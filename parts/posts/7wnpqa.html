		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wind doesn't actually change the temperature.</p>
<p>Wind feels colder to you because your body is 98.6 degrees, so on a cool day with no wind, there is a layer of warm air (warmed by your body) surrounding you... but on a windy day, that warm air gets blown away, so you feel cooler.</p>
<p>A thermometer doesn't have a layer of warm air around it, so it just feels the temperature, regardless of wind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The wind doesn't make a thermometer any cooler.  It makes warm-blooded mammals like us cooler because, unlike a thermometer, we're not at equilibrium with our surrounding environment.  Instead, we heat the air around us, and wind blows that pocket of warmer air away, causing us to lose heat faster.  And since we feel heat loss/gain, and not actual temperature, blowing away that warm air makes us feel cooler.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are 'kinda' isolated from wind and the elements, in fact heat from the road is more likely to affect the gauge then wind ever is, since the only reason wind feels cold is due to losing heat, which the temperature gauge lacks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think they’re usually located in between the grill/lower air opening and the condenser/radiator. Thus, it’s more accurate when your driving around and it will probably show a higher temperature if your parked with the engine idling for a while. Since its measuring air just off the asphalt, it will probably show a higher reading if it’s a bright sunny day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
