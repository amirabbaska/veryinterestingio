		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few (interesting) reasons why a lot of people criticize SETI's approach. They mostly all have to do with the range of radio signals.</p>
<p>We don't necessarily expect to find radio emissions within a few light years. As you start looking further and further away, the civilization which created the radio signal would have had to dump more and more energy into it in order for us to be able to &quot;read&quot; it accurately.  Many people expect that a civilization will actually get less noisy as it evolves, because it discovers ways to send signals more efficiently.  After all, those signals sent into space are wasted energy. The radio signals from earth become indistinguishable from background after a few light years. A lot of people think it is unlikely other civilizations would be sending out much more powerful incidental radio waves.</p>
<p>So, if detecting this incidental radiation is unlikely, then there is always the argument for finding radio signals intentionally directed into space for the purpose of communication. In order to do this, an alien civilization would have to dump a lot of energy into the signal. If you are talking about aliens in other galaxies, it would be a stupendous amount of energy. If you are talking about aliens in our galaxy, but just a few thousand light years away, it is still quite a bit of energy. The arguments against this include that interstellar radio communication is very slow and fairly expensive energy wise, that there are probably better ways of manipulating the universe to communicate over such a distance, and that communication over this distance would probably be <em>directional</em> rather than omnidirectional. If communication is directional, you need to be in its path to detect it, which probably means that it is actually intended for you specifically (given the size of Space). </p>
<p>SETI's best hope is to detect a directional radio signal intentionally sent to communicate with humanity. It is also possible that it could detect a signal intended for someone else that we intercepted, and it is possible that it could detect an omnidirectional signal which has had a disturbing amount of energy poured into it in order to be detectable. My post might sound very negative, but I actually support SETI's efforts. As a civilization it isn't very expensive for us to run SETI and the potential gain is very high.  </p>

Signal</a>, and in my opinion thats pretty fuckin cool. The restrictions of the scientific method's necessity for the reproduction of one's results are quite an obstacle for SETI in general. It's not like the scientists at SETI could go &quot;hey aliens! Can you send that message one more time we have to show our friends?&quot; The whole way we evaluate &quot;scientific evidence&quot; of ET needs to be reconstructed when searching with radio telescopes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi,
From what I've researched on:
<a href="http://ipnpr.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report2/42-45/45R.PDF" target="_blank">http://ipnpr.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report2/42-45/45R.PDF</a> (Pg. 4)</p>
<p>They detail how different signals travel.  This includes an elaboration on interstellar radio, and how the signal transmits.  There is always a &quot;maximum&quot; extent to how far a signal can reach outside of the sender.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, my knowledge is limited outside of astronomy/radio information.  Another article of interest I'd recommend:
<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/squeezed-light-mutes-quantum-noise-1.13510" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/news/squeezed-light-mutes-quantum-noise-1.13510</a></p>
<p>Both contain unique perspectives and tested information.  Sorry I couldn't provide more insight.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
