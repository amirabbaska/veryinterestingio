		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So.. its winter time and there has been a lot of salt applied to my driveway.. and I got to thinking. If you are dissolving a salt into water is the resulting solution still water? Or is it a new compound. H2O + NaCl = ? I'm mainly asking because we all know that adding salt changes some of waters properties such as the point at which is freezes.. so is it different?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you dissolve salt into water the NaCl will disassociate into Na+ and Cl- ions, which will each be surrounded by several water molecules. Here's <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9wKq_3Z2Ci0/UjKOjjzQwJI/AAAAAAAAADk/SMrdlSdetjA/s1600/Salt+solution+diagram.png" target="_blank">an image</a> depicting that. All of the water molecules will remain water molecules, but the solution will have different properties than pure water or salt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a solution of water and salt.  I don't think it would be fair to say that the solvent is not water any longer just because it's mixed with something else.  The properties of water do change when something is dissolved in it, but those changes are generally independent of what was dissolved in the water.  That implies that in an aqueous solution, you're still looking at water whose properties have changed in a manner that is specific to water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As stated by others, it is still just a solution with water being the solvent. There is a great deal of physical change but there is no chemical change, so no new molecules or bonds are formed. In regards to properties of the water, they can change a lot even though it's only a physical change. Think in terms of the density increasing if there is dissolved iron in the water because iron is really dense (and surprisingly able to be dissolved pretty easily). Any dissolved solids will increase the electrical conductivity in comparison to pure water too. Electricity travels super poorly through pure water but super well in salt water because electricity travels via ions and the salt provides those ions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the NaCl is still salt, it is just mixed in with the water molecules, they have not chemically combined, the salt is just dissolved INTO the water.  You could easily reverse the process mechanically, by boiling the water and recouping the salt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>if you mix a bag of m&amp;ms with a bag of skittles. are they still m&amp;ms?  same thing. its still salt. and it is still water.   the difference is the water is attracted to the salt more than to itself so it breaks away and groups around the salt. vice versa with the salt. thus the salts dissolves and the ice melts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
