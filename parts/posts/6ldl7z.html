		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems very difficult that the brain would be able to individually control each wing beat. Their wings can move thousands of revolution per minute and that seems like their brain would need an &quot;ON&quot; switch. Very different from how anything the human brain has to control which is why I am curious. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many insects, and I believe flies and bees are in this group, use &quot;indirect&quot; flight muscles. Basically, the muscles that control the wings connect to the exoskeleton of the upper thorax, rather than the wings directly. When they contract, they cause the thorax to vibrate back and forth like a guitar string. Each vibration is beats the wings, but only the initial contraction requires an action potential. So the nervous system is operating many many times more slowly than the wings are beating. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: Entomology was a long time ago, so that may be a bit off on on the specifics. I invite any entomologists around to correct me. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a neuroscience perspective, most animals have Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) in the brain that allow for coordinated movement with minimal 'thinking' required. Think of riding a bicycle: you are not consciously moving every single muscle in your legs/feet/arms/balancing muscles, it just happens when you think - bike! Brains are so efficient! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two types of insect flight mechanism. Synchronous and asynchronous. Sync style fliers are flappers like butterflies and moths. Each wingbeat is triggered by APs to muscle cells. In async flight muscle that buzz such as flies and bugs, the motor axons depolarize the muscle cells which triggers a stretch-activated mechanism intrinsic to that class of fiber, where elastic resonant interaction between cuticle and muscle sets up a steady cycle of rapid contraction and relaxation.</p>
<p>I have personally make extensive structural and mechanical studies of insect flight muscle from Lethocerus sp (tropical water bugs) and dipterans such as housefly and blowfly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually they have a mechanism called a &quot;central pattern generator&quot; which is an automatic neural mechanism that generates the signal that regulates the speed of wing beat (as others mentioned is indirectly controlled) but also the timing /  phase-relation between wings. This is important because wings can either flap in-phase (up and down together) or anti-phase (one goes up, another goes down), and I'm not sure if there's any other weird phase mappings other than 0 and 180 deg relative phase.<br />
edit: here is an accessible academic work that explains central pattern generators and their role in motor control:<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, even in humans, the act of walking triggers a reflex arc to continue taking steps. Your brain actually doesn't trigger each step once you get into the zone. You can still override it and focus on controlling your steps, but you can pretty much walk and multitask extremely effectively. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
