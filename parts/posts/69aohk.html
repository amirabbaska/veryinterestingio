		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cells that make up your freckles/birthmarks split into basically identical copies of themselves through a process called Mitosis and since they do not move, the new daughter cells have the same pigment of the parent cell and take their place after the cell dies. Basically, the new cells inherit the parent cell's position.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions on this or clarification I would be happy to help!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I like where this went,interesting and thought provoking kind of things about what makes us us from a nice simple question. I wish more internet interactions were like this. I really like Reddit because I can find things I wouldn't think to learn more about on my own and hear different ideas...after sifting through the crap of course lol but thank you for your time and reading suggestions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
