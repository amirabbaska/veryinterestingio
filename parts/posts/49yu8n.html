		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/42/16432.long" target="_blank">recent paper</a> in the journal PNAS that looked at exactly this question. The researchers took a flexible string, put it in a box and then shook the hell out of it for fixed period of time. They then counted the number of knots and classified their geometry, which they then matched with the mathematical description provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory" target="_blank">knot theory</a>. The simplest picture for the knots formed looks <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Ptfasn5.jpg" target="_blank">something like this</a>. The process goes as:</p>
<p>1) When you put the string in an enclosed space (like a box), you will tend to get many parallel coils. </p>
<p>2) Different segments can become intertwined, effectively braiding the string. </p>
<p>3) When you tug on the string the braids become tight knots. </p>
<p>As you might expect, the researchers found that factors such as <a href="http://i.imgur.com/CXSlaqG.jpg" target="_blank">the length affect the probability of the string knotting up.</a> But the slope of this graph is pretty steep at first, which means that even for a ~1m long headphone cable you get a good chance of spontaneously getting a know just be tumbling the cable around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that has not been addressed in the comments I've read is how much energy is stored in cables when you just do the classic wrap. When you do this, you actually are twisting the cable with every loop, which is both bad for the cable, but also makes it want to untwist, hence knots and wrapping. </p>
<p>The proper way to wrap cables to protect them and prevent knotting  it is like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yPcJD7RVuY" target="_blank">this</a></p>
<p>Edit: Clearly I don't know the proper terminology for any of this, but would be happy to correct it if someone points it out. I don't know what kind of energy it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Headphones come packed in rolled up form and you probably store them in some orderely or undorderly rolled up form. They are like everything elastic not 100% elastic, they keep part of the shape that you give them over time and try to get back to it, somewhat like a straw/paper that you fold and that will never be 100% flat after you folded it and will be weaker at the kinks. When you cram them into your pocket in an unordered way, you are introducing chaos or randomness into the system, because you probably do it in a different way every time. After you stuff it in, it tries to get back to it's old/average shape (with the kinks acting like springs), with very limited space and not enough power to do so, thus it will end up with crossed cables. Additionally there are not many ways to arrange cables in a way that they don't cross, especially in a chaos. </p>
<p>When you take them out you apply an uneven force on the cables, because you pull them at very few points, that will knot them because of the crossing that we're introduced by the cramming chaos and the elastic force of the kinks.</p>
<p>This can be circumvented by rolling up the cable on your hand in a simple circle, before putting it into your pocket. Afterward you can take them out, by putting fingers in the middle of the &quot;roll&quot;. This way you introduce less choas, there are no kinks/very structured kinks and when pulling the cable out the force is distributed in a way that avoids tangling because the force is distributed to multiple places and you don't change the shape in the process of pulling out. If you put in a rolled cable and pull out a rolled cable the shape hasn't changed. If you cram a mess into your pocket and pull out the cable at 2 points, you change the shape several times and the cable could change it's shape in your pocket as well, because of the kinks acting as spring and movement of your legs/pants.</p>
<p>TL;DR: chaotical stuffing, limited space, kinks(even small ones) and pulling out in the wrong way all contributed to crossed and knoted cables. To counteract roll the cable around your hand in a circle, and put the circle into your pocket, pull the circle out again by putting your fingers into the middle of the circle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can define a knot as a tangle that isn't easily changed. So by definition, once a knot forms its unlikely to go away on its own. Regardless of how likely it is for a knot to form (addressed by other commenters, turns out its pretty likely), once one forms it will stick around, and any change which makes it harder to untangle will remain as well. This means that knots naturally become more complicated as they jangle around. </p>
<p>As a tangent, you can use a similar argument about the origin of life. At its most basic, life can be though of as a configuration of matter which preserves and replicates itself. Like a knot, once life forms it's unlikely to completely vanish as it has an advantage over configurations which don't self-preserve and replicate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
