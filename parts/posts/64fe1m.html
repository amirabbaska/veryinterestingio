<p>From what I understand, thyroid cells are the only cells of the body which will readily absorb iodine - thus making this radiation a very safe form as it won't damage other cells.  But as the RAI is taken as a pill, the radiation irritates the stomach lining and salivary glands, causing nausea and vomiting as a side effect.</p>
<p>Wouldn't having an RAI infusion avoid that particular side effect?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The side effects wouldn't be avoided, iodine will naturally go to the salivaries and stomach regardless of administration method. (look up an iodine 123 scan for example, they use iv) </p>
<p>The tablet is safer to handle, there is a low risk of a spill. It is easy and simple to administer, and the dose can be more accurately measured (off site) </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After intake of radioactive iodine, a patient is not supposed to touch, hug, kiss, or share bodily fluids with anyone else for a minimum of one week, as it is possible to pass on the iodine and put someone else's thyroid in jeopardy. They even tell patients to flush the toilet twice after going to the bathroom. Administering through liquid would be harder to control. The iodine pill is transported in special containers to control exposure, and then just tossed back when the patient goes to the nuclear medicine technicians. How could that exposure be controlled in IV bags? It's a headache to even consider. Definitely an issue of safety for all involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Don't have to worry about contamination or soft tissue infiltration from a busted IV. </p>
<p>Dose is more accurate with tablet. </p>
<p>With IV, some radioactivity might remain in the tubing. Waste disposal will also be inconvenient. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
