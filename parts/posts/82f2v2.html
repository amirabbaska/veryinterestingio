Can the jet fly faster or maneuver better without their loaded weaponry? Can a pilot actually &quot;feel&quot; a difference while flying? I guess I'm just interested in payload dynamics as it applies to fighter jets.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a huge difference. The weight changes the stress on the airframe, and if external the ordnance produces lots of extra drag.</p>
<p>For example, a f/a 18 is rated for +7.5g and -3g maneuvers when light, but at full weight only +4.8g and -1.8g.</p>
<p>Here are some study cards for an f/a 18: <a href="https://quizlet.com/13297122/fa-18-limts-and-prohibited-maneuvers-flash-cards/" target="_blank">https://quizlet.com/13297122/fa-18-limts-and-prohibited-maneuvers-flash-cards/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  It’s a bit of a combination of all the above answers.  You have a limited amount of thrust available to overcome your weight and drag. So it’s different for every flight. We have performance calculation charts that we have to run prior to every flight to figure out what our limits are for that particular day.  It goes much more in depth than simply the weight of stores carried.  You have to take environmental factors, strength of the individual engines in that specific plane you are flying, weight and balance calculations for that buno.... etc.  All of these variables are considered and then your limits for that flight are calculated, bearing in mind that typically your performance numbers will improve throughout the flight as you burn off fuel.</p>
<p>Jettisoning all stores will lighten the jet up a ton.  It’s like getting chased by a bully as a kid, if you are both running with your back pack on and you ditch yours and he keeps his you will be able to run less encumbered, thus faster, than him.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not fighters, but super insightful.  <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/406789/a-failure-of-intelligence/" target="_blank">On the issue of machine gunners in WW2 bombers, Freeman Dyson has to say:</a></p>
<p>&quot;... Bomber Command could substantially reduce losses by ripping out two gun turrets, with all their associated hardware, from each bomber and reducing each crew from seven to five. The gun turrets were costly in aerodynamic drag as well as in weight. The turretless bombers would have flown 50 miles an hour faster and would have spent much less time over Germany. The evidence that experience did not reduce losses confirmed our opinion that the turrets were useless. The turrets did not save bombers, because the gunners rarely saw the fighters that killed them. But our proposal to rip out the turrets went against the official mythology of the gallant gunners defending their crewmates. Dickins never had the courage to push the issue seriously in his conversations with Harris. If he had, Harris might even have listened, and thousands of crewmen might have been saved.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former F-14 Plane Captain here - F-14 Tomcats have External Fuel Tanks called Drop-Tanks that get 'ditched' in the event of a combat action, aka a Dog Fight. The early F-18 hornets as I understood it had to refuel almost immediately after takeoff from an Aircraft Carrier if they were fully loaded with Ordinance. If you watch the movie Top Gun, it's annoying in the dog fights. One scene they have the Drop Tanks and the next, they don't... then when they're coming in for a landing, boom, they have them again!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other comment is correct. The effect is smaller on some jets like the F-22 which almost always use internal weapon mounts. </p>
<p>Note that dogfighting is unheard of nowadays and pilots would never have to drop weapons for maneuverability. Almost all air combat is done outside visual range. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
