<p>There are 2 primary ways we generate heat:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Increased metabolism and heat generation via burning of brown fat (heat generating fat)</p>
</li>
<li>The changing of how your fatty acids in your skin are structured. This change is brought on by cold weather and enables better heat retention.  The fatty acids get more kinks in them (they look like accordions instead of straight lines where they have no kinks.)</li>
</ol>
<p>This process takes 10 days to occur and is called acclimatization.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical student here, in a city where the low for today is -29C/-20F. There's a lot of science behind cold (and heat) adaptation. I'll try to ELI5 this as much as possible. No guarantees - it's been maybe 3 years since we covered this stuff.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, humans are adapted to moving from moderate climates to hot-as-balls climates. That's what the majority of our evolutionary history is. The response to cold is fairly new, and operates in some similar ways, since certain mechanisms for heat tolerance can be reversed a bit too far to grant effective cold tolerance, but for haplotype groups (&quot;race&quot;, except not the bullshit social construct part, but looking at genetics) that are native to Siberia and NWT/Nunavut, they have some structural adaptations that you can't suddenly &quot;pick up&quot; if it gets cold outside.</p>
<p>Here's how most people adapt.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Thyroid - your thyroid is a small gland that sits right at the bottom of your neck, around your windpipe, and helps you regulate your temperature. The more T4 you have, the faster your metabolism is, and the hotter you are. When it's really hot, your thyroid produces less T4, and it takes about 7-10 days to adapt. When it's really cold, your thyroid cranks out the T4, and it takes 3-5 days to adapt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fat redistribution - fat is a really good insulator. In very cold climates, your body redirects where it stores fat, so that it wraps around your internal organs. This helps insulate them from the cold. This is why patients complain that they &quot;feel&quot; fatter in the winter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blood redirection - your body also redirects your blood flow by tightening blood vessels in your hands and feet, moving the blood away from there. This prevents a ton of cold blood from rushing back to your heart and killing you. It's also responsible for why your fingers and toes feel so damn cold and tight all the time in the winter. (FYI, the idea that your blood becomes thinner or thicker is total bullshit. If your blood becomes literally thicker, it will &quot;crash out&quot; and all of it will clot and you'll die. No biggie if it becomes thinner.)</p>
</li>
<li>Brown fat - there are two types of fat. White fat (or yellow) is for storing energy, and forms if you eat too much. Brown fat is a special type of highly metabolically active fat that raises your body temperature. In extremely cold climates, your body will build up more brown fat, so you burn more energy and your basal metabolism will be higher (hotter).</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few others but there's less solid science behind them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even our military has rules about acclimatizing when you are sent to a new post in a different latitude you are used to.   When I went overseas I had a prescribed number of maximum hours per  day allowed to exercise in the cold in my fatigues without field jacket .  If our commander kept us out longer and anyone got sick, there would be hell to pay.  Our medical team enforced this with new troops.  The process of becoming climate tolerant takes days and we benefit by continued multiple exposures  and is an actual physically observable event for the human body.  I know that if I go outside every day my body will develop a tolerance for sunlight if I do it slowly and develop a tan, same is true with exposure to cold... our body metabolism notches it up a bit and the fatty acids change. But our body has more success adapting to heat!  Our bodies are actually better heat acclimated than cold or altitude. After enough time in the cold, for example, resting metabolism ramps up to a higher level so that the body produces more heat and every normal human body can do this with multiple exposures... one has to daily undergo climate exposure as the body refines its ability to insulate or redistribute heat in changing  weather.  Our bodies have done this for millions of years, especially well -  since we started out as a non-furbearing species, we had no choice and evolved to being able to adapt to climate changes which preserved us from extinction.<br />
When I got assigned  to Anchorage in October(their summer)  I initially was freezing and constantly shivering while wearing a parka....  but after the first snows in November I was outside in short sleeve weather and it felt OK to me for brief periods.  By December, I was sleeping with windows open and when spring returned I'd added on 15 pounds and was very used to being in the snow.  When I finally discharged from the service  and returned home to my normal SoCal High Desert (Victorville) in the summer  three years later,   I couldn't get cooled off at all in the first week home in part due to the extra weight; I fasted to get the weight off, stayed dressed in a bikini or just a Tshirt around the house, and spent nearly every day in either the pool or sweating it out under the AC unit with a cold beer.   At the end of one month I was comfortable in clothing again.    Physiologists can explain it better.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
