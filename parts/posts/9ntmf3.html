		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, so I'm a machinist by trade. I'll try to explain this for you.</p>
<p>Metals are processed in different ways, different methods.</p>
<p>Ductility is the ability to stretch a metal and the metal doesn't break, but instead bends. If I take copper and process it into long strands, it just bends afterwards.</p>
<p>But I don't make electrical wires out of steel, because when you stretch steel out like that, it breaks when you bend it. So copper is ductile, steel is not.</p>
<p>Malleable metals like aluminum can be pressed. You can not stretch aluminum as well as copper, but you can press it between rollers and make sheets of it so fine that it makes aluminum foil. You can compress/ squeeze copper that way also (not quite as thin-as it will tear far more easily when that thin)... But again, steel doesn't do well if you compress it too small, it has some malleability, but not nearly as much as aluminum. </p>
<p>These are processing methods. Ways of working with the metal and how well that metal handles specific processing methods.</p>
<p>Toughness is about how strong the processed metal is after processing. When I am given a bar of round, pressed steel, I need to know its toughness. How much cutting pressure can I apply to this type of steel?</p>
<p>Toughness is not only how much force can you apply before it snaps, it's also a question of whether the metal has some &quot;bend&quot; before it breaks. This is called &quot;deflection&quot;. I need to know how much force I can apply before the metal bends and vibrates (deflects). This vibration causes problems in getting uniformity of the final product I'm creating.</p>
<p>Steel is best processed for the final stage before hardening, by using cutting. Steel is not brittle, so it withstands cutting very well. It is also tough so you don't want to pound it into shape, because it just dents and malforms.</p>
<p>Now, hardness is about withstanding impacts and pressure. Steel, as opposed to quartz, is not hard; and it's not brittle. Steel cannot take as much pressure pushing against it as quartz or diamonds; it will bend or malform and will also break sooner.</p>
<p>The end result of that pressure is brittleness, the ability to stand the pressure is hardness. Under pressure, steel malforms, or if you prefer, bends. Eventually, it will break, but the less hardened it is, the more it malforms before finally breaking. Some materials with low hardness (like glass) still are very brittle--they shatter instead of bending.</p>
<p>So steel has good hardness and low brittleness.</p>
<p>Quartz has high hardness, high brittleness, low toughness. What this means is that it takes a lot of pressure OR a very sharp, fast strike to break it... And when it breaks, it does not bend or malform first. It snaps or shatters. Quarts can be formed through a hammering method called 'tapping' where an awl is used to focus and magnify the pressure into a tiny point and thus direct how the quartz breaks or shatters.</p>
<p>Quartz has no malleability and no ductility. Under heat and/or pressure, it finally just breaks. It's hard (high hardness), but has no &quot;give&quot; (low toughness). It cannot be stretched out (no ductility) and cannot be rolled or compressed (no malleability). The quality of shattering instead of breaking cleanly is brittleness, and is related to hardness and toughness.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ductility is the ability of a material to deform with out fracturing. Brittleness is the opposite of ductility as brittle materials will deform very little before breaking. Materials like glass are considered brittle and most types of steel are considered ductile. Maluability is a very similar concept as it refers to a materials ability to be formed into new shapes, most materials that are ductile will also be malleable because if a material breaks when it isn't deformed very far it would be difficult to bend it into a shape. Toughness is probably the hardest the wrap your brain around as it is energy a material can absorb before fracture. Typically brittle materials will have lower toughness values than ductile ones because by deforming further they can store more energy however some materials can store more energy per unit of deformation than other. Cast iron is tougher than rubber because it stores more energy per unit of deformation than the rubber even though rubber is more ductile than iron. Another thing to point out is that material strength is seperate to brittleness and ductility as a material may be able to deform a long distance before fracture but will break under a low load</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey! I’m a civil engineering student and those characteristics are used a lot to describe different building materials. </p>
<p>Ductility refers to stretchiness and deformation. Think about a plastic grocery bag that you can stretch and deform before it finally breaks. </p>
<p>Brittleness is the opposite. If you try to stretch it, it fails and breaks right away. For example, if you break a pretzel in half it doesn’t stretch it just cracks. So it is brittle rather than. </p>
<p>Toughness is the amount of energy required to fracture a material. A highly ductile material fractures after being deformed while a very brittle material fractures without stretching or major deformation. </p>
<p>Malleability is sort of like ductility but for metals. It refers to the quality of some metals to be hammered into thin sheets or specific shapes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a former purchasing, technical sales and service agent for for a warehouse selling among other industrial metals, steel sheet, plate, bars, structural shapes, tubes, and anchor chain as well as general purpose hoisting chain.</p>
<p>Depending on the application for example - steel plate, the end use of the plate has differing requirements according to usage.</p>
<p>most of a ship's hull would use LLoyd's Grade A which translates roughly to &quot;stops light, sinks in water&quot; in effect meaning its steel with no special other requirements other than certain minimum chemical analysis.</p>
<p>However the entire hull would never be made with that steel because if a plate fractures the crack incorporates at some fantastic speed like 500 feet per second from plate to plate, so there has to be tougher plates inserted in the design to stop crack propagation causing the ship to fall apart. The inserted plates are more malleable, more able to stretch and bend under stress before cracking. Many of the malleable alloy plates can be folded flat on themselves while cold up to about half inch thick. If you stop to think about what that means, the steel on the outside of the bend has to stretch a tremendous percentage without tearing apart,   </p>
<p>When it comes to making the steel harder, differing alloys are used as well as heat treatments in manufacture to give hardness, but usually at the cost of increasing brittleness so the folding or bending while cold trick usually does not work out.</p>
<p>The harder you make it usually the more brittle it gets, unless there are special alloying metals included in the heat. (a heat is the original billet of steel rolled out to make the required shapes.)</p>
<p>So partial amounts of copper, chrome, nickel, columbium, vanadium, lead, tin and carbon all make up the chemical analysis and affect hardness, toughness and ductility.</p>
<p>Some grades are good for making hoisting  hooks because they are quite ductile and will deform a lot before reaching ultimate tensile strength and breaking. A good visual warning of approaching failure/. ASTM A 283 grade C is an example.</p>
<p>Or if you want to make a pressure vessel like a steam boiler you would want something tougher and rupture resistant at the same time  so an A 515 grade 70 would be chosen which is ductile and tough like 283 grade C but twice the strength approximately and more expensive with less visible creep before failure.</p>
<p>So if you want to make a plow blade you have to form it cold, and the edge has to be tough and wear resistant. So you weld on a piece of heat treated steel that is very hard, but brittle and expensive because more than just adding carbon to get hardness is done.</p>
<p>This could go on for a very long time but, the properties of toughness, malleability, hardness, and ductility are different properties and sort of semi mutually exclusive depending on alloys, temperature of use, and so forth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Malleability and ductility are both manifestations of a metal’s or alloy’s ability to be plastically deformed without breaking.  Malleability is the ability to be flattened with a hammer or roller.  Ductility is the ability to be made longer and thinner by pulling.
Toughness is the ability for the process of fracture to absorb energy.  Brittle materials do not absorb much energy from propagating cracks.  Tough materials can absorb a great deal of energy from propagating cracks.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
