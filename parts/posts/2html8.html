		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can do this with simple things... if you take two photos from about 4 inches apart, put the two images side by side, and look at it while coaxing each eye to look at the other image... you can get the stereoscopic effect. But the things in these pictures have to be relatively close to the camera.</p>
<p>In essence, you have to have the cameras placed such that the two images are sufficiently different for your brain to perceive the parallax.</p>
<p>For clouds it would probably work with a football field. Doing video instead of still images is a really neat idea.</p>
<p>For stars - unlikely. Stars are far too far away for the distance of a football field to matter to human perception. However, we've used things like taking the images 6 months apart (effectively using the diameter of the orbit of Earth) to perceive parallax in the stars.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's probably a relatively simple formula for figuring out roughly what kind of space you need between the cameras, based on distance-to-target and general feature size of the target. But I'm at work, and don't have time to try to figure it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Years ago, I was an IMAX projectionist (film, not digital) and got to see some test footage where the cameras for each eye were set more than the traditional 2.5 inches apart.</p>
<p>I think they used 3 feet and 10 feet., </p>
<p>The greater the distance between the two “eyes” the more dramatic the result.<br />
Those results being; everything looked smaller and toy like.</p>
<p>Years later I thought Tilt-shift photography was capturing a very similar effect.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory, yes. The space between our eyes is what gives us 3D depth perception, so spreading your eyes further apart would give you more depth. The setup in the comic would definitely make clouds a lot more fun to look at and probably make them look closer and smaller. However, if you wanted to really get any difference in the appearance of the stars you would have to move the cameras much much further apart. Even using cameras mounted to satellites on opposite sides of the earth might not be enough to create any noticeable 3D effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best rendition I have seen regarding this concept is the gifs wher they rendered different stars at different depths into layers and then slid them back and forth to create a 3d effect.  It works quite well.</p>

<p>This is another example of how we can see things in space moving over time, basically as things in the galaxy move and expand we can get a multi month or muti year time lapse of these objects from the hubble</p>
