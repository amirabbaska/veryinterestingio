		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real reason:</p>
<p>You are adapted to not find the smell of your own shit repellent, because you must be motivated to do it and find it relieving to do so. That means your own shit smell is fine to you as you are doing it. If you shit, leave it alone, and come back to it a few minutes later, all those associations are gone and you'll treat it like anyone elses shit.</p>
<p>Gross, but that's really how it works.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason is because your brain knows what is in your shit. It shit it out. If someone else shit something out the brain doesn’t know what kind of bacteria is in that and tells you to leave it the fuck alone. Thats why your farts don’t smell had to you. Sure, they don’t smell like flowers, but you never feel the urge to gag or throw up from them. If someone else let out a nasty fart, you brain wants you to get away from that bad odor. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because when you're in there, your brain gradually adjusts your senses to the smell, so when the air slowly gets stinkier, you can't smell it as much as the next person to walk into the bathroom and smell it immediately at full intensity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our brains are adapted to be alert for meaningful things in the environment -- danger, food, etc.  Part of this adaptation is suppressing awareness of our own bodies.  Hearing our blood flow and muscles move would interfere with hearing other things.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
