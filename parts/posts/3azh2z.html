		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there is a good answer. With mass density approaching infinity we are getting stronger gravity, but we are also getting into a situation where both quantum effects and gravity are important. And we don't have unified theory for those two (so we don't know). Place like this is for example inside of black holes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gravity of an object is proportional to its mass, so maximum gravity would be proportional to maximum mass. I don't think there is such thing as maximum mass, except maybe that the mass of an object in the universe could not exceed the total mass of the universe. I doubt that's a known number but Googling produces some estimates between 10^50 kg and 10^60 kg.</p>
<p>Edit: from a practical perspective, all the mass in the universe is unlikely to fall together because at great distances, the expansion of the universe (&quot;dark energy&quot;) is stronger than gravity. It is probably possible to put together an estimate of how much mass could accumulate despite the overall expansion, but I am not the person to do it.</p>
<p>But, maybe you're talking about the gravitational force you would experience on the surface of an object. In that case, the answer is not really known but is assumed to be infinity, on the &quot;surface&quot; of a black hole. But since that is inside the event horizon, we actually don't really know what goes on in there. The math says that the surface is infinitely small, so surface gravity would be infinitely high.</p>
<p>Edit: This is because the attractive force you experience due to gravity increases as you get closer to the center of the mass. A black hole is extremely dense--it is extremely small, even though it is very heavy. So, you can get very close to the center of mass, which means that the gravitational force can get very high.</p>
<p>In contrast, think of something like the Earth. We can't get any close to the center, because there's a lot of mass (dirt and rock) between us and the center. If the Earth was denser, it would be smaller, and surface gravity would be higher. But since the total mass would be the same, all the satellite orbits would be the same as they are now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't the &quot;maximum&quot; gravity in the observable universe be just outside of the schwartzchild radius of a really small singularity? The reason I'm saying small is that the schwartzchild radius is growing linear with the mass of the singularity while the force of gravity gets weaker at the schwartzchild radius by the square of the mass(radius).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you are talking about.  If you are talking about the force due to gravity then there is no maximum.<br />
F= G<em>m</em>M/d^2
G is a gravitational constant
m is mass of object
M is mass of planet
d is the distance between the two center of masses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Related questions:  What happens when an object's velocity is already extremely close to the speed of light and is traveling towards a massive object that is acting on the fast object to increase it's velocity?  Does the velocity continue to approach the speed of light?  I assume it does not every accelerate to faster than the speed of light, but why is that?  Can someone provide examples  to illustrate what happens, I am extremely curious.  Thank You!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
