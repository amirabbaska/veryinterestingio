		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of reactions at play here. Noble gases do not react <em>chemically</em>, that is to say that they don't easily form molecules with other atoms. On the other hand, radioactivity has to do with the stability of the atomic nucleus. The two don't have much to do with each other.</p>
<p>The radon atom has an unstable nucleus (so it's radioactive) but it's still &quot;full up&quot; on electrons (so it's a noble gas).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As it is itself still radioactive, it continues <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon#Daughters" target="_blank">breaking down into other elements</a> until it reaches something stable. In this case, it generally ends with isotopes of lead. Basically, consider radon to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning" target="_blank">breathable lead</a> with bonus particles (that themselves can also cause mutagenic damage).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radioactivity is completely different from chemical reactivity. Chemical reactions deal with interactions between the electrons of different elements. You will rarely see any noble gas do this because its orbitals are all full up, (although the heavier ones start to get slightly more reactive than the lighter ones).</p>
<p>Radioactivity has nothing to do with this and is all about the stability of the atomâ€™s nucleus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While not related to radioactivity, it should be noted that to say noble gases are nonreactive is not true. Xenon, krypton, and argon can react with other elements such as florine under extreme conditions. I believe there is some evidence that radon can as well. For most purposes though the noble gases are considered inert. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
