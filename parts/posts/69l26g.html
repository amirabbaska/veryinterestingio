<p>Here's a press release from one of the manufacturers:</p>

<p>Companies in the UK are currently doing this for the new 12-sided pound coin that has just been introduced and will replace the old round one completely by October.  The cost is considerable, one estimate I've seen is £50 million just for converting car park ticket machines and some £100s of millions across the board.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For coins, vending machines don't care what's stamped on the front and back, they measure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Size</li>
<li>Weight</li>
<li>Material (magnetic or not)</li>
<li>Edge serrations</li>
</ul>
<p>And none of those things change when they decide to put a different face on a nickel or a different back on the Quarter.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, for notes usually a software upgrade will suffice. For coins, it's a little more complicated.</p>
<p>In both cases, vending machine manufacturers will be able to get the new cash much earlier, even as much as a year, along with guidelines on what security features are available to them. In the case of coins, this may be detecting the physical size, or it's magnetic properties, in the case of banknotes a special scanner is usually used.</p>
<p>When actually getting the changes out there, the manufacturers might do it as part of some kind of servicing agreement, or as a software update, but often whoever bought the machine will have to pay for the upgrade.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
