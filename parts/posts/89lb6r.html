		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Say I receive the yellow fever vaccine and have enough time to develop antibodies (Ab) to the antigens there-within. Then later, my friend, who happens to be the exact same blood type, is in a car accident and receives 2 units of my donated blood. </p>
<p>Would they then inherit my Ab to defend themselves against yellow fever? Or does their immune system immediately kill off my antibodies?
(Or does donated blood have Ab filtered out somehow and I am ignorant of the process?)</p>
<p>If they do inherit my antibodies, is this just a temporary effect as they don't have the memory B cells to continue producing the antibodies for themselves? Or do the B cells learn and my friend is super cool and avoided the yellow fever vaccine shortage?</p>
<p>EDIT: Holy shnikies! Thanks for all your responses and the time you put in! I enjoyed reading all the reasoning. </p>
<p>Also, thanks for the gold, friend. Next time I donate temporary passive immunity from standard diseases in a blood donation, it'll be in your name of &quot;kind stranger&quot;.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So for blood transfusions used in trauma, <del>the patient will receive what's called &quot;Washed&quot; blood, which is donated blood which has had its plasma components removed. This includes antibodies and another set of immunological proteins called complement proteins. So no, he wouldn't receive any antibodies in a normal situation.</del>my apologies, I just glanced over some lecture materials and misinterpreted a slide, my mistake.</p>
<p>However, I'm sure you're still interested in knowing what would happen and I'm happy to answer this. Transfusion of antibodies is already a medical technique called Intravenous Immunoglobulin transfusion. These are used for patients that unfortunately suffer from immune system disorders so they have diminished or absent immune response. These donated antibodies from vaccinated patients have the ability to bind to pathogens through their F-ab component while still being able to bind to F-c Receptors of immune cells by the F-c components. However, to answer your question, this would only be a transient protection and patients that need this procedure need them consistently.</p>
<p>The reasoning for this is because B cells, the immune cells that produce the antibodies, have no process by which they could receive immunity from someone else's antibodies. Your B cells have to undergo a selection process in your bone marrow, like your T cells in your thymus. As a small background, your B cells provide practically all encompassing antigen binding because they undergo a controlled, mutagenic arms race in their selection process in order to be let out of the bone marrow. Once they're out of the bone marrow after successful selection, they have their own unique antigen binding trait and this would not be changed by the introduction of someone else's antibodies. The binding affinity of the antibody a B cell does change over time, however, once it encounters its match made in heaven antigen, it'll reignite its microbiological Cold War Era arms race in a process called somatic hypermutation to produce an improved antibody.</p>
<p>tl;dr Your antibodies would only give a temporary immunity because there's no process that they could influence their own synthesis in your friend</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In this situation no... When blood is donated its separated into it's components: red cell, plasma, and platlets. All your antibodies are in your plasma. And 2 units is not nearly enough. But what you are asking about is called a therapeutic plasma exchange. A machine pumps ur blood out goes through machine spins it down takes only the plasma out and then the donor plasma is then put back in your system( 2000-3000mls) for an adult. This process is used to treat the flu along with a host of other things. Doesn't last long few months or so it's called passive immunization.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If someone is producing antibodies for a specific receptor, those antibodies will bind its respective receptor. This is actually used to treat some diseases. Most notably, it is the only way (correct me if I am wrong) we have to treat people who were bit by a venomous animal. For example, non-lethal amounts of said venom are administered to animals (ex. a horse). The horse will then produce antibodies for the venom which are harvested and used to treat patients who were bit by venomous animals and the antibodies will neutralize the venom. </p>
<p>However - it is important to note that simply transferring antibodies to a patient does not immunize them against a pathogen or foreign antigen per se. In order for that to occur, you need to present the antigen you want to protect against to the immune system (i.e. that's why vaccines use actual virus particles), which will then go through the process of T cell/B cell activation and possibly result in memory cells which are capable of producing antibodies against the foreign particle for a relatively long time. Repeated exposure to the antigen is needed in order to maintain antibody production in some cases, but now we're getting a bit too complicated for the purpose of the question. </p>
<p>Circulating antibodies can remain in your system for many years, but will likely disappear after x amount of time if the antigen isn't present.</p>
<p>To answer your question directly: if the yellow fever Abs were in your blood, they would neutralize yellow fever virus particles in another person, but the other person would not actively produce yellow fever Abs (we need antigen recognition/processing for this to occur). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have only read about this particular situation in terms of embryology. In Langman's Medical Embryology, it states that a mother is able to pass through fluids, antibodies to the product whether by virtue of colostrum during infancy or even direct blood transfusion down the line. This is a practical example of what you are asking about where it would function exactly as you say.</p>
<p>Antibodies specifically, are very small markers which serve the function of being an encumbrance (Immediate identification of colonization threat to general macrophages, metabolic interference of the colonizing agent, obstruction of their receptors, etc.)  to specific antigen through a process of adsorption, the following statement makes me wonder if you were told antibodies directly &quot;fought&quot; infections :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would they then inherit my Ab to defend themselves against yellow fever?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there's that consideration, but anyway, I hope I was able to help in some way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A single patient, known as the Berlin Patient, was cured of HIV with a bone marrow transplant. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2009/090211/full/news.2009.93.html" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/news/2009/090211/full/news.2009.93.html</a></p>
<p>However, two subsequent HIV positive  patients, called the Boston patients, who were believed to have been cured with bone marrow transplants have since relapsed.
I understand that the Berlin patient received a bone marrow donation that was naturally resistant to HIV (a very small segment of the population is) while the Boston patients could not find a matching bone marrow donor who was also HIV resistant.
Viruses are full of tricks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
