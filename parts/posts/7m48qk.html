<p>A gamma ray burst within about 10,000 light years directly hitting the earth could trigger a mast extinction event.  It's not that life gets irradiated by the gamma burst that's the issue. It's the atmospheric changes these burst set into motion that will be the issue.  </p>
<p>The gamma burst breaks O2 and N2 bonds that can recombine into NO and NO2.  NO breaks down ozone allowing more of our sun's UV to reach the ground.  NO2 absorbs sunlight likely triggering a global cooling event.  Not to mention the acid rain it would also create.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The distance would mostly affect the intensity which you can think of as photons/cm^(2)*s. The gamma ray burst releases a specific number of gammas which would be spread out over more area the further you get from the source. Think of the surface area of a sphere as it expands so with double the distance you would receive a quarter of the total photons. The burst would likely only affect half of the earth because the gammas travel so fast that any movement of the earth doesnâ€™t really matter </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>well,  that was a terrifying read. </p>
<p>Have any observatories ever seen the effects of a gamma ray burst on some other unsuspecting solar system? </p>
<p>Also,  do they move at the speed of light?</p>
<p>Also II (son of Also), does the burst get affected by gravity wells? That is, do solar systems suck passing bursts in?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energy released in a GRB obeys the same &quot;inverse-square law&quot; that all radiation does, so distance certainly matters.  In fact, Earth is struck by one or more GRBs every day, but these are all so far away as to be basically harmless.</p>
<p>The prompt effects of a (nearby) GRB would initially affect only the facing hemisphere, but the natural flow of the atmosphere would distribute the problem (mostly in the form of nitrogen oxides) globally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, yes. </p>
<p>The earth is actually &quot;hit&quot; by something like 3 GRB's every night. They are just so distant that the light has dispersed and is harmless. </p>
<p>Move one a little closer and it goes from harmless to dangerous, and closer still and it becomes a mass extinction event. </p>
<p>It's worth mentioning and realizing that the bursts come out in a sort of super focused cone shape. So a glancing shot to one half of the earth or one hemisphere could prove disasterous bit not apocalyptically so outside the struck area. </p>
<p>it depends on the distance. But  IIRC anywhere inside the milkyway galaxy is close enough to be extinction level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
