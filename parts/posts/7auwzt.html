<p>What we do when we eventually leave earth orbit is yet to be determined, and will likely change many times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of relevant. I lived at the South Pole where all time zones converge and there is one day and one night each year. Time in the clock and calendar sense has no meaning there. We chose to use New Zealand time just because that's what McMurdo uses to coordinate flights to Pole in the summer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They use UTC, because orbital data uses that reference.</p>
<p>Most calculations do not use years, months, hours or minutes, only seconds and days. The reference for days is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day" target="_blank">Julian Day</a>, or one of its variants. </p>
<p>The second is the international standard for time measurement, but it's a relatively small interval when considering very long time periods, so the numbers in computers could overflow, and that's why we also use days. The number of days could also overflow over thousands of years, that's why they use modified variants of the Julian Day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aerospace engineering here:</p>
<p>Generally speaking, each mission picks an &quot;epoch,&quot; or a moment in time. Time is measured as seconds from that epoch.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, we do <strong>NOT</strong> use UTC, atomic time, or any other standard because they include leap seconds or are distorted by relativity which can screw up calculations for everything.</p>
<p>Physically, a memory module will be attached to variable voltage oscillator, and the memory module counts the pulses. If you have a 20 millisecond period on the oscillator, you'll gain one &quot;frame&quot; every 20 milliseconds. The clock ticks one second every 50 frames.</p>
<p>Timing is extremely important, because it feeds into everything from attitude control to communications.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a concern for certain astronauts on the ISS who have religious obligations based on the day or time (think Muslim daily prayers or the Jewish sabbath). The basic solution is to select a time zone and stick with it. A Jewish astronaut, for example, <a href="http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/632169/jewish/Shabbat-in-Space.htm" target="_blank">went with the Cape Canaveral time zone</a>.</p>
<p>That being said, a global time for long-distance space travel, such as Star Trek's &quot;stardate 12345.6...&quot;, wouldn't work because of the time dilation associated with relativity. Heck there are even (very, very small) timeflow differences between atomic clocks placed at different altitudes, so trying to keep it straight when spaceships are traveling at significant fractions of the speed of light (or, we can hope, faster than light) is pretty much impossible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
