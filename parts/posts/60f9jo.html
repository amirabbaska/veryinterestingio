		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would be hard to quantify the (possibly perceived) affective (read emotional) aspects to peoples eyes. We can measure pupal dilation, saccadic rhythms and movement. These have some emotional correlation, but nothing dramatic for softer &quot;mood&quot; style emotions.</p>
<p>That said people automatically &quot;hide&quot; their true intention/feelings by posing their face. Many facial/body posture muscles differ in neurological connection to autonomous and conscious parts of the brain. In fact the eyes are a good &quot;tell&quot; because they are more strongly wired to autonomous systems.</p>
<p>A lot of the processing we do of the emotions displayed by others does happen subconsciously in parts of the brain separate from regular sight. So the possibility of miss-attribution is there.</p>
<p>Its one of those questions we should gain insight into as fMRI studies of emotion and cognition advance.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can -- but it's not the eyes themselves, it's the tiny muscles surrounding the eye. Humans instinctively make facial expressions that use these muscles to convey emotions. Look very closely at the centimeter or two around the eyes, and you can see different muscles at work showing different emotions.</p>

<p>There is something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile#Duchenne_smile" target="_blank">Duchenne Smile</a>, which is a smile that involves not only muscles around the mouth but also around the eyes. There is solid evidence that this kind of smile signifies that the person is genuinely happy, is hard to fake, and is something that people pick up unconsciously.</p>
<p>But of course it is not the actual eyeballs that conves this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of muscle activity around the eyes, direction of gaze, how far the eyes are opened, pupil size compared to lighting conditions, etc. &quot;Reading&quot; expressions from just the eyes and the small area around them is something most people are quite good at, even without any further information.</p>
