		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At a super high level, there is a process that a foreign government has to go through if they want to request data that resides on servers that are in the US.  It involves the DOJ and various court approvals, the purpose of which is to protect the privacy of US citizens.</p>
<p>The Cloud Act eliminates that process in favor of bilateral agreements between the US and foreign nations, as developed by the Executive branch (The President).  Advocates say that this will allow for better agreements with foreign nations regarding the exchange of data, while detractors say that it circumvents the 4th Amendments by removing due process for search and seizure.</p>
<p>As to how it will affect <em>you</em>, it probably won't, similar to how if we got rid of the warrant requirement for searches it probably wouldn't affect you much either.  The issue comes when you have something of interest to a foreign government.  If China wants to look at your emails today, they have to have that request approved by the courts; in a Cloud Act world, they can just ask and we can just give them the data without any judicial review.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The unaltered and now official CLOUD Act effectively gets rid of the need for search warrants and probable cause for grabbing a US citizen's data stored online.</p>
<p>US police only need to point the finger at some account, and tech companies must abide and provide all the needed details, regardless if the data is stored in the US or overseas.</p>
<p>Further, the bill recognizes foreign law enforcement and allows the US President to sign data-sharing agreements with other countries without congressional oversight. The CLOUD Act will then allow foreign law enforcement to require data on their own citizens stored in the US, also without obtaining a warrant or proving probable cause.&quot;</p>
