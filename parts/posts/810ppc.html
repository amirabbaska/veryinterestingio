<p><strong>Edit:</strong> So far in this thread, we have two points being made on the usefullness of the masks: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They prevent hand to mouth/nose touching. </p>
</li>
<li>They prevent saliva, mucus/phlegm projection into someone's face, as well as receiving some from the projection of others in close quarters.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds good to me. </p>
<p>So yes, they are useful, but not as a definitive deterent for airborn disease.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Other types of masks and filters may be used for air transmitted bacteria and viruses.</p>
</li>
<li>No one that I could notice here has put forward any data on international reported flu/cold rates to draw a rough comparrison between Japan and the world.</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Japanese physician, my time to shine!  while it is part of many guidelines (including in america, CDC - <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/infectioncontrol/maskguidance.htm" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/infectioncontrol/maskguidance.htm</a> ) that perhaps there may be some benefit, there are some considerations:</p>
<p>a) a mask is basically permeable within 15 minutes of wearing it.  Multiple studies have shown that viruses and bacteria in the moisture of our breath will penetrate a mask once it becomes damp.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fresh face mask almost completely prevented bacterial contamination of an agar plate 30 cms from the mouth, but after 15 minutes there was a measurable increase in the level of contamination </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4920922/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4920922/</a> -  ((note: this is bacterial!  viruses are 100X smaller!!))</p>
<p>b) barrier protection like a mask will reduce droplets so if you are actively coughing, you are preventing the creation of large fomite (areas that are contaminated),  but not preventing it altogether</p>
<p>c) viruses and other airborne particles are much smaller than a surgical mask, and the moisture of the air we breathe can easily get around a mask.  Because masks aren't air-tight, honestly, the scientific plausibility that masks will significantly reduce inhaled viral particles is quite low.</p>
<p>d) most of the studies about masks and <em>preventing infection</em> are pretty evenly split positive/negative</p>
<p><strong>So taking this all in conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>1) <strong>wash your hands frequently.</strong>  this remains the best way to prevent the spread of infection.  if you need to cough, cover your mouth with your elbow (best).  DO NOT RELY ON A MASK to block a cough (I am looking at you, japan).  </p>
<p>2) <strong>If you are sick, stay at home.</strong> (I'm looking at you, modern world)</p>
<p>3) if you change your mask frequently, you are likely having a minor protective effect for yourself and others from the spread of some germs, in the first 15 minutes of wearing a mask.  But honestly, compared to #1 and #2, this is pretty minor.  Some studies show a benefit and others show no benefit, and the plausibility that significant reduction is possible is low based upon the physical properties of a surgical mask and the pathogens.  To no surprise, the &quot;reduction of flu spread&quot; by good practice (mask and hand hygeine) is likely largely attributed to the hand hygeine portion, not the mask portion.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> wow I got flooded with responses!  I tried to reply to representative responses and I'm sorry I can't answer them all.  </p>
<p><strong>For all of the questions about surgeons and surgical masks, please see this review:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16295987" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16295987</a></p>
<p>In conclusion, when studies have tried to randomized using masks by the surgical team vs. not, there is no detectable difference for infection rates.  Again, the plausibility of a disposable non-respirator mask stopping virus and bacteria in a room is very low.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I remember one of my professors once mentioning that the masks themselves don't actually do much to prevent against respiratory disease directly. It will probably help reduce the amount of aerosols in the air, but I'd be willing to bet the most useful function of it is it'll prevent you from actually touching your mouth or other membranes with unwashed hands. I'm sure this also highly depends on the mask and doesn't apply to proper, individually fitted masks with respirators like you need for high danger pathogen work. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are actual studies on the effectiveness of the masks, which show that microbes generally permeate them within a few minutes.</p>
<p>There are advantages, though. You are preventing moisture projectiles that spread germs very effectively (coughing, wheezing, breathing while sick in general). Instead, they just hit the mask and then slowly spread the germs into the air in a much less concentrated form. You are also signaling to others that you are sick, which can be a very effective form of contagion prevention.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually quite effective as long as you really do it. Many studies have found equivocal results that are later attributed to very low compliance rates.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/mask" target="_blank">https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/mask</a></p>
<p>Many of the medical offices I've been in recently have posted policies requesting that patients wear a mask if they're coughing or sneezing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Related question, All that I have seen about &quot;proper hand washing&quot; requires 30 seconds or more. Are the changes in public sink taps increasing disease spread?</p>
<p>In the last decade or so, almost all public lavatories (water saving) have a slow trickle of water and in smaller restaurants have just cold (since it would take several minutes to get the hot to reach the tap). The worst are the spring activated taps that mean you must hold with one hand and wash with the other.</p>
<p>These pretty much prevent &quot;proper&quot; hand washing</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
