		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea that we've 'only explored 5% of the ocean floor' is not really true (unless we have a VERY narrow definition of 'explored'). The first thing to realize is that we have data on the bathymetry (i.e. the underwater equivalent of topography) of the ocean from two primary sources, gravity data (from satellites) and sonar soundings (from ships). These data have very different resolutions and coverage, with gravity data being much more coarse (i.e. larger distances between data points) than sonar, but we have 100% coverage with gravity data. You can see a pretty good visual representation of the difference between these two almost anywhere in google earth/maps, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@29.430164,-127.8279503,126465m/data=!3m1!1e3" target="_blank">e.g. this random spot in the ocean off the west coast of the US</a>. The linear track of clearly visible bathymetry is a strip of data from sonar dragged behind a ship, the rest of the very fuzzy bathymetry is that derived from gravity data. For the sonar data, the distance between your sonar source and the bottom of the ocean (along with the exact type of equipment, etc) will control the resolution of the data. So expanding the '5% of the ocean is explored' thing, we can put some more precise numbers on that and think about resolutions of bathymetry data, courtesy of <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/just-how-little-do-we-know-about-the-ocean-floor/" target="_blank">this nice discussion in Scientific American</a>.  In short, we have meter scale bathymetry (i.e. spacing between data points is on the order of several meters) for 5% of the ocean floor from sonar closer to the ocean floor (there's the origin of our '5% of the ocean is explored' simplification!), ~100 meter scale bathymetry for 10-15% of the ocean (from sonar at the surface of the ocean), and ~5 km scale bathmetry for the entire ocean (from satellite gravity data). The satellite gravity measurements are pretty cool, worth checking out a <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/gravity-map-uncovers-sea-floor-surprises-1.16048" target="_blank">write up of the study</a> or the <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6205/65.full" target="_blank">actual paper</a>.</p>
<p>With the above discussion in mind, this means that if we've explored 100% of the oceans at a resolution of 5 km, if there was an area deeper than the Marianas Trench, it would need to be less than ~5 km across. The other important consideration is that the fact that the Marianas Trench is very deep is not a surprise or happenstance, there is a very clear geologic reason, specifically because it is a trench associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction" target="_blank">a subduction zone</a>, i.e. a place where an oceanic plate is sinking into the mantle. This means that we immediately have a good idea of where very deep areas will be, and in fact virtually all of the deepest areas of the ocean are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_submarine_topographical_features#Oceanic_trenches" target="_blank">trenches</a>, i.e. subduction zones. If we look at most trenches, they are large features (100+ km across, 1000s of km long), so even with data of 5 km resolution, we have a good number of data points defining the bathymetry of a trench.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
