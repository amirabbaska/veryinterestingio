		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perissodactyls, or odd-toed ungulates (horses, tapirs), developed during a time--about 55mya (million years ago)--when broad leafed trees, herbs and some grasses had supplanted the conifers and ferns from an earlier era. They were very successful animals and enjoyed about 25 million years as dominant land herbivores. </p>
<p>Later (~46mya), the artiodactyls or even-toed ungulates (sheep, goats and cattle, among others) were emerging. They lived in the fringes of the environment, in marginal habitats that the odd-toed ungulates didn't favor. They developed a complex digestive system with a multi-chambered stomach to help them subsist on the low grade foods they were forced to eat. </p>
<p>Due to changing climatic conditions about 20-25mya, grasslands expanded, and the even-toed ungulates with their fancy digestive systems were poised to take advantage. They thrived and superseded the odd-toes as dominant land based herbivore. </p>
<p>So, I think the answer to your question is: cows have &quot;multiple stomachs&quot; because they developed to eat the &quot;scraps&quot; found in the marginal environment that their (then) more successful rival the horse forced them into. The horse didn't need a highly complex digestive system to eat the foods it was accustomed to during its development.  </p>
<p>Edit: clarification (hopefully) and explanation of abbreviation (mya=million years ago)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary digestive difference comes from what are called foregut fermentation (cows) and hindgut fermentation (horses).</p>
<p>Horses have a cecum developed with bacteria that break down cellulose. Other similar animals that eat plants but have only one stomach have varying adaptations including longer GI tracts, but for horses, the cecum is the main event. </p>
<p>Cows have multiple stomachs and chew cud (ruminate) to facilitate the bacterial breakdown, but the rechewing adds a mechanical benefit, since the hindgut is not developed in the same way as cows.</p>
<p>Tl;dr horses have a cecum, cows chew lots. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Horses are monigastric, hind gut fermenters. Their digestive process is fairly similar to a rabbit. The main  process of cellulose breakdown occurs in the caecum, an enlarged appendix like extension between the large and small intestine. In the caecum, bacteria break down the cellulose into a few different components. That are then absorbed in the large intestine. </p>
<p>Cows, on the other hand, are called ruminants. They don't actually have more than one stomach,  they have 1 multi chambered digestive organ. The chambers are called the reticulum, omason, abomason, and rumen. There is a much higher degree of bacterial fermentation that occurs in the rumen compared to a hind gut fermenter like a cow. Another important difference is that the volitle fatty acids and other fermentation byproducts are then absorbed in the small intestine.</p>
<p>As to why these differences occur? There is more than one way to skin a cat I guess? This question is similar to why are gorillas and orangutan different sizes? Because that is the best way for them to fill their niche. </p>
<p>edit: from a comparative biology stand point, the difference in location that bacterial fermentation occurs means that cattle and and other ruminants are able to survive on a diet that is around 90% leafy plant matter. The various by-product of fermentation and the bacteria themselves provide the ruminant animal with all the necessary essential amino acids as well as VFA are utilized as an energy source. Horses, on the other hand, do need a certain amount of grains, or other fruiting bodies to supply vitamins and other micro nutrients. Interestingly enough, on the cellular level, there are actually many similarities between ruminants and obligate carnivores (like cats). Because of the single source of energy in their diets (evolutionary, not in modern practice) the endocrine system is undergoing a constant cascade of gluconeogenesis. There is no off button in ruminants or obligate carnivores. Because one of the by products of bacterial fermentation is vitamin b families (6,12,niacin, I think), ruminants have no issues with this. Cats, on the other hand, must find an external source of niacin and therefor must eat every 3-5 days or they will die. Wow, that got off topic quick...</p>
<p>Tl;dr: cows don't have multiple stomachs, they have a single, multi chambered digestive organ. However, both horses and cows utilize bacterial fermentation to utilize cellulose as an energy source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of people here are missing the point. The question wasn't how it works, but why? The answer is actually pretty simple:</p>
<p>Horses thrive on moving around to where the greenest and most nutrious grass is. They're animals that specialize in movement, hence a normal functional gut with low processing time and normal efficiency. They don't want the extra weight and space a more thorough gut would entail.</p>
<p>Cows on the other hand specialize in living of grass with little nutrional value, standing around doing nothing until their stomachs utilize every single bit of energy available. This enables them to live where other species (including most predators) simply won't find enough food. High in the Himalayas are for example one of the few places where you will find wild cows in today's world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
