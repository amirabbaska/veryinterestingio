<p>My Question is simply:
How many possible games of chess are there?
And, what does that number mean? (i.e. grains of sand on the beach, or stars in our galaxy)</p>
<p>Bonus question:
As there are many legal moves in a game of chess but often only a small set that are logical, is there a way to determine how many of these games are probable?</p></div></div>
