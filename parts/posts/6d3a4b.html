		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Colin, I really like that figure a minute into the video showing all the dependencies between different regions. </p>
<p>Are there any pairs of regions that you found that were super dependent on each other, or really surprising dependencies? (perhaps aside from the obvious tomatoes from North America to Italy?)</p>
<p>And with all these international dependence, are there still traditional dishes in regions that remain mostly unchanged using traditional methods and local ingredients? Are there any 'living fossils' in the culinary world?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
