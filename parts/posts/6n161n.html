Are these two situations connected at all? By what mechanism do they happen?</p></div></div>

<p>Gases only separate themselves under certain conditions. Like at sea level nitrogen and oxygen stay quite well mixed. There's a lot of intermolecular mixing even if the bulk of the gas is stagnant. Entropy prefers the mixing. </p>
<p>At higher altitudes you do get stratification because there's less intermolecular interactions, and things are more like discrete particles than a continuum. I don't know enough about rarefied gasses to say if that's a reasonable analogy to granular flows though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

It’s an emergent result of simple statistical physics. If you have a jar of various sized objects and shake it about, the objects will indeed organize themselves with the smallest on the bottom and the largest on top (mass variation will simply slow the sort). But why? Because all objects want to get to the bottom, and because it’s easier (more likely) for a smaller thing to move under a larger thing (because it’s more likely to fit without resistance), as compared to a larger thing moving under a smaller thing. Without the downward pull of gravity though, the same organizing phenomena can occur. </p>
<p>Imagine the same situation with the jar full of various objects, but this time in zero G. After sufficient shaking, the objects will again organize themselves based on size, but this time radially, with the smallest on the outside and the largest on the inside. In this case, the shaking induces a net proclivity for things to move outwardly (because there are more directions leading away from the center than towards it), and again the smaller things have an easier time fitting between larger things than the other way around.</p>
<p>This is indeed the same mechanic at work organizing gases (and liquids for that matter) – except in those cases, the inter molecular forces play a much bigger role.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
