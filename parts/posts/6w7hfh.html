		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During the 18th century there was a bit of a fight over which decimal separator that should be used, some arguing for the decimal point and others for the decimal comma. During this time period English mathematicians used the symbol &quot;X&quot; for multiplication, but in other European countries it was more popular to use a dot &quot;·&quot; as a symbol for multiplication. Since the multiplication symbol &quot;·&quot; could easily be confused with the decimal point &quot;.&quot; most European countries adopted the decimal comma &quot;,&quot;, simply to avoid confusion between the decimal point and multiplication symbol. England kept using the decimal point however. Most English speaking countries today use the decimal point, while most European countries use the decimal comma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So looks like the short answer is: 18th Century, English used x for multiplication, kept the decimal point. Europe used a dot for multiplication, adjusted and created the decimal comma.</p>
<p>That was ages ago now. In today's tolerant era, we can use the multiplication dot and the decimal point with zero confusion.</p>
<p>Europe, I understand the reason for your transgression, but we have moved on beyond the initial problem. It is solved. I forgive you, and will welcome you back to the world of the decimal point.</p>
<p>You can say 9,000 ⋅ 1.5 without fear, or even 9,000*1.5 if you'd rather. It's safe now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So from what I understand from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> it's all to do with the invention of the printing press.</p>
<p>Some countries like like France already used a full stop to make reading Roman numerals easier to read, so they went with a comma for the decimal mark, some other countries went with this too.</p>
<p>English speaking countries liked the comma for separating the numbers into groups of three, so they chose the dot for the decimal point. </p>
<p>So basically printing was invented and people had to pick a side, some chose commas, chose dots. <em>(Others chose other symbols, but that's too confusing)</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You mean 'why does <em>English</em> use a decimal point, and pretty much everywhere else use a decimal comma?'</p>
<p>It isn't an 'American thing'; it came with the language, and existed before the creation of the US.</p>
<p>I think the basic answer is that other European languages used the point to mean a multiplication, and a comma for a decimal separator. </p>
<p>Now everyone uses 'x' for 'times by', but the decimal separators have stuck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
