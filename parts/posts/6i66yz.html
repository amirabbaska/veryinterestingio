		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea that the two sides of the brain handled specific functions was put forth during the time when lobotomies were regularly performed, which wasn't all that long ago. During a lobotomy, a portion of the brain is removed, and the psychologist who performed the surgery would then test his patient with various tasks to see what the effect was. This way, they could see which parts of the brain controlled which functions... sort of.</p>
<p>Later, the corpus callosotomy was figured out, which takes away the corpus callosum, which is the bridge between the two hemispheres of the brain that allows the two sides to communicate. While a very effective treatment for seizures, psychologists also observed some very interesting effects on a person's ability to recognize words and images. One such famous test is here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMLzP1VCANo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMLzP1VCANo</a> , in which a computer monitor is set up and a word or image flashes on one side of the screen or the other. If it flashes on the right, Joe can understand what is being shown. If it flashes on the left, he can't read the text or understand the image, but he is able to draw it. This furthered the idea that each side of the brain functioned in specific ways.</p>
<p>With more advanced imaging and testing equipment, we now know that the entire brain is brought to bear on every task that it handles. A person without a left or right hemisphere can do all of the things a person with a full, healthy brain can do (although much slower and with less acumen). The corpus callosum was discovered to just allow for information to be shared between sides of the brain.</p>
<p>We do know that there are certain areas of the brain that are more active during certain activities, but the entire brain is still active at all times. It functions as a whole, and any damage to any part of the brain can impair all brain function. </p>
<p>We've also discovered no significant physical difference between the brains of top performers. A very talented pianist, for example, does not have more growth or development on one side of the brain, nor is his brain significantly different to a very talented physicist. These tests put to rest the idea that one side of the brain controlled any one given task.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't really know too much about the brain, tbh. I had a brain injury in August,2000,&amp; have every test &amp; procedure done at least twice, as due to the head &amp; neck trauma I received I have extreme migraines all the time- no obvious cause(s) found. I get all of the side effects that come with migraines as well- sensitivity to light, smells &amp; noise. I actually had to move from a city with a population of approx.500,000 to a city with less than 300 so I don't have to hear &quot;normal&quot; sounds like traffic, sirens, trains, etc. And forget ever going to a movie or concert. I also have basically no appetite at all because i have a nauseous feeling a lot. I get hungry but then when I look at food I'm just like,&quot;ugh.&quot;
I keep up on any &amp; all research in hopes that there will be some kind of breakthrough that I'll be able to participate in before I die at least to help others that come after me with this type of injury. The only thing the doctors can do is control the pain with medication, which sucks for the rest of my body. Before this injury I hardly ever took an aspirin -&amp; now I have to take medication just to function like a human being.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I have got older I have come to the sad conviction that almost everything you hear is garbage - one way or another.  &quot;Debunking&quot; the left brain right brain MAY be technically true - I don't know. Nor do I care. But I'll tell you something interesting.</p>
<p>It is a model of how the mind works.  Now I am &quot;right brain dominant&quot; as per the model and I used to work tutoring &quot;right brain dominant&quot; kids.  Whatever, that might mean in reality, the model is powerful.How powerful? I was able to develop a 4 hour intervention that would take any motivated kid who was right brain dominant and get him to go from the bottom of his class (where they usually were because school is &quot;left brain dominant&quot; and get them to the top.</p>
<p>Some of you may believe me, some of you may not. I really don't care. But if you understood the subject well enough you could do the same thing too.  So was it their right brain, their left brain, the upper brain their inside brain? Who knows and who cares. The model works. Perhaps we could call it &quot;A dominant&quot; and &quot;B dominant&quot;.</p>
<p>So they may have &quot;debunked&quot; the model technically but did they remember to say &quot;but it's a really, really useful concept because applied it can transform people's lives for the better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, here's a bit. We know that for about 90% of right handed individuals, the more active language centers rest in the left side of the brain. Psycholinguistics spends a lot of time studying the data to support such a claim. With left handed individuals, the percentage drops a bit, with more individuals showing more activity on the right side.</p>
<p>(These are the main language centers, brocas, wernickes, and a few other areas of interest)</p>
<p>We tend to make &quot;claims&quot; about right/left brained individuals, specifically regarding creativity, language, math, music, kinesthetics and balance, spatial reasoning, etc... but the reality is that these things really seem to match up more with fields of sensual focus (sight, sound, touch), which in general are kitty corner (left field, right side of brain).</p>
<p>There's some great neuroscience labs studying unique stuff regarding these questions that you could check out if you're interesting in learning more. Lmk if you are and I can link a few for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
