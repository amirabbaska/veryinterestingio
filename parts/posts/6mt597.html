		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because your brain needs something relative to base the wave speed on. A car will look like it is moving relative to a road/landscape. Waves in an ocean have nothing for the brain to base the motion from, unlike waves on the shore. So unless there is a rock or something to break up the area and show motion, waves will appear stationary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is due to 2 reasons
a) If you move past objects of different distance to you, the near objects appear to move past you rather fast, while the further an object is away, the slower it seems to move. Commercial airplanes fly at an altitude of ~ 10-11 km, so the ground seems to move past very slowly. But this slow movement is not really observable, because:
b) the texture of the ocean is very simple and redundant (= it repeats itself) and also so far away that no remarkable spots or patterns are able to be seen from a plane, which means unless there is an island or a large boat you have no point of reference, meaning you cannot measure your change of position relative to it. (=movement)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your background is non-moving on the land.  So the movement of the car is more obvious.   The ocean itself is in motion, so wave movement is not as apparent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're usually at a much lower altitude when you can see individual cars compared to when you're flying over the ocean. The closer you are the more readily apparent any relative motion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the above are good points but also, waves don't really move that much, especially in deep water. Have you ever seen a bird floating in the waves and wondered why it doesn't move? It's because the wave doesn't move water in deep water, only when it's shallow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
