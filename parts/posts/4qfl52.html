Additionally there will be more and more mass above you which is going to be pulling you towards it as well.</p>
<p>So if the center of the earth were hollow wouldn't you be weightless if you were there?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, these answers are great for a theoretical sphere made out of material of the same mass.</p>
<p>But to answer the question &quot;do you get lighter the further underground that you go?&quot;, the answer is both no and yes.</p>
<p>In that particular order.  </p>
<p>Aside the shape of Earth, as you get closer to the core, you become heavier, because Earth's core is much more dense than its crust, and the closer you get to it, the stronger it will pull you.</p>
<p>IIRC it peaks at the outside of the lower mantle of earth<br />
(~650 km [~400 miles] deep, with over <del>10.5g</del> ~1.05g force, [as opposed to ~1g at the surface],<br />
after which, further descent would result in less gravitational pull, until reaching the very middle, where you'd experience weightlessness.</p>
<p>E.:If a physicist could translate my vague knowledge into an actual and accurate scientific answer, I'd be grateful.<br />
E2.: Corrected a horrible, horrible mistake. No excuse.
The difference is only about 0.07g.<br />
For reference, at 8848 meters (top of Mount Everest) gravity would be around ~9.76m/s^2, which is a ~0.04g difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>You can pretty much ignore the mass above you. Assume you went a mile down.  Yes, the mass above you pulls you up. But you also moved closer to the 1 mile layer on the other side of the earth which pulls you down. These two effects cancel each other out, so it makes no difference if you burrow down a mile or if you remove the outermost 1 mile layer from the earth (wouldn't recommend that either).</p>
<p>The inside of a hollow sphere does not have a gravitational field (from the sphere itself).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
