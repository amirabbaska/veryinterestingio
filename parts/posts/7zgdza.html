<p>Edit: Lots of answers are quite US specific (too much religion &amp; money in politics, FDA loopholes, etc.) but I'm more curious how/why homeopathy has remained legal everywhere.</p>
<p>Some countries are even phasing out internal combustion engines: is &quot;Big Placebo&quot; (thanks /u/DarkAlman) more powerful than big oil?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former state food and drug auditor. In the US there are almost no regulations against dietary supplements. As long as they don't make any direct claims to treat or prevent disease they're ok to sell. Normally there's a disclaimer that the item is not meant to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. Homeopathic remedies are sold in this way.</p>

<p>Governments have regulated what claims can be made but homeopathic producers carefully avoid making legally identifiable claims. It is left up to the vocal community of private citizens to peddle the bull shit, and the actual producers just say stuff like &quot;Take this if you have a headache&quot; and not &quot;Cures headaches&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
