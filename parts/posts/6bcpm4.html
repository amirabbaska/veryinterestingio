		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body and brain and part of the same system. Your emotions impact your body, just like your body impact your emotions. </p>
<p>A section of your nervous system lines your digestive tract: the enteric nervous system. It is full of motor neurons that contract and relax muscles all the way from the esophagus to the anus to get your food into your stomach, digested, and eliminated (among other functions). Normally you wouldn't notice it working away, but if things go into overdrive, your stomach can feel weird.</p>
<p>[There is quite a bit of overlap between nervous system and the gastrointestinal system. Neurogastroenterology is the focus of a lot of research right now because there is a lot we simply don't know.]</p>
<p>Anxiety or stress causes muscle tightness all over the body--it readies the body for fight, flight, or freezing. There are muscles all over your chest, so you feel it as tension or tightness. This response also increases blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and other functions. The result is that you can feel like your chest is heavy, feel your heart racing, feel your heart pounding, feel shortness of breath, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The stomach and colon would be white when the man was depressed, and turn red when angry. There are a lot of things going on down there, butterflies, stomach churning. In cases of extreme stress, the body needs to be ready to lighten the load (poop your pants with fear) and divert blood from the tummy to the limbs for running away. the study <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=JaQauznPoiEC&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=stomach+changes+color+with+emotions&source=bl&ots=EDEe9z3lEj&sig=_toKsMeFvBf_WvbR4y1daEGdeFg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5k4OFtPPTAhXFy1QKHbkGARgQ6AEIUDAH#v=onepage&q=stomach%20changes%20color%20with%20emotions&f=false" target="_blank">https://books.google.com/books?id=JaQauznPoiEC&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=stomach+changes+color+with+emotions&source=bl&ots=EDEe9z3lEj&sig=_toKsMeFvBf_WvbR4y1daEGdeFg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5k4OFtPPTAhXFy1QKHbkGARgQ6AEIUDAH#v=onepage&q=stomach%20changes%20color%20with%20emotions&f=false</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neurotransmitters in the Brain, like Serotonin (think the chemical that medications like Prozac or Zoloft affect) have receptors all throughout out gut.  </p>
<p>There is a small medical saying, &quot;Half your brain is in your gut&quot;.  So, when you're excited when that first special someone touches your hand.. you feel you could almost throw-up.  And then later that year (or night) when that person dumps you.. you feel like you could throw-up, it's all &quot;spiked&quot; and &quot;depleted&quot; neurotransmitters affecting not just your brain/emotions, but how your gut physically feels.  </p>
<p>This is also where tropes like &quot;nervous people get ulcers&quot; or &quot;stressed people poop a lot&quot; are <em>sort of</em> accurate.  But not really.  Also.. it's why some many people &quot;eat their emotions&quot;.  Eating relieves stress (through a complex mechanism mind-you).. but it's in the same world, stimulation or depletion of these neurotransmitters.   </p>
<p>P.S.- also, it ties into a lot of what some of the other responses are saying. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a follow-up question, I've always wondered if a person who's had a vagotomy no longer gets that &quot;pit in the stomach&quot; feeling. Anyone know? </p>
<p>(A vagotomy is a procedure to sever the vagus nerve and the parasympathetic fibers it contains to a specific organ or portion of the GI tract. It used to be done as a treatment for intractable stomach ulcers before meds like Zantac and Prilosec came out.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This system has over 100 million nerves connecting them, so, when you feel emotional distress it sends signals to your stomach and vice versa.</p>
