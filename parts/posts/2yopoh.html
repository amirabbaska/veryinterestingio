<p>EDIT 2: A lot of people are pointing out that I must not be from California or else I would know about The California Aqueduct. You are correct, I'm from the east coast. It is very cool that they already have a system like this implemented.</p>
<p>Edit 3: Wow! I never expected this question to get so much attention! I'm trying to read through all the comments but I'm going to be busy all day so it'll be tough. Thanks for all the info!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The average American uses <a href="http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/freshwater/change-the-course/water-footprint-calculator/" target="_blank">2000 gallons of water a day</a>. Most of this is hidden from you - used in farming the food you eat, or in manufacturing the products you use, or just in cleaning the tableware you eat with.</p>
<p>The Keystone pipeline will transport 155,000,000 gallons of Oil per day. Logistically, a project of that price could therefore provide water for 75 million people - sounds good so far, right?</p>
<p>The pipeline would cost 5.2 billion dollars. Again, sounds great - $72 per californian would build the whole thing. So, it's actually a feasible project if California could find a reliable source of water to have shipped. You would pay about $80 per person in extra taxes each yeah, then another $5 or so in maintenance per year.</p>
<p><strong>Alternatively</strong>, the San Diego Desalination Plant will cost $1 billion and provide 50,000,000 gallons of water per day. It's a much cheaper and less ambitious project that solves the problem without the need to find an outside buyer or negotiate eminent domain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We already do.  We have canals and pipelines drawing water from the Colorado River, Northern CA, and the Sierra Nevada and bringing it to Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, and other parts of the state that don't get enough rainfall to be hydrologically self-sufficient.</p>
<p>The problem is that the water sources (NorCal, Sierra, CO River) aren't getting as much rain as normal, so to alleviate this problem we'd have to build entirely new pipelines from the Columbia River or something, and that would require new interstate treaties and several years of construction before we see any results.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is already something like this in place, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Aqueduct" target="_blank">The Califonia Aqueduct</a>.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We already have them. They're called rivers. Southern California's problem is that it <em>uses</em> too much water, often in stupid ways. And they're not alone: <a href="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-11-20-CORterminusSIB1072010OHH.JPG" target="_blank">Here</a>'s the modern-day end of the Colorado River. (The bridge in the back ground illustrates how it used to be different.) It's overtapped, and no longer reaches the Gulf of Mexico as it used to. (This bridge is about 80 miles from there.)</p>
<p>Aqueducts can be done, but they rely on gravity. Meaning, your source must be higher than your destination, and your source must also be abundant with supply. Those kinds of sources are not common uphill from places like L.A. in abundance. You could tap Late Tahoe, perhaps, but then you'd give up Lake Tahoe. Humans are remarkably <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/AralSea1989_2014.jpg" target="_blank">good at this</a>, often with <a href="http://www.global-greenhouse-warming.com/images/AralSeaDriedup.jpg?aba085" target="_blank">devastating results</a>.</p>
<p>So it's not as simple as running plumbing all over the landscape. You also need pumping stations, maintenance, security, and more, and how is that going to get paid for? The cost of water would have to go up quite a bit.</p>
<p>By comparison, petroleum, even the crappy sludge from Alberta, is worth many times more than water (for now), so it's much easier to justify the costs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I hate this idea,  I know I'll catch flack for this but,  it's ideas like this that fuck up ecology in other areas.  Fresh water isn't unlimited and using it to water areas that are dry only speeds up the rate of loss.  </p>
<p>Pumping water to places like Vegas,  New Mexico, Arizona,  and southern California which naturally have arid climates goes against the natural order of things and there is always a cost. </p>
<p>Trying to have a lawn and farming in this region is the problem. It isn't meant to support that much vegetation or life and the plants being planted and methods are doing a lot of harm to the water table that does exist. Now you want someone else's lakes and rivers to keep supporting a poor living habitat,  it's irresponsible. </p>
<p>If you want to do something to help lessen water problems in California then don't vote for public servants who let power and drilling companies use and contaminate the water resources. And stop watering grass that shouldn't be there in the first place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
