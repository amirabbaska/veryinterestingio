		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually a reaction between a metal (e.g. Magnesium) and an oxidiser (e.g. ammonium perchlorate) . Basically a small explosion, but with the results focused on light and sound rather than concussive force. If you've ever burned magnesium in school, basically the badass version of that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well the flash powder I make is dark aluminum powder (more on that in a bit) in a 3:7 ratio with potassium perchlorate. When burned the perchlorate oxidizes the aluminum creating a very bright light and depending on how much you have, a loud bang. Both these components produce stronger effects the more finely ground down they are, as that increases the reaction speed because there is more surface area present as there are more particles. Dark aluminum powder is aluminum powder mixed with charcoal so the aluminum is sniffed out from any contact with oxygen, this makes the reaction when it is oxidized even stronger. Stuff that all into a <del>tightly packed</del> but very thin aluminum canister (that is most cases is actually used during the reaction) and put a small cage around it to protect from shrapnel. And you got a flashbang. </p>

<p>^this is 60g of flash powder I made without the aluminum canister.</p>
<p>Edit: I was corrected on packing it tightly</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In case it wasn't clear from the other comments talking about burning metal and explosions: flash bangs are very dangerous and can <a href="https://www.policeone.com/police-training/articles/3440679-Update-on-accidental-flashbang-death-of-Fred-Thornton/" target="_blank">kill you</a>. They spit out a ton of heat, meaning they routinely catch things on fire. Also, the burning metal does shoot away from the explosion, which can bring it into contact with nearby people. Because of the nature of how many types of metal burn (including magnesium), even if the metal were to embed itself entirely within a person it still won't quit burning. Water on a magnesium fire actually <a href="https://youtu.be/KS3A8reNZyw?t=3m40s" target="_blank">just makes things worse</a>.</p>
<p>Always be careful around any kind of weapon, explosive, etc. Just because it isn't specifically supposed to kill you doesn't mean it can't, it just means that isn't what it was optimized for. That'll be little solace while burning magnesium cooks your face.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that it is not so much the flash that is disorienting as the ‘bang’ it can burst eardrums which is really painful and also screws up your ability to tell which direction is down. plus the compressed air also hits the rest of your body with considerable force. If you aren’t expecting it you’re pretty useless, and even if you are you’re still gonna have a hard time doing much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
