		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the main reason it that <strong>we're just used to it</strong>, and it's a vicious circle.</p>
<p>If you want to get a driver's licence, you need to choose whether you learn it for a manual or an automatic car. The latter option doesn't allow you to drive a manual one, so everyone picks the former one and learns to drive a manual car.</p>
<p>Then when it's time to buy a car you can choose between a manual and an automatic one, the latter is typically a bit more expensive and since you've already learned to drive a manual one you might as well buy that one.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that you <strong>feel/are more in control</strong> of the car with a manual transmission, and we don't really want to lose that feeling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As well as the efficiency side of things there's the weight and cost.  European cars are generally quite small and we have a much more compact road network.  American style large cars do not fare well in medieval urban road layouts. Automatic transmissions started of as heavy,  expensive,  and uneconomical. When your car is only a few hundred kilos and has a 1 litre engine they are not an appealing addition for most people.</p>
<p>Most people enjoy the control of manual gears too. </p>
<p>Edit: to clarify,  these (as I see it) are the reasons automatics were not popular for a long time and gave the manual market a lot of momentum.  As car sizes have increased automatics have become more popular. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I prefer manual due to having much more control over the power transmission to the wheels. During winter here in Finland, when the roads can be extremely slippery, having a clutch to control the torque delivered makes it easier to not lose traction in tricky situations.</p>
<p>A second thing I always look for in a car is being able to sense the road surface through the steering wheel. My father-in-law has a Citröen with air suspension that feels like you're driving a hovercraft, without a clue about whether or not the road is dangerously icy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certainly in the UK (or at least, my part of it...), there's a strong association between older drivers and automatics - people get automatic transmission cars when they are either too old to drive a &quot;proper&quot; car, or are simply not interested in driving as an experience any more. I have driven both extensively (live out in the sticks, so fairly high mileage for a small country), and find that the automatic makes me lazy; you have to do so little to actually drive - add in cruise control, and you might as well be asleep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where I come from, in the northern parts of norway it’s just better with manual. An automatic car would suck on our winding mountain roads, and in winter we need the controle, you know, on ice and stuff.
My dad had a automatic once, didn’t last the summer before he got rid of it. Couldn’t make it up the mountain with a hanger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
