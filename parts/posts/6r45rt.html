		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends what you mean by a &quot;hostile&quot; takeover.</p>
<p>In its broadest sense, any takeover bid, i.e., an offer by one company to purchase all of the shares in another company is &quot;hostile&quot; if it was unsolicited and opposed by the target company's current management/board. So-called hostile &quot;tender offers,&quot; in which one company makes a public offer to buy all of another company's shares at a premium above the current market price, are just as popular as they ever were. There are regulations in place for this sort of thing, and it's not at all uncommon to hear about &quot;unsolicited bids&quot; from one company to buy out another. But because they're regulated and public, they're not particular controversial. If company A wants to pay 120% of the market price for company B, B's shareholders may well go for that, and the current management/board of B can just go pound sand. </p>
<p>But there's a specific <em>kind</em> of &quot;hostile takeover,&quot; the so-called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_raid" target="_blank">corporate raid</a>&quot; which has very much fallen out of favor since approximately the 1990s. This involves the buyer acquiring a significant stake in a target company (usually <em>not</em> a majority!) and employing a variety of tactics to temporarily boost the share price at the cost of hollowing out the target company's core assets. </p>
<p><em>This</em> kind of &quot;hostile takeover&quot; has largely disappeared. One reason is that publicly-traded companies have mostly adopted various legal devices that prevent the kind of tactics employed by corporate raiders. There are a variety of moves here, but the specifics aren't important. Suffice it to say that the management and boards of large companies have various ways of making corporate raids <em>very</em> difficult, and that most companies who perceive some risk that they might be the target of a hostile takeover have adopted a number of these tactics, </p>
<p>But a really important reason for the decline in corporate raids may well be that stock market prices have gone up <em>significantly</em>, across the board, since the early 1990s. This one is a little more technical, but I'll try to explain as simply as possible.</p>
<p>If you want to understand how corporate raids <em>work</em>, you need to understand what a company's &quot;price-to-book ratio&quot; (&quot;P/B&quot;) is. P/B is the comparison of the total value of all a company's outstanding shares (&quot;market capitalization&quot;) to the value of its current assets (&quot;book value&quot;). Share prices are thought to be based on the market's expectation as to a particular company's future profitability, over time, so the P/B ratio is usually quite a bit higher than one. Google currently has a price-to-book ratio of about 4.4:1, while Amazon's is in excess of 21:1. After all, if I could make $100 by selling an asset now, but that asset could produce $20/year in profit, indefinitely, it is a better long-term investment to hang on to it, yes? But if that same asset could be sold for $1,000, while still only producing $20/year in profit. . . maybe I should take the $2,000 and find some place else to invest my money. </p>
<p>What corporate raiders do is target companies perceived to have an unusually or unreasonably low P/B ratio. Such a situation suggests that it's possible to make a pretty penny doing either of two things: either making management changes (sometimes <em>highly</em> dodgy ones) to temporarily boost the share price, or simply sell off the company's major assets for their book value, gutting it as a going concern. <em>That</em> is why this particular type of hostile takeover is characterized as a &quot;raid&quot;: the hostile investor is actually <em>hollowing out the business</em> rather than merely taking it away from the existing management/board. </p>
<p>In any case, the fact of the matter is that stock prices have risen, pretty much across the board, since the early 1990s. I don't have the specific figures in front of me, but the aggregate P/B ratio of the market as a whole has gone <em>way</em> up. This means that there are fewer and fewer companies out there that are attractive targets for corporate raids. Acquiring an equity stake large enough to deploy raider tactics is so expensive now that there's no real point. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 80's introduced the novel concept of securitization. Basically throw a bunch of loans into a pool, and repackage them for sale as a unit called 'securities'. This allowed bankers to pool a bunch of lousy loans and claim the pooled securities were safe due to diversification, while offering higher yields than healthier securities (which is not necessarily true, as seen in 2008). This new creation increased investor's acceptance towards riskier loans, which paved the way for the junk bond to come into existence. </p>
<p>Junk bonds opened up a whole new world of financing. Previously non-creditworthy companies could now issue bonds at higher interest rates, and people would buy them where they previously would turn their nose at them. It became a fad and many investment bankers like Michael Milken made their names during this gilded age of investment banking.</p>
<p>Soon, private equity figures like KKR and Icahn realized the junk bond allowed them to do something that was once thought impossible. Buy up 10% of a company's shares to get a board seat, pressure management to issue massive amounts of junk bonds (using the company's own assets as collateral) to buyback the remaining 90% of outstanding shares, rapidly dispose of valuable assets (including employees) to pay back the bonds, and then exit once the share price skyrockets - leaving the company a shell of its former self. Essentially, it increased potential expected gains by 10x. Didn't matter that the interest rate on the junk bonds were in the high teens if the payback was 500%. </p>
<p>As you would expect, corporate management weren't too happy with this new bully tactic and resisted them. With the incentive of a large payout so high, the unwritten gentlemanly contract that characterized prior shareholder-management conduct was discarded in favor of public spats between the incumbent CEOs and the new &quot;raiders&quot;, who would frequently go over managers' heads and tease shareholders with an offer that they couldn't refuse. Thus the hostile takeover entered the mainstream. </p>
<p>As you would also expect, this introduced moral hazard into society, where companies which previously supported plenty of jobs were stripped bare and the proceeds went into wealthy pockets. It became big enough of an issue that structural fraud eventually found its way into the system. This led to laws being passed which severely curtailed incentives for junk bonds - and therefore, hostile takeovers - which fell out of favor for about a decade before being reincarnated as the much more benign 'active management' in the late 90's.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They got a different name, &quot;activist investors&quot; and today because of the successful takeovers in the 80s, are more likely to get management cooperation on their earlier demands (essentially a hostile takeover was some rich guy making a suggestion for how to run a company better, then if it wasn't followed buying the company and firing the guy who didn't listen to his suggestion).  Today managements are much more interested in what large shareholders suggest, so the process results in changing behavior quite early in the process.  </p>
<p>Also large companies have gotten much bigger since the 1980s (both from their own growth and mergers), so their targets tend to be smaller firms that are less likely to generate stories in general press.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In part, it has to do with the use of the &quot;poison pill&quot; or shareholder rights plans which became popular after the wave of hostile takeovers of the early 80s. More or less, it gives the board more leverage in negotiating the sale of the company, because if left in place it dilutes the value of the shares of a potential hostile acquirer to the point where its impossible to to attain a controlling interest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wall St. goes in phases... for a time, giant conglomerate were the rage, and companies started buying up all sorts of businesses/brands even when they had little in common with the other holdings... liquor companies buying movie studios, appliance makers getting into mortgages and TV networks, food companies buying apparel makers. </p>
<p>Of late, the opposite has been the trend. Large companies are being broken up in to multiple smaller companies to &quot;be more nimble&quot; and &quot;unlock shareholder value&quot; and reduce liability that could drag down brands. So Motorola split into two companies. Sara Lee Corp., which in addition to their baked goods once owned Hillshire Farms, Jimmy Dean &amp; Ballpark meats (when then got bought by Tyson), Hanes underwear, Champion athleticwear and Coach leather as well as big European coffee companies, American food service distributors, global personal care brands, etc. spun off a number of brands, sold off some, and then split the company up. Kraft spun of the cookies and sweets into Mondelez, separate from the food and cheese brand (which then merged with Heinz). McDonald's spun off Chipotle a few years back, which is fortunate as Chipotle's problems could have dragged down McDonald's were they still together. Pepsi spun off Yum Brands to make it easier for Pepsi to compete for restaurant chain contracts (why would a Popeye's or Chick-Fil-A go with owner of competitor KFC?)</p>
<p>There are also tax implications, lower interest rates, changes in executive compensation/severance, etc. that have changed over time that all change the equations when it comes to buying businesses or forcing change. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
