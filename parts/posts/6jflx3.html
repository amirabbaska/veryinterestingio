		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="http://www.usflag.org/uscode36.html#175" target="_blank">Flag code</a> dictates that the blue field should be upper left.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>§175. (i) When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost and to the flag's own right, that is, to the observer's left. When displayed in a window, the flag should be displayed in the same way, with the union or blue field to the left of the observer in the street. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.army.mil/e2/rv5_downloads/symbols/r670_1.pdf" target="_blank">Army Regulations</a> say it should be reversed, to &quot;give the effect of the flag flying in the breeze as the
wearer moves  forward.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AR 670–1, 28018 c (2): The full-color U.S. flag cloth replica is worn so that the star field faces forward, or to the flag’s own right. When worn in this manner, the flag is facing to the observer’s right, and gives the effect of the flag flying in the breeze as the wearer  moves  forward.  The  appropriate  replica  for  the  right  shoulder  sleeve  is  identified  as  the  reverse  side  flag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: to look like you're carrying a real flag as you move.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The reason has to do with proper display of the flag.</p>
<p>The blue field of stars should always be in the highest position of honor. When viewing the flag on a wall, the highest position of honor is the upper left when displayed horizontally, and at the top (upper left) when displayed vertically. When displayed on a &quot;moving object&quot; like a person or vehicle, the highest position of honor is the front, and not the rear; so the field of blue should be displayed to the front.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rule is:</p>
<p>If it moves (like a person, vehicle, ship etc.) The blue field should be facing the direction of movement, to simulate what a flag on a pole being carried would look like.</p>
<p>If the flag does not move ( a wall, a poster etc.) The field should be on the upper left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not. US flags don't have a front and back, rather we are accustomed (by heraldry tradition) to viewing them as though the pole is on the left. The flag is always worn so as to be advancing, or carried forward, on modern uniforms. Hence the blue field is toward the wearer's front. On certain uniforms, like USAF flight suits, the flag is worn on the left sleeve and thus is sewn as you're used to seeing. </p>
<p>It was not always this way. On D-Day, the flag on the right shoulder sleeve of US Army uniforms was depicted &quot;normally.&quot; This was reprised in the 2016 Army uniform for the Army-Navy game, which featured such a flag (complete with 48 stars as I recall) on the right shoulder. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you attach the flag to a flag pole, you put the stars nearest the pole.  If you were to then carry this pole forward, you'd observe the stars forward with the stripes trailing behind.  When you make the flag into a patch, you need a left-side and a right-side version in order to give the picture of the stars forward with the stripes behind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
