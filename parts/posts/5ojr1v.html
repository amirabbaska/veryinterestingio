		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glasses are usually made with Polycarbonate lenses while phone screens are made of thin, pre-stressed glass.</p>
<p>Polycarbonate will dent and scratch easier than glass because its softer than glass, but as a result it will not shatter. <del>Usually you dont notice these, and if your glasses get really bad, you can actually get the lenses buffed and polished back to a smooth shine.</del> (you cannot buff scratches in the actual lens, as it will alter the prescription, but on the top layer and antiglare coatings can be reapplied.)</p>
<p>Gorilla glass on iphone screens, for example, is much harder so that it doesnt scratch and can be made thin enough for the sensors to detect your finger on it. The drawback with this hardness is that instead of deforming (denting) when it gets a hard impact, it will shatter much easier than polycarbonate does.</p>
<p>This same phenomenon can actually be seen in diamond &quot;the hardest substance on earth&quot; The only way to cut diamond is to use a diamond coated cutting wheel (EDIT because not everyone's 5: or cleave it along an axis specific to its crystalline structure.) . When I was little, I thought &quot;then how can you cut diamonds to make the wheels to cut the diamonds to make the wheels...&quot; BUT diamond is SO HARD, it can be pulverized with relative ease. And that pulverized diamond dust is then bonded to cutting wheels to cut larger diamonds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other answers like your phone is heavier and your glasses are plastic, a phone has very sensitive technology directly behind the glass.  It needs to be able to detect your finger as well as having a 1080p display that is crisp and clear.  Because of this, the glass has to be thinner.  As with any brittle substance, thin pieces are exponentially easier to break than something slightly thicker.</p>
<p>Your glasses also have more give.  Meaning if they fall on a lens, the body of the glasses can bend slightly to absorb impact.  There is no such give with a phone.  Think of the karate move where you break a cinder block.  If the to holders are spaced out, its much easier to make it crumble than if you balanced it on one stand and hit it dead center.</p>
<p>But seeing how much abuse my glasses take without a scratch, i'm pressed to say that at least mine are plastic lenses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An iPhone 6 weighs about 129 Grams. A Pair of eyeglasses weighs closer to 20 grams. </p>
<p>Drop both items from 1 meter high and they will hit the ground going 4.43 m/s</p>
<p>For the iPhone that represents 1.18 Joules, while the glasses only register .2 Joules. </p>
<p>So, because the phone is heavier, it must absorb about 6x as much energy on impact.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lenses in your glasses are thicker, and they are curved (which adds impact resistance).  They are also probably made of plastic, which is less prone to cracking.  And your glasses don't have the added weight of the phone, which adds kinetic energy to the impact. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the UK, not glasses do not have glass. It's heavy, costs more and is more dangerous. It doesn't scratch as much though. </p>
<p>Most spectacles use:</p>
<p>CR-39, or allyl diglycol carbonate, is a plastic polymer commonly used in the manufacture of eyeglass lenses. </p>
<p>Some people get polycarbonate but it was easier to scratch and with certain solutions, would smeer permanently. </p>
<p>Cr39 lenses are cheaper but probably gets more glare so you can have a coating on top that helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
