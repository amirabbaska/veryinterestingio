<p>How do things catch fire without flame I.e just from heat?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only reason a flame can set other things on fire is because of the heat it generates.  So the reality is that the <strong>only</strong> way to catch things on fire (ignoring unusual chemical reactions) is from heat, and other flames just happen to be one way to provide the necessary heat.</p>
<p>Also, ask your wife how you can light a match by striking it on a matchbook if it takes a flame to set things on fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A fire just needs heat, fuel, and oxidizer. Usually once the fire starts it will generate its own heat, but it needs to be started <em>somehow</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inorder to burn something you need heat, fuel, and oxygen. For example you create a fire from friction. If you can get something above their flash point they will burst into flames. Example is a magnifying glass and paper or leaves or ants...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Here, I'll help you with that.</p>
<p>Tell her she's probably right, and stop worrying about correcting her scientific ignorance.  Boom, marriage saved.</p>
<p>What do you think she's going to do when you come back with proof?  Exalt you as the god you are?  Gimme a break.</p>
<p>Also, get an electric stove red hot, and put a piece of paper really close to it. Instant fire.  You don't need to even touch it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The flash point of a volatile material is the lowest temperature at which vapours of the material will ignite, when given an ignition source.</p>
<p>The flash point may sometimes be confused with the autoignition temperature, which is the temperature at which the vapor ignites spontaneously without an ignition source. The fire point is the lowest temperature at which vapors of the material will keep burning after being ignited and the ignition source removed. The fire point is higher than the flash point, because at the flash point more vapor may not be produced rapidly enough to sustain combustion.[1] Neither flash point nor fire point depends directly on the ignition source temperature, but it may be understood that ignition source temperature will be considerably higher than either the flash or fire point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
