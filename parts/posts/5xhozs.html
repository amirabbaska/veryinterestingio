		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can, indeed, define trig functions using ordinary arithmetic operations. The catch, as you can see, is that we have to use imaginary numbers. In particular, we have to use imaginary <em>exponents</em>, which behave weirdly compared to real exponents.</p>
<p>The reason that these functions seem so strange is that when you first encounter them, you don't about imaginary numbers, so you can't put them in terms of something you already understand. In fact, trigonometry as a whole long predates the formal idea of imaginary numbers.</p>
<p>However these functions were treated historically, I personally find that the usual definition in terms of triangles is needlessly opaque. I prefer to define them in terms of <em>circles</em>.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Unit_circle.svg" target="_blank">This</a></em> is what the sine and cosine mean.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Circle_cos_sin.gif" target="_blank">Animated version</a>.</p>
<p>Now, what is the connection to imaginary numbers? Take the function f(t) = e^(i·t). This looks rather abstruse^([difficult to understand; obscure]) — what does it mean to raise something to an <em>imaginary</em> power? Well, it turns out that it means <em>rotating</em> it! The function e^(i·t), when t is a real number (so that i·t is imaginary) always produces a point on the unit circle. When t=0, e^(i·t) = 1. But as t increases, e^(i·t) rotates around the unit circle counterclockwise. When t = 2π, e^(i·t) has gone all the way around and is back at 1.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity#/media/File:Euler%27s_formula.svg" target="_blank">Picture</a>.</p>
<p>You can see that this is almost exactly the same picture as the one defining sine and cosine. In fact, there is an even simpler way of defining sine and cosine:</p>
<p><a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b39d354fe272ab3508576234f99f9884115e1fa9" target="_blank">Image</a></p>
<p>In these equations, “Im(x)” means the imaginary part of x and “Re(x)” is the real part of x. For instance, Re(2 + 3i) = 2, and Im(2 + 3i) = 3. The real part and imaginary part functions are not ordinary arithmetic functions — they're more like the absolute value function. But using these definitions, we can indeed define sine and cosine using ordinary arithmetic functions:</p>
<p><a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/54c9315ebec2cf4de2424c145441ec2cd3e43ca5" target="_blank">Image</a>.</p>
<p>A little fiddling will result in “Euler's formula”:</p>
<p><a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0b55e28219a34ac40f8f4a92e22302abb83c53bb" target="_blank">Image</a></p>
<p>And so we have an explicit definition of the sine and cosine in terms of familiar functions. The trade-off, obviously, is that now we have imaginary numbers to contend with! But imaginary numbers aren't so bad, and they really do make other things simpler. I find that explaining things <em>without</em> imaginary numbers is often more difficulty and complicated than just explaining imaginary numbers first. I've always wondered how much easier high school trig would be if you started with imaginary numbers and proceeded from there. Sure, it's not the way the ancients did it, but so what?</p>
<p>EDIT: Thought about removing “abstruse”, but instead added a definition because I really like that word.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <strong><em>sine</em></strong> is a measure of vertical-<em>ness</em>. Imagine a Ferris wheel, the wheel rotates by an angle and the <strong>sine</strong> of that angle tells you how &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; you are on the wheel. (With -1 being at the very bottom, and 1 being at the very top).
The <strong><em>cosine</em></strong> is a measure of horizontal-<em>ness</em>. Using the Ferris wheel analogy, this would be how far &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right* you are on the wheel.
The <strong><em>tangent</em></strong> is the slope-<em>ness</em> of a ramp. It's the height divided by the base (or Sine divided by Cosine) 0 slope would be a horizontal ramp and infinite (undefined) would be a cliff face. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are the three basic <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions" target="_blank">trigonometric functions</a>.</p>
<p>Look at a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Trigonometry_triangle.svg" target="_blank">right triangle</a> (&quot;right&quot; means that one angle is 90 degrees). Specifically, look at the angle A. There are three sides to the triangle: the hypotenuse (which is opposite the right angle), the side opposite the angle A, and the side adjacent to the angle A. The three trigonometric functions are defined as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>sin(A) = a/h = the ratio between the side of the triangle <em>opposite</em> the angle, and the <em>hypotenuse</em>.</li>
<li>cos(A) = b/h = the ratio between the side of the triangle <em>adjacent</em> the angle, and the <em>hypotenuse</em>.</li>
<li>tan(A) = sin(A) / cos(A) = a/b = the ratio between the side <em>opposite</em> the angle and the side <em>adjacent</em> to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, this defines sin/cos/tan for any value between 0 and 90 degrees. There's a more complex definition using a circle which extends this for every number (instead if just 0 - 90), which you can read about in the wiki page I linked to. Also, instead of using degrees, we normally use <em>radians</em>, which are a way to express degrees using the constant pi, such that 360 degrees = 2*pi (so 90 degrees = pi/2).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Obviously, as others have stated, there are very precise definitions of what the trigonometric functions are. However, it seems like you're asking for a more intuitive or less technical way to think about what they do to a number. </p>
<p>Consider first, for simplicity and without loss of generalization, that you're not going to feed your Trigonometric function numbers in the form of radians, which would just be some partition of the irrational number pi (pi/2, 2pi, pi/6, etc). Again, right now we aren't talking about that specifically. You're going to feed your function numbers in the form of degrees.</p>
<p>To be more concise and concrete, consider that you're walking along a circular path in a garden. Your path has a diameter of 2 meters. As you walk around the garden from your start point, you are taking more steps until you come back around to where you started. You've walked in a circle or 360 degrees. What if you notice that <a href="http://sculptures.bethelartsct.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/homeimage.jpg" target="_blank">the path has lines in it from pouring the concrete?</a> You stand on one line and look to the opposite side of the circle, you then count the number of lines between your line and that line directly across from you. <a href="https://www.studenthandouts.com/01-Web-Pages/2013-03/8-section-pie-chart.gif" target="_blank">In our example you count 3 in between that line and your line. 1 halfway between your position and the other side, creating two compartments, and then one in the middle of each compartment creating 4 compartments of path between you and exactly opposite the circle from you.</a></p>
<p>What would you think the angles you've made if you stop at one of those lines on your way over to the opposite side? You start at angle zero, and begin to walk over and every time you stop at a line you've added 45 degrees to your previous angle.</p>
<p>Now consider you wanted to set a number line between you and the spot directly across from you with respect to the center of the circle. You then declare the line you're standing at is 1, because with your 2 meter diameter, on your path you're standing 1 meter from the center (at all times actually!). So, as you walk towards the opposite line from where you're standing what if you stopped at your favorite spot, say 1 line from where you started - 45 degrees - and then decided you didn't like being on the path so you walked directly back to the number line you laid out between your 0 degree spot and the 180 degree spot? Would you be further than 1 meter from the center or less? Hopefully you think less! As you walked around your path to the other side, if you look at the number line you set up between you and the line directly across from <a href="http://solarenergyengineering.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/data/Journals/JSEEDO/935368/sol_138_05_051005_f005.png" target="_blank">you and walked directly to it, you'd be closer to the center than if you had stayed at 1.</a> As you keep walking towards the line opposite your original spot your angle grows bigger and your number line number keeps decreasing to -1 at the opposite side. </p>
<p>Now maybe you're seeing a relationship here. I know this was a little verbose and maybe tricky for you, the 5 year old, but <a href="http://i.imgur.com/cBzeLOo.gifv?forcedesktop=1" target="_blank">ultimately I hope you see that the trigonometric functions help translate your angle to the position on the line.</a> Specifically, in our example, we were talking about cosine. You give it your angle and it will give you your number line distance from the center. However, sine works the same way but reads out the vertical distance. When you're standing at 0 degrees, you're actually 0 meters above or below the center of the circle with respect to where you started. </p>
<p>Hopefully this helped! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure, there's a way to define them.  Suppose I choose a point on the unit circle (circle of radius one) about the origin, and I look at the angle that point makes with the (positive) horizontal axis.</p>
<p>Then the sine of the angle is the height (or vertical distance) of the point, the cosine is the horizontal distance (and is the same as the sine of the complementary angle, which is why it's called co-sine), and the tangent... well, that's the ratio of the sine and the cosine, never mind that one. :)</p>
<p>That's enough to define a function, we don't need to define it in terms of multiplying and adding things.  But if we need a number, we can use a Taylor series to approximate it.  This is what a calculator uses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
