		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer is &quot;for the same reasons colors often become more vivid (saturated) when something gets wet.&quot;</p>
<p>The longer answer is &quot;the appearance of paint is based on the colors of light that reflect off the paint vs. the colors that are absorbed. Varnish acts as a filter because it absorbs more blue light than any other color meaning less blue light reflects to your eye. With less blue, everything appears less white as in less washed out. White is a mix of all colors, so with less blue, there is less white. You can achieve the same effect by changing the color of the light shining on the painting.&quot;</p>
<p><em>[Copied from a follow-up answer lower in this discussion]</em>
I should add that varnish also makes things &quot;shiny&quot;. The shininess is a result of being smooth. Paint tends to have a microscopically rough surface meaning that is scatters reflected light in almost every direction. As a result, light that reflects off paint tends to have equal intensity in most directions meaning that there are no strong/bright/shiny/intense reflections. Acrylic paint is smoother than oil paint and therefore more shiny. When you varnish a painting, the varnish fills in the microscopic roughness smoothing everything out and producing shiny.</p>
<p><em>[Copied from yet more follow-up lower in this discussion]</em>
Most of the colors in a painting are not blue, but many pigments reflect a little bit of blue. If a red pigment reflects a little bit of green and little bit of blue, the pigment will look a little gray (dim white - white is a combination of red, green, and blue). If you take away either the green or the blue or both, the red will be more vividly red (more saturated) and less gray. Similarly, green paint reflects a little blue and a little red. If you take away either the blue or the red or both, the green will be more vivid (more saturated) and less gray. However, if you take away both red and blue, the only color you can see is green. Every other paint color looks gray. If you take away just blue, every non-blue color becomes more vivid, and only blue paint becomes gray. </p>
<p>Now, consider the relative amounts of red, green, and blue in a typical painting. If you are going to sacrifice one color to benefit the others, blue is the one to sacrifice.</p>
<p>The varnish does not completely eliminate blue. It just absorbs enough to make the other colors more vivid. You are probably used to seeing blue with a bit of gray in it, so you don't notice desaturated blue as much. In fact, there was an NPR science story about how ancient people did not have a word for blue and didn't seem to believe it was a real color in spite of the fact they could see azure Mediterranean sea and the same skies you and I see. </p>

</ul>
<p>Look at the &quot;Lastly, let’s look at “saturation,” or “chroma“&quot; section of this brief article explaining it: learn.leighcotnoir.com/artspeak/elements-color/hue-value-saturation/</p>
<p><em>&quot;Saturation defines the brilliance and intensity of a color. When a pigment hue is “toned,” both white and black (grey) are added to the color to reduce the color’s saturation. In terms of the “additive” light color model, though, saturation works on a scale based on how much or how little other hues are represented in the color.&quot;</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the answer about varnish absorbing blue light is correct. It might be, but I doubt the absorbance of varnish is high enough to have a material impact on what you see. </p>
<p>It is more to do with scattering. If you have a rough surface the light that hits it will be scattered, meaning that less light hits your eye and it isn't as bight. Think a frosted glass pane vs a normal one.</p>
<p>When you varnish it, the varnish flows into the roughness and levels it out. Less light is scattered and so it looks brighter. The same thing happens if frosted glass gets wet - it becomes clear. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also with oil painting, the paint sometimes gets what called “sunken in” where the oil has been absorbed by whatever surface the paint has been applied to. This can result in flat, patchy areas in a painting. Varnishing a painting will bring these areas back to the contrast and values that the artist intended.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorta related. I paint furniture and I've noticed the same effect with both paint and when I stain wood. I tend to use water based polyurethane as a top coat and I get the same results. Everything looks more bold and contrasted. Are there any differences between varnish and polyurethane?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same effect can be used to enhance a freshly done tattoo; the clearest, most saturated photos on Instagram are of tattoos covered in a layer of water. It stops the surface of the skin from reflecting light, and lets you look through it a great deal easier (which is also a good trick for finding spots you've missed or not fully saturated with pigment).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
