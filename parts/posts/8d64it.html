		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So first, your brain is pattern seeking. It doesn't really see a man or woman infront of them. It see's a lot of specific patterns like hip to waist ratio,  eye spacing, symmetry etc. And that all makes someone attractive or not. Anime, or similar art, works by highlighting specific characteristics and usually putting emphasis on them to make them specifically attractive somehow. </p>
<p>As for the emotional attachment, it could be partially pathos. Pathos is where the audience empathizes with the character of a story. We grow feelings for these characters. Those feelings can be internalized. </p>
<p>Second is a sort of disconnected feeling amongst certain people. Often these people don't have a whole lot of love coming to them from real life. Either percieved or real. So they settle for what they can get, even if it is artificial. Often the artificial love is in some ways better than real life. Virtual waifu loves you unconditionally, despite your failings. Something that many real relationships don't offer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because at some level we don't see them as fake, which is the reason we can enjoy them in the first place.</p>
<p>When you watch a program on TV, what you are really seeing is glowing bits of color moving across a flat surface.  We know it is &quot;fake&quot;, that there isn't a car chase in our living rooms, but that doesn't stop us from relating to it as those it were real.  We feel excited about the action, we identify with the good guy trying to save the day and worry about the bad guy getting away, even though we know it is fake on many levels.</p>
<p>There is no reason these sorts of emotions can't extend to animate characters who are just fake in one additional way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like much of psychology, there is a lot of speculation and a lot of different theories on how and why people think. However, to understand why people have waifus requires a brief explanation of attraction.</p>
<p>The generally held consensus is that, first of all, your brain is pattern-seeking. You look at symmetry, ratios, and the like, and you determine that a character is attractive that way. As cold as that sounds, there is another half to this.</p>
<p>The other half is personality. What makes someone likable is that they are relatable to you, or you find them interesting in some sort of way.</p>
<p>Waifus may display both, but they are obviously not real, tangible people. The reason people choose waifus is because it gives them a sort of connection that they may otherwise not have. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's kinda like this: what's better, a cake, or a picture of a cake? The cake smells pretty good, looks pretty good, and tastes pretty good. It's not great, but not bad either. The cake in the picture however is the perfect cake. It is, objectively, better than any other cake, in every way. But in the end, it's only a picture of a cake. </p>
<p>In short, these people look at the picture of the cake, and like that. They can't eat it, but they still prefer it over the real deal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
