		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I keep reading in some replies in AskScience that photons have no mass.  I assumed laser beams were composed of photons, but wasn't sure if that was ALL they were composed of.  So I searched the Internet and found this article: <a href="https://www.rp-photonics.com/photons.html" target="_blank">https://www.rp-photonics.com/photons.html</a> which doesn't (for me) clarify an answer.  I know I must be missing something in my understanding, because if lasers are composed only of photons with no mass, then using Einstein's equation E=MC^2 would result in the Mass being 0 and the resulting equation being 0=0, where the Energy would also be 0.  So, how can a laser light beam composed of &quot;massless photons&quot; produce energy to bore a hole through a substance?</p>
<p>EDIT:  WOW!  Thanks for all the answers.  I learned several new things today, one of them being what I &quot;already knew&quot; was an incomplete understanding of the knowledge I had.</p></div></div>
