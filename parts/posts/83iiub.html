<p>Edit: thanks for the International assistance.  I posted this on saturday at around noon here in America, and it only started getting attention as the crazy Britts woke up for their fist of 20 cups for the day.</p>
<p>Also, for the record it is an Earl Grey by Bigelow.  I use 2 bags for what would be 14 oz (freedom units).  I squeeze the piss out of both bags, using only my fingers, not a spoon or the strings.  I also dunk the crap out of the bags while it steeps...</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting question. </p>
<p>Tea has tannins. They are released by the hot water. A little gets in your drink but most stays in the soggy tea leaves. When you squeeze the tea leaves, you release more tannins into the tea. </p>
<p>Extra tannins, give the tea a bitter flavor. Most tea drinkers find this unpleasant. That’s why it’s not recommended. </p>
<p>But it’s interesting because if you’ve done it your whole life, you must like it that way. The right way to drink it is the way you like it. So keep squeezing the tea bag if you prefer it that way. </p>
<p>Source: I drink an absurd amount of tea</p>
<p>Edit: I’ve been informed of the difference between tannins and tannic acid. Tea has tannins, not tannic acid. But yeah, it makes the tea bitter. </p>
<p>E2: okay so I cleaned up some of the science in my answer based on the helpful replies from other people. Thanks for helping me get it right. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I've scrolled through a bunch of comments w/o seeing the reason I've heard not to do this, which is only surprising to me because I'm fairly positive I learned it from Alton Brown on Good Eats, which is quite popular: store-bought tea bags generally contain some amount of dust and other non-tea particulates that can get pushed through the paper into the tea. </p>
<p>So according to Alton Brown, u shouldn't squeeze tea bags cuz it adds dust to ur tea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work at a (target) Starbucks and when we brew our iced teas we use metal tongs to squeeze the tea bags. Granted, they are large tea bags so this could be the reason why. Either way I believe it’s standard for brewing iced tea. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
