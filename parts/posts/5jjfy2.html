		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Antimatter is Matter with inverse charged sub atomic particles. So in normal matter, electrons are negatively charged and protons positively. In antimatter electrons are called positrons and are positively charged and Protons are Antiprotons and are negatively charged. Apart from that antimatter is behaving not so different from matter.</p>
<p>If you mix antimatter with matter things get a little more crazy. Matter and antimatter annihilate each other. In this process all their mass is turned to energy. If you would bring 1 g of antimatter hydrogen in contact with 1 g of hydrogen the resulting annihilation would set free 362 TJ energy or roughly 90 kT TNT.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our current understanding is antimatter and matter are essentially the same but with some properties reversed (electron = negative, antielectron/positron = positive). They have the same mass, same magnitude of charge etc.</p>
<p>At the very start of the universe just after the big bang particles the temperature was hot enough that particles could be formed from that energy providing the energy around was greater than the mass of the particles formed (I know it's not really an ELI5 answer because it contains E = mc^2). But essentially we have all the different particles being created and destroyed changing between all the different types. </p>
<p>As the universe cooled and there wasn't enough energy to make different particles anymore they were locked in. Our current theories think it should be just as likely to form an proton as it would be an anti-proton so we'd expect equal numbers of each. But when matter and antimatter combine they annihilate giving turning into lower mass particles or just light. After the universe cooled the majority of all the particles created annihilated leaving a little bit of matter behind, and seemingly no antimatter (space isn't a perfect vacuum and people have looked at colliding galaxies for signs of matter and anti-matter combining but everything appears to be just matter).</p>
<p>The fact that everything left over from the big bang is matter means that matter and antimatter weren't created exactly equally and there was something that caused just a little bit more matter to be produced. That's a clue that there's some unknown physics just waiting to be discovered. The way we hope to find out what caused it is to look very very carefully at antimatter and look for tiny differences between it and regular matter. Weigh it, look at its spectra, look at the effect of gravity on it etc. There are experiments doing all of these.</p>
<p>Why does it matter? Well when we learn about new physics we tend to find new uses for it. General relativity and special relativity are both needed for SatNavs to work, but when those theories were proposed nobody was planning to build GPS. A laser was made long before anyone thought to put it in a CD player. It's often decades between a scientific discovery and the world changing application its needed for, so it's impossible to know what could come from this work.</p>
<p>TL:DR:
Current theories suggest matter and antimatter are exactly the same but with some properties flipped. Other things point to there being some slight difference we're not aware of, so we have to measure it very carefully and look for unexpected things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, antimatter is like matter with the charges flipped (note that there are more charges than just electric charge).</p>
<p>This recent result is a test of what is called &quot;CPT symmetry&quot;.</p>
<p>CPT stands for charge, parity and time. If you take a system, flip all the charges and reverse the directions of space and time (t→−t, x→−x, y→−y, z→−z) if it obeys the same laws of physics as the original system, then CPT symmetry is conserved. If you want an analogy for the PT part, it's like filming something through a mirror and playing the recording backwards. Physicists really expect CPT symmetry to be conserved: it's an assumption that's built in to pretty much all of our theories.</p>
<p>If you want, you can read pages 3 to 14 of <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N-uHNjmnRoIC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3" target="_blank">this book</a>, which gives a decent explanation if you know some of the basics already.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
