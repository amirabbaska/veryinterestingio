<p>Cars probably aren't the best thing to look at because there's so many other factors involved beyond &quot;thing A hits thing B&quot;.  If you look at something simple, like hockey pucks on an infinite sheet of ice, then, yes, the physics works regardless of the speeds of the objects involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A real world example of the answer to your question would be a NASCAR race, especially at tracks like Daytona and Talladega.    </p>
<p>Speeds are on the order of 200MPH and it's common place for the drivers to make contact by either bumping front to back or side to side. Sometimes they'll make contact rather hard, probably a delta of more than a few MPH, which is known as Slam-Drafting and it's looked down upon as it's dangerous.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially yes, with one big difference.</p>
<p>The relative velocity is the same in all three scenarios so the energy transfer would be the same.</p>
<p>A minor collision can cause loss of control at speed though. If the car loses traction at 100 mph due to a minor bump a serious crash may result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would guess that while the total force of the crash is the same in both cases, the stationary car would take (slightly) more damage since the axles would need to overcome static friction before the car moved forward. The moving car is already in kinetic friction, so the impact would be translated into acceleration rather than deforming the bumper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I'm going to have to disagree. the stationary car would have to be in neutral or not on the brakes in order for it to be the same...Think of it like this... NASCAR bump drafting, or hitting a concrete wall. That is an exaggerated version of both. While in the terms of physics... Both masses and velocities calculated the impacts would probably be similar..but in the real world, if a car is stationary it's usually either in park, or brakes are applied. Energy from the impact would be less likely to be transferred into forward motion as hitting a moving car. HOWEVER, if the 59mph car was decelerating as fast as it could, And hit by the 60mph car, the impact would be greater. It's about the transfer of energy more than anything. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
