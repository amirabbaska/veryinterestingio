		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>for example, in my family (on my father's side), there have been only boys for the last 5 generations (and i'm only saying 5 because we don't know what was the deal before). Is it some genetic predisposition, or did we just beat the odds? (assuming you have a 50% chance of having a boy, our track record of 20 boys is literally one in a million).</p>
<p>Edit: Clarifying that the 5 generations is on my father's side. clearly my mother's side had girls at some point.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It appears that there is a genetic component to childbirth from a <a href="http://www.science20.com/news_releases/chromosomes_are_so_20th_century_male_genes_really_determine_baby_gender_says_study" target="_blank">Newcastle University study</a> <a href="http://www.collective-action.info/sites/default/files/webmaster/_TEA_Gellatly_Trends-in-Population-Sex-Ratios.pdf" target="_blank">(full study)</a> that found a correlation between men with many brothers having a higher percentage of male children and men with many sisters having a higher percentage of female.  </p>
<p>This data is in line with a theory that there is a sex-linked gene  that determines the proportion of men's sperm. If the man has MM he produces more male sperm MF means more equal sperm and FF means more female sperm.  Currently this gene has not been identified.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this adds much, but I'm a primatologist and there is this trend in primates: high ranking females tend to have males/sons, and lower ranking females have daughters.  This is because sons have more variable reproductive success, so if they inherit your rank, it makes sense to have sons that end up with a higher than average chance of reproducing.  If you aren't high ranking, it's safer to invest in daughters because they will have fairly reliable reproductive rates no matter what their rank is.  This is achieved through post-copulatory female sperm selection.
So, maybe if rank (in humans this means job success and money) runs in families, so does a sex bias?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if it's mentioned other places, but it is also possible to have sex-linked diseases that might cause a fetus to be nonviable. </p>
<p>Imagine a woman has a mutation on one of her x chromosomes that codes for an essential protein (let's call it protein xyz). Because she has one chromosome &quot;X&quot; that produces xyz, and one &quot;x&quot; that doesn't. She is Xx, so she has one functioning chromosome that produces xyz and so she is phenotypically normal.</p>
<p>However, all of her male children don't have the benefit of two x chromosomes, so she will get a 50% split of YX and Yx. All fetuses with Yx wont produce xyz and will thus miscarry. Because of this, she will have twice as many girls as boys, and this trend can continue for some time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There has been some very slight evidence that environmental or genetic factors can influence whether a couple tends to have male or female children. As one example, <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1643/1661" target="_blank">this study here</a> from researchers in the UK showed that there was evidence that the diet of the mother around the time of conception was correlated with having a male or female baby.</p>
<p>However, the best answer is that it is quite nearly 50/50 chance for a boy or girl, and statistically there are outliers in some families (like maybe yours). There is no magic &quot;eat/do this and you will get a boy&quot; that has been found, no matter what the old wives' tales tell us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
