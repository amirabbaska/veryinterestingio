Is it some genetic predisposition, or did we just beat the odds? (assuming you have a 50% chance of having a boy, our track record of 20 boys is literally one in a million).</p>
<p>Edit: Clarifying that the 5 generations is on my father's side. clearly my mother's side had girls at some point.</p></div></div>
