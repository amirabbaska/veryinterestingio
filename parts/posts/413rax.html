		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually reading a book right now that talks about this: &quot;Oxygen: The Molecule that Made the World&quot; by Nick Lane</p>
<p>Yes, fire did burn differently because of excess oxygen fuel.  During the carboniferous period, 300-350 million years ago,  oxygen levels reached as high as 35%, compared to today's ~20%.  This allowed fires to start in places which we wouldn't normally expect (places of high humidity, during rain storms).  Today we find fossilized charcoal in coal beds that arose from peat bogs, which grants credence to the idea that fires did burn much more easily during this period.  You might ask &quot;how did plants survive the constant danger of fire?&quot; Adaptation thanks to random evolution.  For example, plants from this period expressed deeper roots/tubers than their modern day counterparts, and the leaves of trees were higher which could help avoid catching fire from a stray brush fire.  </p>
<p>The reason so much coal (a large part of which is oftentimes fossilized charcoal) remains from this period is due to two factors, as other posters have mentioned.  First The structural material of plants, lignin, doesn't burn rapidly, (paper is often stripped free of lignin which is why it burns so easily) rather it tends to smolder (i.e. logs in a fire), so fires would leave large amounts of charcoal rather than their usual main byproducts: carbon dioxide,carbon monoxide (at lower burning efficiencies) and water.  Secondly, lignin is very hard to digest, even fungus/bacteria today have a hard time digesting it.  300 million years ago, the decay rate was practically zero.  In summary, pretty much all of todays coal comes from plants which, millions of years ago, died and were buried without ever going through the process of decay.</p>
<p>What's even cooler though is that during this time gigantic insects roamed the earth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meganeura" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meganeura</a> which is believed to be related to the faster metabolic rates that high oxygen content allows.</p>
<p>Anyways, its a good book if you're interested in the topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an Environmental Scientist I have studied modules relating to high atmospheric oxygen and its relation to fire. A base premise was set up with &quot;burn experiments&quot; initially on wet paper. I'll spare you the full details of the experiment, but it basically states that higher atmospheric oxygen, 25% the probability of ignition would reach 100%. Basically you would expect massive global forest fires. However, through isotope analysis we can see that global levels of oxygen actually peaked around 30% 300 million years ago. </p>
<p>Using supplementary charcoal record we can see a large peak in what sort of vegetation is being burned and where. At 35% oxygen levels we see evidence for fires in mires, and even very wet vegetation growing. This collective period of time is known as the Permian, and actually ends with a mass extinction through declining oxygen levels. </p>
<p>So to answer your question, fire burned hotter, and it burned wetter vegetation than today. However, there is no evidence of massive global forest fires as initially thought, just rather large ones.</p>
<p>[EDIT] There seems to be some confusion about burning reaching 100%, the experiment simply stated that at 25% Oxygen there was a 100% chance of sustained burning occurring in that environment. This isn't to say the damp paper literally caught fire, but that when heat was applied and then turned off the substance continued to burn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I'm not mistaken, there was a relatively long period of time where trees had evolved but the cells that enabled trees to form rigid structures could not be broken down through biological processes (it took a long time for bacteria, algae, fungi to evolve the ability to digest).  During this period, trees would die but not decompose.  Forests would become massive areas of dead wood.  These would catch fire and created staggeringly large fires.  Much of the coal we consume today formed as a result of this period.  </p>
<p>Edit: Thanks good folk for the gilding and the great info.  I've really enjoyed learning more about this interesting time.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea what the answer would be, and this doesn't explain like you're 5, but I thought your question was very interesting so I found this: <a href="https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/coffee-break/cb_fp_2014_13.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/coffee-break/cb_fp_2014_13.pdf</a> and this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_oxygen" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_oxygen</a></p>
<p>From the first thing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Materials that normally do not burn in atmospheric oxygen may burn vigorously in an enriched
environment. Materials become easier to ignite because their flammable ranges expand and their
autoignition temperatures drop. Even materials that we think of as noncombustible — such as the
metal pipe that delivers the oxygen — can ignite in these atmospheres.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An oxygen enriched environment, they say, is 23.5% oxygen by volume, the air we breathe is 20.5%. From the wiki article, the percentage was as high as 35% at its peak 300 million years ago but there have also been large blocks of time in the earth's history where oxygen was minimal or possibly even removed from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>So considering the first thing and considering the second thing, I would be inclined to believe that fire behaved differently than a similar fire would today. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
