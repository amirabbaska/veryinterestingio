<p>There's no way to analyze very well what's going on underground, so there's no way to develop a protocol for depressurizing a volcano.. there's seismic tomography but it's rather coarse, and there's not a good picture of pressure, exact rock density, etc., so anything that is done is a crapshoot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pressures in the magma chamber are on the order of megabars to gigabars and the target zone is often located <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02762" target="_blank">10-20 km down or more</a>.  It's hard just getting down there.  And once an eruption comes up a drillhole at high pressure, there may not be much to stop it from widening the column and erupting fully right there.</p>
</li>
<li>Liability and politics... how do you address the concerns of residents who don't want the chamber tampered with, and are you prepared for injunctions and court battles? And if you do drill, what if a small release produces a Pinatubo eruption?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>as hodyoaten stated, the limitations are numerous.</p>
<p>This isnt anything at all like drilling for oil.  The area your drilling to is immensely hot, so even if you could pinpoint exactly where you wanted to go to relieve pressure, we may not have the tools that can get there.  Entirely in theory, we may be able to use water to hydrdo-drill to the area but this would still leave more questions to be answered, like what are the side effects and what do you do with all of the water and earth you've dug up?</p>
<p>Once you've gotten low enough, how do you intend to relieve pressure in a safe way?  this isnt at all like the pressure relief valve on your water heater.  That valve is made to withstand higher temperatures than the water heater can, reducing the risk of failure.  What materials can we use to hold lava(yes hopefully the lava would never make it to anything important, however)?  It maybe possible to simply bleed off the gasses but then what would you do with the toxic gasses?  these gasses will be undoubtedly be extremely hot and may need to be cooled before containing them.  People will have environmental concerns.</p>
<p>What do you do when something goes wrong?  how to you prevent the lava from using the hole you drilled to burst out of the ground?  You can't just plug the hole as the pressure has a path to the surface and may come out someplace else.  Are you hoping to just fill the hole back in (the problems with this idea are numerous)?  Its not very realistic to pour 10 inch concrete in a 2 mile radius from your work site. 10 inches thick might be a little thin, some eruptions burst through a good amount of earth and this plate will add pressure to the area.  in theory, the plate would reduce the chances of an eruption, but it would also increase its volatility. </p>
<p>And finally, risk vs reward and effort, what are you hoping to gain? Are there any other ways this can be done at a lower risk?  if your just hoping to reduce the chances of an eruption, would it be easier to cool the given area and press the hot water through a turbine to not only generate electricity (A thermoelectric generator using the earth's core) but to also cool the area in hopes that will relieve some pressure?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my basic understanding of Geology, once we drill down to a certain level, the heat becomes so intense we do not have the technology to proceed further. In an active or dormant volcano, I imagine that heat is much closer to the surface, and would thus preclude drilling to a certain extent. Once again, not a geologist, but I just remember this from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole" target="_blank">Kola Superdeep Bore</a>. Our tech may have improved since then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shear scale of it. Pressure in the chamber can be strong enough to blow up a mountain. You'd have to drill a lot of holes and regularly re-drill because the many km of rock that you drill through is moving. You'd have to drill through partially molten rock, which may not be possible. Release of pressure might occasionally include large quantities of molten rock. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
