		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If such a thing could form, it would likely evaporate very quickly by Hawking radiation. And I mean <em>quickly</em>. A black hole of mass 10^-23 g (approximately the mass of an atom) will evaporate is 10^-94 seconds... that's like 10^-54 Planck times.</p>
<p>But those numbers are probably all useless/meaningless anyway because what you'd really want to describe such a thing is a quantum theory of gravity - gravity probably behaves differently at such mass/length/time scales. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The size of an atom would probably be the diameter from the most energetic orbital, straight through the proton core, x2. </p>
<p>Black holes much larger than an atom, like a grain of sand, are theoretically extremely unstable and would evaporate in very little time.
The time-dependant release of energy would be unpractical to harness, like a battery that wants to give all its energy at once.
Also, extreme energetic outputs like that would probably scar your continent if released at once, or even be able to ignite the whole atmosphere - even completely shed! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're asking the wrong question here. Atomic sized black holes would not stick around for more than a second in space. </p>
<p>The real question is: <em>Theoretically, could an atomic sized black hole be artificially created and maintained in order to harness the energy?</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
