		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically it takes effort to focus your eyes, when you gaze off into the distance, not really looking at anything, your eyes realize they don't have to do work, and get a bit hazy. </p>
<p>HOW this works is a bit more interesting, your eye lens is flexible, (even though you might have thought it was hard in that cow eyeball you dissected in high school) and is able to change shape by consciously or unconsciously changing the muscles in your eye. A rounder lens is able to focus on closer objects, as seen <a href="https://i.imgur.com/GKYvQgW.jpg" target="_blank">here:</a> and a flatter lens is able to focus on things that are further away as seen <a href="https://i.imgur.com/sIVIL54.jpg" target="_blank">here:</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's start with the how. How this happens is that the lense in the eye is soft. It's shape and therefor its focal point (focus) can be changed by muscles in the eye. The more the lense is squeezed by these muscles the thicker and more convex it becomes, reducing the focal distance. </p>
<p>When looking at something, the brain judges the distance to the object you wanna focus on and adjusts the muscles around the lense to put that object into focus. The focus point has to be just right for this to work. If its too close OR too far away the image won't be sharp and vision will be blurry. </p>
<p>As for why vision sometimes goes blurry, there are lots of possible reasons, but I'll go over a few. One is simply tiredness, your brain is tired and can't quite controll its muscles. Your limbs feel heavy, you can't keep you eyelids from closing, this affects the muscles around your lense as well. </p>
<p>One other reason is you're under the effect of some kind of substance. This might be alcohol, medication or narcotics. It's really too general to get into to as every substance causes different reactions in the body. Some prevent the muscles from contracting correctly while others distrupt the brains vision centre (located in the back of the head).</p>
<p>Muscle fatigue might be the cause of blurriness. You've spent too long reading or staring at a monitor too close to your eyes. Just like most other muscles the ones around your lense can get tired, when they are it's harder to get them to do what you want. </p>
<p>Tears or water directly infront of the eye. This is a topic of how light bends in different materials and that question has been asked before, with people giving far better explenations than I every could.

It was happening at stop lights, he would just 'let go' of the focus. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To some extent it is muscular and when you get tired, so your eye controlling muscle will slack or need a more conscious effort to focus. I know someone who experiences a struggle to focus / blurry vision when he is having a bad day, due to <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Myasthenia-gravis/Pages/Introduction.aspx" target="_blank">myasthenia gravis</a> which is a condition affecting muscle tone in the face. </p>
<p>So it can be caused by fatigue or many other causes of muscle weakness. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
