		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is both kind of yes and kind of no.</p>
<p>Compared to electricity, the answer is generally a &quot;no&quot;, since with electricity it's not really a technology limitation but rather just girth of the wire, insulation, heat tolerance, and stuff like that.</p>
<p>That said, Ethernet cable has improved over time. You can look at this wikipedia page for an example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_over_twisted_pair" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_over_twisted_pair</a> . Also note that while that Ethernet technology has improved over time, that is not really the bottleneck for what has increased internet speeds. It's more-so general infrastructure and routing stations themselves that route all the traffic, and/or their use of a technology like fiber optic cables and switches.</p>
<p>Generally speaking the cable visually looks the same since it's still almost always Ethernet (although some providers may provide it via a coaxial cable line), but it does have better noise isolation and other stuff improving the speed it can operate at. The computers itself also need to support the faster speed, and is actually the most critical component in the line; while even very old computers have the same Ethernet ports as the newest computers, their network controllers will only tolerate a much slower max speed (this is the same sort of principle in ISPs having faster/slower service). This even applies to routers/switches/hubs, which means if you have an old router but a new PC, the router could be the bottleneck. Usually the ISP is the bottleneck though (aside from wireless scenarios) since their speeds are frequently 10â€“1000 times slower than the speed that your Ethernet cable can operate at.</p>
<p>In addition, fiber-optic cables can transfer data much faster than Ethernet, but generally that's only used between data centers, and/or distribution hubs, not to the end user.</p>
<p>The two things they do both generally have in common is rating/capability for the end-devices themselves. For power this is frequently a voltage requirement (which is both a min and a max), and potentially also it's ability to dissipate heat such that it doesn't overheat (which really isn't an input spec, but it will still change the amount of power it can take). For network, as was already mentioned different devices support different speeds, such as 1 gigabit per second (common but not especially new specification, been around for a good 15 years for consumers) or 10 megabits per second (really old)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are 4 main types of carriers for internet. Coax, fiber, copper (what most people have in their walls for internet), and wireless. each of these has standards and limitations. I will order this in the order that most people use.</p>
<p>So, first off we have wireless. There have already been many wifi standards (802.11-b,g,n, and now different flavors of 802.11-ac). Each came with a speed or range increase, as well as more advance technologies such as channel hopping, beam forming antennas, and different algorithms to handle higher traffic and interference. Each subsequent upgrade to wifi constituted a different type of cable as you put it. often times a card that was designed for 802.11-g will not work with newer standards such as 802.11-n, unless it was made RIGHT before the standard was finalized. Wifi also utilizes two frequency ranges. 2.4ghz and 5ghz. if b,g,n, and AC are different amperage rated cables, than 2.4 and 5 ghz are like having different wall plugs. Even if a vendor released firmware to upgrade a 2.4 ghz wifi card to work with a newer 2.4ghz standard, there would be no way to release an update to make a 2.4 ghz card work with 5ghz, since the hardware just isnt there. (as a side note, a firmware upgrade is theoretically possible, but i have never seen it done. most of the time the wifi cards use a chip that is only meant for certain standards)</p>
<p>wifi has a lot of info about it. i will pass on it here since you asked specifically for internet <em>cables</em>. if your interested, reply and ill expand.</p>
<hr />
<p>next up we have good old copper. most of the time the copper is terminated with rj-45 connectors, however this is not always the case. ill touch on that at the end of this section. when you buy an ethernet cable, it normally has an associated standard with it. You might be familiar with cat5, cat5e, cat6, or cat6a (though they continue to go higher to cat7 and cat8). Each of these standards defines characteristics about the cable that the network ports care about, and ultimately define the throughput that is possible. this includes the inductance and impedance at a certain frequency, as well as dc resistance, and capacitance. The most important ones though are going to be the impedance at the desired frequency, and the twists per inch on the cable. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_5_cable#/media/File:CAT5e_Cable.jpg" target="_blank">twists</a> in the cable help to remove noise from other electronics, since having a long straight cable acts like an antenna. The frequency the transmitter and receiver operate at ultimately dictates the throughput, since a higher frequency means more data is possible to send. (for more on this, check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem" target="_blank">Shannon Hartley theorem</a>). now, lets cover the standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>cat5 had a terribly low frequency of 100mhz, and a similar data throughput of 100mbps.  cat5e reduced the crosstalk more, and kept the 100mhz frequency, and was able to achieve 1000mbps speed (1gbps). this is what most older homes built after late 2001 are wired with, normally for phone as well! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cat6 now brings us the ability to transmit at 10gbps for 55m runs and gigabit for 100m runs. to achieve this the frequency that the transmission is done at was raised to 250mhz. later a slightly different standards called cat6a was brought out that increased the frequency to 500mhz and allows 10gbps transmissions at 100m runs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cat 7 and cat 8 are a mess... originally cat7 was specced out to support 10gbps at 100m runs, however the cat6a standard was introduced that supported this. cat 7 required wrapping each twisted pair with shielding, which increased the cost, as well as defining a different connector to be used optionally (the gg45, or the TERA connector). the cable was specced to run at 600mhz. Later cat7a came out which was meant to up the throughput to 40gbps, however by that time a standard for 40gbps over copper came out, which defined 2000mhz as the transmission frequency, so cat 7a was scrapped in favor of cat8. </p>
<ul>
<li>cat 7 was never really used, other than maybe if someone pushed hard to wire a home for future proofing... cat 8 isnt used in home of office installs, and is mainly used in data centers for short run cables*.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, you will probably never touch ethernet cables beyond cat6a. I would bet money that all the equipment in your home maxes out at 1gbps. if you bought an expensive router or switch that does support 10gbps copper, and put a pci 10gbps network card in your computer, you could probably achieve 10gbps over the wiring you have, assuming its cat6 / cat6a though. also, the footnote for cat 8... the articles i read in fact checking myself specified that cat8 has two classes, one for the 8 pin 'rj45' connector, as well as a class for the TERA / gg45 connector. i personally have never seen these. most data centers will use sfp+ for 10gbps and qsfp for 40gbps. these are normally used for fiber, however you CAN get very short run (&lt;5ft) copper patch cables that are terminated with sfp+ / qsfp connectors that can hit 10 or 40 gbps throughput. if i had to take a guess i would assume they are using cat8 cable for this.</p>
<hr />
<p>next up is coax. this is most likely what you have coming in from your ISP and going into your modem. coax allows for longer runs of cable without repeaters compared to rj45... but fiber takes the cake. ill get to that next. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable#/media/File:RG-59.jpg" target="_blank">heres an example of coax</a>. coax uses that inner copper wire for transmission, the white plastic is called a dialectric and acts to insulate the inner data cable from the outer copper jacket. that acts as the ground, but also as shielding to reduce the noise on the signal wire. lastly there is isolation on the outside of the cable. The biggest factor for coax is the wire impedance. In the US, most coax is rg-6 and uses 75 ohm impedance. for ethernet over coax, there are 5 standards called docsis that were defined. docsis1, 1.1, 2, 3, 3.1, and 3.1 with full duplex. the following table from wikipedia defines out what the differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1.0   1997    40 Mbit/s(down)     10 Mbit/s(up)   Initial release</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1.1   2001    40 Mbit/s(down)     10 Mbit/s(up)   Added VOIP capabilities, standardized the DOCSIS 1.0 QoS mechanisms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2.0   2002    40 Mbit/s(down)     30 Mbit/s(up)   Enhanced upstream data rates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3.0   2006    1.2 Gbit/s(down)    200 Mbit/s(up)  Significantly increased downstream/upstream data rates, introduced support for IPv6, introduced channel bonding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3.1   2013    10 Gbit/s(down)     1â€“2 Gbit/s(up)  Significantly increased downstream/upstream data rates, restructured channel specifications</p>
</li>
<li>3.1 Full Duplex   2017    10 Gbit/s(down)     10 Gbit/s(up)   Introduces support for fully symmetrical speeds</li>
</ul>
<p>The speed increases, like with copper, came from higher frequency channels that narrowed in their bandwidth, allowing for more channels to be carried over one wire. The current docsis standard still uses rj-45 however higher frequency signaling can increase throughput beyond what is currently supported. in doing so, one would need to utilize a  cable that is better suited for higher frequencies (such as lmr-195). I dont see this happening though, since most infrastructure is going to fiber now.</p>
<hr />
<p>alright, last one, fiber optics. Fiber is the only cable that doesn't need to be upgraded assuming you go with the right one. there are two main types of fiber, single mode and multi mode. Multi mode is cheaper, and uses a larger diameter optical channel. this allows the light to bounce around more, so there is more loss. multi mode is normally used in short runs in data centers, since the cabling and transmitter / receiver modules can be cheaper. single mode is utilized for very long runs, its much smaller optical channel allows the light to go a lot further without bouncing, reducing the signal attenuation. once you have single mode fiber ran, to increase your throughput, you just have to replace the sending and receiving equipment on both ends to accommodate a new standard. Most fiber is rated with OC-n specification, where the n is some number that represents the throughput as (51.84Mbps * n). This is mainly used from a telcom stand point. in most data centers its just refereed to as single mode or multi mode... or more commonly by its end connector and color, since the color denotes the cable standard (such as OM1, 2, 3, or 4 for multi mode fiber) for instance, all my fiber is aqua lc-lc cable (OM4, with lc connectors on both ends). Fiber is surprisingly cost effective. To do a 10gbps home network, it would be more cost effective to run multi mode fiber, if the cat6/a is not already ran. This is mainly due to the price of the pci cards and switch gear in comparison to 10gbps copper. OM4 multi mode can support 10 Gigabit Ethernet at lengths up 550 meters and it supports 100 Gigabit Ethernet at lengths up to 150 meters. The only tricky thing about fiber is there is an extra piece of equipment in line. You might have noticed i mentioned SFP+ and qsfp previously, but did not mention that at all when talking about fiber. a fiber switch has holes in it for modules (such as sfp, sfp+, or qsfp). you can then buy a module for that switch that has the right connector for the fiber on it. you plug the fiber into that. <a href="https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1ozK_HVXXXXXYXFXXq6xXFXXXs/2-sfp-port-4-ethernet-port-poe-fiber-switch.jpg" target="_blank">here is an example image</a></p>
<p>feel free to ask any questions. im currently running 10gbps sfp+ fiber in my apartment, so i have a good bit of hands on experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Are you talking about ones in your house or ones that go through the ocean.  For example with fiberoptic it depends more on the what equipment of have on the ends.  For example you can upgrade the send and receive equipment with out upgrading the fiberoptic cable.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most internet traffic travels over fiber optic cables, using lasers.  They keep finding ways to send more data over these fiber optic links.  The amount of data they send depend upon the method used and length of the link.  Some travel thousand of kilometers.  The highest commercially available now is 600Gbps for a given wavelength of light, and they send many wavelengths in a fiber to increase capacity. </p>
<p>Most people then get their internet access in their homes via copper wire pairs (DSL) or coax (DOCSIS, or cable) which carries internet the last mile or so.  Even here, they find ways to increase capacity every couple of years.  If your lucky you'll get fiber to your home, but this is expensive (ask Google about that).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>NO, while often electricity is involved cables that deliver power and &quot;internet&quot; accomplish much different tasks. </p>
<p>Data lines and power lines are designed to accomplish different tasks. Power cables are designed to send electrons to and from a source and destination.  The major issues with power is that the higher the current the more heat generated in which expands the conductor. If you look closely you will see power cables droop during extreme peak usage (mostly summer heat waves or winter cold snaps).  If you need to move more power you need a thicker conductor. </p>
<p>While some methods for transmitting data does use electricity, increasing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput" target="_blank">Throughput</a> doesn't require more power but the ability to manipulate and monitor the manipulation the medium that it is sent. There are many different mediums and variations of those mediums.  Copper is pretty inexpensive to deploy and maintain for short distances,  Fiber while expensive and delicate is not susceptible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference" target="_blank">interference</a> (and a few other other problems) like copper is, so it is better for long haul connections.  The RF spectrum has loads of downsides that I'd rather not attempt to list. </p>
<p>As for an &quot;internet port&quot; I'm assuming you really mean the &quot;Ethernet&quot; port,  currently most computers are sold with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabit_Ethernet#1000BASE-T" target="_blank">1000BASE-T</a> ethernet ports (commonly refered to as &quot;gigabit ethernet&quot;) that already is faster than what most ISP's are willing to deliver to residential customers. If for some reason you need more throughput than it can deliver there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Gigabit_Ethernet" target="_blank">10 Gigabit</a> Ethernet available, but that exceeds the speed of most desktop's storage.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
