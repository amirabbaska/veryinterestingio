		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Subs like r/worldnews often have a autotldr bot which shortens news articles down by ~80%(+/-). How exactly does this bot know which information is really relevant? I know it has something to do with keywords but they always seem to give a really nice presentation of important facts without mistakes.</p>
<p>Edit: Is this the right flair?</p>
<p>Edit2: Thanks for all the answers guys!</p>
<p>Edit 3: Second page of r/all - dope shit.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/autotldr uses an algorithm called &quot;SMMRY&quot; for its tl;drs. There are similar algorithms as well (like the ones /u/AtomicStryker mentioned), but for whatever reason, autotldr's creator opted for SMMRY, probably for its API. Instead of explaining how SMMRY to you, I'll take a little excerpt from their <a href="http://smmry.com/about" target="_blank">website</a> since I'd end up saying the same stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The core algorithm works by these simplified steps:</p>
<p>1) Associate words with their grammatical counterparts. (e.g. &quot;city&quot; and &quot;cities&quot;)  </p>
<p>2) Calculate the occurrence of each word in the text.</p>
<p>3) Assign each word with points depending on their popularity.</p>
<p>4) Detect which periods represent the end of a sentence. (e.g &quot;Mr.&quot; does not).</p>
<p>5) Split up the text into individual sentences.</p>
<p>6) Rank sentences by the sum of their words' points.</p>
<p>7) Return X of the most highly ranked sentences in chronological order.</p>

<p>If you have any other questions feel free to reply and I'll try my best to explain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many auto-summary tools around. This is how smmry.com describes their bot works.</p>
<p>About</p>
<p>SMMRY (pronounced SUMMARY) was created in 2009 to summarize articles and text.</p>
<p>SMMRY's mission is to provide an efficient manner of understanding text, which is done primarily by reducing the text to only the most important sentences. SMMRY accomplishes its mission by:</p>
<p>• Ranking sentences by importance using the core algorithm.</p>
<p>• Reorganizing the summary to focus on a topic; by selection of a keyword.</p>
<p>• Removing transition phrases.</p>
<p>• Removing unnecessary clauses.</p>
<p>• Removing excessive examples.</p>
<p>The core algorithm works by these simplified steps:</p>
<p>1) Associate words with their grammatical counterparts. (e.g. &quot;city&quot; and &quot;cities&quot;)</p>
<p>2) Calculate the occurrence of each word in the text.</p>
<p>3) Assign each word with points depending on their popularity.</p>
<p>4) Detect which periods represent the end of a sentence. (e.g &quot;Mr.&quot; does not).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are algorithms based on statistical analysis. Basically words are counted and the count equals a certain weight. Sentences with a high weight are deemed more important. Common words like &quot;the&quot; or &quot;and&quot; are usually excluded by blacklist. There are further improvements such as increasing the weight of words after &quot;enhancers&quot;, words that increase the importance, for example &quot;especially&quot; or &quot;in particular&quot;. Google &quot;LexRank&quot; for an example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see you have 9 comments, so maybe this was already answered, but my browser says &quot;there's nothing here&quot; so I'm not sure what's going on.</p>
<p>The short explanation is that it looks for word frequencies.  My understanding is that it first vectorizes the article, i.e., makes a bin in a list for every word in the article.  It then adds up the number of times each word occurs, and puts that number in the word's specific bin.</p>
<p>Once it has the total word count vector, it goes again through each paragraph, and calculates a score.  Basically, the paragraphs (or sentences) with the most words with the highest scores get put into the auto-tldr text.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
