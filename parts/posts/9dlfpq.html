		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Source: I am an aircraft design engineer from the same company that built the F-104. </p>
<p>The interesting thing about the F-104 is not that it has especially small wings, but rather that it has especially <em>thin</em> wings. </p>
<p>These thin wings were an early solution to the problem of something called “transonic drag rise”. Effectively, this is a phenomenon where the drag of an airplane increases rapidly as it approaches the speed of sound , even more so than you would expect. This problem gave birth to the term “sound barrier”, where early attempts to fly faster than the speed of sound seemed to hit a “wall” in the sky before they could reach supersonic speeds. </p>
<p>Interestingly, it was discovered that thin wings greatly reduce this problem. The F-104 used this solution in order to become one of the worlds first supersonic interceptor aircraft. </p>
<p>The reason it looks so different than fighter jets today is because we (and by “we” I mean “the Germans”) came up with a much better solution: sweeping the wing. This is better because a swept wing is actually lighter than a thin wing, and achieves the same effect. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here are <a href="http://imgur.com/a/SxrKYLx" target="_blank">some pictures</a> I took right now of the F-104 near my house in Burbank, CA. I know it doesn't answer your question OP but I thought you might want some pics of it up close. Fun fact: they used the F-104's intake design and modified it to use on the U-2 spy plane.</p>
<p>If you want more I can always take some more.. It's very close..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The F-104 does <strong><strong><em>NOT</em></strong></strong> have small wings. It is a very deceptive looking aircraft.</p>
<p>An F-104 has 200 sq ft of wing area for a 6 ton plane. An F-15 by comparison has 600 sq ft of wing area for an 18 ton plane. A 747-400 has 5600 sq ft of wing area for a 180 ton plane.</p>
<p>So a 747-400 a jumbo jet has smaller wings than the F-104 relative to the weight they carry.</p>
<p>The F-104 is just a full sized jet engine with parts from a 1/3rd scale plane attached to it. If you remove the engine and cockpit there is very little else to the aircraft.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Drag due to lift is unimportant at high dynamic pressure, so span can be reduced without much drag penalty at high speed. Landing performance penalties can be mitigated with boundary layer control flaps; outside the pattern, <em>speed is life</em> anyway. </p>
<p>Wing weight is driven by span, due to bending &amp; torsion, so reducing span saves weight. </p>
<p>Low thickness-to-chord ratio reduces wave drag, as does sharp leading edges. This allows a straight wing, which is light. </p>
<p>Wrapping the minimum aircraft around the J79 results in maximum performance at reasonable cost. </p>
<p>An unintended bonus of high span loading &amp; low aspect ratio is gentle gust response, which allowed Lockheed to sell the same basic vehicle concept as a low level strike aircraft. (<em>It would have been better if they’d replaced the downward firing ejector seat at this point.</em>)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
