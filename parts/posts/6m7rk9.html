		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way scars heal is different than the formation of regular skin. The wound is filled with a dense connective tissues and elastic tissues that creates a scar. It does not have the same layers as normal skin  which are epithelial tissue and will never grow into regular skin. I have had a scar on my knee for 22 years that still looks the exact same, just a little lighter in color. The body does this in order to further protect the damaged area. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With small wounds, the nearby cells can replicate and grow to fill in the gap. This is a normal process of healing for small scrapes, cuts, and other penetrating insults. </p>
<p>But with larger wounds, like deep gashes, lacerations, or punctures, there really isn't a way for the nearby cells to replicate to fill in the void. It's too big. So instead, the body tries to fill in the void with a mass of connective tissue instead of living cells. The connective tissue is composed of long biopolymers and structural proteins that overlap in sheets to re-connect the tissue and cover the wound. </p>
<p>This connective tissue in the scar is mechanically stronger than normal cells which makes the scar less likely to tear or get cut again. However, the skin on the edges of a scar don't have this benefit, and are actually more likely to tear because they're right on the boundary between healthy cell and connective tissue.</p>
<p>Where your skin is living and growing, the connective tissue is static. That's why it never really changes. It might shrink or fade very, very slowly (over the course of decades), but depending on the size of the scar, it won't ever go away completely. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Figuratively speaking, they already have. Scar tissue is the body's spackle. It's a different structure than skin which permanently replaces the area's coverage. There's nothing to heal because the area is already patched roughly and functionally according to the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all a matter of priorities.</p>
<p>Somee animals heal without scars.  One of the best examples is the Axolotl, which can regrow limbs, and even solid organs.</p>
<p>Small mammals, especially rodents heal with minimal scarring.</p>
<p>Larger animals, especially mammals scar.  This is because we have evolutionarily prioritised healing sounds quickly to prevent infection, over scarless healing.  </p>
<p>Similarly, an embryo, and an early foetus can heal without scar.</p>
<p>Many things seen to contribute, including:</p>
<p>Wound tension - embryonic skin (and those of small mammals such as rodents) have much less skin tension.  Tension across a wound stimulates formation of fibroblasts from stem cells, which ultimately lead to scar tissue.  It also leads to further differentiation to myofibroblasts, which contract and shrink the wound, making it smaller (and therefore healing quicker)</p>
<p>Neutrophils - animals that heal without scar seem to have a much more macrophage driven wound milieu.  Again this goes back to infection resistance, especially to bacterial infection.  Both cell types are phagocytes, but macrophages have a much more complicated role beyond eating bugs.  This is also part of the reason infected wound healing with worse scars than clean wound</p>
<p>The way the wound is closed (or not closed) plays an important role.  If the wound is directly in contact with the other side (such as a surgically sutured wound - healing by primary intension) it will heal with less scar than a wound that is left open (healing by secondary intension), such as a burn or an infected wound.</p>
<p>There are examples of larger mammals healing without scar (the largest I am aware of is deer antlers), and this is an area of research to identify ways to manipulate scarring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty good answers here already, I'll add just a bit more:</p>
<p>All wounds scar. Every one of them.
But then why can see a scar due to an accident but not a scar in a surgically incised wound after a few weeks? </p>
<p>Well, our entire body is covered by Langer's Lines.
These are the direction in which the collagen in the skin is arranged and deposited, and regrows if damaged. </p>
<p>Cutting along (parallel) to these lines leads to less scarring and if the suturing along it is done well, almost none can be seen after a few months. </p>
<p>If however the wound is haphazard or goes across these lines (perpendicular or any other non-parallel way), or not sutured along these lines, the collagen deposits in a way that the scar is very evident, sometimes persistent for life. </p>
<p>In short, a scar cannot heal, its already the healed form of a wound. </p>
<p>Wounds scar depending on how they are inflicted with respect to Langer's lines. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
