		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This request is in response to a report that the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (the U.S. top nutrition advisory panel) is going to reverse 40 years of warning about certain cholesteral intake (such as from eggs). Moreover, in recent years, there has been a dramatic reversal away from certain pre-conceived notions -- such as these panels no longer recommending straight counting calories/fat (and a realization that not all calories/fat are equal). Then there's the carbohydrate purge/flip-flop. And the continued influence of lobbying/special interest groups who fund certain studies. Even South Park did an episode on gluten.</p>
<p>Few things affect us as personally and as often as what we ingest, so these various guidelines/recommendations have innumerable real world consequences. Are nutritionists/researchers just getting better at science/observation of the effects of food? Are we trending in the right direction at least?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first commentor has it spot on but I would definitely like to double down on the notion that the science is young.  It definitely is, we learn new things every day.  When it comes to our bodies there is still a lot we don't know and sometimes we find out that certain cells interact with certain things in ways we didn't realize before.  For example my first year of college I took anatomy and phyisology, after the first semester had ended we had to buy a new version of the textbook because some cutting edge genetic information had just been solidified and it was important to our understanding of the body.  This filters out into the other sciences as well.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes we perform long-term studies that take many years to realize that what we are using/doing is harmful.  Take asbestos as an example.  We used to use it in <em>everything</em> because it was cheap, flame resistant, and had many many other properties that were desirable.  It was until much later that we realized that asbestos caused a good deal many health defects in humans and so had to complete revise construction techniques and methods.  This also applies to things like nutrition, we find things out after studying long-term effects that don't match with what we already know and have to change it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food studies scholar here. It mainly depends on where culture stands at the time. If people think that certain things are clean and that health is defined a certain way, then dietary advice will follow. </p>
<p>Take bread for example: brown bread used to be considered the stuff peasants ate and it wasn't healthful. In the middle of the 20th century, people thought that white foods were cleaner and therefore healthier. Now, white bread, white rice, and white sugar have been abandoned in favor of brown bread, brown rice, and raw sugar. Peasant foods are now good for you. </p>
<p>New science also changes things. As we learn more about how the human body works, we can better judge how food affects the body. Brown fat, for example, did not exist in the imagination in the 19th century, when moderation and bland foods were put forth as better for the body. </p>
<p>There are also powerful lobbyists who make their case. Using scientific studies (that they may or may not have funded) they petition to shape how we think about food at the level of public policy. </p>
<p>This scholar has a lot to say about the matter: <a href="http://www.foodpolitics.com/books/" target="_blank">http://www.foodpolitics.com/books/</a>. Marion Nestle's book is at the bottom of the list and is quite thorough in its study of how food policy and public stances on nutrition are shaped--and by whom. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One additional issue is that nutrition is difficult to study in a controlled fashion. First, unlike testing a drug, where you can give the control group a placebo and the experimental group the active drug, you cannot give a control group no/placebo food. You have to replace the food you are trying to get experimental data on with some other food. </p>
<p>Want to test the effects of eating saturated fats? You have to create a control diet that replaces those calories with something else (or you run into another experimental problem where a lower-calorie diet may be producing the results you see), and it's impossible to know the full extent of what replacing those calories does. Do you replace them with unsaturated fats? Carbohydrates?</p>
<p>Diets also tend to be very heterogeneous. This can be a problem when people like to compare population-level data (epidemiological study rather than a controlled study). People looked at the &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot; and saw people eating more monounsaturated (and some polyunsaturated) fats, but they tended to ignore MANY confounding factors, even things that probably have a significant impact like eating more whole foods rather than processed foods and even differences in total calories. Scientists don't tend to set up highly controlled studies where people all eat the same foods, but rather eat whatever they want (or what they are supposed to eat/avoid) and then report back occasionally, with varying degrees of accuracy.</p>
<p>Early research on fats didn't treat trans-fats as a separate category and lumped them in with saturated fats, which may have helped create stigma against saturated fats (although there were a lot of political headaches that go into this history).</p>
<p>Finally, different organisms handle different foods and macronutrients differently! Yet people (especially media reporting a new study) will often take results from a mouse study as if it applies equally to humans or other animals. </p>
<p>TL;DR nutrition is complex, heterogeneous, and difficult to control in large experiments, forcing us to rely on less rigorous methods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I studied nutrition for several years before veering off into archaeology. I still have my textbook Nutrition: Concepts and Controversies, and it's that second one you want to focus on. </p>
<p>The biggest Achilles heel in nutrition science is politics. Take the case of beef. Several decades ago the (I believe) USDA came right out and said &quot;eat less red meat,&quot; in response to sound science, and the beef lobby sued like crazy. The revised advice became &quot;reduce intake of lipid-rich proteins,&quot; which is nicely innocuous and also applies equally well to PEANUTS. </p>
<p>The fact is the science is still very, very young, and meanwhile the politics of food have deep roots. Every time a new study that's both innovative and objective actually gets funded <em>and</em> published it's a goddamn miracle, and that'll be even more true in the next several years. So food officials jump on those studies like lions on a fat gazelle, and that's why things get massively shaken up from time to time. </p>
<p>TL;DR - nutrition is a very new science and food is highly politicized, so new information will almost always be pretty game-changing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What pisses me off is the food pyramid went from <a href="http://blogs-images.forbes.com/michaelpellmanrowland/files/2016/11/USDA_Food_Pyramid.gif?" target="_blank">horizontal rows of foods</a> and the portions they recommend to <a href="https://www.disabled-world.com/artman/uploads/newfoodpyramid.jpg" target="_blank">vertical wedges</a> of those same proportions.</p>
<p>The only reason a pyramid was chosen was because it's wide at the base and narrow at the top. So the foods you are supposed to have more of are at the bottom and the foods you are supposed to have less of are at the top. By making it into vertical wedges, you defeat the whole point of having a fucking pyramid. It could be the food square, a food circle or a food icosagon if you're just going to negate the shape of the overall object and divide it into unequal wedges. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
