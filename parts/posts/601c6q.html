		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Needing to urinate is something which can be suppressed by the sympathetic (fight or flight) nervous system activity, or becomes more obvious when parasympathetic (rest and digest) nervous system activity predominates.</p>
<p>Exercising shifts the balance towards the sympathetic nervous system. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Doing the “potty dance” helps alleviate the urge to urinate.</p>
<p>plausible</p>
<p>For a control test, Grant, Tori, and Kari began with empty bladders and each person drank 2 liters of water. They continued their normal daily activity and measured how long they could wait before urinating. Tory was able to last 1 hr 57 min; Grant, 1 hr 58 min; and Kari, 2 hr 40 min.</p>
<p>They repeated the procedure the next day, but this time attempted to dance and move around to help them combat the urge to pee. In this test, Tory lasted 1:31, Grant 1:51, and Kari 2:47.</p>
<p>On the third day, the procedure was again repeated and this time each person attempted to relax as much as possible both physically and mentally. Tory lasted 2:05, Grant 2:46, and Kari 2:43.</p>
<p>After noting that the results of each method can vary widely from person to person, the team called this myth plausible.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seems like this could possibly be related to gate control theory: your body/nerves have trouble processing more than one type of stimulus, so a neutral stimulus occupies the &quot;gate&quot; and prevents noxious stimuli from reaching your brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think another major reason has to do with where the bladder is in your abdomen. It's located immediately behind where your two hips come together, so when you sit, the angle between your hips and your spine is less and you're squishing your bladder. This extra pressure is relieved when you stand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
