		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, particles can't decay.</p>
<p>If you take the limit where the speed of light goes to infinity, but you keep <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_invariance" target="_blank">&quot;Galilean relativity&quot;</a> (the notion of relativity we'd been using before special relativity), a very large change occurs at the level of elementary particle physics.  </p>
<p>In particular, there's a theorem that allows you to classify what kind of states you can have in a quantum mechanical theory given the symmetries of your system. If you apply the symmetries associated with special relativity, you find that states &quot;look like&quot; particles - they're characterized by a mass and a spin, massless particles move at the speed of light, and particles can be created and destroyed. You can also define the &quot;chirality&quot; of particles.</p>
<p>In contrast, if you use the symmetries associated with just Galilean relativity, some of this changes. First, you have no massless particles, and everything must be massive. Second, chirality goes away, though spin is still there. Most drastically, you cannot have any particle decays - every particle must be infinitely stable. So a non-relativistic quantum theory of particle physics is extremely different from a relativistic one like our universe, where everything but the least massive particles decay very quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I can think of is dark skies at night. If light traveled instantaneously, there's would be no limit to the observable universe. All the light created would reach earth the instance it was created (not sure if it would be red shifted at those speeds), making the sky much brighter. The amount would depend on how much there is past the current observable universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
