		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like many of the top commenters have said so far, &quot;libido&quot; is the cause of many different things.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a major factor. Drugs and activities whichc change the regulation of dopamine will alter libido. Dopamine agonists (pramiprexole), dopamine reuptake inhibitors (wellbutrin, cocaine, methamphetamine) will all cause increases in reward seeking behavior including but not limited to libido. Dopamine blockers such as antipsychotics are often considered libido killers.</p>
<p>Dopamine is counter-regulated by prolactin which is released after male ejaculation, so increases in prolactin cause dopamine and libido to drastically fall off. The other name for dopamine is prolactin inhibiting hormone, or PIH. Males who are able to ejaculate multiple times in a row with no refractory period tend to have a reduced production of or response to prolactin.</p>
<p>Testosterone is a huge factor in libido for men and women. Testosterone acts as a neuromodulator and potentiates dopamineric activation of the sex drive. Interestingly, testosterone is decreased in men after drinking alcohol and increased in women.</p>
<p>Cholinergic function can also play a part. Anticholinergics can cause sexual dysfunction, acetylcholinesterates inhibitors can increase sexual function. The mechanism is thought to have something to do with activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>Many people mention SSRIs. Since dopamine is generally excitatory and serotonin is generally inbihitory within the brain, it would make sense that SSRIs inhibit sexual function. The longer-term sexual side effects that come with SSRIs like post-SSRI sexual dysfunction probably have more to do with downregulations of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of dopamine in the brain.</p>
<p>There are a whole host of other psychopharmacological factors, but there are physical factors too.</p>
<p>Aerobic exercise increases heart rate, which in turn causes the body to produce vasodilators to reduce blood pressure. This causes better circulation which leads to more blood flow to the genitals and makes it easier to become aroused. If your body produces enough of these vasodilators, one of the main vasodilators, nitric oxide, can cause even more increased blood flow to the genitals. Nitric oxide is what ultimately gets altered from the use of viagra.</p>
<p>Anaerobic exercise can do the same thing through the vasodilation mechanism. It also tends to boost testosterone. I'd imagine that the cascade of events which causes muscle to be built also includes some other things helpful to sex drive (BDNF, other growth factors).</p>
<p>Erection is mediated by oxytocin in the brain which activates the appropriate spinal nerves. If there are problems or alterations in the function of oxytocin then this can impact erection.</p>
<p>PC muscle and bulbospongiosus tone/size/strength are also important factors. You can easily increase this with PC exercises. They are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kegel_exercise" target="_blank">Kegel exercises</a> and the pubococcygeus (PC) muscle is the main target. The more space is taken up by those muscles, it seems the less blood flow it would require to cause any given level of arousal.</p>
<p>High doses of vitamin C can cause increases in arousal, but those are probably mediated by increases in norepinephrine which increases blood pressure, causing vasodilation in response. Other little things such as stimulant based asthma medicines likely have the same effect.</p>
<p>There's also the Coolidge effect, i.e., the effect of novelty on sex drive. Sex drive goes up dramatically with the addition of new partners and can take a dive with the same partner over time.</p>
<p>The quality and quantity of both sleep and food will have dramatic impacts on your sex drive as well.</p>
<p>Excitation in the brain tends to increase sex drive. Inhibition tends to decrease it. This explains some of the effects of trainquilizers (GABA-A allosteric modifiers) on sex drive, as well as the effects of changes in progesterone, an allosteric modifier of the GABA-A receptor in women, across the menstrual cycle and its effect on sex drive.</p>
<p>Many of these factors are altered in men vs. women.</p>
<p>Then add in the psychological factors and people's life histories. The mind can change almost any reaction of the body. It gets very complicated very quick.</p>
<p><strong>To answer your question</strong> There are a lot of different factors that cause or are associated with libido changes. These neurochemical and lifestyle factors are dramatically different among different people. If you are having trouble with your libido, it could be any one of these factors or a host of others. Maximizing all of them is likely to make you insatiably horny all the time, minimizing all of them is likely to make you about as horny as a eunich,</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well it can be connected to sex hormones but that isn't the entire story. I take medication that kills my libido but I have normal sex hormone levels.</p>
<p>From what I've seen hypersexuality manifests in several situations that would indicate that dopamine is a major factor in libido.  </p>
<p>1) People who abuse methamphetamine become hypersexual , methamphetamine being a powerful dopamine releaser. In long term abusers the symptoms become difficult to distinguish from psychosis and the treatment for the acute phase is a D2 antagonist.  </p>
<p>2) You see hypersexuality in people in the manic phase of Bipolar Type 1 along with other compulsive, disinhibited activity such as excessive gambling .  D2 antagonists are the treatment of choice for the acute phase of Bipolar Type 1 until connection to reality returns at which point Lithium is the treatment of choice.</p>
<p>3) You see hypersexuality  and excessive gambling in Parkinson's patients who take dopamine agonists like pramipexole.   </p>
<p>So although Dopamine may not be the whole picture, clearly libido is enhanced by various drugs and conditions which are dopaminergic. So normal libido would be connected with normal functioning of domaminergic neurons.  </p>
<p>The most likely suspect in low libido would be depression. And up until lately most drugs have been targeting serotonin. However sexual side effects are notorius among the SSRI drugs. Now many psychiatrists will prescribe Ritalin, a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, for sexual dysfunction. Or give Wellbutrin which is a weak dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Or give a drug like Effexor  which is a serotonoin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and weakly a dopamine reuptake inhibitor.  </p>
<p>So again it would seem the picture points to dopamine involvement in low libido. and interestingly, one of the drugs on the cutting edge of treating depression is ketamine. Which is a complex drug but does act as an agonist at the D2 receptor. The mechanism of it's antidepressant effect however is unknown.  </p>
<p>As an addendum it should be noted that stimulants such as cocaine or methamphetamine although they may stimulate libido, they also inhibit erections. Gingko Biloba is natural form of Viagra to remedy this or you can go with the real thing, Cialis or Viagra.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been studying the mechanics of this a lot recently. Libido is a function of the brain and spinal cord. The mechanisms of sexual drive and behaviour are studied primarily in rodents however, so this has to be extrapolated to humans. Since humans have all of the same brain regions, the systems are assumed to be similar in most animals, but keep in mind that we don't even have the whole picture in rodents just yet.</p>
<p>Arousal is generated in part by nerve cells (neurons) in the lower spinal cord. These form a network called the ejaculation generator, and these become excited both by hormone levels and sexual stimulation. When ejaculation is triggered, this system will both control the muscular movements associated with orgasm and will also send a &quot;satisfied&quot; signal to the brain which negatively regulates libido thereafter. Oppositely, it's assumed that the ejaculation generator also sends signals of arousal to the brain which motivate sexual behaviour, though this mechanism has not been identified yet.</p>
<p>Libido is also the product of brain systems. These brain systems send signals down the spinal cord to the ejaculation generator, exciting it and increasing arousal levels. The brain region responsible for this is the hypothalamus (primarily the ventromedial hypothalamus and the medial preoptic area, which is larger in males than females due to testosterone production in males).</p>
<p>Serotonin is one chemical that the brain uses to modify the activity of the spinal cord. In men and women excess serotonin (from taking SSRI's like Paxil) tends to lower libido - this is thought to be in part because Serotonin inhibits the ejaculation generator. Curiously in rodents, drugs activating the Serotonin Receptor 1A excite males but not females. This suggests that there are fundamental differences in the brain structures of male and female sexuality.</p>
<p>Now for the last bit ... why does it vary so much between people? In my opinion, the nitty gritty of the brain &amp; spinal cord mechanisms simply haven't been worked out yet to provide an acceptable answer. We know very little, so we have very little to go on. Maybe a psychologist could give more insight into what other personality traits co-exist with high or low libido.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here and I want to clarify a point of confusion in a lot of these threads. </p>
<p>Libido and the ability to have an erection are two different things. </p>
<p>I have plenty of male patients who cannot achieve an erection but have tons of libido. The opposite is also true. Many men can have erections but lack interest in sex. </p>
<p>Very roughly, libido is more a product of neurochemistry while erection is a product physiology. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a 41 year old heterosexual divorced white male. I suffer from low libido, depression with anxiety, high blood pressure, and sleep apnea.  All of these conditions can effect the sex drive and like some bad cosmic joke, each other.  </p>
<p>My testosterone, however, is completely in the normal range.  I tried testosterone patches and became a very irritable guy with headaches and a short temper.  It had zero effect on my sex drive. </p>
<p>When I am able to get a good night's sleep with my apnea machine a few nights in a row, it makes some difference, I can tell because I have sex related dreams and erections (morning wood).  This rules out a plumbing problem, though I have been to a Urologist just to confirm it.  It does little for my low sex drive. </p>
<p>I have spent almost a decade trying to find the right combination of anti-depressants and blood pressure  medicines to bring back any sort of libido and I am still looking.  I seem to have had the 'best results' with a combination of Wellbutrin XL (anti-depressant, but that can cause anxiety as a side effect) and Paxil (anti-anxiety/anti-depressant), and  Paxil which helps with the libido somewhat but is notorious for causing anorgasmia (difficulty reaching orgasm).  </p>
<p>This is where the blood pressure comes into play. I take Lisinopril, which treats my high blood pressure (runs in the family and is exacerbated by my sleep apnea) but effects the ability to sustain erections long enough to have a chance to reach orgasm.  Paxil can make that take a long time.  This worked out in my favor when I was 22, now it is just frustrating, tedious, and troubles my very patient yet somewhat insecure girlfriend (caused by past relationships, I make it very clear that it is my problem and definitely not something she is doing wrong). </p>
<p>I say all of that because I am uniquely aware of the difference between the depression (a possibly debilitating mental illness that can be chronic), erectile dysfunction (which is related to various combinations of cardiovascular factors and hormone levels, and low libido (which is neuro-chemical in nature). </p>
<p>My current status is this: depression, treated; blood pressure, relatively controlled with medication; sleep apnea, getting better as I slowly lose weight (around 27 BMI currently); libido, almost non-existent.</p>
<p>What is it like to have no sex drive? It sucks. I love my girlfriend, she has a healthy sex drive for a 29 year old. I feel awful that my indifference to sex makes her self-conscious.  I am very honest with her  and that it has nothing to do with her. </p>
<p>I am currently trying alternatives to Paxil but they seem to only have made things worse.  I predict that my best choice is to return to Paxil which would at least bring back some level of my libido so that she can at least experience a more healthy sex life than what I am currently capable of giving her. She will just need to accept that my difficulty reaching orgasm has nothing to do with how I feel about her. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Libido, attraction, erections, relationships, and sexual performance can be complicated and often separate factors in sexual health. They can be caused by many different medical conditions and treatments.  Also, having no libido sucks, no pun intended. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
