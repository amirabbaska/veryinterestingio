		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Math is like a toolbox. Trying to describe parts of nature without math is like building a house with your bare hands. It can be done, but will take a very long time. </p>
<p>For both integrals and differentials it has historically been a matter of making calculations smarter, the same way tools have become smarter over time.</p>
<p><strong>Integrals:</strong></p>
<p>Say you're an ancient egyptian and want to build a house, and that particular house needs a curved gable. Naturally you want to know how much material you'll need for this gable. </p>
<p>An initial guess could be that you take the height of the gable, multiply by the width and divide by 2 to get the amount of material (similar to a triangular gable). But you quickly realize that this is not a very good approximation. </p>
<p>You then get the idea that you could divide each side of the triangle into very small parts, in the process getting closer to the shape of the gable by essentially &quot;rounding&quot; it. If you keep doing this you get to point where each part of your approximation of the gable is infinitely small. This is integration in a nut shell. </p>
<p>Say your gable can be described by the formula: f(x) = -x^2 + 2x.</p>
<p>Then the initial guess would give Area = (1*2)/2 = 1</p>
<p>Using integrals you get Area = ∫ (0 to 2) -x^2 + 2x = -8/3 + 4 ≈ 1,33</p>
<p>This is a simple example, but this could very well be how integrals first was applied in Ancient Egypt. No one knows for certain who first came up with the idea of trying to use infinitely small parts to calculate an area.</p>
<p><strong>Differentials:</strong></p>
<p>Like integrals, differentials are, simply put, a way of doing things smarter. </p>
<p>Differentials come from the idea that you want to measure the slope of something. </p>
<p>At first you might consider subtracting end and beginning to get the difference. But if you don't work with something that is a straight line, this will not tell you what the slope is at any point. To do this you have to divide that something into many parts, and now you can subtract two parts next to each other to get the slope there. The more parts you use the more precise it gets. </p>
<p><strong>Limits:</strong></p>
<p>Limits in the context of integrals and differentials are the concept of using smaller and smaller parts until you get to parts that infinitely close to each other. </p>
<p>Infinitely here just means as small as is necessary. If you for instance have the triangular shaped gable mentioned in <strong>Integrals</strong> it wouldn't make any sense to make parts smaller than each upper side of the triangle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An extremely brief summary would be like this:</p>
<p>If you look at the parabola y=x^2 +1 plotted on a graph, you'll notice that its not a straight line. </p>
<p>At first we looked at the average rate of change, e.g. if you look at the average rate of change between (0,1) and (10,101), we average a change of 10 units in y per unit change in x.</p>
<p>the formula for this was (f(x+h) - f(x))/((x+h)-x) where above, x = 0, h = 10. If we choose a smaller h, or a negative h, we can still determine this value. However, if we choose h = 0, we get 0/0, which does not equal zero, but we don't know what it is since we divide by zero. </p>
<p>So what if we choose something infinitely small for h, which is basically zero, what is that rate of change. What is the rate of change at that instant, or the instantaneous rate of change for x.</p>
<p>So if we plug that formula in with y= x^2 + 1, we find that it equals 2x. So the instantaneous rate of change at x is 2x for any point on that parabola. This is the basic premise for all derivatives is calculating the instantaneous rate of change for all points. </p>
<p>So there, we had to use limits to get around dividing by zero by dividing by almost zero, and we found derivatives.  </p>
<p>To come up with integrals, we used process similar to the following. If we traveled with velocity of 5m/s for 10 seconds, how far did we travel. Well if we graph velocity, and look at the area under that constant line of 5, we find 50 m/s*s or 50m which we know is correct. But what if we were not travelling at a constant velocity. well the logic still holds that its the area under the curve of velocity.</p>
<p>So if we use rectangles, one unit wide, each at the height of the velocity at the start of the rectange, we can approximate the distance. By using smaller rectangles, we can get a better guess. But what if we use Infinity rectangles, our guess would be perfect. So an integral is shorthand for the limit as we take an inifinite number of rectangles up to the curve from one point to another point, which happens to yield antiderivatives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, limits were used by Newton for calculus purposes without knowing for sure that what he was doing was valid. Mathematicians didn't fully understand them for 150ish years when Weierstrass and Bolzano (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(%CE%B5,_%CE%B4)-definition_of_limit" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(%CE%B5,_%CE%B4)-definition_of_limit</a>) put them on solid footing. Newton got them right, but he was using them on &quot;easy&quot; functions so nothing strange came up.</p>
<p>Same thing happened when Euler discovered e^{\pi i} +1=0. Without justification, he used power series expansions of sine and cosine with complex numbers. The formula just popped out. Too good to not be true!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ancient Greeks had come up with the idea of infinitesimals, which are numbers so small that they can’t be measured. Essentially, they were mathematical placeholders. </p>
<p>The early inventors of calculus used infinitesimal changes in slope to define a function for slope along a curve (derivatives) and infinitesimal width rectangles to define a function for area under the curve (integrals.)</p>
<p>In the 1800s, mathematicians set about to define all of mathematics via rigorous proofs. When they got to infinitesimals, they could not find a way to work them into modern mathematics as they were essentially fudge factors. So they came up with the idea of a limit as a way to rigorously define infinitely small changes, and rewrote all of calculus to fit this new notation. </p>
<p>Then in the 20th century mathematicians finally found a way to rigorously define infinitesimals. But by that point limits were already the standard, so that’s the one that’s currently taught in schools. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
