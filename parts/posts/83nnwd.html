		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In geometry, regular polygons become closer to circles the more sides they have.  In that sense, you might say a circle is a regular polygon with an infinite number of sides.</p>
<p>Real world objects can be neither perfect circles or perfect regular polygons.  Eventually imperfections will crop up, at the molecular level, if not before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can somewhat define an ellipse/circle as a polygon with infinite sides. If by small scale you mean molecular, then essentially yes. Current models of molecular geometry are supported by experimental data. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In terms of what is practical to the user, it depends on what needs to be achieved. Requirements can be function, for example: a vector CAD package will increase the polygon side count based on the zoom to create the representation, otherwise it's really just a matter of how circular does it need to be and when does adding more faces diminish the addition's value.</p>
<p>In real terms: Arcs and circles are abstract concepts, they don't exist outwith theory and can only be defined functionally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Polygons in euclidean space become more circly and boring as you increase the sides. There really isn't any &quot;boundary&quot; to when a many-sided polygon becomes a circle. But more sides on a polygon means it approaches being a circle. Step on over to hyperbolic space (constant negative curvature), a polygon with an infinite number of sides can actually be tiled and it isn't a circle. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/H2_tiling_23i-1.png" target="_blank">Apeirogon</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

A point is a location with 0 diameter.   A line  has 0 width.a polygon has 0 height.     Physical manifestations in our world have all non zero dimensions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
