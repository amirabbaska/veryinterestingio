		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is because the drainage (lacrimal) duct is compressed from us screwing up our face, therefore your normal amount of lacrimal (eye) fluid cannot drain away and thus it overflows onto your face. This duct goes from the inner eye to the nose (thus why you get a runny nose when you cry). </p>
<p>In reply to the hormonal response, tears do contain endorphins that make you happier. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I asked my anatomy professor this exact question a year ago!</p>
<p>He said to think of laughter as a heightened parasympathetic response (opposite of flight or fight, sympathetic response). </p>
<p>It just so happens that cranial nerve VII innervates the pterygopalatine nerve ganglion which subsequently innervates the lacrimal gland...and surprise- cranial nerve VII contains parasympathetic nerves!</p>

<p>EDIT: Laughter is the toll booth operator that is so overwhelmed with stimulation (that deep, good-good laugh) he doesn't do his job and lets a wave of cars through (excess Parasympathetic stimulation). However, this same toll road goes to many places in the body (cranial nerve VII). This massive wave of cars is so dense that it causes traffic, and some cars can't get over to their exit in time. These cars that missed their exit ride the toll road all the way to Niagara Falls (Pterygopalatine nerve ganglion/Lacrimal Gland).</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Modified EDIT 1. As many others have accurately pointed out, I am atrocious at this but I'm sorry- I'm trying!! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For me, it's more than tearing up. If I laugh hard enough, like for something over-the-top hilarious, the laughter at some point switches  to actual crying. Strangest feeling ever. It's like I know I'm happy, but now I'm sobbing uncontrollably. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a doctor and probably shouldn't. </p>
<p>Tear ducts respond to stress and hormones. When I yawn big my tear ducts act up. I can fake cry. Coughing can cause it. As can getting things in your eye. </p>
<p>When crying from sadness, there is a hormonal release. Joy does the same thing. We can actually tell which is which because these hormones are present. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
