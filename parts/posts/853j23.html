		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the early 1900s, there were competing theories about what would happen if a sufficiently pure metal were lowered towards absolute zero. Some thought that the trend of lower resistance would continue all the way down, others that electrons would become immobile and resistance would increase towards absolute zero. Heike Kammerling-Onnes tried to test this using mercury, which was easier to purify than solid metals. He found something totally unexpected, that the resistance didn't just smoothly decrease, but that there was an abrupt drop to zero at around 4 kelvin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To summerise both of the current comment. There were guesses as to resistance would tend to either zero, or infinity as a continuous function.  </p>
<p>Experiment showed that it went to zero with a sudden drop from some value. </p>
<p>It was then a long time until a theory could be worked out as to why there was a sudden drop. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
