		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aged and really salty cheeses have very low water content (or are too salty), and basically everything requires water to live. If there's no water, there's no bacteria to spoil it. They will tend to continue aging and drying out, maybe growing a little mold where water can condense but not a lot. A chunk of parmesan can last a while. So really dry cheeses will not spoil very fast.</p>
<p>Cheeses have lots of living things in them, and they're cultured to grow it. These give characteristic flavors, along with the ingredients and environment. Some of these things, like the &quot;blue&quot; in blue cheeses, can kill or out-compete other organisms that want to eat it. They keep the food to themselves, and it will last quite a while. Blue cheeses tend to get more blue as they age.</p>
<p>Some grow protective molds on the outside. The white rind on brie protects the inside. And it's <em>completely alive</em>. If you cut out a wedge of brie and close it back up with the cut exposed, the rind will gradually seal over the missing wedge you removed.</p>
<p>And lastly, many other cheeses don't have much alive left in them (possibly even pasteurized or processed), or what's there cannot fight off invaders. They have enough moisture where all sorts of bread molds and random spores can take hold. These cheeses will grow hair and turn colors.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some cheeses are soft cheeses - mozzarella or ricotta for instance. These don't age. They just spoil because they have a fairly high moisture content. </p>
<p>Other cheeses are hard cheeses. Parmesean and cheddar for instance. These are made in such a way to lower the moisture content to minimal levels. Then you do the other things people mentioned like waxing or rinding, adding tons of salt or bacteria. Store them in cool, dry, clean areas, and there is little ambient bacteria can do to spoil it. As some one else mentioned, it goes bad in your fridge because fridges are filthy places. And you eat FOOD from it. Gross. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cheeses that &quot;age&quot; are, kind of, already spoiled. Some cheese are just coagulated milk, sometimes flavored or pressed. Others are preserved by being inoculated with bacteria and/or mold. These cheese are the ones that are aged; the microorganisms are not harmful to humans, and out-compete the ones that are harmful, rendering the cheese safe for long-term use. It's kind of like how kimchi or sauerkraut is fermented with lactic acid organisms, because they create an environment hostile to more dangerous microorganisms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
