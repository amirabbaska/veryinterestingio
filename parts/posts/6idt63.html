		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the first thing to understand is the instruction set in your DNA is called your genotype. The way you actually look and are is called your phenotype. Most of genetics study is about understanding the relationship between the genotype and phenotype.</p>
<p>Now some aspects of your phenotype are easily mapped to a single gene in your genotype. This is the easy part. But some characteristics of your phenotype are determined by not one but the combined action of multiple genes. And some aspects of your phenotype are not determined directly by the genotype at all.</p>
<p>For example, there is no gene for 'height'. There are multiple genes that together determine things like how large your bones are, how fast they can grow, how sensitive your body is to growth hormones, how efficiently you can use the food you eat etc. And then there is a final factor which is the environment - how much food and of what quality was available to you when your were growing.</p>
<p>Your height is the net effect of all these things. That is why, you can talk about people being <em>genetically predisposed</em> to being taller or shorter, but there is no way to predict exactly what height will be. Even if you had extremely detailed information about a person's genotype and exactly how the hundreds of involved genes will contribute in miniscule ways to affect height, the environmental factor still remains a variable.</p>
<p>PS: Eye color is also determined by multiple genes and is not as simple as you might think <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some good responses here. Just thought I'd add a few types of genes that make genetics more complex than a simple Punnett Square:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genes that code for proteins that help the cell replicate and perform its basic function (proteins involved in building bone, muscle, connective tissue, etc. that creates an increase in height)</li>
<li>Genes that code for proteins that regulate the activity or expression of other proteins (proteins that speed up or slow down the proteins creating muscle, bone, connective tissue, etc.)</li>
<li>Genes that code for proteins that regulate gene expression itself (proteins that attach to the DNA and speed up, slow down, or prevent DNA transcription of &quot;height&quot; genes entirely)</li>
<li>There are also segments of DNA, such as introns, which were once thought to be useless but now are believed to play an important role in gene expression and the shape of the DNA molecule itself (a slightly modified intron size near a &quot;height&quot; gene might make it more/less accessible and therefore more/less frequently expressed)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even for something as seemingly simple as eye color, there can be dozens if not hundreds of genes somehow involved in the production or regulation of eye pigments, and some of these genes may affect other processes as well. So instead of imagining a simple line of causality that connects a gene to a phenotype, imagine it as a web of interconnected genes that combine to form multiple phenotypes and affect each other in ways that aren't always easy to predict. It's not A --&gt; 1 but rather ABCDEFG --&gt; 123456789, with no way (yet) of knowing which one is causing what.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygene" target="_blank">polygenic traits</a>, and they're much more complicated than simple mendelian traits. In the simplest case, each gene acts independently of the others, which produces a nice bell curve like the first graph in that article. But it's also possible for genes to interact with each other, so two genes together might have more impact than the sum of the same two genes separately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't over simplify eye color either, saying the colors one eyes can be are hazel, green, blue and brown would be like saying the height one can be is short, average and tall. </p>
<p>Eye color and height both are determined by a good number of genes that we have already identified, but also likely very many others that we have not. The human genome has not been completely unraveled, but we are learning more as we continue to research.</p>
<p>To answer your question, we understand the variables that go into human height potential about as well as we understand those for eye color. They seem easy to understand at the macroscopic level because two parents with brown eyes quite often have brown eyed children, creating a kind of pattern we can recognize, but it is important to understand that these patterns are what we use to predict eye color, not some understanding of activated genes. But for the very reason you stated, there being a much more apparent lack of predictability with height, you would be had pressed to find a reputable geneticist willing to predict a patients height potential within a margin of less that maybe 6 inches.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add one thing to all of these fantastic responses: height isn't one thing, it is made up of the lengths of things. Usually, torso length stays about the same because organs need room and that can't vary a lot. Mostly height comes from the leg length as well as a tiny but from the torso. So height would come from femur length, tibia length, and fibula length as well as neck length, skull length and organ size (smaller organs will result in a smaller torso). That's one of the reasons why it's so difficult to predict height.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
