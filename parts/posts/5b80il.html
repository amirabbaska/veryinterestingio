However, this still doesn't explain to me why there's generally a very clearly defined flame, with sharp edges to it. Why wouldn't the glow of the oxidizing fuel (let's say, wood in a campfire) just glow in all directions equally, kind of like a red-hot piece of metal? What creates the appearance of the flame itself? </p></div></div>
