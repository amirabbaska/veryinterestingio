		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I saw this bit of a nature documentary about a penguin who goes marching off toward a mountain, away from the coast where all his penguin buddies hang out and occasionally go diving to eat fish. The narrator said the penguin was headed toward “certain death.” Which makes sense, what’s he going to eat? Is there anything at all in the interior of Antarctica away from the coast? It’s frozen all year round and most of the land is covered by glaciers. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Emperor penguins can survive and breed the furthest inland, but even that’s not very far. All noticeable life must stick to the coasts/peninsulas/islands. There are still microscopic extremophiles that can live anywhere and everywhere in Antarctica, but they’re pretty much pointless. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No there is not.  One day during lunch, we had just gotten a shipment of fresh vegetables (don't get those often).  In the lettuce was a tiny little bug, and it seriously stopped everything, everyone watched it walk around the gally. Also a skua once somehow got blown in from the coast but most people predicted it would die flying out.  No germs, no viruses, can only get sick if someone flying in brings germs.  Was an interesting place at the South Pole</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Specifically, on the  nunataks, exposed rocky tips of mountains that protrude above the glaciers.  These are home to a few species of charismatic microfauna like rotifers, nematodes, and (surprise surprise)  tardigrades.  </p>
<p>Here's a good article</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's nothing. Penguins aren't very bright, and they'll go wandering inland sometimes. Seals too. They sometimes make it 20-50 miles before they croak.</p>
<p>We have seen lost skuas at the geographic South Pole. They're the only animal known to make it there on their own, and they probably die shortly after arrival. Tough birds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
