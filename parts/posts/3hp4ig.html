		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I was playing around on Excel, and I copied the formula =randbetween(1,2) into 1,000,000 cells. I then summed the total number of 1's and total number of 2's and found the difference.</p>
<p>I refreshed the formulae and the 2nd time the difference was 0, meaning there were exactly 500,000 1s and 500,000 2s. I then carried on refreshing the formula and the difference didn't come out at 0 for quite a while, but was always between -2,500 and +2,500.</p>
<p>This got me thinking - is there a probability of this difference being exactly 0? How would it be possible to work it out, and is there a name for this kind of probability?</p></div></div>
