		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit - a lot of posts on here are saying that there is an evolutionary advantage to having an animal scream out because it warns the other members of the tribe, and, though it may lead to the animal being killed, it's better for the tribe as a whole. </p>
<p>I'm fairly sure that can't be true. Evolution only works in the interests of the individual, not the group (at least, not if it means sacrificing the individual). Evolution is about passing on your genes to the next generation. That's all it is. If the individual dies, they can't pass them on. That's survival of the fittest. True - screaming out may help the tribe, but if it leads to those genes dying, they don't get passed on.</p>
<p>Editing my edit - apparently I'm wrong. Some know-it-all named Richard Dawkins wrote a book about how sometimes evolution can work for the interests of the group rather than the individual. Learned something new. That's what I love about reddit.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are communal animals. Screaming alerts the rest of the tribe to the danger. It may or may not save the injured individual, but it definitely helps the group as a whole. Since genes are what matters, not individual survival, behavior that makes other close relatives more likely to survive is more likely to get passed on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I didn't see a very high level post addressing this but being under attack isn't the only time we cry out.  Imagine you get injured in a ditch or between rocks or something.  Crying out loudly will more likely get you saved than a more quiet response.  Same with a predator attack if you're around other armed humans.  You will be more likely to survive if you get help fast.  Food for thought.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know with puppies and kittens,  they learn how to coexist peacefully by responding to their parents' and littermates' cries.  Puppies and kittens who are separated from their litters too early often have issues recognizing other animals (and even people's) boundaries.  So when a puppy is playing with its littermate and bites too hard,  the other pup squeals to let him know that it's inappropriate play.  Obviously this doesn't quite fit for instances where the animal is being attacked,  but it is still an important function of communicating pain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm seeing a lot about &quot;alerting the tribe&quot; but it's worth remembering how jarring a scream can be. &quot;Startling&quot; is a common mechanism in nature to scare off predators. Additionally, it doesn't have to be either/or.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing you want to do is alert everyone else. One of two things will happen, which is either that the other humans come and save you, or they run and at least some of the tribe survives. Same with other animals. If one deer makes noise when bitten it might scare off the predator, and it also lets the other deer in the area GTFO so that they can live.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
