		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest part of this is that the government will accept payment of taxes in US dollars. That will usually be enough to get people using whatever the government takes for tax payments. Especially if nobody's printing anything else.</p>
<p>People in East Timor, and the government, can buy and sell U.S. dollars like anyone else. The US doesn't really have any interest in stopping them from doing so, and I'm not sure if they could if they tried.</p>
<p>For a very young country like East Timor, especially given the fragile state of its economy, there's some real benefits to using dollars as their currency: you don't have to ride the rocky currents of inflation and deflation as the markets try to figure out what the heck your money is actually worth. They can get outside lenders more easily, who know they'll be paid back in dollars, not a local currency that could have a very different value in ten years.</p>
<p>It's not without risk, though: American monetary policy does not consider the needs of East Timor, and so the US could tighten up the supply of dollars at a time when Timor needs a looser policy, or vice versa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many nations do this actually.  The US dollar is a highly stable currency that's unlikely to experience significant inflation or dramatic swings in exchange rates.  Taking the local government's currency controls away makes it impossible for corrupt/inexperienced officials to manipulate the monetary supply and cause a Venezuela/Zimbabwe style inflationary death spiral.</p>
<p>It also makes it much easier to do business with US companies and government agencies.  The US is often the largest single trade partner for nations that adopt the USD currency.</p>
<p>If you can get your hands on enough actual paper money to run the local economy many smaller nations go with the US dollar for the extreme stability it provides.</p>
<p>The downside is that you lose a lot of economic control.  Inflation and interest rates are dictated to you from the US and they may not be what's best for a developing nation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's nothing to prevent a country from using any foreign currency it wants. All it needs to do is acquire enough of the particular foreign currency. The upside is they don't have to pay to print the money. And if they use US currency, it'll be fairly stable. The downside is they have no control over the value of the currency. The US government can take measures to raise or diminish the value of the dollar for economic benefit. But other countries that use the US dollar (like East Timor) can't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same way that, assuming you're in the US, you do. Accept and make financial transactions in dollars - just declare that that's official rather than doing it on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis. Doesn't take any more than that.</p>
<p>The challenge with being a minnow using someone else's currency is that you have no control over it; your own national economy and policies are highly unlikely to affect its value. And in theory, if it tanks, your economy could go with it. The dollar has historically, been strong enough and stable enough for people in plenty of countries to be happy to take that risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p><a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2000/01/timo-j31.html" target="_blank">https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2000/01/timo-j31.html</a></p>
<p>In short, Timor was occupied by Indonesia from 1975 to 2000. After eventually gaining independence, a UN transition government set their official currency to USD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) announced last Monday that the US dollar would be the official currency of the former Portuguese colony and Indonesian territory. As a result, government transactions must be conducted in dollars for at least the two to three years of UNTAET's expected rule.</p>
<p>Private contracts may still be executed in any currency, but civil service wages, taxes and other payments owed to any public authority must be in US dollars. The former official currency, the Indonesian rupiah, may be used to make such payments temporarily, subject to a yet-to-be-determined transaction fee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Timor depends on foreign aid and their oil exports, both of which are in USD, so this decision is rather practical. They are moving towards their own currency, somewhat.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor_centavo_coins" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor_centavo_coins</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>East Timor centavo coins were introduced in East Timor in 2003 for use alongside United States Dollar banknotes and coins, which had been introduced in 2000 to replace the Indonesian rupiah following the commencement of U.N. administration. One centavo is equal to one US cent. The coins are in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 centavos and feature pictures of local plants and animals. East Timor does not yet issue its own banknotes.</p>
