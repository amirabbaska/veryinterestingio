Even in family photos I seem to notice this, my mom at 60 vs her mother at 60, and my dad at 30 vs me at 30. Does anyone else notice this or am I just crazy?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from all that's been pointed out in this thread so far is the fact that most younger people I know seem to be able to take information about health and take it seriously and then use it to their advantage.  I know so many people from my parents and grandparents generations that were told over and over throughout life that they needed to lose weight, they needed to quit drinking,  they needed to quit smoking and blah blah blah.... The doctors might as well have been taking to the wall because most were just incredibly set in their ways and would take their horrible habits to the grave.  People around 40 right now and younger just seem to be much more capable of getting their act together health-wise.  I've always wondered why.  What is it about baby boomers and people older than them just seem so immune to advice regarding their health? They all just seem to get to a certain age where they say screw it, I'm riding this shitty habit train into the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
