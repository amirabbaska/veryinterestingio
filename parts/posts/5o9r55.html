		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Preschool teacher here, with a masters  in education. Simply put, babies and animals like high pitched cooing. It feels safe and comforting to them. The high pitched baby talk portrays a positive emotion to babies, while grumbling or yelling would likely make a baby upset. That explains tone, but the type of language we use demands further explanation.</p>
<p>We tend to say things like, &quot;woooooooooow, what a big girl, playing with the choo choo train! Chooooo Chooooo!&quot; Talking to an adult, we would never extend the vowel sounds or ask about the Choo Choo, we would just say train. Adults say these types of things, in short, to help children understand vocabulary and assign words to objects and actions. We exaggerate vowel sounds to encourage them to start imitating and speaking. We offer a play-by-play of what we are doing (&quot;you are playing with the train&quot;) and state the obvious, (&quot;the train is blue, the train has wheels&quot;) just to let the kid know what's going on. </p>
<p>But, if we are trying to teach them to talk, why not just say train? Isn't Choo Choo train harder to say than train? Yes, but we like to offer the child basically an adjective and a noun. &quot;This is a train and it makes the Choo Choo sound, so it's a Choo Choo train&quot; or &quot;this is a cow and it says moo, so it's a moo cow&quot;. It basically provides a scaffold for the children; if they forgot cow, maybe they will remember the moo part. Or they can learn to associate the sound with the object, the color, the shape, size, etc. All about vocab building and recognition.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is also because it helps us bond with the babies. We as adults feel the need to &quot;get into character&quot;, to shift our speech patterns to acknowledge to ourselves and others the special relationship we have with the baby. Our nurturing, loving, never swearing, always teaching side kicks into gear and we babble and coo away. It's a learned social behavior that conveys to both the adult and baby that they are in a loving relationship. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There seems to be some confusion regarding what &quot;baby talk&quot; constitutes. See /u/sippy_cup 's response to get a good summary of some of the features of what has been referred to by linguists and speech-language pathologists as &quot;motherese,&quot; or more recently &quot;infant-directed speech&quot; (IDS). </p>
<p>Many of the comments seem to be objecting to the use of vocabulary that people associate with kids (i.e., &quot;doggy&quot; and &quot;kitty&quot;) and modifying grammar in ways that are not associated with adult-like speech. That is not what IDS is. IDS refers to the exaggerated prosody, hyperarticulation, and higher pitch that tends to feature in the vast majority of cultures' speech to pre-lingual infants. Older children do benefit greatly from being exposed to more complex sentences and a wide vocabulary, but that is not mutually exclusive with parents using infant-directed speech to their babies while they are pre-lingual.</p>
<p>There is actually plenty of evidence pointing to benefits from IDS. To quickly add a few sources for the curious:</p>
<p>facilitates word segmentation:

<p>babies prefer to listen to motherese (and getting babies to listen is crucial for language acquisition):

<p>…similarly, babies respond better to IDS, and there is neural imaging evidence for it. Improved response even when it’s a stranger.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I studied language acquisition in college.</p>
<p>I just wanted to note that child-directed speech (motherese) is not universal among all human cultures. Some cultures do not use motherese (such as Samoa and Papua New Guinea) and just speak to children the same as they speak to anyone else. I remember studying about one culture (I can't remember which culture it is) that does not even speak to a baby (child) until the baby starts speaking. The babies in that culture learn the language by hearing it, not by being spoken to.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether child-directed speech is used or not, or even if the child is not spoken to at all, children all pretty much learn and progress in their language development in similar steps and at similar ages.</p>
<p>To sum up, we talk weirdly to babies because it is what is normal in our culture, not because it benefits the baby.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a big difference between gibberish/jargon (an infant's non-speech sounds or mispronounced words) and motherese (a caregiver's exaggerated speech). That's a key distinction when reading this thread. </p>
<p>My kid said &quot;bup&quot; for cup and &quot;guk&quot; for milk. I didn't use those words with her because I wanted her to use the real words once she was able to learn and pronounce them.  The baby words are cute, so write them in the baby book so you don't forget. </p>
<p>Here's a link to an article that explains it well, using references to actual studies.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My sister talked like an adult to her daughter and forbid baby talk from the rest of us,  as well. It seems to me that the result of that has been a 7 year old who has the vocabulary of an adult (I'm not joking,  one of the most adult words I've heard her use has been &quot;omniscient&quot;). I live on the other side of the country now but everytime I go back to visit I am completely floored by how smart and how good her vocabulary is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
