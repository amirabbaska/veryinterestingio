		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can get around the law pretty easily:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tell the police what you are doing before you do it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not wear any emblems of any government body</p>
</li>
<li>Do not actually say that you are acting in any capacity as a police officer or other peace officer or otherwise an officer of the government.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the set, they wear a fake uniform and boss people around but don't really claim to be police officers. They just let people wrongly believe it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When you film in a city, you need to apply for a permit. With this application form you need to state all relevant data. Once approved and paid for, the film crew can go about their business. </p>
<p>If they are stopped by any authorities, the simply present the permit and all is good as rain. </p>
<p>Authorities in the area will usually be notified although this isn't always the case. </p>

<p>Our fraternity house would have the pledges go out and cut down a massive Christmas tree every year (would be as tall as fraternity house).  We always call the cops ahead of time that a pick-up truck (or however they figured out how to do it) would driving very slow speeds and be dragging a massive tree through some back streets ~ 1 am.  We have been doing it for like 50 years, so they never have a problem with it.</p>
<p>Of course, the pledges don't know, and the cops will occasionally fuck with them ( drive down into the woods flashing their lights, etc).  Then they would put the tree up, add massive strands of Christmas lights, none the wiser that the cops knew the entire time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Has any of those YouTube pranksters been sued yet? I don't see how YouTube allows some of those videos (namely the gun pranks) to stay up, as they have no disclaimer warning and seemingly no communication with law enforcement (videos of guys getting arrested/confronted by police). It comes off as a breeding ground for copycats to attempt those &quot;guy with a gun&quot; or &quot;lets screw around with the gangbangers&quot; pranks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
