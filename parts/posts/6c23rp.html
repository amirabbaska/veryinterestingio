How do companies keep from using barcodes that are already assigned to other products?  Are the company details coded in the barcode (brand, model, style, etc.)?</p>
<p>Edit:  Wow!  Thank you to all of you!  I've learned more about barcodes, GS1, EAN, ISBN's, and Stargates than I ever imagined!  I mean, this whole process is just fascinating!  Thank you all again!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is an organisation in place called the GS1. It is a non-profit based in Belgium which, among other things, coordinates the use of bar-codes on whole industries and cross-industries scale.</p>
<p>The most common standard in place is the International Article Number (or sometimes European Article Number). It has a number of fixed format that all go like this:</p>
<p>-n digits for country code<br />
-n digits for a unique manufacturer code<br />
-n digits for a unique product code<br />
-n digits for checking purposes when scanning the code</p>
<p>So every business goes through the GS1 to get a manufacturer code that is unique and not in use by another company. Then the manufacturer can decide on any product code itself (within the specifications of the standard).</p>
<p>Edit:format
Edit 2: Since this seems to get a bit of interest. I'll add a few things that have been mentioned in other comments and also address the last part of the original question. </p>
<p>EAN is the most used standard in the world, but other exists as well, some codes are also made to no particular standards. I used this as an example fitting to give OP an answer. </p>
<p>Registering with the GS1 does cost money.  </p>
<p>A bar code is just, well, a code, what is printed underneath a barcode is the entirety of the information. 12-13 digits long numbers are used in the most popular standards. Since the last digit is usually used as a check digit, it only leaves 11 or 12 digits to convey information. That is far too small a volume of information to carry things like brand,model etc.<br />
In the example of a cashier's terminal at a department store, the Point Of Sale software receives a code from the scanner and looks it up in its database where all the relevant info is stored under the bar code number.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I should dispell a few MYTHS about GS1 as someone who works in the industry. I realise I'm a little late to the party but whatever.</p>
<p>Because GS1 aren't the non-profit do gooding angels some people seem to think they are</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>GS1 is NOT the only legal legitimate option for purchasing - there are a number of barcodes that can and are bought and sold for a one-off cost rather than people having to pay on going fees and joining fees. These Barcodes are part of the GS1 system - but due to a mistake GS1 made back in the 90's, they have now been proven outside of GS1's control in court and can legally be sold by third parties for one off fees.</p>
<ul>
<li>GS1 would say they can't guarantee that these aren't used on multiple products. But they also can't guarantee this to any extent with the barcodes they supply directly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not for profit? - technically yes, although it's hard to see how they manage to somehow, spend all of this, if they are not paying massive salaries out to everyone involved. Cause they are quite clearly a money making machine. They don't release their books, so it's hard to know where their expenses are exactly. We do know that at least some of their resources in some countries are spent on people going into individual stores, searching for products not carrying GS1 Barcodes and calling up the owner to tell them that their barcode is illegitimate and that they need to sign up to GS1 immediately, start paying exorbitant fees every year and reprint their product packaging or print labels and manually stick them onto their products. - This despite the fact that these Barcodes have been proven in court already to be legitimate</p>
</li>
<li>Companies like Walmart require GS1 Barcodes to guarantee non-duplication of barcodes on multiple products - again GS1 can't guarantee that a company doesn't accidentally assign one barcode to 2 barcodes any more than other companies can. The reason Walmart doesn't accept other sellers barcodes is because large companies like this will sometimes allow GS1 to manage their barcode policy entirely. GS1 then of course decides that they should only accept GS1 Barcodes in order to maintain their virtual monopoly. There are also interesting occurrences of Senior Vice Presidents of Walmart appearing on the Board of Governors for GS1-US - this might actually explain some of these other expenses of theirs...</li>
</ol>
<p>So GS1 are kind of the devil in a lot of ways</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Source: &quot;GS1 Certified Bar-code Professional&quot; The only bar-codes that have any kind of intelligence built into them are those required by the FDA such as medical devices or some other deciding agency. Basically anything that falls under the medical device tax. Same goes for prescriptions and food. Things that are deemed not dangerous or not able to hurt you don't need to adhere to this standard. If you are selling pencils and rubber bands you can make your own internal barcode numbers that mean nothing to the outside world. Only you and your business know or care what they are. For example we make class III medical devices that fall under the FDA medical device tax. We need to create what is called a FDA UDI. UDI - Unique Device Identifier for each product falling under this tax, meaning it has to be unique for each and every scale that gets produced. For this we use a GTIN14 which is a longer barcode consisting of a (root)+xxx barcode number in which xxx always increments. There are certain applications identifiers that fall into the GTIN14 standard. (21) tells the scanner that the numbers that follow are batch or lot number. There are many many application identifiers and certain products require 1, 2, 3 or more identifiers based on which level the product falls under. The most dangerous products require the most identifiers such as expiration date, and among others. SO in our case we have our GS1 &quot;prefix&quot; we then add application identifier (gs1prefix(21)wo-1234xxx) so when any scanner that has the gs1 standard will read this correctly. The other side of the spectrum is the pencils and rubberbands, these products can use a simple EAN barcode that is the same.... 12345456671 for each and every pencil you sell. If you took that pencil and scanned it at a different store it may come up as a rubberband.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have posted about the GS1, but I wanted to address something else in your question! The barcode does encode one thing: the country it's marked for sale in.</p>
<p>UPC-12, which is just EAN13, is mostly used in the US. That's because the number for the US is 0, so we ignore the first digit, giving us UPC-12.</p>
<p>Other countries have different leading numbers, the first digit in an EAN tells you where the manufacturer/company getting the barcode is from. As another commenter pointed out, this doesn't tell you 100% where the company is selling their products, not does it tell you where it was made.</p>
<p>When barcodes where first being given out, companies could buy a whole block of barcodes, so the first part of the barcode would seem to match up with a company. This isn't true anymore - there's too many people that need barcodes. The first three digits of a barcode do tell you a little bit about the company, and you can get a company prefix, it just might be longer.</p>
<p>Another thing to remember is that you can print barcodes with whatever number you want - some of our suppliers don't purchase codes from GS1, and instead use a specially set aside internal use code, which are the prefixes 040-049.</p>
<p>Edit: Corrected a mistake in wording about UPC-12 that was confusing</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many have noted about GS1, EAN, UPC, etc. (there's dozens more). These are all fine and dandy when they are used correctly by everyone. However, in many cases smaller companies will not entirely comply with these standards (tiny format differences). Think for example about butchers, bakeries, ... Often in these cases smaller barcodes are used and sometimes only contain a single number which identifies their internal product. The use of internal codes is perfectly fine, as this is also done within EAN codes (the last field), however, it often becomes an issue when these products are being sold to others. Different suppliers of a product (e.g. a 10kg bag of flour of a specific brand) sometimes provide a different barcode even though they are offering the exact same product. My point being, in theory, the standards are brilliant. In practice, not so much.</p>
<p>Source: I've worked on barcode scanning software to identify import and export items. In Belgium, where these standards are supposedly founded...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
