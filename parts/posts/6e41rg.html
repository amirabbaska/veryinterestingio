		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-017-0357-5" target="_blank">There has definitely been human impact on the Magnetosphere</a>, though I'm not sure if that's strictly considered the same as the Earth's magnetic field (this is not my field of research, at all), and a large chunk of that comes from things like Atmospheric Nuclear testing.</p>
<p>That said, a couple of excerpts from above that are particularly relevant; it's likely there's at least some effect from radio transmission.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given ambient terrestrial ionosphere and magnetosphere magnetic field and electron density values, VLF fixed frequency transmissions can not only pass through the medium but can under certain conditions trigger a variety of natural stimulated wave emissions, often interacting with existing particle populations in these regions. Observations exploring these physical mechanisms have been and continue to be conducted both from the ground and in-situ within the ionosphere and magnetosphere. Sect. 3 of Parrot and Zaslavski (1996) provides a mid 1990s snapshot review of observations and mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, from the above ref, there's debate over the specific contribution from the use of electronics not intended for EMF radiation emssion;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The possible effects on the space environment of human activities via use of electrical power sources in industrial activities have also been reported from statistical analyses of weekly variations in geomagnetic activity (e.g. Park and Miller 1979; Fraser-Smith 1979), and refuted from other analyses (e.g. Karinen et al. 2002).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other responses have mentioned, the fact that man-made electronics point in essentially random directions means that they have very little cumulative effect at all.</p>
<p>To satisfy some more curiosity, it may be illustrative to look at the question: could man-made electronics affect it at all? </p>
<p>Let's do a basic ballpark estimation. Human electric power consumption is around 25000 TWh a year, or about 3 trillion watts on average. That corresponds to a regular 230 kV power line (or more realistically, many parallel ones) pulling 12 million amps. If we loop that power line around the equator, we turn the Earth into a giant electromagnet generating one microtesla - about 30 times less than Earth's natural magnetic field. So no, even if all the man-made electricity on Earth were to collaborate, we still couldn't beat Mother Nature magnetically.</p>
<p>(Of course, lower voltages generate more magnetism for a given amount of power, so if we instead managed to run our big magnet on regular mains voltage (1000 times lower than the transmission lines) we could create a 1000 times stronger field, beating Earth but requiring one hell of a thick cable.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
