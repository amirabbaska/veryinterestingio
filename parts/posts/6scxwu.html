<p>I love math, but I'm not fluent in date calculations. (base 7? base 365?) I'm very curious about patterns. I'd love to hear more about the how and why of this question. (don't forget about leap years!) </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because a normal year is 52 weeks plus one day (365 mod 7 = 1), weekdays normally skip forward by one day every year. So 2017 started on Sunday and 2018 will start on Monday. If all years had the same length, it would then take seven years for the calendar of any given year to &quot;roll around&quot;.</p>
<p>However, leap years make the matter more complicated. They have 366 days and thus the calendar skips forward by two weekdays on a leap year. Plus, of course, you cannot reuse a leap year calendar on a non-leap year even if they start on the same weekday.</p>
<p>Given a non-leap year, say, 2017, you can just count years, summing the &quot;remainder&quot; days until you hit a number divisible by seven. So:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>2017</th>
<th>2018</th>
<th>2019</th>
<th><em>2020</em></th>
<th>2021</th>
<th>2022</th>
<th>2023</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td><em>5</em></td>
<td>6</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>And indeed by checking the calendar you see that 2023 looks like 2017. But for some years, your counting will skip from 6 to 8 due to a leap year, and you have to keep on going:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>2015</th>
<th><em>2016</em></th>
<th>2017</th>
<th>2018</th>
<th>2019</th>
<th><em>2020</em></th>
<th>2021</th>
<th>2022</th>
<th>2023</th>
<th><em>2024</em></th>
<th>2025</th>
<th>2026</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td><em>3</em></td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>6</td>
<td><em>8</em></td>
<td>9</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>11</td>
<td><em>13</em></td>
<td>14</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>With leap years, such as 2016, the year of reuse has to be a leap year as well, and you'll have to wait longer. 28 years, to be exact! In 2044 your Taylor Swift calendar will be pretty vintage.</p>
<p>Final disclaimer: Years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they're also divisible by 400. So for example around 2100 you have to take that into account. Also, these calculations only concern days of week. Lunar cycle markings, date of Easter etc. will take much longer to get in sync.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the leap years. Without leap years, the day of the week of a certain date is shifted by one every year. So say January 1th is a Monday in 2000 (I picked random numbers), then January 1th will be a Tuesday in 2001. This is because the remainder of 365 days divided by 7 (a week) is exactly 1. You have to wait 7 shifts so that your calendar will be useful again.</p>
<p>Now accounting for leap years, every 4 years you have one extra day, giving you an extra shift. In the timeframe of 7 shifts you will have exactly one leap year. So 6 years should be enough.</p>
<p>But then you get special rules for the leap years and I'm out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Familiarise yourself with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar" target="_blank">Gregorian calendar</a>.</p>
<p>The Gregorian calendar has a 146,097 day, or 400 year, cycle. However, common sense tells us there's only 7 days a year can start on, and the rest of the year is fixed. But there's also <em>leap years</em>, and on a leap year we miss a day, so that's 7 more possible calendars, totalling 14.</p>
<p>Thus we need to know two things to find out which year the 2016 calendar will repeat:</p>
<ol>
<li>The day of the week of January 1st</li>
<li>Which one of the two possible calendars with that particular day of the week it is</li>
</ol>
<p>The algorithm that provides those to us is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule#400-year_cycle_of_Doomsdays" target="_blank">Doomsday algorithm</a>. The 28-year cycle should be obvious if you observe leap years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
