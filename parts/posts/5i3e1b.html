		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Work and Academy are very different things.</p>
<p>As a hiring manager that interviewed hundreds of STEM field engineers I was able to observe how little the academic achievement has to do with ability to perform work related tasks in their own fields. The high GPA's interview results were no better than normal ones.</p>
<p>To understand why, you need to consider the requirements from a worker:</p>
<p>Employees in this field are required to get a project with specifications and then execute on them with as little help as possible.
The success factor includes, but not limited to (not ordered by importance):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to collaborate with colleagues and customers</li>
<li>Speed of work</li>
<li>Errors and the ability to correct them</li>
<li>Ability to seek for answers/solutions</li>
<li>Status reporting</li>
<li>Raising flags - at the right time</li>
<li>Motivation</li>
<li>Flexibility</li>
<li>Innovation</li>
<li>Consistency</li>
<li>Relevant skill</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more factors but those already represent a big prat of the picture.</p>
<p>Now, GPA does not represent any of these, in many cases even the relevancy of skill.</p>
<p>This is why a recruiter would try to have a test that will include some of the above in a simplified isolated form. (Important note, I learned that in US the GPA actually has more significance compared to other countries because those tests can be disputed as illegal. In court, the employer might have to prove that the test is relevant for the specific vacant position. There is much more to this, but this is is not for this thread)</p>
<p><strong>My preferred method is - logical questions:</strong></p>
<p>The goal of the question is to present the candidate with new, incomplete information and then observe how its being handled.</p>
<p>The example logic question for this will be the &quot;Die Hard 3&quot; bucket puzzle.</p>
<p>The considered factors are (I will list the factor and in brackets -  an example response):</p>
<ol>
<li>Attitude to the question (I don't know anything about buckets, so don't ask me that)</li>
<li>Ability ask for more information (Am I missing something? The buckets fill to the end? The fountain has endless supply of water?)</li>
<li>Extracting information from clues (I can refill the buckets!)</li>
<li>Giving up (I'm not a mathematician)</li>
<li>Knowing when to ask for help (after 20 minutes of grunting &quot;Wait, I will solve it!&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>And much more
The idea is to understand how the person behaves in all of those areas. Normally I would ask harder and harder questions until I will understand the candidate.</p>
<p>The high GPA in some cases would get more questions but but would not perform better in other areas.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Your academic test does not measure you as a worker.</strong></p>
<p>Edit: After many comments I have to add this:</p>
<p>In big companies the CV's get through HR which will eliminate the candidate based on their grades. This means that the recruiting manager that cares about experience or cares less than HR about the grades will not get the chance to evaluate you</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're going to get two very different answers on this thread. One telling you you're wrong and one trying to explain the shift away from relying on GPAs. This will be due to a few things. 1) People who have high GPAs who don't want to be told that their GPA that they worked hard for didn't matter as much as it used to. 2) Country...some countries still put a heavier emphasis on academic scores well into your career. 3) Field...some fields might use your GPA as a filter or a qualifier. </p>
<p>Now to answer your question from my professional experience. I had a low college GPA and graduated into a recession. I took an unpaid PR internship followed by a paid marketing internship after college. Right now, 5 years after graduating college, I'm pretty successful in title and pay. I've also interviewed numerous people coming straight out of college. </p>
<p>The first reason is that most of the time with people coming straight out of college into an entry-level job, the skills they need are pretty much teachable. &quot;Do this assignment every morning, do these tasks and send me a report every week, etc. If you need help, I'm here to teach you how to do it the way the company wants it to be done.&quot; </p>
<p>The second reason is that with low-level employees, you just want people who can work hard, be personable (you do have to work with them every day) and do the work. Like I said above, most work can be taught on the job OR can only be taught on the job and not something you can learn in school. So when it comes to an interview, you're gauging for how this person will work with others (most entry-level employees do have to work with others in and out of the department, hence personable) and if they're going to work hard which brings me to my next point.</p>
<p>The third reason is HARD WORK. I've interviewed people with 4.0 GPAs and interviewed people who didn't put their GPAs on their resume and it doesn't exactly matter....the GPA does stand out and you are impressed with it and can make a great tie-breaker....but that's about it. What you're gauging for is how hard does this person work. If I have someone with a high GPA who didn't do anything else and someone who didn't state their GPA on their resume who worked their way through college, was involved in greek life/clubs/activities throughout college and can tell me why they want this job....I'm picking that person. Because that person has probably been in a situation where they worked, had a club meeting and pulled off an all-nighter and THAT is what translates in the real world. </p>
<p>The high GPA candidate might learn skills quicker but I want someone in the trenches with me if I have to finish off a project late at night and not complain on nights where, when I was in their shoes, I slept under my desk for 3 hours just to take a nap overnight, and then woke up to keep cracking on work. If I get a high GPA candidate that can give me that, then he/she gets the job for sure, but I know a high GPA doesn't guarantee me a hark-worker</p>
<p>TL;DR - I care about looking for work-applicable skills from entry--level applicants. A high GPA is nice and can be a tie-breaker but show me I can rely on you with other skills you have. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me put this in the shortest way I can, and maybe this analogy will be a helpful way to look at it. Football is basically running fast, jumping high, being strong. A career in business means accomplishing tasks, fulfilling your requirements, and doing things in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Both of these statements are true, but they are also just a small portion of the truth. GPAs on a resume are like a player's stats at the NFL draft combine. Sometimes they indicate greatness, sometimes they indicate physical prowess which cannot apply itself to football.</p>
<p>If you are looking to draft a wide receiver you want someone who can run as fast as possible, right? So you go to the combine and have players A and B run the 40 yard dash. Player A runs it in 4.24 seconds, a fantastic time. Player B runs it in 4.71 seconds. 4.71 is not a good 40 time for a wide receiver. It's honestly not a good 40 time for a linebacker. Ray Lewis ran a 4.58 second 40 yard dash. Are you really going to draft a wide receiver who runs a 4.71 40 yard dash?</p>
<p>If you were a recruiter, picking a 4.0 GPA vs. a 3.1 GPA is very similar. If all that matters is a number and the conclusions you draw from it, then you will hire the 4.0 GPA every time, and they will be better than the 3.1 GPA player. In the case of the NFL 40 times however, the 4.24 second 40 time belongs to a wide receiver by the name of Marquise Goodwin. He is a 3rd or 4th option for the Buffalo Bills. If all that mattered was the number, Marquise Goodwin would be the pick 10/10 times over the 4.71 40 time player. Player B, the one who ran the 4.71 40 yard dash time in this case is Jerry Rice. Statistically the most prolific offensive player in the history of football, Jerry Rice is likely the greatest wide receiver who has ever played the game, or at least one of the greatest. He was a 1st ballot hall of famer and holds the NFL record for most career touchdowns, receiving yards, etc.</p>
<p>Would you rather have Jerry Rice or Marquise Goodwin? Metrics aren't everything. They might be part of the package- Randy Moss ran a great 40 time and was an excellent player to boot. GPAs might be part of the package, you could obtain a great GPA and also end up being one of the leading experts in your profession. It is not a guarantee however, and frequently if you look beyond the school name, the GPA, etc. with a job candidate who comes in with a 3.0, you can find someone who has a very complete skill set for a real job, and a whole lot of untapped potential.</p>
<p>Edit: This got voted up and I had a lot of responses. Let me clarify: I am not saying that companies recruit by comparing directly two candidates of varying GPAs and picking the higher number. Most companies use those GPAs to filter down the batch size by immediately deciding not to spend their time on people below XXX number. Yes, I'm aware that this runs both ways. Sometimes a low GPA doesn't mean you have a diamond in the rough. You could easily have somebody whose GPA was a result of character flaws which will plague them in the business world. The idea beyond this is that the interviewing process is often unconcerned with GPA beyond a certain point of admission. If you are looking at candidates from 3 and up, you don't just hire the highest number, you talk with them and use interview tactics which given you insight into their true character and potential.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;GPAs on a resume are like a player's stats at the NFL draft combine.&quot;. No they are not. Player stats measure relevant abilities in the game. GPA's measure academic ability, which very often has little to do with the needed qualities of an employee. In terms of your analogy, you are loosing focus on the ball.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A GPA can easily measure a few of the relevant abilities of a potential employee, but only a very narrow amount. A wide receiver can be very fast but not capable of running a half decent route, taking a hit, catching anything, adjusting to a ball in flight, releasing from a jam in man coverage, breaking tackles, etc. A recent grad with a 4.0 GPA and a business degree might have learned how to work hard, persevere, meet deadlines, accomplish goals, manage their workload and schedule, but they don't possess the 200 other traits which are necessary for a given position.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally because schoolwork and actual work are (with some exceptions) totally different in nature for the design field.</p>
<p><strong>Schoolwork</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>has clearly defined problems, solutions, and requirements for success. Grades are based on doing the things assigned quickly and well. The purpose of these is to teach techniques.</li>
<li>is generally independent in nature, and working well with others isn't graded. </li>
<li>most of each grade is determined by a test that mostly grades ability to memorize and repeat knowledge. </li>
<li>in design schools, high grades are given to people with bold uncompromising visions and unorthodox solutions to problems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actual work</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>problems are typically very open-ended, and the ability to decide <em>which technique</em> to use is often more important than the skill with which you can do so. </li>
<li>is highly collaborative: your ability to understand, work with, and communicate with others is key.</li>
<li>deep memorization is a waste of brainspace in a fast-moving industry. Google-fu and the ability to quickly absorb new information is much more useful.</li>
<li>bold vision is great, but in the real world you need to harmonize with a team. Your vision needs to become part of and an inspiration for your team, not a fight against it. Top students often fail at this after years of being told otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>My interviews tend to involve questions about working with teams, times when they've had to compromise, or when they were asked to make a decision they disagreed with. </p>
<p>I also have them walk me through projects and describe why and how they approached it, what failed, how they worked around those failures, etc.</p>
<p>We also sometimes do design challenges where I will give them incomplete information and expect them to ask questions or look things up to answer the unknowns, and then challenge them to solve the same problem in a different way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another factor not mentioned in the top comments is that GPA is not an absolute measure of anything - some schools are simply easier than others, and thus the values aren't necessarily very meaningful. Comparing GPAs from the same school might be slightly more useful, but even then, different students take different classes and someone's basketweaving 101 might pull up their GPA while someone else's fourth year calculus might bring theirs down. </p>
<p>In particular areas, grades have more meaning. For example, law schools in Ontario use a true bell-curve to distribute marks. Your absolute mark doesn't matter - your grade is given based on where you placed in the class. For example, if you got 91% on an exam, but most of the class had 92% or higher, you could end up with a C or D. The flip side is that in a class of 100 there are only 6-8 A+ marks to go around, so getting one of those shows distinction. As a result, law firms in Ontario will give a good amount of consideration to your grades during your first few years as a lawyer. Of course, like most fields, after you've been out of school more than a handful of years, your experience becomes the only thing that really matters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
