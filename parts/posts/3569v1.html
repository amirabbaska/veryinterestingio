		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Yes. Flatulence would propel an astronaut forward very slowly, but if you used the gas as fuel for a combustion reaction the astronaut could get going much faster.</p>
<p><strong>Longer answer:</strong> Gas diffusing will carry a small amount of momentum backwards, so it must exert a force on the person, pushing them forward. Essentially, farts are rocket fuel. So let's figure out how much and how fast a person farts, to figure out how fast an astronaut can get moving in space.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1648028" target="_blank">this paper abstract gives us a good idea of the average volume of gas produced by a person in a day.</a> They give it somewhere between 476 to 1491 mL, and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9176210" target="_blank">another paper</a> gives the composition as a mixture of methane, nitrogen gas, hydrogen gas, and carbon dioxide. Let's say the average person produces 1 L of gas each day and we'll <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+mole%2F22.4+liters+*+1+liter+*+%2810+grams%2Fmole%29" target="_blank">guess that this gas mixture is about 0.5 grams/Liter, which is not entirely unreasonable given the known masses of the gasses in the mixture.</a> That comes out to 0.5 g of flatulence every day for a normal person. </p>
<p>Now, let's guess that a fart leaves the butthole at about 1 m/s - again, not entirely unreasonable. So putting all this together, we can find that a day's worth of farts carries backwards momentum equal to</p>
<pre><code>(1 m/s)(0.5 grams) = 0.0005 kg m/s</code></pre>
<p>so for momentum to be conserved, the astronaut will now be traveling <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.5+g+m%2Fs++%2F+65+kg" target="_blank">7.7x10^-6</a> m/s forward, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28speed%29" target="_blank">which is only about 1000x faster than hair grows.</a> If an astronaut in space farted every day, it would take 10,000 years for him to get up to a normal highway speed. </p>
<p>This is incredibly inefficient, but luckily, there's a better way. The gasses I listed above are combustible - specifically methane. Just spewing the gas backwards to get a push forward would be like putting your SUV in neutral and trying to propel it forward with a supersoaker that sprays gasoline backwards. Instead of <em>throwing</em> it backwards, you can <em>explode it</em> backwards to generate thrust, like a real rocket. After all, every 14 year old knows you can light a fart on fire, but if the astronaut did this the gas behind him would expand in all directions, not giving him much of a push. Instead, we need to harness this energy for a jetpack, so that all the exhaust goes backward.</p>
<p>If we take the methane to be about 1% of our flatulence, and the energy of combustion to be 890 kJ/mole, then we find that the <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%280.01+Liters%29+*+%2822.4+moles%2FLiter%29++++%28890+kJ%2Fmole%29" target="_blank">chemical potential energy of the gas is about 100 million times greater than the kinetic energy backwards.</a>. If we had one of those fancy <a href="http://www.springwise.com/img/uploads/2014/05/cowbackpacks.png" target="_blank">gas backpacks that they put on cows</a> to harvest the methane from their farts and a jetpack to burn it, then <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282*%280.01+Liters%29+*+%281%2F22.4+moles%2FLiter%29++++%28890+kJ%2Fmole%29+%2F%2865+kg%29%29^%281%2F2%29" target="_blank">this gas would be enough to get a particularly flatulent astronaut up to highway speed in a day.</a> </p>
<p>(Edit: /u/throwaway_MZ3Ji8yc offers a good discussion of the practicality of such a rocket in the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3569v1/if_you_farted_hard_enough_in_space_could_you_move/cr1mnpp" target="_blank">comments</a> below.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1s4l7v/i_am_col_chris_hadfield_retired_astronaut/cdtupcd" target="_blank">his AMA</a>, Chris Hadfield said</p>

<p>We all tried it - too muffled, not the right type of propulsive nozzle :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So while theoretically possible, it seems in practice it's not a viable method of navigating the space station.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it would be much more effective if you could pipe in a bit of oxygen and an igniter.  This would increase the propulsion by at least a factor of five.  It would also require some explaining for your proctologist so be sure you have a good story put together before trying it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
