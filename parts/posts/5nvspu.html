		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These work due to chemicals known as cyclodextrins. </p>
<p>Typically a number of glucose molecules in a ring. </p>
<p>Small aromatic molecules are able to become trapped within these rings due to strong intermolecular between the inside of the ring and the small aromatic. </p>
<p>This takes it out of the air and out of your nose! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sprays do not destroy smells, but collide with particles that cause smells.  The stray's particles collide with the odorous particles and coagulate, forming slightly larger particles.  In effect, this removes a odorous particle from the air, but a particle that can collide with other odorous particles remains in the system.  As these particles become more massive, local air currents are not providing enough force to counteract gravity and they fall to the ground, leaving a film on your floor.  Clean your bathroom.</p>
<p>I was able to find further links to it <a href="http://cires1.colorado.edu/jimenez/AtmChem/SP_7.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://cires1.colorado.edu/jimenez/AtmChem/SP_11_1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  The describes how particles interact, the second deals with mass transfer and has a nice chart that shows how particles increase in size over time.  If this interests you, I would suggest reading a textbook on aerosols.  <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471194107.html" target="_blank">This was mine in my undergrad</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting fact - initially febreeze did not do well as it originally didn't have a scent. Because people were nose blind to the terrible odours in their home, they didn't feel the need to use it. Once they added a scent to it, sales skyrocketed. </p>
<p>Source - heard it on a CBC radio program called under the influence with Terry O'Reily, which is all about advertising. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I prefer Neutradol, it has less of a strong headache inducing perfumed smell, its also a lot cheaper and tends to work better. It comes in aerosol, powder one for bins another for carpets and a long lasting gel version ideal for bathrooms. I'm not certain if its available in the U.S. thought.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern chemistry has shown us that certain chemical agents, when atomized and inhaled, are capable of blocking our smell receptors, thus blunting our ability to detect odor. Other air fresheners coat our nasal passages with an oily film, and many still just cover up the original odor with better-smelling scents. A minority of air fresheners actually break down the offensive odor, and even those ones generally contain a heavy dose of chemicals.</p>
<p>What’s Wrong with Conventional Air Fresheners?
A regular run-of-the-mill air freshener will probably contain at least one of the following scary chemicals:</p>
<p>Phthalates. Synthetic fragrances usually contain phthalates, and most of us know that these are bad—linked with early puberty, autism, obesity, and birth defects. You won’t see “phthalate” on a label; it’ll just say “fragrance” or perhaps “parfum.”
PEG-40. The Environmental Working Group considers this polymer to be moderately hazardous to human health.
1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB).1,4-DCB is reasonably anticipated to a human carcinogen, and has been shown to cause kidney and testicular cancer in rats. It also has been shown to cause reduced lung function and increased asthma rates in humans.
Air fresheners may also contain some really gross chemicals that won’t show up on the label. A 2007 study tested 74 air freshening products and measured the concentration of VOCs in the air after use. They reported that a total of more than 350 different chemicals and allergens were detected, including (but not limited to!) benzene, formaldehyde, styrene, and phthalates.</p>
<p>Spray bottles (aerosol) cause additional health risks due to ingredients used as propellants, such as butane and propane.</p>

<p>TL;DR some people are highly sensitive and get sick from air &quot;fresheners&quot; while most people have no idea their sense of smell is getting slowly destroyed along with loads of unhealthy chemicals being introduced to their immune systems...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
