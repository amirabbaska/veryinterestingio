<li>
<p>Yes, they can get old and die in a sense. Typically in the from of degenerative diseases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of factors. Evolution, genetics, environment. Some can live for thousands of years, some live only a few months. </p>
</li>
<li>You can theoretically take what's called a &quot;cutting&quot; of some plants and keep it going forever if conditions are kept right. But you need to constantly take a cutting every now and again and grow a new plant. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process you are talking about is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence" target="_blank">senescence</a>, specifically organismal senescence. The whole process of senescence in and of itself is not entirely figured out and there are competing theories for what is actually happening, but we do understand that there are fundamental differences between the processes in most animals and plants.</p>
<p>The plant senescence that most people are familiar with is what happens to plants as cold weather onsets: leaves change color, the trees abscise (shed) their leaves, annuals die, and perennials go dormant. All of these processes are not consequential to the age of the cells but rather to environmental cues and the hormonal response to these cues within the plant. This can be easily demonstrated by keeping such plants in a greenhouse over winter - the plants carry on as if nothing has happened, even if cloned plants kept outside senesce.</p>
<p>An important consideration is that plants and animals are fundamentally physiologically different. Many plants are modular, meaning that they have discrete levels of tissue organization, but the way that these tissues are assembled do not have specific limits on their number or placement. Or, in other words, most humans are originally genetically destined to have two arms, two legs, and ten five digits on each of these limbs, all in a specific arrangement. No such limit exists with the number and placement of the branches of a tree, or the number and placement of the tillers on a crabgrass plant. Another important difference is that most plants have indeterminate growth - they continue to grow throughout their lifetimes, again, unlike most animals, whose growth and development has a finite end.</p>
<p>These two factors have important implications for the way that tissues are differentiated in plants. Plants have meristems, which are the growing points of the plant. These are organized bundles of undifferentiated tissue (think: stem cells) from which new tissues are made. The fact that plants have meristematic tissue has interesting consequences - most plants can be vegetatively propagated or clonally propagated via tissue culture.</p>
<p>I know I haven't directly answered your question, mostly because it isn't a simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. With modular organisms that can be vegetatively propagated, the question of what is actually a single organism can be complicated in and of itself. I would say with certainty that plants do die of &quot;old age&quot;, but not in the way we do. Plants don't age like we do because there are fundamental differences in our physiology and how our tissues die and renew themselves. That is all I'm really qualified to say, maybe someone with more expertise on the subject can weigh in. Hopefully what I've shared will at least help you think about the question in a different way.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm also interested. Sorry, but here's another question in a similar vein.</p>
<p>Say you have the lifespan of a random tree or something. Then it's cut down, but a new sprout emerges from the stump. Is this a new tree? Does it share the remaining lifespan of the old one if it wasn't cut down? Or is it its own thing with it's own lifespan?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
