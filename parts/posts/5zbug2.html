		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A mixture of the oils and residue on your skin and in the air such as dust, mainly. It's similar to how you smudge a window by touching it and can never seem to wipe it off with just your fingers. It'll take longer for it to become noticeable than with glass so it'll seem like a mountain of dirt you need to scrape off in comparison.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
