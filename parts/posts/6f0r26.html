		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is mostly question of dose and pharmacokinetics (the speed the substance acts). When you carefully inject something into bloodstream (some bigger vein), pretty much all of it spreads around the body fast. That way you can exactly control the dose and make the most out of what you have. If you injected it elsewhere, the odds are it would work too - but if it hit a muscle (intermuscular application), it would take much longer to get where it needs to be, which generally means lower &quot;maximum&quot; effect over longer period of time. </p>
<p>With pharmaceutical drugs you want the best controlled outcome you can get. With bad drugs you want to get the most out of the dose. Both is better achieved by getting it right into blood. (Unless you go for intermuscular application on purpose)</p>
<p>With poison darts and bites, the substances are so efficient and/or in dose large enough that you dont really care. Yes, hitting a vein WOULD make it faster and stronger, but even muscle is good enough.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are also drugs like IVIG that are composed of immunoglobulin that we have in our blood. Medicines like these are injected into the vein, given that their goal is to elevate levels of antibodies in the blood in order to help patients with immune disorders to fight off recurring infections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you take a drug by mouth, it may get diluted by the &quot;first pass effect.&quot; All the stuff that enters your blood stream from your stomach and intestines goes into vessels that carry blood directly to the liver before that blood goes anywhere else in the body. The liver has enzymes that change certain substances (other drugs can pass through the liver mostly or entirely unchanged). So if you take a drug by mouth that is significantly metabolized by the liver, very little of it will reach the general circulation unchanged. But if you inject that same drug into a vein or a muscle, the drug has a chance to circulate to all or most of the body before passing through the liver where some or all of it can be metabolized.<br />
If you get a drug injected into a muscle, it takes time for it to enter blood vessels and get carried into the general circulation. So, a tranquilizer injected into muscle is going to take a bit longer to work than the same drug injected directly into a vein. (This is why I want to throw something at the screen every time I watch a TV show where someone gets injected in the leg with a tranquilizer and they immediately pass out.)
Now, if you happen to inject into an artery by accident you can cause real havoc. Every veterinary student has, no doubt, heard the story of the vet who was trying to inject euthanasia solution into the jugular vein of a horse but missed and put the drug into the carotid artery instead. The drug went whoosh right up into the brain. The horse reared up and then fell, nearly crushing the person. Not how you want a euthanasia to go, by the way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short version is with most pharmaceuticals you want a particular controlled reaction. Overdoses can be dangerous, and not enough medication would be ineffective. It has to do with how well the drug in question absorbs, and how quickly, what it has to pass through - a tablet or capsule by mouth must pass through the GI tract, troches and enemas absorb via mucous membranes, ect. See pharmacokinetics, above. </p>
<p>It also has to do with ease of use. Most prescriptions you pick up at Walgreens are tablets and capsules, because they're the easiest to self administer and if you have to, it's relatively easy to puke something back up if you realize something is wrong, but it's slower to take effect and less efficient in the dose it might deliver. Same concepts with topical agents - easy to administer, wash off if rash occurs.</p>
<p>Intravenous administration has the benefit of taking effect almost immediately because it doesn't need to be absorbed, it just puts the medication directly into the bloodstream. The downside is that it's difficult to self administer, especially if you dislike needles, and not everyone has a sharps disposal at home. </p>
<p>Tranquilizer darts and poisons or behind work by overwhelming the systems and don't really care if you OD or being controlled in general, so you throw a ton of the chemical agent into the muscle and it works just fine.</p>
<p>TLDR Pharmaceuticals are hella controlled reactions with specific pharmacokinetics, toxins don't need to be. Source: pharmacy technician student pulling information from my textbooks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What many people here seem to miss, is that not only do some drugs need to be injected i.v. to reach their full effect, but that some drugs will effectively damage the patient if they're give i.m. or s.c. And it's not only drugs like chemotherapeutics and barbiturates, but also simple things like 5% glucosis given to patients with dangerously low blood sugar. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
