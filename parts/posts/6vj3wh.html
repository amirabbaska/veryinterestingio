		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sudden increase in humidity.  The coil gets wet from condensation but when the compressor is running the air is cold so it's ability to absorb water is very low.  When the compressor turns off the air heats back up, absorbs the water from the coil and blows the humid air out of the vents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you may be referring what is known as &quot;dirty sock syndrome&quot;.</p>
<p>It is because of this pesky mold that grows on the coil since it is a dark, damp environment. Really only occurs on electric heat HVAC systems because the heat doesn't get hot enough to burn it off in the winter, like a gas system does.</p>
<p>Millions of pages on google on it as its the bane of our industry!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mold in on the evaporator coil is part of the problem. It gets really cold and condenses moisture on it. Every AC cycle condenses moisture which can promote mold growth.</p>
<p>While the AC is running, the evaporator coil gets really cold which also reduces the evaporation rates of the smelly compounds in the mold. The rate at which the mold releases it's sockyness is much lower when the evaporator coil it's colonized is cold. When the compressor turns off and the coil warms up to room temp, the mold holds a kegger and gets back into business making smelly compounds which can evaporate from the now warmer surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
