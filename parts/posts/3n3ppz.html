		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think I can actually use my degree a little bit here,
It is also to do with the degree of insulation on the nerve fibres that transmit pain to the brain. In colder temperatures nerve fibres that transmit touch stimuli are less active as they have less insulation (myelination), making transmission more metabolically demanding, on the flip side, pain transmitting neurons are better electrically insulated and so are more capable of transmitting the painful stimuli.  Additionally in the spine non-painful signals interact and inhibit the transmission of painful ones to the brain reducing the pain sensation (ever noticed how sometimes it helps to rub a bruised area?)  This is also lost in colder temperatures.<br />
TL;DR
nice neurons are inefficient at colder temperatures and can't inhibit the transmission of painful stimuli (spinal gate theory). </p>
<p>I asked a professor this a while back because it was bugging me, its always really cool to get a hard scientific answer for something that everyone notices but never thinks about :) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><em>The nerves in your hand get much more sensitive when they're cold.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, your veins constrict, and blood runs less to your extremities and more to your vital organs to preserve heat.</em></p>
<p><em>This makes your skin more rigid, which causes pressure to be applied to these already sensitive nerves. So everything is getting less blood flow, which also makes it harder to make precise or repetitive movements (texting when it's cold).</em></p>
<p><em>So all these make for a more painful experience when your fingers get hit when they're really cold. Compare the warm, soft hands with good padding and flexibility to cold, rigid, blood-deprived hands.</em></p>
<p><em>EDIT: I forgot to add, your muscles are a lot tighter and less &quot;mobile&quot;, and it's easier to cause injury when your muscles are tense. Hence why they say people who are intoxicated suffer less from permanent injuries, because they don't tense up as much, for instance in a car crash.</em></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two main reasons. The first is that your nerves are actually more sensitive at lower temperature. The second is that your skin and muscles are less flexible when it is cold (for a few reasons), meaning that instead of bending, they are damaged by the trauma. This means it triggers a more severe pain sensation when it is cold outside. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>similar receptors on your skin handle temperature, itch and pain sensation.</p>
<p>in some cases, the &quot;pain&quot; signal is weaker when they are already transmitting &quot;hot&quot;.</p>

<p>if something itches, just warm up the area and you won't feel itchy for a good while :-)
also, capsicin (chilis!) influences the receptors, if you eat spicy food, you will feel hot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
