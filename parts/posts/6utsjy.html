<p>Studies indicate that temporal perception is linked with metabolism and body size.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347213003060" target="_blank">Metabolic rate and body size are linked with perception of temporal information</a>,<em>Healy et al</em> compared body size and metabolism with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_fusion_threshold" target="_blank">critical flicker fusion</a> and found that smaller body size with higher metabolism tended to also have a high CFF.</p>
<p>What this can be understood to mean, is that these animals perceive their changing environment over a much finer timescale than larger animals with a lower metabolism. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First you have to consider that not even a single organism experiences time in a consistent manner. </p>
<p>For humans the difference can be dramatic. The classic example is a traumatic experience appears to be in &quot;slow-motion&quot;, this is because as a novel experience while extremely physiologically arroused, we are creating more memory per second. More information crammed into the seconds make them appear longer, so they go by &quot;slower&quot;.</p>
<p>Consider how this concept could apply to completely different biology... </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember in Catch 22 there was a character, Yosarian (?), who believed that the subjective experience of time was the actual objective passage of time, so he tried to be bored to extend his existence. He would go to all the really boring speeches of another character, Major Major (?), because he thought the duration of the speech was actually thousands of years. The Major was really flattered at his attendance, not knowing the real reason. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Even humans don't all perceive time at the same rate. For one thing we perceive time as going faster as we age. Even more interesting is the lexical hypothesis, which states that anything meaningful in our cognition will be encoded in our language. We have discovered tribes of people deep within the rain forest that don't have words for past, present, future or even time. When asked questions about time, the tribe members didn't even understand the questions.  So the answer to your question is undoubtedly no. Different organisms do not all perceive the passage of time at the same rate, because even organisms of the same species perceive time differently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>While you and I might perceive time differently, most organisms are unaware of the passage of time.  They simply exist in the moment.</p>
<p>The more complex the brain, the better awareness of time.  Insects, which are the most common organisms on this planet, have no perception of time.  I would argue a fish has no perception of time but a dog had has minimal perception of time.</p>
<p>Take an example of a pet dog.  While they can be trained and show emotions they cannot tell if you have been away for 1 day or 10. (At least mine cannot).  Humans will have an exact perception of how much time has passed yet your pet will have difficulty.  The dog will know the difference between 1 day and 10 years simply by how memories are stored but the dog will not understand the difference.</p>
