		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The image in that video is not a hologram, it's just a video displayed on a &quot;screen&quot; made of a rotating blade so the background is mostly transparent and the image appears to be in midair, like this <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GqehPK7uL._SY355_.jpg" target="_blank">LED fan clock</a> but higher resolution. The video is of a rotating object, but if you were to move around that image it would not look like you're walking around a real 3-dimensional object.</p>
<p>A real hologram can recreate a 3D image, but typically only works under specific lighting conditions. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Holograph-record.svg/1024px-Holograph-record.svg.png" target="_blank">This</a> is how a hologram is made: the image is encoded as an interference pattern on a plate made by the light scattered from an object and a reference beam. After the interference pattern is made, the object can be removed and when the plate is illuminated at the same angle as the reference beam you can see the object through the plate in 3 dimensions as if the plate were a window.</p>
<p>The problem with holograms is that they work best with coherent monochromatic light like a laser beam. Some techniques have been developed for white light holograms with various limitations.</p>
<p>Edit: interference pattern, not diffraction pattern</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A hologram is a &quot;smart&quot; diffraction grating. When you make a hologram, you capture the interference pattern between your target object/scene and a reference source of illumination in one plane. </p>
<p>Shining a similar source through the hologram recreates the original interference pattern. This reproduces a 3D view of the object you can see through the &quot;window&quot; of the hologram. </p>
<p>Some holograms are reflective. Sometimes the object/scene appears in front of the hologram instead of behind it. </p>
<p>But the basic idea is the same - the hologram diffracts/reflects light to capture and reproduce the light rays you'd see being reflected from a real object in a hemisphere around the holographic plate. </p>
<p>You can only record a hologram with coherent light. If you use broadband light, you get a 2D sum of the colours in the plane instead of a diffraction pattern which projects the light into 3D. </p>
<p>This is usually called a photograph.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A hologram is a three dimensional representation on a two dimensional surface. </p>
<p>In other words (x, y, z) is embedded on a surface (u, v). How is this possible? The trick is to encode a third dimension based on the phase of the light. That’s why a lot of holograms need a reference laser beam. This reference will determine the phase (think of phase as a difference of two sine waves. Two sine waves are identical if they have a phase difference as zero. They cancel if the phase is 180 degrees.) </p>
<p>So this phase, p, encodes a third dimension that is used to make a surface of a hologram able to display a three dimensional object. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Technically, a hologram is 2D.</p>
<p>A 3D &quot;hologram&quot; is called a volumetric image and its done using lasers to scatter the light across floating dust like particles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently wrote a literature review for my English class about 3D projections. I’m by no means an expert in the field, but I can share what I learned. Like other comments say, the video is not a hologram, just a flat video of a rotating image. </p>
<p>There are different types of techniques that all have their pros and cons, but none of them are currently able to produce a 3D image like the ones in sci fi (like the princess Leia projection or Star Trek’s holodeck). To my knowledge, there is no technique able to “trap light mid air.” (Which I am very sad about)</p>
<p>The techniques I found were:</p>
<p>Holography: it involves creating a diffraction pattern on a film using a reference and object beam. Once the diffraction pattern is made, when light hits it, it recreates the same light pattern that was present when making it. (Think about the little hologram sticker your credit card has). A lot of companies do computer generated holograms where lots of lasers create the diffraction pattern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Xp7BP00LuA4" target="_blank">Zebra Imaging</a> made a cool one. The bad part is they can only make a static image, not a video. And you always need a film for it.</p>
<p>Stereoscopy: basically 3D movies. Two cameras record the same thing a little distance apart. Both are shown on a screen but each image is filtered through the glasses you get. It mimics what your eyes do since your eyes are a little distance apart so they see two slightly different images. This is called binocularity.</p>
<p>Auto-Stereoscopy: the idea of making a 3D movie without glasses. This involves sending a different image through each eye. This can be achieved through something called a parallax barrier, which  is a screen with thin lines creating a diffraction pattern. So you see a slightly different image depending on where you stand in relation to the screen.</p>
<p>Volumetric Images: these are the closest to what we think of as real holograms but they have their fair share of problems. One study I found had a rotating helical surface with a projector, where a computer program calculated when to project a certain “dot” (called a voxel) so when it hit the screen, it would position that dot where they wanted it. If you do it fast enough, you can create an image. Another study had several layers of panels and a laser. The panels could be switched on or off, so that when they were on, and the laser hit a point, that point would light up. By calculating where the laser hit and what panel was on, it would create the dots where they wanted them. The one I was that was the closest to a real hologram though, was one where they created a <a href="https://youtu.be/1aAx2uWcENc" target="_blank">photophoretic trap</a>. This is basically invisible lasers trapping a cellulose particle in the air. Then they would shine a visible laser on the particle and it would light up. By moving it around they made lines and shapes. The problem is that you need a physical particle, something with mass, to trap to do this. You can’t just trap light mid air because light doesn’t have mass. Maybe one day we’ll be able to....</p>
<p>Anyways, for those knowledgeable in each field, I hope I didn’t misreport anything. Feel free to correct me if I did.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
