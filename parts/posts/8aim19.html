		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My best guess would be because you’re not entirely awake the whole time. As I found out this morning, I often find myself in instances where I THINK I’m just “closing my eyes and relaxing while awake”; but as it turns out, I just fell asleep again - just a much briefer sleep cycle.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting phenomenon. Time of course continues to pass at the normal pace while we sleep, but our perception of time is temporarily suspended. This can be attributed to the altered state of consciousness associated with sleep. We are kept unaware of our surroundings, which would certainly make it difficult to remain informed of the passing of time. When we awaken in the morning, we have the memory of going to bed the night before, but new memories are rarely made while we sleep. Therefore, upon waking up the following morning it feels as if no time has passed, but our minds reason that many hours have elapsed simply because it is now light outside, and perhaps your bedside alarm clock is telling you that it is morning.</p>
<p>TLDR: you don’t have a reference point of time because you’re asleep and you have to “make” new memories as you awaken. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it’s something to do with your brains sense of time. Everyone knows the 5 senses right? Well turns out there’s actually more like 20 “senses,” with one of them being a sense of time.  This is what tells the difference between waiting a minute and waiting an hour. When you go to sleep that part of your brain shuts off as well which would in turn skew your sense of time. And since you are just waking up that part of your brain isn’t functioning at full capacity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
