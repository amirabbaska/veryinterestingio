		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope! In order to see something, light must interact with it and reflect  into our eyes. However light (photons), being uncharged particles, is generally kind of terrible at interacting with atoms. Having a 1 atom thick wall would give the light just a single chance to interact and reflect. Since the odds are so low for this, the plank would be almost invisible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have a couple factors you're missing.</p>
<p>1) What angle am I looking at it
2) Angle and light output of light source
3) Ambient conditions
4) Material of the wall.</p>
<p>I mean if a light souce from behind me that I couldn't see hit a gold wall, even 1 atom thick, in a dark room with nothing else and the source was bright ebough then yes.  A very small portion of the light would reflect back due to the 1 atom thickness lettong most light through.  So what ever object you are looking at would have to be a highly reflective metal, like gold or steal.  It would be very difficult to create the conditions  that would allow this to happen though becuase of enough light from the source itself becones visible to you then it will wash out the reflection from the wall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on several things(material, light, angle, etc), but yes, it could be seen. To pick one example, Graphene can be seen. Graphene is a 1-atom thick arrangement of carbon atoms, and it absorbs about 2.3% to 2.6% percent of visible light, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene#Optical" target="_blank">Wikipedia even has a photo</a>. </p>
<p>More than that, you could probably test your idea to the size too. It does not matter to your question if it's a 1mx1m or 1cmx1cm sheet, but graphene could also probably hold up to a 1mx1m sheet (hanging, not a plank standing by itself).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Nobel announcement illustrated this by saying that a 1 square meter graphene hammock would support a 4 kg cat but would weigh only as much as one of the cat's whiskers, at 0.77 mg (about 0.001% of the weight of 1 m2 of paper).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can actually make graphene at home and test this.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the plank was made of gold, I think there is a very good chance you could see it, because of the nature of the large nucleus gold has.     I think this is a question you should definitely r/askscience, because there may be many unexpected answers depending on what the plank is made of.   Also to the 'can I walk through the plank safely?' Question.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
