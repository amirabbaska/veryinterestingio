		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rap is simply the act of rapping, which is spoken word lyricism, usually with a flow or delivery that matches the beat it's delivered over. Rap is often utilised in hip-hop music, but you can have hip-hop music without rap. Rap is also utilised heavily in grime and, to a lesser extent, metal and rock, and I'm sure also in a plethora of other genres that I'm personally unaware of.</p>
<p>Hip-hop is a culture, but is often also used to describe a music genre born of this culture. Hip-hop music is often  associated with DJing, turntabling, scratching and sampling. As previously stated, rapping is often a part of Hip-hop music but is not a necessity. </p>
<p>Edit: there's so much more that I could put in this, but for the sake of assuming OP is an old man after a quick answer I tried to make it quite concise. There are a lot of aspects of Hip-hop culture that I've not included, some great examples are given by others in this thread </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rap is to Hip-hop what Singing is to Jazz. Jazz can exist without singing, singing is an element of jazz that is optional and not limited to jazz alone. Singing can also be found in other genres and jazz without singing is still jazz. </p>
<p>Equally hip-hop can exist without rap, rap is an element of hip-hop that is optional. There's a ton of instrumental hip-hop or music with just singing that I would still categorize as hip-hop. Also rap isn't limited to hip-hop alone. Nu-metal (Linkin Park) is a good example but by now most major genres feature rap at some point. Also, as others have mentioned, hip-hop turned into a culture that reaches beyond music (graffiti, dance, etc) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the answers here are only getting it partly right.</p>
<p>DJ Afrika Bambaataa was one of the originators of HipHop. At the outset, he identified four elements to Hip Hop culture: rapping, breakdancing, graffiti and djing.</p>
<p>These days, most people don't practice all four. But the word Hip Hop still refers to those elements, with rapping and DJing being the most popularly associated with the term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
