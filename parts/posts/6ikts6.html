		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physical oceanographer here.
There was an article published in Science 7  years ago answering this exact  a question using Paleo oceanographic  evidence from the last deglaciation (Synchronous deglacial overturning and water mass source changes by Natalie Roberts and others).</p>
<p>Deglaciation does, by simple math make the world's oceans less salty but not in the way you think it would. It takes gargantuan amounts of energy to mix water masses with different properties, so instead of the entire ocean reducing its spicyness (salt concentrations), you'd see certain currents take the biggest hits while others remain pretty much unchanged. </p>
<p>Now, the ocean currents that have been shown to be most affected by current and past deglaciation are those feeding deep, cold water to the world's oceans (water can only sink to the bottom of the ocean near Antarctica and Greenland). In case of a total deglaciation, this supply would stop, meaning that:</p>
<p><strong>The rates at which deep water resurfaces and that at which surface water sinks to abyssal levels would reduce drastically. Freshwater, the article finds, would remain in the upper ocean and drive overturning there.</strong></p>
<p>In short, a deglaciation partially stops the exchange of energy, salt, and heat between the deep and upper ocean, leaving only topography-driven and tidally-aided sources for turbulence to cause 'communication' between these two layers. This is pretty much how lakes work (no tides though, but being smaller, lakes can have their bottom layers accelerated by wind under some special conditions), so oceans would become much more similar to them. This is by no means that currents would stop (wind and tides would remain stirring everything up), but it is only the deep/upper water exchange that would pretty much disappear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you define &quot;saltiness&quot; as <a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=salinity&amp;spf=1498068817254" target="_blank">salinity</a>, then yes.  It's actually a fairly big concern associated with the risk of glacial melt because it's widely believed that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation" target="_blank">salinity influences ocean currents</a>.</p>
<p>One concern is that a massive influx in freshwater to the ocean could alter or even shut down major ocean currents, and ocean currents are what help keep the ocean oxygenated so that fish can live in them.  We don't know for sure, but the concern is that global warming could cause serious disruption in the ocean food chain, and that would have ramifications for the food chain we're a part of too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Yes, salinity would be affected which also affects density. The combination of temperature and density variation in the oceans is what maintains the ocean currents. This is another reason why melting ice caps are dangerous as we cannot survive unless our oceans have these currents. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kind of. The fresh and salt water wont mix easily and would likely just end up distributed in &quot;streams&quot; of fresh water or very low salinity water through the ocean currents. The result would be a shift in the oceans ability to circulate water temps at different levels (you would loose much of the deep sea heat exchange). </p>
<p>This effect is what they fear will slow or all together stop the North Atlantic pump. Such an event would be catastrophic to most of Europe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
