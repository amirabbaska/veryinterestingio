There were so, so many great responses and I have to call out /u/JohnnyJordaan as being my personal hero in this thread. His comments were thoughtful, respectful, well informed and very helpful. He's the Gold Standard of a great Redditor as far as I'm concerned. </p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure that this subject can <em>truly</em> be explained like I'm 5 (this is some heavy stuff for having no mass) but a lot of you gave truly spectacular answers and I'm coming away with this with a lot more than I had yesterday before I posted it. Great job, Reddit. This is why I love you.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is an incredible answer by /u/corpuscle634 when this was asked a year ago in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150529092913/http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/22pi7o/eli5_why_does_light_travel/" target="_blank">this thread</a>. (Scroll to first answer.)</p>
<p>Edit: an updated TL:DR by the same user:</p>
<p><strong>If you give energy to something without mass, the only form it can take is motion - you can't have a stationary massless particle, since mass literally is &quot;the energy something has when it isn't moving.&quot; Photons have no mass, so they're never stationary.</strong></p>
<p>And if that's still too complicated here's a another answer from /u/kvandy15:</p>
<p>&quot;The speed of anything is basically determined by it's weight and the amount energy that is pushing it. You can push your toy cars really fast but if you try to push a real car it's a lot harder. That's because it weighs more. Light weighs nothing, so it moves at full speed all the time with no push at all.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since Op asked specifically about why light move at all, so the thing is light is an electromagnetic phenomenon. </p>
<p>Basically a charge at rest induces electric field and charge at uniform motions induces magnetic field and last but not the least charge in accelerated motion induces electro-magnetic field which is what electromagnetic waves are. Light  only occupies a tiny spectrum of electromagnetic spectrum with radio, xray , microwave, infrared, uv , gamma etc being others. </p>
<p>The thing is rate of change of electric field with respect to time (time derivative) induces a magnetic field which varies with space(space derivative). So you have lets say an electric field changing in time this creates a magnetic field which varies with space and since it varies with space it moves in space rather in time and then this space varying magnetic field induces a time varying electric field and so on the process continues. Hence a source(charge) sitting at one place can have electromagnetic wave(radiation) emitted from it. </p>
<p>For eg antenna, the antenna in your phone or to understand imagine a walkie talkie with its antenna protruding out of it has electrons (charge) moving back and forth in it which creates above described phenomenon of changing electric and magnetic field and thus the wave from it can be received by receiving antenna which starts to make charges on receiving antenna go crazy and move back and forth which is what current is (motion of charges is current) and then everything works.</p>
<p>Notice that in vaccum , no energy is lost so em wave(light) can go on infinitely until there is some stuff to absorb it . And since we have atmosphere and a hell lot of things which absorb it the signal gets weaken and we need repeater and shit.</p>
<p>Hope this clears something.</p>
<p><strong>TL;dr:</strong> wiggling of charge creates em wave(light) which travels effortlessly in vaccum (why is explained by some maths thanks to maxwell and others)  but not so easily in presence of other stuff.Thats why you see light from galaxy billions of light year away because nothing absorbed it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how when you push things, the heavier they are, the harder it is to get them moving ?</p>
<p>Well, light is one of the few things which weigh <em>nothing</em>. It's not even &quot;very small&quot;, it's actually nothing. So it's not just super easy to push light away from you : it is <strong>infinitely</strong> easy.</p>
<p>Because it is infinitely easy, even if you aren't trying very hard, or if you aren't trying at all, whenever light comes in contact with you, you push it back away and it takes off at the fastest speed anything can take.</p>
<p>You see, the &quot;speed of light&quot; is a pretty bad name, it should actually be &quot;the speed of particles which have no mass, in a vacuum&quot;. But that is quite a mouthful, so we just say &quot;the speed of light&quot; for shorts.</p>
<p>I'm probably missing a few details here. That's the explanation I was planning on giving to my children when I have some, so if you feel like helping me not make them stupid, please do !</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're getting a lot of over complicated answers here, so I will be brief. Photons have no mass, that's just how they are. It's an intrinsic property of photons in the same what that the density of a material is always the same. Since they have no mass, they have no inertia as you would expect given Newtons equation F=ma. This means you need exactly zero force to make a photon move at the speed of light. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually all matter and energy can be considered moving the speed of light through spacetime, it's just when you look at speed through space (without time) that speeds vary.</p>
<p>Consider moving in two dimensions, like on a map. You can travel straight North at 10 mph, or straight West at 10 mph. But if you travel straight Northwest at 10 mph, then you're going less than 10 mph along the North axis, and less than 10 mph along the West axis. The combination of those is 10 mph.</p>
<p>In spacetime, space can be considered &quot;North&quot; while time is &quot;West&quot;. Light is going as fast as possible &quot;North&quot;, so it can't travel at all along the time axis. Most of us are devoting pretty much all our velocity towards the time axis, so we don't move very fast through space. But if we accelerate faster and faster, we're not actually going faster in spacetime, we're just swinging that constant speed away from the time axis more towards the space axis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
