There were so, so many great responses and I have to call out /u/JohnnyJordaan as being my personal hero in this thread. His comments were thoughtful, respectful, well informed and very helpful. He's the Gold Standard of a great Redditor as far as I'm concerned. </p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure that this subject can <em>truly</em> be explained like I'm 5 (this is some heavy stuff for having no mass) but a lot of you gave truly spectacular answers and I'm coming away with this with a lot more than I had yesterday before I posted it. Great job, Reddit. This is why I love you.</p></div></div>
