		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human blood types most likely came to exist to fend off infectious diseases. The incompatibility of some blood types, however, is just an accident of evolution.</p>
<p>There are four main blood types. Blood type A is the most ancient, and it existed before the human species evolved from its hominid ancestors. Type B is thought to have originated some 3.5 million years ago, from a genetic mutation that modified one of the sugars that sit on the surface of red blood cells. Starting about 2.5 million years ago, mutations occurred that rendered that sugar gene inactive, creating type O, which has neither the A or B version of the sugar. And then there is AB, which is covered with both A and B sugars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood types are part of immune system.</p>
<p>Immune system genes work differently than normal genes.</p>
<p>For most genes, there's usually &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; variant for every environment - like if you like in Africa, genes for dark skin are &quot;better&quot; than genes for light skin etc. Organisms living in similar environment will end up similar, as genes different from what's best will fade away with time. Or maybe multiple variants are just as good.</p>
<p>Genes for immune system work completely differently. Here &quot;better&quot; means as different from others as possible - if your immune system is same as other people, their diseases will infect you, and there's a lot of possible infection sources.</p>
<p>If it's very different, their diseases can't affect you, and any disease that would affect you but not them - well, who are you going to catch them from?</p>
<p>That's why immune system genes show much higher levels of diversity than other genes.</p>
<p>(having unusual immune system has downside in that it might cause immune conflict between mother and growing baby)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok.  Lets start with the basics.  After whole blood donation, it is separated into: packed red cells (what the layman usually just refers to as blood), plasma, and platelets.  Red cells have antigens on their surface which determines what type it would be categorized as.  These antigens are really just proteins which fit like lock and key to corresponding antibodies.  The whole idea behind blood banking is that you don't want the lock to find the key.  Then the cells start sticking together and let's just say it's not good. There are two main antigens. A &amp; B.  If you have both, you are type AB.  If you have none, you are type O.  Typically you have antibodies in your plasma that correspond with the other existing antigens; the one(s) you don't have. So...I'm getting to the point here...Type O is the universal donor for red cells because they do not have any Antigens on their surface, and Type AB is a universal plasma donor (because the  cell have both antigens, they do not have the A or B antibodies in their plasma!!).  I am a medically laboratory scientist and one of the hats I wear is a blood banker in my local hospital.  Please restrain from spreading misinformation.  It can be deadly.  It is not as simple as saying hey I'm type O, I can give my blood to anyone!  If you tried that, it could be absolutely devastating. Remember someone who is type O has antibodies against both A and B cells in their plasma and could kill someone type A, B, or AB.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.  Stay woke my friends.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, evolution does not make sense in terms of &quot;why&quot; and &quot;purpose&quot;. Changes are 100% random. There is, however, a logic to whether or not they are passed on. A better way to think of it would be &quot;How did humans come to have different blood types, and what is the benefit, if any?&quot; </p>
<p>It may seem like a semantic argument, but the difference is important. While it may be true that if a species didn't evolve a specific trait at a specific time it would not have survived, it is never true that a species evolved a specific trait for the purpose of surviving that evolutionary pressure. That is not to say that evolutionary pressure does not influence the types of random mutations that tend to be successful. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
