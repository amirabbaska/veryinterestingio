		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hair is not like a plant, so the concept of what you might think a root is doesn't apply to hair.</p>
<p>Hair grows out of a special hole in the skin called a follicle. At the bottom that hole, there is a device called a papilla which is responsible for generating hair. The papilla usually remains intact, or will heal, when you pull out the hair. So you continue generating hair as normal, it just takes extra time for the new shaft to get long enough to reach the surface of the skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hair doesn't just sprout at random locations on your skin, it grows from a specialized organ called a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Hair_follicle-en.svg" target="_blank">hair follicle</a>. When you pluck a hair, the follicle is still in place and starts making a new one.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong> Since this turned out to be a popular question, here is a little more detail on that process. There is a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v22/n4/fig_tab/nbt0404-393_F1.html" target="_blank">bulge</a> on the side of the follicle that contains the stem cells for the organ. As long as those stem cells survive, they can <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v22/n4/full/nbt0404-393.html" target="_blank">regenerate the rest of the follicle as well as the skin nearby</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Hair grows in 3 different stages:  Anagen, catagen, telogen
Anagen phase: new hair is produced as new keratinized cells are created in the hair follicle. Activity is greater in the bulb (little black part at the end of a hair when you pluck it) which pushes down into the dermis and swells with cell mitosis in matrix. New cells form hair and root sheaths while older part is pushed upward.
Catagen: the transition stage. Mitosis ceases. Hair grows upward and detaches from dermal papilla.
Telogen: the final resting stage. Hair moves up follicle and is ready to shed. Hair bulb is no longer active. Hair is released and is only attached by epidermal cells
Everyone's hair growth rate is different as well as regeneration rate </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
