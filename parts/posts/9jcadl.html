<p>As you age the muscles in the eye do not weaken, rather the lens becomes full of cells and impossible to manipulate. Thus it cannot be stretched to accommodate focussing on nearby objects. All older people get this problem and hence need reading glasses. People who already have refractive error (normally because their eyeball is the wrong length) will gain this problem on top of whatever issue they already have. This is why varifocal glasses exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I am seeing a lot of people on here commenting about how we strengthen our muscles and build them up, etc. This is true for skeletal muscles like the muscles surrounding the eyes, but not for the muscles of the ciliary body-the ones controlling how much the lens in the eye is flexed and relaxed, and therefore focused. They are smooth muscle like those in our esophagus or intestines, and cannot be strengthened the same way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey wait I know how to answer this!  Optician and opthalmic tech here.  Your vision is not generally related to muscles in your eye.  Your focus and vision have to do with the combined power of your cornea, and the internal lens called the crystalline lens.  </p>
<p>Muscles do contract that lens to see things closer than 20 ft (assuming the eyes power to by typical or 20/20 to start).  As you age, that lens grows internal layers (think a reverse onion).  It becomes less pliable.  So you end up holding things further away from your face due to lack of &quot;accommodation&quot;.  Eventually you may get reading glasses to make up for the lack of ability to increase the magnification on that internal lens.  </p>
<p>Also, this lens filters UV to protect your retina.  So it ends up cloudy over time.....which is a cataract.  </p>
<p>None of that however is related to the muscles that move your eye.....or flex the lens.  </p>
<p>Lots of variations based on people's unique vision.....but those are the basics.  I hope it helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>simple answer: the muscle groups in the body you refer to are striated or, skeletal, muscle and can be built up. when you refer to eye muscles i'm not sure if you're referring to your vision overall at distance, which has little to do with any muscles, or your near vision, which does, but relies on smooth muscles which cannot be built up through exercise. there are two major competing hypothesis on why our near vision declines with time. i refer you <a href="https://www.aao.org/bcscsnippetdetail.aspx?id=f5f61688-98cd-4e30-84c0-b9acf775950c" target="_blank">here</a> for a more thorough explanation. neither accounts fully for the changes we see in human vision but the helmholtz hypothesis has been more practically verified. it basically says that as we age the increasing inflexibility the the lens (which supplies our near focal power) causes its conributions to our near vision to lessen. the muscles that cause changing of lens shape, the ciliary body muscles, presumably remain equally strong but unable to effect the same changes in  a more rigid lens later in life when compared with earlier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscles are like a bunch of guys playing tug of war. Just like the guys in the tug of war, muscles can only pull in one direction or the other. No pushing allowed.</p>
<p>When your eyeball moves in one direction, the other team kind of “gives up” and lets the opposite team on the other side of the eyeball win. They don’t let go completely, but control it to make sure the other team doesn’t pull too hard so as to not damage the eye. </p>
<p>When you add an extra load to one side of the tug of war, say, a 4x4 truck for team B, then team A is going to get overloaded pretty quickly when it’s time to pull. They’re still going to try their best not to lose and because they don’t want the body to get hurt, but if the truck pulls hard enough, this makes some of the people on team A trip and fall over.</p>
<p>If that happens, your body will put more guys on team A to better handle the next time a tuck shows up on the other side of the rope, which makes the team (and the muscle) bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Bodybuilders and weightlifters take advantage of this effect to get bigger and stronger and will use bigger and bigger trucks over time.</p>
<p>EDIT: This explains the muscles around the eye and is a good descriptor for what happens when a muscle gets built up and why it doesn’t happen with eye muscles (can use weights for your eyeballs), but is inadequate for describing all of the types of ocular degeneration which occur with age. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
