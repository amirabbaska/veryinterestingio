		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For things like tax purposes they can't say they lost $10 if the item was never sold, but instead stolen. If insured: they will only cover the $1    </p>
<p>Edit: for extra clarification -- if the insurance company did pay them $10 for that $1 item, at that point the insurance company would be paying into the profit center of the business, paying for their expenses, costs, and such.  There are some exotic forms of insurance, but for the most part they will only cover what you lost and what you paid for it, they aren't going to cover what you <em>might</em> have made in profit </p>
<p>For things like internal metrics, they can totally say &quot;We had $10 worth of potential revenue vanish this year due to theft&quot;</p>
<p>Value can only be assigned once an actual transaction takes place, until then the only value associated with it is the $1 the company paid for it.   </p>
<p>Otherwise there's nothing to stop crazy/greedy people from saying &quot;This Coca-Cola bottle we have here for sale is worth $500, crap it got stolen, now we can declare a loss and not pay as much taxes&quot;.   Nope, doesn't work like that .</p>
<p>The age old saying is very true:  &quot;It's only worth what someone is willing to pay&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The reason is that, as you see from the other comments, there are many different ways to understand loss. One way the law deals with this is by choosing the idea of loss that fits the blameworthiness of the wrong doer. For example, someone accidentally knocks over and breaks a glass figurine, they are likely to pay only replacement costs. Whereas if that same person purposely broke or stole the figurine, their worse behavior would allow for a greater recovery. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>b. Shoplifting. Shoplifting shall consist of any one or more of the following acts:</p>
<ol>
<li>For any person purposely to take possession of, carry away, transfer or cause to be carried away or transferred, any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale by any store or other retail mercantile establishment with the intention of depriving the merchant of the possession, use or benefit of such merchandise or converting the same to the use of such person <strong>without paying to the merchant the full retail value thereof.</strong></li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a GameStop employee of 9 years, let me throw in my 2 cents...</p>
<p>We are particularly careful of theft of new games and systems.  This is because there is not much profit in the sale of those items.  For instance, a $60 new game costs the company $55 to buy, netting them a $5 profit (these numbers fluctuate between games, but generally this is the largest profit margin).  This means they have fronted all that money.  Now, when a new game is stolen, we are at a loss of that $55 of fronted money.  To make that back, we must now sell 11 copies of the game to generate $55 ($5 of profit per game).  </p>
<p>Systems are even worse.  A $400 console generally costs the company around $390 &quot;wholesale&quot;.  That means there is a $10 profit per console sold (of course the market here is to put consoles in the hands of customers, thus enabling them to buy games, controllers, etc.).  However, when a new console is stolen, we must then make up that $390 of fronted money... meaning we must sell 39 consoles just to break even ($10 profit per console sale x 39 consoles = $390).  It can take all month or more to make up for the theft of a console.</p>
<p>However, on the other side, used sales have much larger profit margins to keep the company afloat.  They may buy a PS3  off a customer for $40, and resell it for $120.  That's a 300% profit margin.  Due to this, theft of used merchandise is not as big of a deal.  In fact, I specifically remember one year around Christmas, our District Manager told us to take all of our used console boxes and put them by the door.  The idea behind this was that with them being right in their face, more people were likely to pick one up, have it physically in their hands, and thus be more likely to buy it.  I argued that putting them right by the door was just asking for theft.  The DM told me he would rather every console be stolen than miss out on this opportunity.  We ended up getting like 5 consoles stolen, but we easily doubled and possibly tripled our Used Console sales.  At that +300% margin, the bonus sales more than made up for what I deemed &quot;acceptable theft&quot;.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, it's usually based on what the company has invested in the product, not potential sale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
