		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep is controlled by two systems. The sleep-wake homeostasis system and the circadian rhythm. The sleep-wake system works by making you more sleepy the longer you have been awake and less sleepy the longer you have been asleep. In your case you spent the same amount of time asleep, so this isn't a sleep-wake homeostasis problem. It's the circadian rhythm! Which uses melatonin and cortisol to boost you while your awake and help you stay asleep. Generally, because of this 2am-4am you are the most sleepy and 2pm-4pm is the second most sleepy time. However, if you are a night owls or a morning person the circadian rhythm can be shifted by an hour or two. Also, if you are a teenager or a young adult then the circadian rhythm is also different. The peak sleep time 3am -7am and 2pm-5pm</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can I tag a question onto this ? Why do I sleep better during the day than at night, even though I set alarms to wake up during the day for a YEAR(!) ?</p>
<p>If I sleep at night, say, 10pm-midnight, I'll sleep for 12-14h before I wake up naturally, and if I don't set a bed time, my bed time will get later and later..until I go bed around 10am-12pm. If I go bed then, I wake up at 7pm on the dot, feeling refreshed as a summer rain.</p>
<p>I've been trying for years to &quot;correct&quot; this but I just can't. For example at the moment I'm going bed at 11pm and waking up at 2pm (with an alarm, if I don't set an alarm I wake up even later, earlier and I feel like absolute death). Why can't I sleep a normal amount of time during the night ?</p>
<p>PS. I'll sleep 16h np if I'm left alone :(</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Lightly stretch for 5 minutes focusing on your breathing. By this time coffee is ready and so to is your morning sphincter spawn ( your fiber game is good, yes?). Release it into the wild. Enjoy coffee.</p>
<p>By this point (wake up + 10 minutes or so) you should be fully ready to start your day. </p>
<p>Have a light breakfast full of good things like fiber and protein and some sort of actual vegetable. I like yogurt granola blueberries, whatever cut veggies i have in fridge, carrots, broccoli crowns, snap peas. This is wake up + 30 or so.</p>
<p>Brush teeth and such last and you're out the door</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>we all have sleep phases.  if you can't wake up early, you have  delayed sleep phase.  it may have evolved from certain members of society keeping a watch over everyone else at night.
i used to work office day jobs and was literally dead for many years.  then i scrapped it all and got a night job cleaning offices.  i couldn't be happier.  i don't even <em>need</em> to sleep per se, i mean, i don't dread my job and could go in if i was tired and not suffer at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
