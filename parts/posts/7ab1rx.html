		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mandatory &quot;I'm a doctor&quot; disclaimer. In your body you have cannabinoid receptors scattered throughout your physiology (CB1 in the CNS and CB2 in the PNS). These cannabinoid receptors are specifically designed to be triggered by a substance manufactured by the body (endogenous) called anadamide.<br />
Anandamide that has many functions within the body associated with fertility and immune function. Current working theory is that the level gets extremely high right after childbirth. Common side effects of marijuana intoxication include short term memory loss, increased appetite, Euphoria, and paranoia.  The same side effects would be beneficial immediately after giving birth including short term memory loss causing you to forget the pain you just endured, increased appetite to replenish lost nutrients during childbirth, euphoria making you happy with your new baby, and paranoia preventing anything detrimental happening to the child.
Again, this is working theory, and there is a lot of research currently in the subject. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We have cannabinoid receptors. When synapses in the brain &quot;fire&quot; a chemical is released to these receptors that prevent that from firing again for some time. THC blocks these receptors and allow these synapses to fire multiple times without a resting period. So if I remember correctly, these synapses are all firing randomly.</p>
<p>This effect take solace in the reward center of the brain.</p>
<p>I found a nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/oeF6rFN9org" target="_blank">video</a> that'll help anyone understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dopamine is one of the brain's most important painkillers. When you're not in pain, the brain releases neurotransmitters into the system that inhibit the release of dopamine. When you experience pain of sorts, your brain releases a natural cannabinoid called anandamide that binds to the receptor that triggers the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters, which allows dopamine (uninhibited) to then flow freely into the brain's synapse. </p>
<p>When you smoke cannabis, THC (the main psychoactive compound in cannabis) mimics the natural cannabinoid anandamide and binds to the same receptor that prevents the release of the dopamine inhibitors. It doesn't mimic the actual neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin (the way drugs like meth and cocaine do) and so it doesn't cause your brain to work in reverse, which is why using cannabis in moderation doesn't appear to do any seriously long-term damage to your brain.</p>
<p>This is a cool interactive explainer on how different drugs affect your brain that we used in middle school health class (requires flash): <a href="http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/mouse/" target="_blank">http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/mouse/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It contains a chemical (called Tetrahydrocannabinol aka THC, the white dusty crystals). When that is inhaled or ingested, the chemical gets into your blood stream.  </p>
<p>THC is a psychoactive thing, meaning that when it gets into the human brain, it causes a reaction that messes with the brain. Depending on who you ask, THC may be there to protect the plant from being eaten - predators wouldn't want to go back to something that made their heads go weird.  </p>
<p>It just so happens that some humans like the reaction it causes! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, being 'high' is a term that can be described for a variety of novel and stimulating experiences. </p>
<p>The high tends not to last if one does not make jokes, laughs, and engages in a modified form of zen. </p>
<p>Thus, THC and other cannabinoids(which most strains(plant subgenotypes (circles of weed)) have been modified to increase the level of THC).</p>
<p>It can get old unless one is using it to have therapy. It fits in well with the phenomenon of hypnosis.</p>
