		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's partly the same reason why small animals can jump several times their own height and lift many times their own weight. If you scale down yourself, the rate your muscles weaken is not so much compared to the rate your weight decreases. So you'd feel super powerful if you were scaled down, and your energy would last longer. </p>
<p>Gravity is just harder on you the larger you are, in a way your larger muscles can't compensate for, so you have to overcompensate with muscles to stay as energetic as a kid.</p>
<p>This is also why female gymnasts are typically on their top during their mid teens - it's more beneficial to them to have a light body to work with than it is to build the muscles to be able to handle a larger body (while males can build larger muscles easier to  compensate for their growth).</p>
<p>And also why children tend to skip at some point around 5 years old instead of walk or run, at a certain body size/weight proportion, it's been shown to be the more efficient, just like astronauts adopted skipping with the moon's low gravity.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add onto some other comments, children don’t hold back. They use every last shred of energy they have and then collapse, knowing that if anything happens, and adult will deal with it. </p>
<p>Adults need reserve energy to stay alert, deal with issues, walk themselves home, etc. Children can fall asleep anywhere, safe in the knowledge they’ll wake up in their own beds. If we fall asleep in public, we may get robbed or at least have the cops called. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A part of this is explained by the fact that the world, to a child, is hyperstimulating. A substantial percentage of their daily experience is completely new, and their brains are geared in to devour all of that substance. Do you feel suddenly energized when something new, exciting, and revelatory becomes part of your understanding? <em>That</em> is how children are living much of the time. Of course, they burn out too. </p>
<p>This is only a small piece, explained for a subjective understanding. In sure the actual biology is quite co.plex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Children's cells and organs are working near perfectly. All metabolism and biological processes humming along just right. This goes well into teens. By the time you're coming up on 30s - sadly, the processes of aging and things that cause us to die are starting to compound. DNA damage, organ functioning, enzymatic processes are not working so well. Manifests itself as lethargy and sometimes disease. Yay. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
