		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever seen a sign on the wall of a shop that says something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good</li>
<li>Fast</li>
<li>Cheap</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pick Two</strong></p>
<p>That's essentially what's going on with our brains. A human brain uses up about 20% of the food we eat everyday, which is a lot for something that doesn't have to move us around or pump blood or anything 'strenuous' like that - but they could use a lot more. A computer that could do what our brains do would be enormous and would use thousands or millions of kWh of electricity. So, our brains are actually pretty efficient or &quot;cheap&quot; for what they do, which includes things like figuring out the right things to say and how to pronounce each word whenever we have to talk.</p>
<p>So, if they're &quot;cheap&quot; that means that they can't be as good and fast as we'd like. They're going to make mistakes sometimes. It's better to get the words right 99% of the time and be pretty fast and efficient, then it is to get the words right 100% of the time and be huge and use way more calories all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> - For a non ELI5 way to think of it we can <a href="http://www.definitionsblog.com/2017/01/animal-learning.html" target="_blank">think of our brains as lossy compression of things we've learned</a>. Instead of perfectly mapping inputs to outputs we map the responses on top of each other where possible, which results in a network. This saves a ton of space and energy, but it means that often our responses are &quot;good enough&quot; instead of being exactly what we might've wanted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our brains are hardwired in a way where each cell (neuron) is connected to many other cells. It's like a computer where one wire connects to other ports and wires to create a while computer. Once in a while, a neuron will fire when we are speaking but will go down a little different path which our brains are not used to. This will cause some lag just like a computer program that was not used in a while. This can ultimately lead to a stutter. To my knowledge, this occurs randomly and unpredictably. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering the same thing when I was talking to my brother in-law about camera equipment and gear (he wants to buy my sister a camera for her birthday). Photography is a nice hobby of mine which I am passionate about. When I was telling him all about it, I was getting out of breath and was stumbling with my words a lot. I had to stop talking and take a few deep breaths in the middle of the conversation to recollect myself and catch my breath. I think I was just too excited to talk, and wasn't thinking about breathing and exactly how I was going to word something. I had too many thoughts in my head at once and wanted to say it all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can control it to a certain extent if you can control your breathing.
Cross your arms in front of you and notice how you breathe into your chest, stretch your arms to the sides and notice how you breathe down into your belly.
When you stutter or mispronounce your words it's because you get excited, nervous or wound up in some other way, you're almost always breathing with your chest.
This is your body's emergency breathing system, and using it also produces cortisol, the stress-hormone causing you to loose full perspective on what you want to say and be more focused on 'getting the sentence out' (often because people think the listeners will lose attention if they talk normally) leading to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2127686/How-stress-shut-command-centre-brain.htm" target="_blank">frontal lobe shut-down</a> essentially shutting down your capacity to think broadly.</p>
<p>Our brain talks to our nervous system but our nervous system also talks back, if you can force yourself to breathe right you won't fumble words that way. Also, people will perceive you as more confident if you do this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
