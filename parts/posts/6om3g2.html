Why can the same allergen be rubbed on skin in some cases and no reaction occurs, or post stomach not cause reactions throughout the rest of the digestive systems? </p>
<p>I am assuming there is no reaction after leaving the stomach due to the acid denaturing the protein responsible, but why is this the case for other parts of the skin/body?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The antigens have to be bound to IgE and then end up activating immune cells (mast cells especially). That's just much easier to accomplish in the respiratory and digestive tract. Unbroken skin is an excellent barrier for entry, and the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract make up most of the rest of the barrier between &quot;outside&quot; and &quot;inside&quot; of the body (the gut lumen etc. is topologically outside the body).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All tissues have tissue-associated immune cells. These tissue-associated immune cells home to the resident tissue by a large number of proteins given off by that tissue. Sure, most immune cells circulate all the time, but the pathogens your toe sees is drastically different from those in your large intestines. </p>
<p>They are also &quot;primed&quot; to react very quickly, very potently, and very specifically to certain pathogens. As you may infer, these 'resident' immune cell don't circulate as much, and thus don't give the same reaction if the pathogen is introduced elsewhere.</p>
<p>The GI tract is especially made to do this through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucosa-associated_lymphoid_tissue" target="_blank">Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT)</a>. The lymphoid tissue is so well organized that it look almost like lymph nodes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
