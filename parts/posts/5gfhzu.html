		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The notion that only massive objects carry momentum stems from classical, Newtonian, mechanics, which has been shown to just be an approximation for the more complete theory of relativity.</p>
<p>In Newtonian physics, momentum is given by the expression p = m * v, which would imply that massless objects have no momentum. But this expression is only a good approximation when velocities are low (with respect to the speed of light). Since light travels at the speed of light, this condition is obviously not met.</p>
<p>From relativity, the following expression can be obtained:</p>
<p>E^2 = (m c^(2))^2 + (p c)^2</p>
<p>where E is the energy of the particle/object, m is the mass, p the momentum and c the speed of light.</p>
<p>For objects that have non-zero mass that are at rest (so zero momentum), this reduces to:</p>
<p>E = m c^2</p>
<p>For objects that have zero mass, such as photons, this expression reduces to the expression for momentum of photons:</p>
<p>E = p c</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, p = mv is a valid approximation for low velocities. But nobody has yet explained what it's an approximation <em>of</em>.</p>
<p>The full relativistic equation for momentum is:</p>
<p>p = mv / (1 - v^(2)/c^(2))^(1/2),</p>
<p>where c is the speed of light. When v is much less than c, v^(2)/c^(2) is approximately equal to 0, so that the entire denominator is approximately equal to 1, and we recover the classical approximation p = mv.</p>
<p>But what happens when m = 0?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that massless things MUST travel at the speed of light. So to answer the question, we take our relativistic equation for momentum and do two things to it: we set m = 0, AND we set v = c:</p>
<p>p = (0)c / (1 - c^(2)/c^(2))^(1/2)</p>
<p>= 0 / (1 - 1)^(1/2)</p>
<p>= 0 / 0.</p>
<p>Remember: 0 / 0 isn't the same thing as zero. Zero divided by zero is UNDEFINED.</p>
<p>What can we conclude from this?</p>
<p>Not much! At best we can say that we haven't <em>ruled out</em> the possibility of massless things having momentum. And indeed it turns out that massless things <em>do</em> carry momentum, but of course we need other equations to quantify it (E = pc = hf).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, let's for the sake of argument accept that p=mv, then photons would have no momentum.  By that same argument they would have no kinetic energy either since KE=1/2mv^2 . You've accepted that the formula for KE doesn't describe photons, then neither does p=mv describe the momentum. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Einstein's theory of relativity tells us gives us:
E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2</p>
<p>If momentum is 0 (the object is not moving), then we get the familiar E = mc^2.</p>
<p>If mass is 0, then E = pc.
Rearranging for momentum gives p = E/c.</p>
<p>The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Where λ is its wavelength and h is Plank's constant.</p>
<p>Combining these last two formulas tells us p=h/λ.
So, the momentum of the photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength.</p>
<p>Conservation of momentum tells us that the law's of physics are the same across space. Conservation of energy tells us that the law's of physics are the same across time. Both of these laws are derived from symmetries in physics.</p>
<p>More simply. Momentum can be thought of as the tendency for an object to resist changes to its motion. Consider the planetary society's solar sail. Photon's from the sun hit the sail and impart a change in momentum to the sail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
