		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really, no. Animals wag their tails for a variety of reasons, but the happy=tail wagging response in dogs is unique to them. (Interestingly, foxes that were domesticated as part of an experiment also began <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Domesticated_Red_Fox#Genetic_experimentation" target="_blank">wagging their tails in greeting</a> after several generations of breeding for tameness. So the potential for tail-wagging in excitement and happiness when bred for juvenile traits is present through a lot of the canine family tree.) A cat wagging its tail is most likely annoyed or agitated, or at least overstimulated. There is no hardwired environmental or behavioral reason for tail wagging that all animals share. (EDIT: And yes, a dog can also wag its tail when it isn't happy; I was specifically referring to the common, stereotypical behavior of the happy tail-wagging doggo.)</p>
<p>Apes 'lost' their tails at least 14 million years ago, well before the human branch of the family tree had even begun to split. Human responses that involve butt-wiggling (for lack of a more specific term) like dancing or squirming are coming from a different behavioral source that has nothing to do with tails.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, but Humans have other limbic reactions that signify happiness pretty much across the board. Watch someone's feet next time they are very excited or happy; it's where the phrase 'happy feet' comes from. Closest thing I can think of to tail wagging </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't this be similar to laughing or smiling? Yes, you can control this response but it does happen immediately and sometimes uncontrollably especially when greeting someone you have missed. I didn't take your question as is we had internal tails or something but more of a question of an uncontrollable happiness response. </p>
<p>Edit: wait did you mean the people who are actually born with tails? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>A case of a tail in a 2-week-old infant is reported, and findings from a review of 33 previously reported cases of true tails and pseudotails are summarized. The true, or persistent, vestigial tail of humans arises from the most distal remnant of the embryonic tail. It contains adipose and connective tissue, central bundles of striated muscle, blood vessels, and nerves and is covered by skin. Bone, cartilage, notochord, and spinal cord are lacking. The true tail arises by retention of structures found normally in fetal development. It may be as long as 13 cm,
<strong>can move and contract</strong>, and occurs twice as often in males as in females. </p>

<p>First of all, the coccyx does not retain the muscular functionality of a tail, but it does act as an anchor point for tendons, ligaments, etc. Second, while tail-wagging is a trait present in <em>some</em> primates, such as lemurs, it is far from ubiquitous, and there is no evidence of tail-wagging in any of our closest primate relatives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
