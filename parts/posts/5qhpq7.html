		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the way that the electrons are arranged.</p>
<p>Electrons can also absorb photons to jump up energy levels - but only if there's the right amount of energy in the photon to do a complete jump. Electrons won't jump up anything but whole energy levels.</p>
<p>This means that there has to be the right amount of energy in the light in order for it to be absorbed. With light, energy is proportional to the frequency, which is inversely proportional to the wavelength. This means there's a direct relationship between wavelength and energy.</p>
<p>This is why glass, for example, is transparent. The amount of energy necessary to excite electrons in glass doesn't match the amount of energy that photons have when they're in the visible part of the spectrum, so the photons go whizzing on through without being absorbed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photons carry the electromagnetic force. Electrons interact with the electromagnetic force, however, electrons can only interact with photons of certain energies, depending on a few factors that are too complex for an ELI5. Basically, electrons can only absorb or emit photons of discrete energies (think whole numbers, 1,2,3, etc. You can't have a .5, for example)</p>
<p>This means that any photons that aren't at those specific energies don't interact with electrons, so they fly right through the material.</p>
<p>Pure metals, for example, are opaque because their electrons can occupy a huge number of possible states, and visible light happens to have the right energy to interact with the electrons in the metal (electrons moving freely through a metal aren't under the same restrictions and can interact with any photons IIRC).</p>
<p>Glass, however, has electrons in a tightly bound state that can only interact with photons in certain bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, few of which fall within visible light. Most materials have specific energies at which photons can pass through them, and other energies at which photons can't pass through. Glass is right in the visible spectrum, as is water (which is probably why our visual range is what it is, all the frequencies of light we can detect travel through water easily, I cannot explain the mantis shrimp, sorry).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A material shows transparency if there are no processes that compete with transmission, either by absorbing the light or by scattering it in other directions. In pure silicon, there is a very strong absorptive process at work: the incident visible light is absorbed by electrons that then move from one electron energy state to another (an occurrence technically known as a band-to-band transition). Glass, being silicon dioxide--not pure silicon--does not have this band structure, so it cannot absorb light as pure silicon does. Sand, on the other hand, is also silicon dioxide, but it is so filled with impurities that light simply scatters outward incoherently and does not pass through to a noticeable extent</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, it has to do with whether or not the incoming photons possess enough energy to promote an atom's electrons to a higher energy level. If they do, then the photons get absorbed by the electrons they interact with, and the electron jumps to another energy level, making the material opaque. If they don't, then they pass right through the material, making it transparent.</p>
<p>There's a great Sixty Symbols video which discusses this exact topic.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Transparency and opacity are influenced also at a larger scale, by the microstructure. Silica may come in a form with nanoscale holes and will be opaque, or in another form a grain structure without holes will be transparent/translucent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
