<p>Baaaasicslly. The surface of a bubble is a very thin layer of water. If you were to zoom in really closely you would see that this layer of water has a top side, and a bottom side. Imagine it looking like a slice of water when you zoom in. </p>
<p>The reason light reflects in a shimmery way is because as the light goes through the surface, the light partly reflects off of the top and the bottom side, and kinda just messes with itself, making it look shimmery or iridescent.</p>
<p>Hope that helped, DM me if you want a more detailed explanation! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So, light is a wave. In fact, white light is all sorts of waves with different wavelengths (that is, the horizontal length of one cycle) mixed together.</p>
<p>If you get two identical waves and place them exactly on top together, the waves will strengthen each other and become stronger, right? Also, if you place the two waves so that the &quot;mountain&quot; goes on top of the other wave's &quot;canyon&quot;, then the waves the cancel out each other, right?</p>
<p>What happens is that, one light wave reflects from the surface of the bubble, and some other light wave just enters the surface but immediately reflect on the other side and come out. These two light waves might strengthen each other or cancel out each other, depending on the angle of the light (because the distance the light travels become longer depending on the angle) and the wavelength (which is directly related to color).</p>
<p>So, depending on the angle you look at the bubble's surface, the wavelength that gets strengthen will change gradually, and looks rainbow.</p>
<p>Sorry if that was difficult to understand. My native language isn't English and that was kind of a physics and English exercise for me too :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
