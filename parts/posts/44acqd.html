		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have something in common with all the other animals in that our parents survived to have kids, as did theirs, as did theirs, and so on. One of the most critical means of survival is getting enough to eat. </p>
<p>Sometimes, that &quot;enough to eat&quot; is just one thing, such as a leaf from the milkweed plant that is the sole source of food for a monarch butterfly's caterpillar. It's small and stays in one place, so it has adapted to take all of the construction materials in that one source to use in growing its body. And - bonus - that plant is a LOT bigger than that caterpillar, so it has all kinds of food for itself.</p>
<p>But for larger animals, it's often the case that using just one source of food is going to reduce the chances that you'll get enough to eat consistently over time. So most larger animals, humans included, eat a number of different things because that increased the odds they'd survive the loss of one of their food sources. As a result our bodies have adapted to having different sources of different nutrients, and we've come to depend on that varied diet to provide the ones we need to keep as healthy as we can. We could survive a long time with just traces of many nutrients, but we work best with a variety.</p>
<p>(There are loads of exceptions - pandas and bamboo, koalas and eucalyptus - but they eat a huge quantity of their particular those food sources, and they're not particularly energetic or adventuresome animals because their food is so poor in calories and nutrition. Further, those plants are so plentiful in that creature's area that a one-food strategy was largely okay and their bodies &quot;filled in the blanks&quot; if those food sources had missing nutrients.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what others have said:</p>
<p>It's not just vitamins that we can't make, but other things like certain amino acids (the &quot;essential amino acids&quot;) and so on. </p>
<p>Many animals have enzymes that allow them to break down grass and leaves to get nutrients from them, or turn amino acids that their diet has plenty of into amino acids their diet is poor in, or make their own vitamins. All of these enzymes cost energy and protein to make, but they have evolved to do this anyway, because it gives them the ability to survive. In some cases it's an advantage because it lets them eat foods other animals can't eat.</p>
<p>Pandas, for example, can survive by eating tons of bamboo because nothing else eats bamboo. If they couldn't digest bamboo, they'd have to compete for other, easier to digest food sources.</p>
<p>We, humans, have a bunch of enzymes that help us make things we need that aren't in our diet. We can manufacture certain amino acids in our bodies, and this is probably because in our evolutionary past we ate a diet that was poor in those amino acids. But because our diet was rich in OTHER amino acids, we 'gave up' the ability to make those ones on our own. </p>
<p>It's also worth noting that most animals DO, to some degree, also need to make sure they get enough of certain things. Moose eat aquatic plants for a certain percentage of their diet, to get enough sodium. Some animals will sometimes eat certain kinds of dirt or clay to get enough of certain other essential micronutrients. And some plants have evolved the ability to catch and eat insects, so that they can get enough nitrogen! And some monkeys have to carefully eat a very wide variety of plants, because the plants are slightly poisonous and they can't eat too much of any one kind or they'll get sick, so they eat a tiny bit of many kinds.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that all animals (and plants, etc.) need certain things to survive. There are many ways to get these nutrients: Eating plants that contain them, eating animals that contain them, eating other stuff in the environment, or consuming enough energy that you can afford to spend energy making your own. Animals usually evolve to use whatever combination of solutions will get them the nutrients they need for the least cost, given their environment. In our environment, it was easiest to get some amino acids by eating them, and easiest to get others by spending energy to make them, and so on for all the other nutrients we need to eat (or don't). Some animals have strategies similar to ours, some different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the <del>above</del>EDIT: below, you don't actually HAVE to eat a varied and healthy diet. As a species, humans will do just fine if we all eat a very unhealthy diet, reproduce six times between 15 and 20, have three babies die, and drop dead ourselves at 27.  This is a valid survival strategy for many species.  </p>
<p>The problem crops up when you actually want to live till you're 80. Then you'll have to take much better care of yourself.  </p>
<p>Car analogy: You don't have to maintain your car, clean it or buy quality oil and gas if you plan on scrapping it when its three years old. But if you still want to drive it in 30 years, you have to take good care of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets take an example: Vitamin C. All animals need it.</p>
<p>Most animals and plants can make it themselves from just sugar. We used to be able to make it, but lost that ability as an &quot;advantage&quot;.</p>
<p>The ability to make it costs us energy. If we naturally eat foods that have vitamin C, then it's wasted energy for us to make it. At some point in the past, we &quot;closed&quot; that unused wasteful factory down.</p>
<p>But now we are dependent on eating foods that have vit C.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is we do, and we don't!</p>
<p>We DO need a varied diet in the sense because the stuff you most easily get access to nowadays tends to be horribly balanced in terms of nutrients. Example; fast foods and takeaways which are practically all processed starch/oil/meat. Many people and especially kids end up eating something like pure chips&amp;dips or mac&amp;cheese etc., and develop various deficiencies. Now unprocessed plant based starchy diet isn't bad since plants themselves contain a good mix of minerals and such, but processed into a bag of fried flour? Thats just pure glucose and nothing much else = bad. Meat from the butcher/fish/etc isn't just pure proteins either and has other nutrients in it. But processed meat? Mainly just salt (loads) and degraded protein. So yes, can't just survive on the same crap.</p>
<p>We DON'T need a varied diet if you aren't subsisting on processed foods. You can have the same steamed chicken with veg practically all your life and come out an Olympian.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
