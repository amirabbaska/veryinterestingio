		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello /r/AskScience! <a href="https://homewardboundprojects.com.au/" target="_blank">Homeward Bound</a> is a ground‐breaking leadership, strategic and science initiative and outreach for women, set against the backdrop of Antarctica. The initiative aims to heighten the influence and impact of women with a science background in order to influence policy and decision making as it shapes our planet. The inaugural 2016 voyage took place from 2 - 21 December 2016 and was the largest‐ever female expedition to Antarctica. We care about science, the concerns of others, and we think science can unite us towards seeing and managing the planet as our global home. <strong>Ask us questions about our Antarctic journey, the Homeward Bound Initiative, and why it matters, especially now, for there to be gender equity in leadership. We'll be back around 2pm U.S. Eastern Standard Time to start answering!</strong></p>
<p>Answering questions today are 5 participants from the inaugural Homeward Bound expedition:</p>
<p><strong>Heidi Steltzer, Ph.D.</strong> Heidi is an environmental scientist, an explorer, and a science communicator, sharing her passion for science with others. She is an <a href="https://www.fortlewis.edu/facultyexperts/FullStory/ArtMID/23965/ArticleID/1147237/Steltzer.aspx" target="_blank">Associate Professor at Fort Lewis College</a>, Colorado. She studies how environmental changes affect mountain watersheds and Arctic systems and their link to our well-being. <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/co2-makes-growing-seasons-longer-1.15081" target="_blank">Heidi's research has been published in <em>Nature</em></a> and featured in the <a href="https://durangoherald.com/articles/2066-early-snowmelt-unhappy-plants" target="_blank">media</a>, including the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/science/springing-forward-and-its-consequences.html?_r=0" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em></a>. Find her on social media and Medium.com @heidimountains.</p>
<p><strong>Anne Christianson</strong> is a current PhD student in the <a href="https://www.nrsm.umn.edu/" target="_blank">Natural Resources Science and Management</a> program at the University of Minnesota, researching the intersection between climate change, biodiversity conservation, and women's justice. She holds a Bachelor's degree in environmental policy from St. Olaf College and a Masters in Biodiversity, Conservation, and Management from the University of Oxford. Previously, Ms. Christianson worked in the U.S. House of Representatives writing and advising on energy and environmental legislation, for Ocean Conservancy advocating for science-based marine policy, and held the position of Vice President of <a href="http://dc.ecowomen.org/" target="_blank">DC EcoWomen</a>, a non-profit organization working to empower women to become leaders in the environmental field. A 2016 Homeward Bound participant, Ms. Christianson was enthralled by Antarctica, and inspired by the 75 other women striving to create a global network of female change-makers.</p>
<p><strong>Dyan deNapoli</strong> is a penguin expert, TED speaker, and author of the award-winning book, <a href="http://booklaunch.io/dyandenapoli/the-great-penguin-rescue" target="_blank"><em>The Great Penguin Rescue</em></a>. She lectures internationally about penguins, and is a sought-out expert on radio and TV, including <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01b9c8z" target="_blank">appearances on BBC</a> and CNN. A participant on the inaugural Homeward Bound expedition, she returns to Antarctica next year as a <a href="https://www.expeditions.com/why-us/expedition-team/staff-bio/dyan-denapoli/" target="_blank">lecturer for Lindblad/National Geographic</a>. A four-times TEDx speaker, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/dyan_denapoli_the_great_penguin_rescue" target="_blank">Dyan's inspiring TED talk</a> about saving 40,000 penguins from an oil spill can be viewed on TED.com. She is on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn as The Penguin Lady.</p>
<p><strong>Ashton Gainsford</strong> is an evolutionary biologist and recently submitted her PhD thesis to the <a href="https://www.coralcoe.org.au/person/ashton-gainsford" target="_blank">Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies</a> at <a href="https://www.jcu.edu.au/" target="_blank">James Cook University</a> in Townsville, Australia. Her research questioned what constitutes a species, highlighting the importance of animal behavior to the outcomes of hybridization, a common and significant evolutionary phenomena where closely related species interbreed. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=Rxgv6WoAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;oi=ao" target="_blank">Her research</a> on coral reef fish using behavior and genetic tools provides novel insights into the ecology and evolution of species. She is passionate about the marine environment, women in science, and diving. She joined the Homeward Bound network in 2016 to build future collaborations and learn within a program aimed to elevate each woman's leadership abilities and capacity to influence in the future. This was highlighted in an article written for <a href="http://www.1millionwomen.com.au/blog/70-female-scientists-journey-worlds-edge/" target="_blank">1MillionWomen</a>. Connect with her on twitter at @AshtonGainsford.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna Speirs, Ph.D</strong>, is a climate scientist with specific research interests in climate variability and change, alpine hydrometeorology and Antarctic meteorology and climatology.  She works for <a href="http://www.snowyhydro.com.au/" target="_blank">Snowy Hydro Ltd.</a> (a government-owned renewable energy company operating in Australia's alpine region), and specialises in understanding weather and climate processes that effect water resources in the Australian Alps. Johanna maintains an affiliation with the <a href="https://sees.uq.edu.au/climate-research-group" target="_blank">University of Queensland's Climate Research Group</a> following her PhD on Antarctic meteorology and climatology. She wants to live in a world where quality science is used to make more informed decisions in the way this planet is managed. She thinks Homeward Bound is a pretty inspiring initiative to help get more women to the decision-making table. See <a href="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:269511" target="_blank">google scholar</a> for her publications, or find her on twitter @johspeirs.</p></div></div>

I live in Pennsylvania and it gets pretty cold here. Like face-hurting wind cold. And I'm pretty sure it's gets colder in other parts of America but I can barely handle here. Was it the type of cold that made you immediately regret the decision, or was it something you knew you could handle? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
