		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Iodine, which is brown-ish in water, can be reduced to iodide I^- (transparent) if it encounters an oxidizable substrate. </p>
<p>You can check that I^- is still in the solution by adding a small quantity of an oxidant, like hydrogen peroxyde. If this causes the brown color to reappear, it means you have oxidised transparent iodide back to colored iodine. (if it's negative then possibly the iodine has just evaporated)</p>
<p>This is the basis of the &quot;iodine clock&quot; reactions, which can be used as introductions to chemical kinetics.       </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Iodine is volatile, an oxidizer and a weak acid. If it evaporates from the water the water will lose some color. It's also an oxidizer like chlorine added to pool water (though chlorine is usually added in a different form). If the iodine reacts with organic compounds (used as a disinfectant) or a base it will change forms and lose it's color.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
