<p>Yes, Black Holes and Hawking Radiation are both Hypothetical. But per those hypotheses...</p>
<p>A black hole while being a region of the universe that no &quot;thing&quot; can escape from, Emits radiation on it's own at a temperature that is lower the larger the black hole gets (for stellar mass black holes, the predicted temperature is much lower than that of the cosmic background, so are unobservable). So , when black holes stop accreting matter and light, they slowly lose mass to hawking radiation, slowly increasing the mass loss rate as the size shrinks.</p>
<p>Thus a black hole will evaporate in a finite amount of time. This time is much longer than the age of the universe for astronomical black holes (stellar mass and larger), but for smaller ones that (which we have even less proof for) would emit a measurable amount of radiation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Black holes emit thermal radiation as per the Hawking effect. This temperature is absolutely minuscule for astronomical BHs. In the very, very distant future, the exponential expansion of the Universe driven by dark energy will have separated black holes from all other forms of matter, and will have redshifted the cosmic microwave background to a temperature lower than the Hawking temperature of the black holes. Since heat spontaneously moves from the hotter thing to the colder, black holes will put out energy and therefore very slowly lose mass. The BH can therefore evaporate completely.</p>
<p>Note that smaller black holes are hotter (T ~ 1/M) so if there were indeed small enough BHs they could also be evaporating right now. Such BH could in fact be dying right now and emit a specific signature. BHs of this size cannot be produced by astrophysical processes and must thus be primordial, as in created in the early Universe. There are ongoing experiments search for the death whistle of primordial black holes, but none have been found.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hawking Radiation will make small black holes smaller. The larger ones are picking up more mass from accretion and just from the light and heat reaching them from everywhere. Hawking radiation is a very low leak, like evaporation from a sealed glass jar, everyone knows that it happens, just not much.</p>
<p>There's some notion that black holes may naturally rebound at some point. That could be in the 10^78 to 10^81 years frame. </p>
<p>There is this notion of imaginary time that Hawkings suggests. I'm not sure how it works but it may provide some light on what's going on with the timelike lines were spacelike lines which intersect the hole horizon. Inside time is still proceeding or may be in some context. Their 2/1000ths of a second to bounce back and splay out a white hole may be an awful long time for us. While its doubtful that this is an accurate or even ballpark rendition of what may occur there are likely few people in the black-hole field that have firmly given up on black-holes ever altering their behavior at any time in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
