		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pick a spot on the ground. Imagine that a raindrop falls on that spot. Imagine that it doesn't soak in, but it runs downhill. Which way will it go? Trace its path. Eventually, it will flow into a stream. That stream will flow into a bigger stream, which will flow into a river, which may flow into a bigger river, and so on, which will eventually reach the sea. The last river will have a name; let's say it's the Mississippi. That means your original spot was part of the Mississippi watershed. Sometimes large watersheds are divided into smaller watersheds named after the various rivers that flow into it; for example, the Mississippi watershed may be divided into the Ohio watershed, the Missouri watershed, and so on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water shed is the dividing line between two river basins, rain falling on one side of that line will end up in one river and another on the other side of that line. That's why we use the phrase &quot;water shed moment&quot; to describe an event that separates two things.</p>
<p>This is covered in GCSE Geography in British schools. The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/water_rivers/background_rivers_rev2.shtml" target="_blank">BBC</a> have a cool guide that explains river terminology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>'Watershed' just indicates where all the water flows.</p>
<p>So a river, in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, will drain (or empty) into Chesapeake Bay.  Or at least, into another river or lake system that eventually empties into Chesapeake Bay. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
