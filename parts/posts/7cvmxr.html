		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your gut just lacks the enzymes to process the lactose, the bacteria that then meet the undigested lactose produce a bunch of nasty byproducts as they make efforts to devour the sugar. They produce lots of gas and the bacteria for the most part can't really handle it so the material just kinda gets shoved along the digestive tract as your bowels become filled with gas(at a rapid rate), causing diarrhea </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most mammals, including most humans, stop producing lactase, a pancreatic enzyme that splits lactose (milk sugar) into a glucose and galactose after they are weaned. So lactose intolerance is the normal state. When lactose is consumed, it remains in the lumen of the bowel where it osmotically attracts water leading to diarrhea. Further, some bacteria can metabolize lactose and produce methane as a consequence. This gives the gas, the flatus. Avoid or reduce lactose consumption to avoid these physiological responses to lactose consumption. One way is to convert lactose to lactic acid. It curdles the milk and makes sour. Voila, yogurt and lebneh. Or make cheese and toss away the whey where the lactose remains. Cultural adaptions to retain the benefits of dairy without GI distress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lactose is made up of two sugar molecules - glucose and galactose. Lactose itself cannot be absorbed so the enzyme Lactase is required to cleve lactose into glucose and galactose, molecules that can be absorbed.</p>
<p>When lactose is not cleved and absorbed it travels through the digestive system where it becomes food for bacteria in your gut. The process of bacteria metabolizing lactose is essentially fermentation. Products of fermentation include lactic acid, carbon dioxide, ethanol, and hydrogen gas. These products can cause symptoms like bloating, gas, cramps, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the diarrhea in this case would be of an osmotic nature: undigested lactose would attract water molecules (it's an osmotically active molecule, alright), preventing their absorbtion by the cells of intestinal epithelium in the colon, where the major part of intestinal water is absorbed, thus creating an excess of water and causing a diarrhea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
