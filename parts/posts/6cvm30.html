		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How is it possible that we can measure the speed of light so precisely?? The speed of something can only ve measured in reference to another object, can't we just measure the speed of light in two directions and have the exact speed at which that point in the earth is moving ( C - measured C = speed of that point of earth.</p>
<p>Extra question: How is it that the universe is expanding? I have a big theory on this but how is it that we can measure the expansion of the universe?? That doesn't make any sense to me because if the universe is expanding we are also expanding, how can we know that what we percieved as 10 meters is now 20 meters if our instruments for measures also expanded and our own body, mind, eyes, atoms, and even the photons in the universe also expanded?</p>
<p>I say this cause scientists say the universe expands faster than the speed of light... </p>
<p>Extra extra bonus final boss easy question</p>
<p>How can something not pass the speed of light if the momentum formula is f=m.v being f force, m mass and v volume. To move something of 1 kg faster than the speed of light you need more newtons than speed of light, does a newton always take the same energy to achieve or does one newton take more energy in relation to the one that was applied before??</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for clearing my mind! I think a lot about this things but school is shit, I'm 16 and we are learning movement, I wanna learn about plancks not fucking a.t+iv=fv, that's easy boring shit. (Sorry for small rant)</p>
<p>Edit: that's my record of internet points in this site, thanks to everyone for answering!!!</p></div></div>

<p>The speed of light is <em>always</em> the same, even if you're moving. It's only speeds <em>below</em> the speed of light which are relative.</p>
<p>What you're describing is almost exactly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson-Morley" target="_blank">Michelson-Morley</a> experiment - measuring the speed of light in two directions. But it doesn't work because light is <em>always</em> measured to be moving at c, even by two people who are measuring the same light but moving at different speeds themselves.</p>
<p>Space and time &quot;rotate&quot; into one another as you change your speed in a way which essentially conspires to maintain the speed of light as you measure it. What one experimenter sees as space (and time) is not quite the same as what another (relatively moving) experimenter sees as space (and time).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To the first question. You can measure the speed by synchronizing two clocks, taking one very far away and then sending an object from one to the other at a very specific moment in time and then counting how long it takes before it arrives. If your measurements are sufficiently fast you can even measure the delay of light in very small distances in processors for example.</p>
<p>To the second question. I don't know much of the details behind the mechanisms of the expansion of the universe but it isn't so much that everything just gets larger but that the space in which objects are located gets larger. It acts like a sort of force accelerating content inside space out. As long as the forces holding objects together are larger, the objects will not grow in size themselves. We know it is expanding because distant objects move away from us which causes a doppler shift in the frequency at which they send their light. They look more red if they fly away from us and more blue if they move towards us. Similar to how an ambulance sounds different when it comes to you and moves away from you.</p>
<p>The formula f=m<em>v is not correct. It should be F=m</em>a. Where everything is the same but a is the acceleration. These equations however need to be corrected if you account for relativity which limits our velocity and those equations get much more complicated to a point where I'm not comfortable going into detail and I also don't think it would help you too much at this point. I think the most important lesson for you to take away from this is that some equations in physics aren't perfect but just sufficiently good within certain conditions and as long as you are not going a significant fraction of the speed of light for example. The principles that will happen once you start reaching the speed of light is that time doesn't move equally fast for different frames of reference which causes all kinds of non-relativistic physics to stop working properly. </p>
<p>If something goes really fast (99.99% speed of light for example), its time from the perspective of a stationary observer would 'almost' stand still. You might see the problem with definitions of force here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can just measure the speed of light like we can measure any other speed. The speed of light is only 300,000,000 meters per second. We can easily make things that make measurements at 1000 times per second or more. So all you would need to measure the speed of light is a distance 150 kilometers long, a mirror and a sampling rate of 1000 times per second. This is exactly how we got our first measurement of the speed of light. We created a pulsing light beam and then shot it at a mirror, then had a spinning disc that we could change the RPM of next to the emitter, this lets us measure very precisely what the travel time of the pulses are.</p>
<p>Our own bodies, atoms, and eyes are not expanding. The force pushing everything away from each other is ridiculously weak and almost any object's gravity can overcome it. The space between galaxies is very very big though, much bigger than the space inside of galaxies, so the dark energy force that is causing the universe to expand is greater than the incredibly tiny force pulling galaxies towards each other, so galaxies move away from each other, but the forces inside galaxies and between very close galaxies like our own local group is more than enough to keep those things together.</p>
<p>The speed of light does not work the way you think it works, and has nothing to do with light itself. What we call the speed of light is actually the speed of causality. Light in it's own reference frame moves almost infinite distance in almost zero time. Light moves much much much much faster than the speed of light in it's own reference frame. So f=ma works until infinity in your own reference frame. It is only outside stationary observers that see things moving at the speed of light. We don't really know what causes this, but one theory is that it's the Higgs field. The Higgs field is a sea of quantum particles that fills the universe and imparts mass to objects in the universe, letting them interact with other objects.</p>
<p>If you're familiar with how the speed of sound in a medium works, we get the speed of sound because it is the maximum speed that particles in air, steel, or water can transmit a wave from one particle to another. The speed of light/the speed of causality is thought to work in the same way. When you move from one location to another in the universe your mass has to go with you before you can move again. So as you move faster and faster the Higgs field has trouble handing off your mass from the particles at your previous position, to your new position fast enough. Because you cannot experience time without mass you do not experience these delays with the Higgs field updating your position, but outside observers see you moving in slow motion much like watching a laggy video on YouTube that is constantly buffering. Just because people watching a video of an SR-71 Blackbird with very slow buffering see it taking much more time to cross a distance, doesn't mean the plane in the video is going any bit slower. The plane is still moving ridiculously fast, it's just that you as an outside observer experience it moving much slower due to the buffering. Likewise outside observers see things moving at or near the speed of light with progressively more buffering. Those things going near the speed of light are still moving incredibly fast, quadrillions of meters per second or more in their own reference frames, but we can only update their positions at a maximum speed of about 300 million meters per second when we observe those objects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't want to be rude but before diving into special or general relativity and astronomy you should probably start from very beginning. I suggest you to get more familiar with the definition of mass, force, motion and energy, Newton's laws and laws of conservation. Don't just try to memorize formulas, try to understand meaning behind them. </p>
<p>This is one of the best books to start in my oppinion <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0880292512/" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/dp/0880292512/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>About the momentum thing:</p>
<p>The formula for momentum isn't p=mv,</p>
<p>It's actually</p>
<p>p=γmv</p>
<p>where m is the mass, v is the speed in an inertial frame of reference, and γ=1/√(1-v²/c²) is the Lorenz factor.</p>
<p>If you graph both γmv and mv as functions of v, you'll see how much the equations differ when v approaches c. For low values of v the equation p=mv is acceptable to use, but when v gets large you need to account for relativistic effects and use the proper formula p=γmv.</p>
<p>To change an objects momentum you need to apply a force. Force is the derivative of momentum (F=dp/dt) so it's​ the slope of the graph p=γmv, and as v approaches c that slope gets infinite which is why you need an infinite amount of energy to accelerate a mass to the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
