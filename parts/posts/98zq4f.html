		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pour yourself a big bowl of corn flakes. Add milk until the level of the milk has risen about half way to the level of the corn flakes. You can’t really see the milk under the corn flakes, can you?</p>
<p>Now take a spoon and dig corn flakes out of <em>just</em> the center of the bowl. Now you can see a little puddle of milk in the center of the bowl, right? And yet, you know there must also be milk underlying the remaining corn flakes, right?</p>
<p>This is how it works. The puddle you dug out is a lake. It’s the <em>visible</em> part of what we call a “water table.” So are rivers. The rest of the water table is hidden by the soil you stand on. The bowl containing the milk and cornflakes is analogous to a layer, such as clay or bedrock, that the water cannot flow through. We call this kind of layer “impermeable.” Impermeable layers can slope, with water trapped between, and if you dig a hole in the ground at the bottom of the sloping layers, water will fountain out—this is what we call an “artesian” well.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the water drains out of the water table. Maybe it hasn’t rained recently; maybe too many wells have been dug and water is being pumped out too fast. The soil that previously had a lot of water in it will shrink and collapse; we call this “subsiding.” It’s one of the processes that can cause sinkholes to form.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ground is already saturated with water or there's an impermeable layer of rock that limits how much dirt is available to absorb the water.</p>
<p>You can see this by trying to dump water onto dirt yourself - there's only so much it'll absorb before the water starts pooling up or flowing away from the spot you're pouring it on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are other types of lakes, called 'perched lakes'. These are made when you have a dip that is covered by something that water can't flow through, such as rock, or compressed clay. This forms a sealed layer, trapping a pool of water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does (drain), but water  is replaced because lakes tend to form at lower elevations, where all rivers flow to. So the lake is being filled at the same time it is draining. See Dams.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
