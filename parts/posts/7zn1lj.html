		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, breaking the sound barrier in any medium (including air) will result in a buildup of sound waves (pressure waves) which causes a sonic boom.</p>
<p>However, the high viscosity and higher speed of sound in water means a ridiculous amount of energy will be needed to create that sonic boom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! You'd need insane levels of energy to do so, but you can break the sound barrier underwater, in oil, in a pool of alcohol, etc. The higher the density of the medium, the higher the speed of sound. Even solids objects have a finite speed of sound (but those are stupidly high numbers). So that means when you're in outer space (i.e. a vacuum with zero density) any movement at all means you're breaking the speed of sound - and you're basically at Mach infinity! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. BUT you are breaking a different sound barrier. The speed of sound in different materials is different. </p>
<p>Its much more difficult to do in water, as water is much more difficult to compress. You need to be in a compressible fluid. Liquids are technically compressible fluids, but much LESS compressible than gasses. This is primarily dependent on density. </p>
<p>For clarity, the speed of sound in air is 343 m/s (at sea level atmospheric and room temp), while in water it is about 1500m/s (sea level, room temp)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
