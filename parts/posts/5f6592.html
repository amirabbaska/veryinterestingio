Very interested to hear your explanations, as I'm currently at this point right now.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mood and sleep are linked. When you are overly tired, you lose some abilities to regulate your emotions, so you feel more emotional extremes than usual.</p>
<p>At the same time, sleep deprivation causes the same kind of impairment as alcohol intoxication. So you subjective understanding of what you are experiencing isn't necessarily as accurate as if you were not sleep deprived (or drunk).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IIRC sleeping repairs the body and flushes toxic waste out of the brain. </p>
<p>When you're sleep deprived your body releases more dopamine to counteract cope with the damage done by not sleeping. </p>
<p>The overdose of dopamine then does something to your receptors, (I'm not sure if I'm correct on this sorry) and your body won't be able to absorb as much dopamine after the initial burst wears off. That's lack of sleep can lead to depression. </p>
<p>I definitely know what you're talking about though. I'm a senior in high school and have stayed up studying/procrastinating too many times to count. If I don't fall asleep before midnight, I start to feel a little more awake and giddy. I usually find myself cracking up at really stupid videos at 1 or 2, then wanting to die the next day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
