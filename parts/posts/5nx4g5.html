		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. You wouldn't be saved from eating immediately before. Your body needs to metabolize the food into your blood which isn't instant. Not only that, if you're on the brink of starvation, then your digestive system wouldn't be functioning ideally; after all, starving to death takes typically over a month (assuming you're hydrated) and in the last week or so your organs would be damaged and shutting down, plus you're barely producing stomach acid to digest anyway.</p>
<p>To add even more on top of that, there's refeeding syndrome which involves a number of pretty shitty disorders. Essentially though, from my understanding, during starvation, your body uses up it's resources and switches to consuming your fatty acids to conserve red blood cells. When refeeding occurs, the body tries to pump out more red blood cells, but the resources used to make those normally are used up, so some compound builds in the liver and skeleton which uses up ATP in red blood cells causing the red blood cells to not work properly and they don't deliver enough oxygen around your body. There are also other things that happen, but I'm not sure about them.</p>
<p>Often times, when faced with emancipated, emaciated WW2 captives, allied soldiers were told not to give any food to the emaciated captives and to keep them away from finding food as it could literally kill them because of refeeding syndrome. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Standard practice when rescuing starving people is to give small amounts of food in order to prevent refeeding syndrome. It depends on your condition and the type and amount of food you have.</p>
<p>Long answer: With adequate food, the body primarily uses glucose for energy, but the body can't store as much glucose as it can protein and fat. Trouble is, the brain can't use fatty acids for energy, so the body produces ketone bodies to help replace the glucose you aren't eating. This process, called ketosis, releases acid into the body. If you undergo ketosis for long enough to starve, then ketoacidosis, a deadly acidification of the the blood, may occur. If you can't get treated for severe acidification, then it doesn't matter what you eat. You'll die (interestingly, this is why untreated Type I diabetes is also extremely dangerous).</p>
<p>But let's say your blood hasn't turned to acid before your rescue. Ketosis changes the metabolic environment of the body in other ways, but the body would prefer to metabolize food normally. If you eat a load of food, then the body will immediately shift to the normal mode of metabolism, and that shift is what causes refeeding syndrome. Several days of limited intake helps &quot;prime&quot; the body for regular metabolism and slows down the shift from ketosis to normal metabolism. If your &quot;last moment&quot; means that you have no more stored calories, then the shift from no food to enough food for you to live would probably kill you. If your &quot;last moment&quot; means that you have just enough stored calories to maintain your life until you can finish the metabolic shift, then it might save you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on circumstances and type of food.  Look at the holocaust victims, they were literally starving to death and if you allow them small bits of food and sips of water their body can handle it and slowly get better.  Some still died of starvation even after being rescued.  This is very circumstantial.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>my grandfather told me that starved people who got to eat food the first time for a really long time in american camps(after they got captured) died because they ate too much and their bodies could not handle the food. he said the food they ate was too heavy and they got diarrhea and died because of that.</p>
<p>he also said starving isnt really that bad after a couple of days. your intestines shut down and it takes a while to get used to food again.</p>
<p>he had some interesting anectotes. one is that americans eat more pepper and less salt than germans. they had tons of pepper left over but salt was always rare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another issue I haven't seen mentioned on here yet is something called &quot;refeeding syndrome.&quot; It's something that happens when you haven't eaten for weeks. The influx of glucose and other nutrients into your system cranks up hormones that had been essentially shut down, especially insulin. The sudden change causes a massive shift and depletion of electrolytes like phosphorous and magnesium among others. It's so bad it can send you into heart failure. That's why if you're admitted to the hospital due to starvation, they reintroduce food very slowly with a close eye on your electrolytes. </p>
<p>tl;dr Refeeding syndrome is more likely to kill you after reintroducing food than anything else </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
