		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My basic understanding of Hawking Radiation is that a particle-antiparticle pair will occasionally come into existence close to the event horizon.  While in normal circumstances they would quickly annihilate each other, when near the event horizon it is possible for the anti-particle to be amalgamated into the black hole, and the particle to be emitted.</p>
<p>Is it not equally as likely that the particle would be amalgamated, and the anti-particle emitted, leading to a no net loss/gain of particles or anti-particles?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Forget the particle-antiparticle picture. It is just a pop-science myth and has nothing to do with the actual process. In the calculations, Hawking radiation is very similar to a decay process: black hole -&gt; slightly less massive black hole + particle. For all practical purposes, the particle is always a photon unless the black hole is extremely small.</p>
<p>Unrelated to Hawking radiation: Both particles and antiparticles have positive energy, and the photon is its own antiparticle anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Even further, no black hole has even evaporated significantly so far?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many ways to intuitively picture the process but they are all imprecise. Basically, Hawking radiation is due to a combination of quantum effects with gravitation - the strongly curved space in a black hole. Quantum waves can tunnel through barriers, and this is what happens. The smaller the black hole, the thinner the barrier and the faster the tunneling until.. poof! Another way to look at is the quantum vacuum is everywhere and contains fluctuating fields - the strong gravity &quot;bends&quot; the vacuum and some particles become manifest. The way Hawking was led to postulate the radiation was from still another viewpoint - that the area of a black hole was its entropy. All such pictures are connected, but the basic thing is quantum + strong gravity. Since gravity is equivalent to acceleration, acceleration can also cause thermal radiation (Unruh effect).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
