E.g. if you look at the edge of the moon the light of the stars behind is bent slightly by its gravity. Or in black holes light is bent so hard that it cannot leave the event horizon.</p>
<p>Now that poses the question if light itself affects gravity. I mean it has energy and it interacts with gravity. But its particles are massless. </p>
<p>If I were to convert all mass of a black hole into energy and the energy into photons, what would happen in regards to gravity? Would it stay the same or would it simply disappear letting the photons out of their prison?</p></div></div>
