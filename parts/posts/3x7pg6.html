E.g. if you look at the edge of the moon the light of the stars behind is bent slightly by its gravity. Or in black holes light is bent so hard that it cannot leave the event horizon.</p>
<p>Now that poses the question if light itself affects gravity. I mean it has energy and it interacts with gravity. But its particles are massless. </p>
<p>If I were to convert all mass of a black hole into energy and the energy into photons, what would happen in regards to gravity? Would it stay the same or would it simply disappear letting the photons out of their prison?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photons or light are affected by gravity because they are only following the curvature in space-time caused by a large mass and NOT because they are feeling individual gravitational forces on each particle. This was the main difference between Newtonian and Einstein's physics of gravity. </p>
<p>Photons cannot have rest mass or else quantum mechanics would fall apart through collapse of gauge invariance. The reason photons can have energy per particle without mass is because they obtain relativistic mass which is not mass in the way you are thinking about it. Their E is actually =pc , their momentum x speed of light. </p>
<p>But you can create a blackhole from photons, by focusing enough energy in one area to warp space time, and in fact this has been hypothesized to have happened in the early universe. You can still create gravity without mass essentially. </p>
<p>Hope this is understandable. </p>
<p>EDIT1: Sorry guys I actually thought this was ELI5 subreddit when I answered so I tried to keep it super simple, yes there are many correct points being raised in the replies that are the specifics of what I described here.<br />
Some common questions: </p>
<p><strong>1)</strong>Yes mass and energy are intrinsically related, and thus you can have momentum from energy. You can correctly say that mass is a from of energy but Im not sure if its very intuitive to think of energy as a form of mass. Its like ice is a form of water but is water a form of ice ? better to think of it of ice and vapour as different forms of water</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Yes the actual equation is longer and its been mentioned. </p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> A lot of debate on if photons have rest mass or not, I was taught they dont. You could argue that since photons have energy and energy and mass are related, photons can have mass and you would be correct. In fact, hypothetically if you trap light in a scenario where it loses momentum, it is theorized it will precipitate mass instead to maintain energy balance. But this is all hypothetical scenarios, and not what I believe most of you guys mean when you think about your average photon. Moreover, a lot of currently accepted theories will go under doubt/question or tweaking if we are to accept photons have rest mass. Even cosmological theories rely on photons being massless. Sure the upperbound on the supposed mass is very small but we have A LOT of photons. </p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> yes all matter/energy/stuff follows space time. Earth follows the curvature produced by the sun, just as light does the same. </p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> Yes im aware of gravitons, but these are all attempts to unify space-time and quantum mechanics and currently space-time curvature is the accepted theory. </p>
<p><strong>6)</strong> light still cant escape blackholes because they are literally holes in space-time fabric, once something falls in its like falling to the bottom of a pit, you wont be able to spin your way out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity actually binds to mass-energy, not just mass. So photons with energy E interact with gravity in the same way as a resting object with mass E/c^2. </p>
<p>If you get a high enough energy density, it has the same effect as a high enough mass density, and you can create a black hole from photons. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory yes, but it would be essentially impossible to verify. I have read <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375960100002607" target="_blank">a paper</a> considering a ring of mirrors with a powerful laser bouncing between them with a bead in the middle, and seeing if the gravitational field of the lasers can cause the bead to rotate. As an aside, the author of that paper has recently been in the news for trying to build a time machine to visit his dead father.</p>
<p>The idea of a gravitational field originating as photons is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugelblitz_(astrophysics\)" target="_blank">kugelblitz</a> and it's a neat idea but not quite relevant for our universe. The gravitational influence of light may have been more important in the early universe.</p>
<p><a href="http://klotza.blogspot.ca/2015/08/what-heeck-how-stable-is-photon.html" target="_blank">Fun fact:</a> if photons do have mass and decay into even less massive particles, the mass must be less than 10^-54 kg and the lifetime must be longer than three years, but is dilated to longer than the age of the universe because they go so fast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light has energy and so creates gravity of its own. Theoretically you can have a ball of light bound into a lump solely by its own gravitation. This is called a Geon and was analyzed by J. A. Wheeler in 1955.</p>
<p>There seems to be a lot of confusion on Reddit about photons having no mass. They have no REST mass, but they have energy and momentum and interact gravitationally just like other objects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not only is the answer yes, but carefully focused gravitational waves (not that we're capable of making even close to big enough ones) can also create a black hole. Gravitational waves are ripples in the shape of spacetime that propogate out from moving objects, with the biggest ones (which LIGO Will hopefully detect) coming from pairs of black holes/neutron stars spiraling in toward eachother. So basically waves of gravity could themselves have enough gravity to make a black hole.</p>
<p>Edit: tl;dr from /u/InSearchOfGoodPun &quot;In layman's terms, in theory, a black hole can be created from gravity itself.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
