If theoretically he wanted to build unsanctioned private nuclear weaponry it would have to be completely secret. Which means he would have to somehow hide the base, personnel, materials, and paper /money trail from the federal government. It would be a monumental task, especially in an American state by an American company. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>He still has to get clearance from the US government before he can launch anything (FAA specifically).</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It is HARD to buy fissile material and even harder to refine it to weapons grade. and even HARDER to do it all without anybody finding out because...</p>
<blockquote>

<p>All of the governments in the world. No government wants other <em>governments</em> to have nukes, they will NOT just sit idly by as a rogue element makes Weapons of Mass Destruction in their own backyard.  </p>
<blockquote>

<p>North Korea is already doing and has been doing it for the better part of a decade. Iran signed an agreement saying NOT to do it anymore. People said that Iraq <em>might</em> be doing it, and the resulting war is still going on. But a private individual? I would say it approaches 0%. If someone <strong>really</strong> wanted to work on the Manhatten Project, then they would have to join up with a government (like North Korea) to make it possible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's simply not possible for a private enterprise to achieve on its own. You need state knowledge and infrastructure to make it work.</p>
<p>First off, it's a lot more expensive than you think. Elon Musk has a lot of money. His net worth is about $16.7 billion dollars. The Manhattan Project, adjusted for inflation, cost about $25 billion dollars, so even if Musk liquidated all of his assets, he still would come up short, and that's not to mention that the only reason SpaceX is successful in the first place is because of huge investments by the US government.</p>
<p>Second, it's lot harder on a technical level than just getting some uranium. Not only do you need the materials and infrastructure, but you also need the scientific knowledge, which is some of the most closely guarded information in the world.</p>
<p>So what would this hypothetical evil genius billionaire have to do? First they would need to obtain vast quantities of uranium. Then build a huge plant of centrifuges to enrich it into a usable form, or alternatively build a reactor to turn it into plutonium. Then he'd have to hire hundreds if not thousands of workers to operate the plants. Then he'd need a team of the best physicists in the world to work out the math, or the best spies in the world to steal it from a nation that already has it. This would all have to be done in <em>complete secret</em>.</p>
<p>How likely would this be in the future? I can't know for sure, but given how much effort it takes, it seems highly unlikely. A more likely (although how <em>much</em> more likely I can't speculate) is for a person or organization to steal a bomb from a nation with lax security, or to steal/buy some weapons-grade material to make a crude device of their own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laws of countries stop that. Private countries do produce military weapons and sell them to the state, and even to other countries than where they are situated. But they do that under permission of the country.</p>
<p>Elon could very well get contracted by the state to develop a weapon of mass destruction, but he can't just start doing that on his own accord because then the police would come and knock on his door and take him in.</p>
<p>If he hid it in Alaska without the state knowing it, sure he could perhaps do that.. I'm sure there are quite a few terror organisations that would like to and even try to do that already in states that don't have control of their territory, hopefully they'll not be successful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
