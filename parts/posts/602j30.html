		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of these responses are correct but are missing a critical point; That is that games require input and interaction while movies and television are passively observed.</p>
<p>When a game renders a low amount of frames per second, <em>especially</em> when it dips under ~30 FPS, the player can feel the difference much more because it takes more time for input to be read and then displayed on the screen. </p>
<p>In other words, this means that every action a player makes in such a scenario feels sluggish and unresponsive because when our brains are expecting to perceive a change much faster than we do. It can cause an element of frustration and it certainly does not help in immersing the player into the game as they are effectively being constantly reminded that something is wrong.</p>
<p>Television and movies on the other hand require no input from those watching it so utilizing lower frame rates - so long as they are constant - is far more comfortable than if we were to play a game at the same FPS. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Motion pictures work because of an attribute of our visual processing called persistence of vision. If you are shown a rapid series of still frames that are moved into position quickly (without bluring them which is what a shutter in a movie projector does) then it tricks the eye into seeing motion. </p>
<p>24FPS happens to be on the lower end of the minimum number of frames to fool the eye into seeing motion without causing discomfort however it's not high enough to show all types of motion clearly. There is something called the picket fence effect, where objects panning past a 24fps movie camera, appear to judder or jump past the camera noticeably, making it hard to make out the clear edges of the fence boards. This is why panning shots in movies are generally done slowly and controlled, so the frame rate of the camera isn't over loaded with too much motion. </p>
<p>In a video game though it is up to you to control how quickly the camera pans around, and you generally need to look around quickly, which doesn't work so well at 24fps. It might look okay for a cut scene where the game director can slow down the camera so it looks good, but in live play it's not enough. </p>
<p>At 30fps, most motion looks acceptable, but panning motions still seem jumpy. At 60fps even panning and strafing shots seem smooth but the eye can still see even more detail all the way out to 100+fps if very fast motion is observed. </p>
<p>This is why many gamers prefer 60+fps in games, because most kinds of game motion like spinning the camera around, aiming, jumping, running, all basically look smooth, with higher frame rates having diminishing returns. </p>
<p>Ironically when you shoot film at higher FPS, at a certain point it stops looking like film and starts looking more like video like a news or sports broadcast. Movies have a certain look to them that is a combination of the color pallete and dynamic range of the image, but also the lower fixed frame rate which gives movies that 'film' look. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Film has natural inherent motion blur which smooths things out. When played back, each image is actually flashed two or three times which also helps. Standard definition television was interlaced, so the nominal 25 fps of PAL or 30 of NTSC actually meant new image data being displayed 50 or 60 times a second but only half the image each time. Games displayed on a monitor or modern TV have neither of those things.</p>
<p>Additionally a rock-solid 24 fps in a game, with a monitor refresh rate suitably matched, probably wouldn't be so bad. The problems really come when an average 24 fps comes with stutter and lag, and momentary dips well below that, and screen tearing because the monitor refresh rate doesn't match.</p>
<p>EDIT: The replies show split opinion on that, which is not too surprising. I think partly it's what you're accustomed to. Console gamers are used to 30 fps and don't mind it, but PC gamers who usually play at 60+ will notice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Professional game designer here. It really depends a lot on the game. While more fps is always better, it's not always needed. For something that requires twitch based reaction and frame counting, such as fighting games, 60 fps is the minimum acceptable speed. Strategy and casual games usually are a bit more relaxed with 30 fps being fairly acceptable. I haven't worked directly with Sony or Microsoft in recent years, but both used to have a TCR/TRC that stated you game should not fall below 15 fps for any prolonged length of time. Now, &quot;prolonged length of time&quot; is fairly subjective, so we always did our best to never fall below 30 fps, but considered it a critical bug if the game ever fell below 15 fps...at least when getting ready for submission (in regular production we didn't care as much). You would be surprised how hard this is to actually accomplish in open world games. Near the end of my first project, we seriously had to pick and choose what bushes/foliage we wanted to leave in and to take out to improve framerate. Foliage is the WORST to deal with. While particle effects can be rough too, foliage is pretty much always around. It usually has to move in the wind, move for the player and be translucent around the edges. Even when we started using professional middleware (speedtree) for our foliage it was still an fps killer. Anyhoo...that was long...Yeah. More frames = good. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
