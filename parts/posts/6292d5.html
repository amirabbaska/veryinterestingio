		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding of stuff is that net neutrality and net privacy are not the same things at all.  I'll try to paraphrase by memory how the two things were explained to me as if they were different. </p>
<p>Net neutrality became a buzzword for a specific thing that ISP providers were doing to other corporations and how that affected us as customers of those corporations. To give an example, TimeWarner would block all access to connection to websites for Verizon because they didn't want their ISP clients to search for better deals from a competitor. Sometimes it even became a sort of extortion racket. An ISP could block a website from their customers and then demand payment for &quot;reparation of excess stream useage&quot; from the website before they would unblock the website for their customers. </p>
<p>The most common example of net neutrality issue was that some ISP providers were throttling and restricting streams from Netflix because they were &quot;using too much bandwidth&quot; which is an issue because all ISP's like to tell you that data is a rare and expensive limited natural resource that they must carefully regulate before we use it all up faster than it can replenish iteself! (rolls eyes). </p>
<p>Back to serious topic, another thing ISP providers were doing were charging huge surcharges to companies like Netflix to refrain from throttling their streams, or to customers to allow &quot;extra streaming capacity&quot; to use Netflix. The major reason ISP providers did this was because again, companies like Netflix were competitors. If you stream video from Netflix, the chances are higher that you will cancel your cable bill, or something similar. So the &quot;neutrality&quot; part of the FCC laws that were enacted was to stop this sort of thing, because ISP's should have no right to filter or throttle what content you want to consume out of the desire to interfere with fair market trade. This is especially true when you consider they often have a monopoly in their markets. If you don't like what your ISP is doing, most people don't have any options to find some other provider in their area. This is a whole other issue that needs to be dealt with. </p>
<p>The net privacy issue is the one that concerns people because of the bill was just passed by senate and house. It's a bit more complicated than that, because the bill is actually a repeal and replacement of some points of another bill that was started last year, and also the relocation of jurisdiction from one overblown bloated government regulation department to another. But that's really not &quot;the issue&quot;. The issue is that the concept that Google, Facebook, and now your ISP should have some right to monetize your own personal activity on your internet time in order to generate ad revenue, or sell the data to massive analytics companies that use the data later for targeted &quot;marketing opportunities&quot;. </p>
<p>The thing about this bill is that previously, it didn't stop Facebook from such practices, or any other website company where you had to create an account. The concept behind that was if you wanted to keep your life private, simply don't use those social media type websites because there are other alternatives. The new bill is basically giving the same opportunities to ISP providers who you purchase your internet access from, because they complained that websites aren't regulated and have an unfair advantage in opportunity. </p>
<p>The concern is further than the concept that they might just sell what you do to advertisers, but say, they could sell your health searches like &quot;lung cancer&quot; to insurance companies who can then see what you're searching and prepare to raise costs and premiums against you personally based on that data that you might have lung cancer issues and thereby avoid the law in the Affordable Healthcare Act which requires that they cannot raise costs to customers based on previous conditions. Again though, this is nothing that Google wasn't already legally allowed to do before now anyway. </p>
<p>I used to work for this guy, this really shady guy in the late 1980's who did a mailing advertisement scheme. Some of you may remember, how you'd get these envelopes full of coupon printouts trying to get you to go take your business to a lot of other places, like $5 off coupon for a drycleaner's shop, buy one steam carpet room and get a second free offers, stuff like that. Well that's a mailing ad scheme. The people who print the coupons purchased mailing names and lists of people and their addresses from phone companies, or other middle man companies that laboriously copied it all from phone books and stuff. Then they'd sell the concept to businesses that we can send coupons in the mail to all these people on this list for x amount of dollars to bring you new business! And the advertising/publishing company that did all this purchased block lists of names and addresses, like 500 dollars to get 2000 addresses with x zip code, etc. This is really not any different than what's going on now. People have been selling your personal information for profit since before there ever was an internet. The truth is, large companies have been invading your privacy for almost a century now, regardless of the technology involved. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Defeating an enemy one time doesn't make it never reappear to oppose you again. If it lives at all, unless it changes its principle reason for opposing you in the first place, it will go away, regroup, retrain, strengthen, then attack again.</p>
<p>That's how it is with everything in this representative republic. If you value something strongly enough, you must continue to fight for it to keep it alive, and teach your children and grandchildren why and how to effectively fight for it as well.</p>
<p>Imagine the thing you value as being a plant. If you stop watering it, it will die. If you don't keep pests away, it will be consumed. If you don't protect it, it will die. If you don't fertilize it properly, it will get sick and die. If you don't trim and prune it properly, it will become overgrown, consume all its available resources, become anemic, and die. Keeping your plant alive and healthy requires regular attention and maintenance, and, sometimes, 100% focus on defending it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because our victories on net neutrality have been really weak. </p>
<p>The bills that we've been fighting, like PIPA and SOPA, weren't voted on. They were withdrawn. </p>
<p>The 2015 FCC regulation on net neutrality was just an administrative reclassification of Internet service providers as &quot;common carriers&quot; which then subjected the ISPs to rules that prevented paid prioritization under Title 2 of the Communications Act. Hillary Clinton in 2015 described this as merely <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/233722-clinton-backs-fcc-on-net-neutrality" target="_blank">&quot;a foot in the door. It's a values statement. ... [The FCC] is hanging this on Title 2 because it's the only hook they've got.&quot;</a></p>
<p>What we really need, in order to make a victory on net neutrality stick, is to pass a law through Congress. We need a majority of Representatives in the House. We need a majority of Senators in the Senate. We need the President to sign it into law. </p>
<p>We don't have that yet, and the majority party in Congress is on the other side, so we have to keep fighting for net neutrality and privacy every year just to prevent laws that would make things worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>2 years ago, by making ISP's Common Carriers in the US, this was the official enforcement of net neutrality, but the ISP's can still try to get congress to change the rules for common carriers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
