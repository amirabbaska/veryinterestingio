		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good use of sound, color, and light can somehow break the barrier of the screen between you and the movie. A good movie will make you feel like you are a part of that world, therefore you will consider your other surroundings as a part of that atmosphere. Think about the fact that there must have been some really bad movies which didn’t really do anything to you. If every scary movie does that to you then I guess your tolerance and fear of death play the major role in the way you feel. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do know that some movies use infrasound, it’s a frequency lower than we can hear. It’s said to give people feelings like something else is in the room, and this can be used in movies to express that feeling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
