		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have 4 basic types of light receptors in your eyes.  Rods, Red Cones, Blue Cones and Green Cones.  The Rods are used for night vision and edge detection, and the Cones detect the color they are named for.  Different cones have different sensitivities, and the Green Cones are most sensitive, followed by Red, followed by Blue.</p>
<p>Yellow colors activate the Green and Red cones, which are the most sensitive and 2nd most sensitive cones and they add together, generates the largest signal given the same number of photons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eyesensitivity.svg" target="_blank">Eyes happen to be most sensitive for green and yellow</a></p>
<p>But why?!!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.handmadeinpa.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/SA_sun_550SA.jpg" target="_blank">That curve closely matches the light from the Sun that reaches the ground.</a></p>
<p>But why do they match?! </p>
<p>Because it is practical to sense the strongest light the best.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/IMG/lumeff3.gif" target="_blank">Actually our eyes have also night mode. Called scotopic vision. With WAY more sensitivity for blue.</a></p>
<p>But it only kicks in when there is very little light.<br />
That is why everything seems blue when it is dark.        </p>
<p>Why blue?</p>
<p>This happens because oxygen in atmosphere changes the direction of blue light, so even when sun isn't visible, some of the blue rays arrive to us, after many changes in direction.</p>
<p>Finally, on screen yellow will look extra bright, because it is created by lighting <em>BOTH</em> red and green. <a href="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7253/6899963862_52c45a38df_m.jpg" target="_blank">A picture of magnified LCD. Step back to see yellow emerge from green and red.</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It always doesn't. But we don't realize it. Same with orange. It has to do how we categorize colors.</p>
<p>When you have green and make it darker, you have dark green.</p>
<p>When you have red and make it darker, you have dark red.</p>
<p>When you have blue and make it darker, you have dark blue.</p>
<p>When you have purple and make it darker, you have dark purple.</p>
<p>But when you have yellow and make it darker, we don't consider it dark yellow. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/yT5FEOc.png" target="_blank">We consider it olive green.</a> Yellow in RGB is R: 255, G: 255, B: 0. So halving the brightness of yellow gets you dark yellow. R: 128, G 128, B: 0. It appears olive green to us. Not yellow. We don't consider olive green to be yellow, even though it technically is dark yellow.</p>
<p>And when you have orange and make it darker, we don't consider it dark orange. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/X7XS5l7.png" target="_blank">We consider it brown.</a> Orange in RGB is R: 255, G: 128, B: 0. So halving the brightness of orange gets you dark orange. R: 128, G 64, B: 0. It appears brown to us. Not orange. We don't consider that brown to be orange, even though it technically is dark orange.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some good responses so far, but I haven't seen one of the simplest: Contrast. The highest contrast color pair is yellow and black. (Followed by yellow and blue, followed by black and white, then blue and white.) You'll see this expressed in license plates, for instance: NY is black/yellow. California used to be black on yellow, then yellow on black, then yellow on blue and now blue on white. Yellow &quot;stands out&quot; against a world of mostly darker colors.</p>
<p>I am not sure if you mean yellow seems &quot;brighter&quot; in general, but our rods and cones process visual information relatively, looking for contrast between objects (and their colors) to aid in pattern recognition, which helps process information more efficiently. I know all of this only as a layperson because my work is about processing visual information. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with how we classify yellow as a color, as well!<br />
Not often do we see &quot;dark yellow&quot; because it just turns into a different color.</p>
<p>Speaking from the art perspective, if you shade yellow (that's adding black to yellow), you get a color that has more of a green hue.<br />
When you tone a yellow (that's adding the complementary color to yellow, and in this case, it's purple), you get a brown color.
The only real way we can mix yellow with something and keep its yellow hue is with white, but doing so will desaturate it.
Moreso, yellow is a primary color. You cannot mix colors to make yellow.</p>
<p>So simply speaking, yellow is brighter than other colors because we call it something else when it ISN'T the bright yellow we know it to be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
