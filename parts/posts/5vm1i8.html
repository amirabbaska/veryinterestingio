Three are in the habitable zone of the star and all seven could hold liquid water in favorable atmospheric conditions. We have a number of astronomers and planetary scientists here to help answer your questions!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>supposedly the planets are close enough to be seen approximately the size of our moon with the naked eye from one another. Does this not significantly decrease their potential habitability?</p>
<p>would these bodies not experience exceptional seismic forces?</p>
<p>combined with their short orbital periods, wouldn't this mean that their orbits are in constant significant flux?</p>
<p>how do we know that none of them are moons of the other?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apparently one of the cool things about this system is that we could potentially get atmospheric data <em>without</em> waiting for JWST.  I'd like to hear more about this.</p>
<p>I've also read that a potential problem with planets close-in to dwarf stars like this is the issue of large flares stripping atmosphere from the worlds.  Do we know how active this star is in terms of flares that could cause issues like that?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's often asked how long it would take to get there given current technology. With technology that <em>actually exists</em> (chemical rockets and ion drives), it would take roughly 600,000 years.</p>
<p>A question I do have though: I noticed the period of the farthest one is only 20 days. How quickly could we get dedicated Doppler velocimetry data if we started NOW?</p>
<p>Since two of them are tidally locked, can we make heatmaps of their surfaces like for <a href="http://klotza.blogspot.com/2015/09/a-surface-map-of-exoplanet.html" target="_blank">HD189733</a>?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
