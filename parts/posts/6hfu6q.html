		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The metamorphosis of insects is incredibly complex and there are uncounted ways such a process can fail.  </p>
<p>When I worked rearing moths for research, I usually found 15-30% of a batch could not to make it out of their pupae. </p>
<p>Some common failures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They got stuck inside and trapped</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Couldn't free themselves of the pupa shell completely, and so became malformed when their exoskeleton hardened</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>portions of their body failed to express adult characteristics, usually the abdomen, so they remained soft and pliable without the proper organ development on sections of their body</p>
</li>
<li>they were too small/underfed before they pupated, so they likely died of malnutrition/exhaustion in the process</li>
</ul>
<p>You can imagine that if you had to melt down and reconstitute your entire body at the level of individual tissues before you became an adult, that there are hundreds of places nature could throw a wrench in that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. If they don't eat enough they can become too weak to complete their transformation and die partway through. Insects that suspend rather than bury themselves need a solid anchor or they wont be able to shed their skin completely, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSW4WF974lk" target="_blank">as this caterpillar demonstrates.</a> Lots of ways it can all go wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Caterpillars when in the cocoon stage digest themselves with special enzymes that are powered from all the food that they eat. If the caterpillar doesn't meet the required food amount, it either dies while in a liquid state or doesn't liquidate at all and dies in the cocoon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certain insecticides work by preventing metamorphosis from occurring successfully.  Some of these mimic hormones that keep the insect a juvenile.  Instead of forming a pupa and metamorphosing to an adult, the insect keeps becoming a bigger and bigger juvenile, eventually dying.  </p>
<p>Some other insecticide prevent the production of chitin, which makes up the insect exoskeleton.  The insect can't complete molting without building a new exoskeleton, so this hinders the process.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Self doubt. </p>
<p>But actually any number of things. A rapid environmental change, predation, genetic defects or just birth defects in general. You'll find nature is much less forgiving than society is. </p>
<p>Like someone else said, any number of defects can lead to being unable to even emerge. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
