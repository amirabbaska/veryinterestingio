		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mud retains its shape very well yet is still malleable. It also can harden under sun and be filled in by loose sediment, so that's where a lot of footprints come from. In this case the print was found at a prehistoric waterline of a lake so lots of clay. If you go to the paper you'll see the clay sequence in which the print was found in figure 13.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a related note, imprint fossils can be preserved for much longer. There are  <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/environment/27-billion-year-old-fossilised-raindrops/" target="_blank">fossil raindrop splashes in South Africa that are 2.7 billion years old</a>. Similar fossils can be found in Glacier National Park in Montana and are around 1.2 billion years old. The crazy thing is we can use the splash diameter to estimate the density of the atmosphere from that time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First you must consider, what is a Footprint? It is an indentation/deformation of some form of matter, let's call it clay. That clay will retain the deformation indefinitely unless it is once again deformed.</p>
<p>In the case of the preserved footprint you reference the clay was undisturbed by mud that filled in the indentation, which in turn served to protect the indent in the clay.</p>
<p>And note that the material does not need to be clay. There are bootprints on Earth's moon from when the astronauts landed that will be there until the sun turns into a red giant, barring meteor collisions and tourism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trace fossils include tracks, trails, burrows, feeding marks, and resting marks. For example, a trace fossil is the trail left behind by an ancient reptile that dragged its tail in mud. Another example is the footprints left by dinosaurs along an ancient river or the hollow tubes created by worms burrowing in soft mud in an ancient ocean. There are more trace fossils than body fossils because one organism can leave behind many traces (e.g. footprints), but only one set of hard parts (e.g. bones) to become a fossil.</p>
<p>Most trace fossils were formed in soft mud or sand near a pond, lake, river, or beach. The imprints left by the organisms were quickly covered by sediment. The sediment dried and hardened before the imprints could be erased by water or wind. The sediment was then buried under more sediment and became compacted and cemented together to form rock. This process is much the same as the formation of body fossils.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
