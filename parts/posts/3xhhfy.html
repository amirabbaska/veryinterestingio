		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soda isn't inherently caffeinated. It usually has to do with the flavoring ingredients. Colas use something called a cola nut and cola nuts have caffeine and people used to chew them for a quick burst of energy. </p>
<p>Soda pop was invented in Waco Texas, Dr Pepper being the first, and it was originally sold as a medical tonic to help people with low energy, stomach problems, or digestion problems. For instance coca cola was dispensed in pharmacies and advertised as an energy tonic. Pepsi was sold as helping to settle upset stomachs and takes it's name from the word peptic as in stomach. </p>
<p>Since so many sodas were the Victorian equivallent of a red bull energy drink, many contained caffeine and other stimulants. </p>
<p>Lemon, lime, and orange sodas were originally made by mixing soda water with lemon, lime, or orange juice and since none of those ingredients are caffeinated, neither was the soda. San Pellogrino still makes soda this way, with sparkling spring water and actual fruit juice instead of flavorings and corn syrup. </p>
<p>Root beer's main flavoring ingredient similarly has no caffeine in it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly history, but also because caffeine is bitter and thus is more likely to be used to balance the very sweet flavors.</p>
<p>Sunkist Orange Soda and A&amp;W Cream Soda are a couple of flavors that usually aren't caffeinated, but are caffeinated in those specific brands, much to the surprise of many people.  Also Mountain Dew is a citrus flavor that we might not expect to contain caffeine, but it has a strong reputation as having one of the highest caffeine amounts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Traditionally the caffeine in must sodas came from adding Kola Nut (hence Cola).  Kola Nut has an unique taste that you probably wouldn't like if only combined with a single flavor like Lemon or Orange. Once companies came up with a good recipe decades ago they have mostly stuck to them.</p>
<p>Now it is possible to just add straight caffeine to stuff and things are  changing. There has been an explosion of things like red bull and monster energy drinks that are caffeinated fruit flavors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine occurred naturally in the first colas so it became a tradition for darker sodas. However, some root beers like Barq's have caffeine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know for decades in Canada there was regulation against caffeine in clear/non-dark liquids. <a href="http://blog.graywriterrv.com/?p=541" target="_blank">Thankfully that changed in 2010</a></p>
<p>So many of those drinks continue that traditionally marketed caffeine/non caffeine content.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
