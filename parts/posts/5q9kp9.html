		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure this is a universal thing but anways...</p>
<p>If you know when the task needs to be done by for example a school assignment, you will work towards completing this task and once you realise you are mostly done you will think about the deadline. This may be a while away.</p>
<p>Therefore you will relax and take a breather when it comes to this task as you know you are close enough to being done that you can do something else for now and do this task at a later date. This procrastination then gets worse until you eventually have come close to the deadline and do it. </p>
<p>Basically you would rather have everything 80% done than one thing 100%. Just do things straight away in future to prevent this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two explanations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The 80/20 rule: 80% of a task requires only 20% of the effort, the last 20% requires 80% of the effort.</p>
</li>
<li>You're not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Role_Inventories" target="_blank">completer/finisher</a>. I'm the same: once I get to the point I <em>know</em> I could complete it I lose interest. Fortunately I work in a position where my role doesn't require it: I task others to do the last 20% :)</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen it described as a 'fear of finishing', related to worries about having nothing to do afterwards and fears about being unneeded.</p>
<p>If you don't finish it then somebody still needs you...</p>
<p>I suffer from this too and it still seems to happen even if I know I have a long list of things to do next.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
