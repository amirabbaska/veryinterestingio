		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, a lot of these are wrong. I'm an archaeologist so let me try to clear some of these misconceptions up. </p>
<p>You are generally going to find fossils within sedimentary rock, and there are a few types of sedimentary deposition. The most common is by water, where tiny pieces of sediment (not dirt, sediment is weathered/eroded pieces of other rock) are placed either by tides, or simply by falling through water. </p>
<p>The other major type of sedimentary deposition is aeolian, or Loess deposition. Instead if the sediment being carried by water, it's carried by the wind. China has a gigantic Loess plateau, which is interesting because if you examine the types of sediment you can get a complete record of that areas climatic conditions. </p>
<p>As far as fossilization goes, fossils will preserve best when they are deposited quickly, so in an area with a high rate of sedimentation. Many aquatic environments will do this, or landslides, or areas that have sediment windblown quickly. But remember this is generally a very SLOW process, but it happens over enormous timescales. </p>
<p>Sorry for writing a book but I hope this helps. </p>
<p>EDIT: Upon rereading the title I noticed you said &quot;dinosaurs&quot; and &quot;centuries&quot; at the same time. Some archaeology is done from centuries old, these you can find by digging down. Dinosaurs haven't been around since 65 Ma (millions of years ago), typically these sites are found via exposure due to weathering, which is how people know where to look for dinosaur sites. </p>
<p>Also, if anyone is curious I deal with paleolithic archaeology, a nice happy medium between historic arch and paleontology. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the root of your question is: the whole earth getting bigger?  Where does that extra material come from?</p>
<p>And I think the answer is no, it doesn't happen everywhere, just locally.  Some spots get more material, some get worn away.  We only find fossils where it's been net built up over the time since the fossilized creature died.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is missing from all of the answers is the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidence" target="_blank">subsidence</a>. Imagine you're in a basin where sediment is actively being deposited by a river. As sediment is left behind by the river, this is increasing the mass of sediment in a given spot (a little bit more has been added to the top of a column of rock). This does two things: (1) it causes compaction of the sediment beneath it (decreasing the size of pore space, etc) and (2) because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostasy" target="_blank">isostasy</a> it causes the entire column of rock to 'sink' a tiny amount. These both have the effect of lowering the surface elevation of the area where that sediment is deposited. On top of this, there can be tectonic forces that produce 'tectonic subsidence'. A common form of this is the formation of a basin via flexure of the lithosphere, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreland_basin#Lithospheric_behavior" target="_blank">e.g. a foreland basin that forms next to a mountain range because the mountain range itself flexes down the crust (imagine a weight on an elastic sheet)</a>. </p>
<p>As described by many of the other answers, erosion through the action of rivers and glaciers moves sediment from higher to lower areas, but importantly sediment is only deposited if there is 'accommodation space', meaning basically that there is a low spot to fill in with the sediment. That accommodation space is generated by subsidence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well the key is that this didn’t happen over the last few centuries. This happened over millions of years. Millions is a lot. Sea level has changed a lot, mountains have changed a lot, entire continents shift.  It’s not like dust just settles to make new layers (which does happen). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The surface of the earth is constantly experiencing erosion and sedimentation.</p>
<p>Erosion is when rocks are broken down into smaller pieces and washed away. Sedimentation is when those pieces come to rest in a new location and eventually form new rock. Erosion and sedimentation happen because water, wind, and ice are constantly moving across the Earth's surface and acting upon the rock. The planet as a whole is not getting bigger, it's just that material is being moved from place to place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
