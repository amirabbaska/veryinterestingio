		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE ANSWERING</p>
<p>This is a theoretical question about gravity not just a stupid question to be funny. Gravity pulls two objects with mass together. The force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). Both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. The force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. Conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. </p>
<p>But Newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale. It seems that this case is true because the scale doesn't rocket off into space when you turn it upside down but stays in place. </p>
<p>So is force really mass x acceleration? Where is this discontinuity coming from? </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a brilliant question because in some sense you <em>are</em> measuring the earth's mass. </p>
<p>By Newton's third law, the force exerted on the scale by the earth is the same as the force exerted on the earth by the scale - you know, the 'equal and opposite reaction' law. </p>
<p>In this case that force is the force of gravity. The force between two objects of masses <em>M</em> and <em>m</em> separated by a distance R is equal to </p>
<pre><code>F = G M m / R^2</code></pre>
<p>The key point is that scale just happens to be calibrated to measure the mass for an object experiencing earth surface gravitational acceleration - i.e. it assumes <em>GM/R^2</em> is a constant value (which is equal to g=9.81 m/s^(2)), and then returns the value for <em>m</em> that when scaled by this constant is equal to the force the scale measures. </p>
<p>If you had a scale of a known mass and you turned it upside down you could then calculate the value of this constant - <em>GM/R^(2).</em> Then, with known values of <em>G</em> and <em>R</em>, you could calibrate your scale to measure the mass of the earth rather than the mass of the scale :D</p>
<hr />
<p>And to clarify an important point - the earth and the scale don't experience the same accelerations. Use Newton's second law: </p>
<pre><code>m a_1 = G M m / R^2</code></pre>
<p>and find the acceleration of the scale is</p>
<pre><code>a_1 = GM/R^2</code></pre>
<p>Conversely, the force of the earth is</p>
<pre><code>M a_2 = G M m / R^2</code></pre>
<p>So the acceleration of the earth is</p>
<pre><code>a_2 = G m / R^2</code></pre>
<p>Since M is the mass of the earth and m is the mass of the scale, a_2 is much much much smaller than a_1. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a certain sense, you can. </p>
<p>You would simply need to calibrate your measurement to the gravitational pull of the scale. </p>
<p>Since &quot;weight&quot; is actually the gravitational force of attraction between two masses, <strong>the weight of the earth in the scale's gravitational field is the same as the weight of the scale in the earth's gravitational field</strong>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You <em>are</em> actually weighing the Earth by putting a scale upside-down, except there is something about the working of the scale that you need to take into account:</p>
<p>What the scale displays to you in kg or lbs or stone or whatever is the <em>mass</em>, not the weight (that's just an incorrect use of language). But scales don't really measure mass, they measure a <em>force</em> (which is officially called &quot;weight&quot; and is measured in Newtons), and then they calculate mass based on the weight and the Earth's (presumed) gravitational constant (g = 9.807 m/s²) using this simple formula:</p>
<pre><code> Mass = Weight / g</code></pre>
<p>Where Mass is in kg, Weight is in Newtons and g is Earth's g of 9.807 m/s².</p>
<p>The &quot;g&quot; they use is that of Earth, which only applies when measuring the mass of things <em>on Earth's surface</em>. Your scale would not display the correct number on the Moon or on Mars, because their &quot;g&quot; is different and your scale has no clue about this.</p>
<p>So now, if you've flipped your scale upside-down, you're no longer measuring things <em>on Earth's surface</em>, but rather <em>on the surface of the scale itself</em>. It is as if your scale was a mini-planet with Earth standing on it weighing itself. So you need a new &quot;g&quot;, one that applies to your mini-planet, i.e. the <em>scale</em>.</p>
<p>If you could set your scale to use a different &quot;g&quot;, specifically the one that applies to the scale itself rather than the Earth (which would be a much smaller number), you would get the correct Earth mass. In fact you could then send the scale out onto another planet and measure its mass too without any changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mass is not the same as weight! Weight is a measure of force, while mass is mass. If you take the weight given by the scale and solve for M in the equation for gravity you will indeed get the mass of the earth.</p>
<p>In order to &quot;weigh&quot; the earth, you need a reference object. For us, the earth is our reference object when we weigh ourselves on a scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, to answer this simply, you'd just be weighing the other side of the scale. Weight is a measurement of gravitational pull, and since the Earth is by far the closest object, 99.9999999999% (and more) of the gravitational pull is from the Earth. So, the only thing you're measuring is the pull of the Earth on the bottom half of the scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
