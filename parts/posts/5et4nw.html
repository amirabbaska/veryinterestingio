Is it because we associate it with being completely relaxed, is it because sexy scenes in movies are usually in slow motion? How did one think of doing that anyway?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slow motion allows people to observe and/or appreciate the motion with an extended amount of time thus allowing further anaylsing, fantasizing and arousal to occur. This only happens if you are already doing something sensual though. Try watching a person pick their nose in slow motion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a cultural association that's developed over time, but the origin is simple:  teasing. You want the object of your interest in your hands immediately, slow movement makes the fit of desire more intense.  </p>
