		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most animals with shelled eggs produce uric acid. The developing embryo produces nitrogen waste; if it excretes as urea the egg will contain increasingly large concentrations, whereas uric acid can precipitate and sit at the bottom of the shell harmlessly.</p>
<p>Based on that, I would conjecture that most dinosaurs excreted uric acid. But given the wide variability amongst modern reptiles, there were probably also some species that excreted urea... And possibly even some species that could do both.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Birds are modern-day dinosaurs, phylogenetically. Their closest modern-day relatives are crocodiles.</p>
<p>Birds are uricotelic (excreting nitrogen via uric acid), while crocodiles are ammono-uricotelic (excreting nitrogen via uric acid and ammonia). Most likely, dinosaurs would be in that same range, relying primarily on uric acid.</p>
<p>It's entirely possible there were variations in this between species. Just like it's been postulated that some birds can partially switch to ammonotely in situations where that's more efficient (making uric acid costs energy, so if you're calorie-restricted but ingesting lots of nitrogen and water, excreting ammonia would be preferable).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Dinosaurs&quot; is a huge amount of animals spanning 232 million years filling every conceivable ecological niche.  </p>
<p>Birds are dinosaurs.  So their close relatives, the Theropods would have very similar digestive systems.  </p>
<p>Keep going back and you end up with crocodiles and their relatives that branched out to be mammals and their other relatives that became dinosaurs.  </p>
<p>Evolution is just a few gene tweaks that can cause a Great Dane or a Chihuahua.  But the basic things that make every vertebrate function don't really change much across the millenia.<br />
Modern birds still have the tiny urinary bladder (originally evolved in fish) that doesn't really do a whole lot.  They need to lose weight to run fast and fly and carrying a bag of waste water is just slowing you down.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called mute, not poo :-) and it's not all uric acid.</p>
<p>Taken from the modern apprentice:
There are three parts to a mute:</p>
<p>Fecal - the semi-solid mass, frequently this is colored</p>
<p>Urate - white, chalky material - the crystalline uric acid that is the result of protein metabolism</p>
<p>Urine - clear water that flushes the waste from the system</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
