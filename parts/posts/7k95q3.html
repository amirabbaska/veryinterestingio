		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Freakonomics did a thing on it. Basically if your name was more common and easy to say you are more likely to get picked. Also if your teacher called you up based on alphabetical order, people that got called last felt a negative psychological impact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lyrics are told from the point of view of parents who are certain that their son Nigel is &quot;happy in his world&quot;, affirming that his future in British Steel &quot;is as good as sealed&quot;, and that he &quot;likes to speak and loves to be spoken to&quot;.              </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There must have been some perception of truth about the aspirations of the parents' of these young men, as the song was in the charts for many weeks.         </p>
<p>I'd love to know what triggered the popularity of that name in those years,  and whether there is a correlation in status of the parents. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah there are. Preconceptions about names influence our behaviour towards those people. Paired with the Pygmalion/Rosenthal-Effect you can see how names can influence our success. </p>
<p>Children with names, that are connotated negatively by their teachers,  will often be treated differently. To their disadvantage. The same is true the other way around with positively connotated names and advantageous treatment. This effect can also be seen in other environments, like workplaces or daily social encounters. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Exact same resumes were sent to many large companies with only the names being different. Sure enough there was a statistical difference. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
