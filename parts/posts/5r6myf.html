		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did my PhD in the neurodevelopment of sexual orientation. </p>
<p>I think there have been a lot of answers here that do a good job explaining it.  Here's my attempt at an ELI5:</p>
<p>As has been mentioned, genetics does seem to play a large role in sexual orientation, but it isn't a complete explanation. When one twin is gay, there is less than a 50% chance of the other one also being gay. Studies investigating &quot;gay genes&quot; have been inconsistent in their findings, so while there have been studies suggesting certain genes may be involved, next time a study is done, they don't find those genes to play any role. A particular region in the X-chromosome does seem promising though.</p>
<p>So, if genes don't tell the whole story, what else is there? Well, in my own research, I tested the role of the environment in the womb. We found some effects that may point to factors such as immune system of the mother or exposure to hormones influencing sexual orientation.</p>
<p>But if there is ANY role in genetics, why wouldn't it be selected out? Many people have mentioned the gay uncle hypothesis. This theory was popular for a while but has since fallen out favour since research has shown that gay men are no more involved as uncles as straight men. The other hypothesis is that the genes for male homosexuality is a gene for attraction to men, designed to get women to have more babies.  There is evidence that female relatives of gay men tend to have more babies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's not something that you inherit. Straight people can have gay kids. Gay people (at least those who do have kids), can have straight children. </p>
<p>Human genetics are FAR more complicated than most people think, and being gay seems to involve more than just genetics. The fact that identical twins, who have the same genetics, can have different sexualities seems to prove that. There's some evidence that while some people may be genetically more disposed towards homosexual or bisexual activity, some of that may also be determined through epigenetics, from conditions during development as a fetus that affect brain growth. (Basically, imagine that quirks and oddities while a fetus could impact the brain in a way that makes someone gay.)</p>
<p>There continues to be a lot of investigation into this, but it's also worth noting that exclusive homosexual behavior is relatively rare in the animal kingdom. Plenty of animals are gay, and some animals have homosexual behavior being more common than heterosexual, but as long as some animals procreate, the species is able to survive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gay uncle theory says that homosexual men could have increased the reproductive fitness of their close family members by contributing manpower and resources to raising children. You share an average of 25% of your genes with your gay uncle. It's the same principle as many theories of familial altruism whereby helping individuals that share some of your genes might help those genes get passed along.</p>
<p>EDIT: Studies on modern gay uncles do not show that they are better uncles than straight men. This says very little about the role of gay men in prehistoric, tribal societies and how they may have contributed to the survival and reproduction of their kin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the five-year-old that asked, the men in the family are not working at being daddies, but it's ok since the women can work harder at being mommies to make up for it and the men can help them take care of their kids by doing things like sending them to school or making dinner. That's enough weird questions for today, go to bed.</p>
<p>Now that the kids are all gone to bed, we can have the non-ELI5 answer to this non-ELI5 question. </p>
<p>First, we need to understand that the contemporary understanding of evolution has moved from the survival of the species to the survival of the gene. Everything living thing on this good Earth is a mere vehicle for their genes and these genes are constantly fighting to propagate themselves at the expense of other genes. When you have children you and your partner's genes have succeeded in propagating themselves at the expense of other genes in the gene pool. What does this have to do with homosexuality? Hamer et al (1993) and Hamer and Copeland (1995) analysed the families of homosexuals and found that homosexuality seems to be more common along the maternal line allowing them to conclude that homosexuality is passed down via the X chromosome. This suggests that there is a genetic component to homosexuality, but it is not the complete picture. As other redditors have pointed out there are other factors involved too and homosexuality is poorly understood.</p>
<p>Now comes the important part - the Darwinian paradox of it. One theory called Kin Selection tries to explain it by saying that the homosexual males have more time and resources to take care of their cousins, who also carry their genes. This theory, however, has very little empirical support.</p>
<p>The theory that has the most empirical support is known as Sexually Antagonistic Selection. This theory says that the same genes that make the males homosexual are also the same genes that make females more fertile (or fecund, if you like the technical term). Camperio-Ciani et al (2004) compared the families of both heterosexual males and homosexual males and found that while the fecundity of both males and females were roughly the same in families of heterosexual males, the females in families of homosexuals were significantly more fecund than their counterparts in families of heterosexual males. This lends support to the Sexually Antagonistic Selection theory and postulates a possible resolution to this Darwinian paradox</p>
<p>However, this is still not the whole picture. Camperio-Ciani et al (2004) acknowledges that 79% of the variation in their results cannot be explained, meaning that there is still much that we don't know about human sexual orientation. Also, a lot of research has been done on male homosexuality but very little on female homosexuality. This is particularly important because female and male sexuality is very different from each other with female sexuality being more fluid than male sexuality through the life course (Mustanski, Chivers, &amp; Bailey, 2002). In fact, in Mangaia society (Mangaia is an island in the South Pacific Ocean) a female homosexual relationship is used as a form of sex education with an older female teaching a younger female about sex through a homosexual relationship before she has a heterosexual relationship (Marshall, 1971). </p>
<p>Tl;dr, there is much we do not know, and far more that we do not know that we do not know about human sexuality</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So many reasons.</p>
<p>Natural selection is when animals with traits that make it harder to survive (slower, weaker, bad at hunting etc) don't survive long enough to reproduce and pass on their poor genes. But: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Being homosexual does not make it harder to survive (in most countries, anyway) and does not stop you from reproducing. Even in animals those who display mostly homosexual behaviour often still reproduce, since most animals mate only for this purpose and not for pleasure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homosexuality is not simply a gene that it passed on. I don't pretend to understand exactly how and why some people are gay, but it is obviously not simply inherited from your parents since most gay people have heterosexual parents and will have heterosexual children.</p>
</li>
<li>Natural selection largely doesn't even apply to humans anymore. You can be born with any number of unfortunate medical conditions or disabilities and thanks to modern medicine, still both survive and reproduce. You can even reproduce if you are naturally infertile, which is probably why levels of infertility have actually been increasing in recent decades (I think).</li>
