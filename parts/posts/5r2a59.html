		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to address the <em>TV</em> portion as it can be considered separate from movie production and distribution.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To start, let us look at where TV shows come from. A production studio creates the material for a show. As tv production is expensive (2006 estimates are $120 million average for a season), the studio is often funded (and normally owned) by a conglomerate company, such as Comcast-NBCUniversal. Prior to production, the project is greenlighted (ordered) on the premise that it will be exclusive to a certain company (such as the NBC example above).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Airing of the show is negotiated for a time slot on a certain provider. For companies that own the channel (such as NBC), the slots are determined internally based on projected potential viewers and likelihood to draw from competitors' viewers. The channel owner will also sell advertizing slots to offset the cost of production and operation, and negotiate cost-per-subscriber for cable/satellite companies to stream content.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The cable company needs to negotiate with each company that they want to provide on their services. While some of these channels are profitable on their own (based on cost:subscriber), several are not (ESPN, Lifetime, SyFy). Bundling prevents viewers from paying $15 just for ESPN and allows smaller channels to thrive. Cable companies also sell some of the advertizing slots to recuperate broadcasting costs.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now comes in Netflix. Netflix operates on the same principle as Video-on-Demand (VOD), but uses the internet instead of your media box. In order to display shows through its service, Netflix has to secure rights, the same way that cable companies do.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As most rights are held by TV channels, they are reluctant to lease viewing rights within a certain marketability period, which is why shows may not appear for a certain time following their DVD/BD season release. Some studios refuse to lease content to Netflix; Disney-ABC in particular is notorious for this. They also own <em>(edit: 30% of)</em> Hulu, to compete with Netflix and piracy.<br />

<p>They just piggyback.  Thus, it costs Netflix and Amazon FAR less to get the signal from their server to your house.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cable companies pass the cost of individual channels onto consumers and we pay for that.  As an example ESPN costs consumers ~ $7.00 while TNT is the next most expensive channel and it runs about $1.75.  This is a dying business model and it is going to change very soon.  I think the catalyst is when larger companies like Cox, Comcast, DirecTV, etc allows ala carte channel options where you only pay for the channels you actually watch.  I personally have roughly 350 channels but I only watch about 20 of those with any regularity.</p>
<p>However the first thing that needs to fall for this to happen is DirecTV's monopoly with the NFL.  Once that falls it will really open up the market because people will leave DirecTV in droves</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're paying for equipment, maintenance on the network that delivers the channels to your house. etc. Which is alot less then renting servers from Amazon in the long run. Netflix only needs to be available digitally online. </p>
<p>Your traditional cable tv has physical lines that need to be maintained by the company.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to say that mass licenses for shows and movies is probably cheaper than actually buying air time on standard and satellite cable for said content, whereas on the Internet there are no such time slots to pay for. However, I'm also naive on the subject and it could just be them screwing the end user and the web giants don't want to (yet).</p>
<p>Adding my two cents partially because it could be useful, and partially because I want an easy way to get back here and find out how I was wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
