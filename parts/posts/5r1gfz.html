		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The locks actually help ships get above sea level for a stretch of the canal and then another set of locks lowers the ship back down to sea level. There's no real  major difference in the sea levels. The suez canal in Egypt is lockless, meaning water can flow from the Indian ocean to the Mediterranean sea, but again this doesn't  affect either bodies of water much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would look like a big empty ditch carved into the top of a hill with some empty lake beds. In canals like the Panama canal, ships use locks  to travel uphill and then downhill because digging a canal right through a land mass at constant depth is many many maaaany times more work. Here's a picture. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Locks are a combination between a dam and a ship elevator.</p>
<p>In building the canal they constructed a set steps over the continental divide and used locks to hold enough water in place to both lift ships and allow them to float across each step.</p>
<p>If the locks were not there, you'd simply have a sometimes shallow  river on each side of the mountains that no one could navigate a ship all the way up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your interested read The Path Between the Seas - David McCullough  Wonderful and very readable account of the original (French) attempt to build a canal, the breaking away of Panama from Columbia with the help of the US and the construction of the Canal. It is an engineering masterpiece that uses no pumps to move the water and has operated 24-7 since about 1917 without a major break down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So one day they open all of the locks on the canal?</p>
<p>Well water finds it's own level, in this case sea level! There will be a lot of dry land, what rivers still flowed would not be navigable by large ships.</p>
<p>And that I guess the trick of the Panama Canal. Maintaining a navigable channel up and over the higher land.</p>
