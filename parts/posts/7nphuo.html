		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_navigation_system" target="_blank">inertial navigation systems</a>, much like <a href="http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/LN120GStellarInertialNavigationSystem/Documents/ln120g.pdf" target="_blank">jetliners still do</a> to supplement GPS. With some gyroscopes to know the missile's orientation and some accelerometers to know its acceleration (or even just with a pre-programmed knowledge of the engine's thrust profile) you can get a pretty  good idea of its current velocity and make corrections to stay on course. This works pretty well. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-2_rocket#Technical_details" target="_blank">German V2 rockets</a> used this in WWII, and there were even torpedos with steampunky brass gyroscopes and gears and clock-springs to hold course underwater. By the 1970s, though, physical spinning metal gyroscopes were being replaced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_laser_gyroscope" target="_blank">laser ring gyroscopes</a> (<a href="http://www.k-makris.gr/AircraftComponents/Laser_Gyro/laser_gyro.htm" target="_blank">e.g.</a>, <a href="https://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/how-things-work-ring-laser-gyros-32371541/?all" target="_blank">e.g.</a>) which are more accurate. The micromechanical gyros in your phone work on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrating_structure_gyroscope" target="_blank">vibration principle</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/fun/part15.htm" target="_blank">Some missiles used ground guidance</a> during the boost phase — that is, radars near the launch site would follow the missile's course and send info to it by radio — but I don't know if that technique was used much for ICBMs. If you're launching ICBMs, it means things have really gone to hell, and you might not want to rely on any particular other part of your country to still be in existence if you don't have to. But ABMs like the Sprint were effectively ground-guided.</p>
<p>A ballistic missile is a bit like a bullet, in that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile_flight_phases" target="_blank">(almost) all of the acceleration is at launch time</a>. For most of the travel time, it's just coasting/falling — that's what &quot;ballistic&quot; means in &quot;ballistic missile&quot;. There might be a midcourse correction (maybe based on star sights, aka &quot;astro-inertial&quot; navigation) and some terminal-phase corrections during reëntry, but for the most part, the guidance happens during boost and immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>As a side note, one of the reasons that large nuclear weapons went out of favor after the '50s was improved missile guidance. A 50-MT bomb is useful if you can only get it approximately on target, but if you have a missile that can drop things within a mile or so of where you want, it makes much more sense to load it up with <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//nsa/NC/mirv/mirv.html" target="_blank">several independently-targeted 100-kT bombs</a> instead of a single monster. Today, most of the US's warheads are below a megaton.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's also why they carry massive warheads. The development of gps systems first demonstrated in the Gulf War allowed much smaller projectiles to accomplish much greater damage.  The scale of it is incredible, today a naval vessel 1000 miles off shore can fly a missile through a specific window into a specific structure ...  50 years ago we would be carpet bombing to accomplish the same destructive effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First projects involved a crewed calsule with a kamikaze pilot. No kidding.</p>
<p>Later they just used maps and geometry to precisely aim the rocket. They still do it today. ICBMs are not guided mid-flight. They cannot change their course. It's a design feature to prevent any sort of hacking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
