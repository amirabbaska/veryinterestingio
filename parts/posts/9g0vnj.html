		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A friend told me the following math problem:  </p>
<p>Imagine you are walking to the bus stop. Your current position has a value of 1, the bus stop has a value of 0, and the distance between the two can be represented by a decimal. Before you reach the bus stop you must first reach half way to the bus stop (0.5), and then you must reach half way between that point and the bus stop (0.25), and then you must reach half way between that point and the bus stop (0.125) and so on and so on, I think you get the picture. If you must first pass an infinite number of places before reaching the bus stop, mathematically how do you actually reach it? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you continue this process infinitely, simple math would suggest that you will never reach the bus stop, but we know that we can reach it in a real world example. Is this because as numbers get very small they must approach a finite value? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why can't you go through these infinitely many &quot;halves&quot; in a finite amount of time? </p>
<p>Let's say, for simplicity, that you're running to the bus stop at a constant speed, and you stop when you suddenly hit the sign, or something. So, you're running from position 1 to position 0 (note, I reversed this), say the units are meters. If you're running at, say, 1m/s, then the time it takes for you to go the first half, from 1 to 1/2, will be 1/2 a second. The time it takes for you to go the second chunk, from 1/2 to 1/4 is 1/4 of a second. The time it takes to get from 1/4 to 1/8 is 1/8 of a second. This pattern continues. The time it takes you to get from the chunk 1/2^(n) to 1/2^(n+1) is 1/2^(n+1) of a second.</p>
<p>What, then, is the total time of the trip? You would have to sum up all the times together. The times for each chunk are 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, etc seconds each, so the total time will be</p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 +...</li>
</ul>
<p>where the sum goes on infinitely. This is a very classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series" target="_blank">Geometric Series</a>, and adds up to a finite value. That finite value, in this case, is 1. So after 1 second, you will have gone through all of these infinitely many halfway points and gotten to the end (which makes sense, because you're going 1 m/s for 1 meter). So, even though there are infinitely many halves to go through, it takes a finite amount of time to get through them all.</p>
<p>This situation is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes" target="_blank">Zeno's Paradox</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might not know it, but you have stumbled onto one of the fundamental building blocks of calculus.  The idea of a &quot;limit&quot;.</p>
<p>You are right that, as time passes on, the distance gets closer and closer to 0, but never actually reaches it, so we would say that the &quot;limit&quot; is equal to 0.</p>
<p>Here is another example of a limit to think of.  Say you have a sibling who is 3 years older than you, how many more <em>times</em> older than you are they?</p>
<p>When you are 1, they are 4, and so they are 4/1 = 4 times older than you.</p>
<p>When you are 2, they are 5, and so they are 5/2 = 2.5 times older than you.</p>
<p>When you are 3, they are 6, and so they are 6/3 = 2 times older than you.</p>
<p>Let's jump ahead.</p>
<p>When you are 20, they are 23, and so they are 23/20 = 1.15 times older than you.</p>
<p>When you are 50, they are 53, and so they are 53/50 = 1.06 times older than you.</p>
<p>No matter how old you are, they will be 3 years older, and so this fraction will always be bigger than 1, but it will be getting closer and closer and closer to 1, so we say that &quot;limit&quot; is equal to 1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number" target="_blank">Infinitesimals are indeed valid!</a>!</p>
<p>Keep a few things in mind though:</p>
<p>An infinitely small number is not necessarily the smallest number. If we say some number x is infinitesimal, x/2 is another infinitesimal, and so is x/3, and so one. You could also have a number be infinitesimally small compared to an infinitesimal, and so on. Hyperreal numbers have this branching hierarchy all the way down, and up into infinite values as well.</p>
<p>Another thing is that numbers, from the conventional views of most mathematicians and scientists, have no real world meaning in and if themselves. Some people believe numbers exist out there, such as mathematical Platonists. But most view math very differently. Maths some would say is a language, a way of talking about things that happens to have rigor built in. Some say maths is more of just an extended and particular sort of logic, we are drawing conclusions from axioms after all, but maths has special assumptions logic does not. Some also argue maths is like a story or a game, where we are defining different rules and playing by them to see what happens. And you can have entirely different rules to found maths, so there isn't one superior game so to speak. Mathematical truth is not contingent on physical reality in most conceptions, nor visa versa.</p>
<p>So, there are hyperreals which contain infinitesimals, but no really interesting and consistent systems that extend the integers or the reals contain a &quot;smallest number&quot; (to my knowledge). Also it's maths so none of it has an intrinsic physical meaning according to most.</p>
<p>Make of that what you will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Given any number (other than 0), you can always find a number closer to 0 (given a suitable definition of &quot;closer&quot; and &quot;number&quot; - but let's not go too deep into mathematical theory). The most obvious example being that if you give me the number <em>n</em>, I give you back <em>n/2</em>, which is closer to 0 (in the sense that <em>|n - 0| &gt; |n/2 - 0|</em>). So in the same way that numbers can always get bigger, numbers can always get smaller.</p>
<p>Mathematically, there are ways of defining infinitesimals and dealing with them, just as there are ways of dealing with infinities. Generally mathematicians don't like being told they can't do something - instead they just find a new way of defining things to make it work. So in this sense, infinitesimals do exist.</p>
<p>To answer your problem; yes, you'd have to go through an infinite number of gaps. But you're going through an infinite number of <em>infinitely small</em> gaps. Meaning that if you're going at a constant speed, you'll go through the infinitely small ones infinitely quickly.</p>
<p>So what happens when you combine an infinity and an infinitesimal?</p>
<p>You get what's sometimes called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminate_form" target="_blank">indeterminate form</a> - a thing whereby you can't work out what you get without more information. And this is where we introduce the concept of limits of functions. This whole area of limits, infinitesimals and so on is the basis for the calculus of variations - one of the main branches of standard maths.</p>
<p>In this case, it turns out that your infinite number of infinitesimals works out in the way we'd expect. i.e. 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... = 1</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
