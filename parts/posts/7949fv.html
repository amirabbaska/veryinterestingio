		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No.  No orbit can have Periapsis within or at the photon sphere.  There are no stable orbits within that region.  Within that region to escape to infinity you must expend work to escape constantly.</p>
<p>Generally orbital mechanics uses Newtonian gravitation.  Here the potential energy of an orbit would decrease as one gets closer and closer to a gravitational well.  This is not the case with black holes and general relativity.  Scott Manley has a really good video about there here.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM8HvoaKsBU" target="_blank">How close can you orbit a black hole</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No.
This is one example that pretty dramatically shows the difference between classical mechanics (under which that would be possible) and general relativity.
An object orbiting a black hole at close range will not be in an elliptical orbit, but spiraling inwards, giving off energy in the form of gravitational waves. In fact, all orbits do this, but it's so insignificant except in extreme cases that it doesn't really matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sili question here, do black holes have a &quot;side&quot;? I mean, are they like stars, but isntead of emitting in every direction, they absorb from every direction? Or are they more like funnels that &quot;absorb&quot; from one side and ... Well... Not emit from the other?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>if the orbital distance at periapsis is less than the event horizon...the object is no longer in orbit around the black hole. It's fallen in and physically can not go back. This is sort of like asking if there's a stable orbit around the earth that involves a satellite slamming into the surface of the planet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
