		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An alter ego has no psychological definition, and as a result refers to many things. Many of those things are engaged in willingly by the person, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A second family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pseudonym</p>
</li>
<li>Superhero civilian personas</li>
</ul>
<p>Dissociative identity disorder involves an individual possessing an alter ego, but it is one that the person cannot control.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dissociative personality disorder is usually caused by severe, repeated trauma in early childhood. The developing mind is unable to cope and the growing personality fragments. </p>
<p>Most commonly it results in one or more alters that are apparently normal, though often incapable of showing negative emotional states. Those states tend to be risky when life depends on abusive people so they get &quot;outsourced&quot; to other alters. Often one or more carry the massive pain and fear induced by the trauma along with the traumatic memories, which the apparently normal personality is usually not aware of. They can't access the memories outside a flashback, which usually also comes with a personality switch. If you ask them, they can't remember their childhood at all or call it &quot;normal&quot;. Other alters are collections of anger and impossible to act out impulses to fight back. There are often more alters with different functions depending on the individual and the nature of the trauma.</p>
<p>Dissociative personalities aren't necessarily fully separated from each other, even within one body some might know of each other while others are isolated (usually because they're hard to deal with in everyday life). It's actually the goal of traumatherapy to get these aspects to communicate and work together. It <em>is</em> possible to become a cohesive whole again, with lots of work and the willing participation of all, but it's not absolutely necessary. Well collaborating systems can have a good, healthy life too.</p>
<p>An alter ego is a choice, dissociative identity disorder is the absolute opposite of choice. It's the result of a young mind so battered that the only way to maintain any semblance of functionality was to fragment and bury the most dysfunctional memories, emotions and impulses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If anybody is interested,  one of my favorite shows by Steven Spielberg beautifully documents DID. At least,  it seems to based on my own research and all the comments here.  It's called United States of Tara.  If you're interested in the subject,  I'd recommend it.  It's actually what sparked my interest in the subject and trauma related psychology to begin with. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
