		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is a very complicated machine that does a lot of things you're not aware of, especially with regard to processing images. Your brain figures out what's up and down based on visual cues and a special little gravity sensor inside your ear.</p>
<p>Fun fact, in an [experiment](<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/nov/12/improbable-research-seeing-upside-down" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/nov/12/improbable-research-seeing-upside-down" target="_blank">https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/nov/12/improbable-research-seeing-upside-down</a></a>), a guy was able to completely adjust to seeing the world upside-down, through the use of mirrored glasses. It took the guy about a week, but when they took the goggles off, the &quot;normal world&quot; was as confusing and disorienting as the &quot;upside-down&quot; world had initially been.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
