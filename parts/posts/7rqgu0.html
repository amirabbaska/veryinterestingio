		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are making good points, but I have a great deal of experience in microscopy and would like to sum things up. </p>
<p>The electron microscope (EM) does not produce a photograph at all. Rather it produces a topography, or a bump map. If you've seen a map of the ocean floor, with deeper areas colored darker, this is the same thing. </p>
<p>This happens because the microscope actually fires a beam of electrons at a small section of your sample, back and forth very quickly like how the image on old TV's is displayed. Depending on several factors, such as the angle at which the beam connects and the different elements present within your sample, the computer connected to your EM produces a black and white topography. </p>
<p>At this stage you are able to use software to make calculations about the size of different features, and even determine a breakdown of which elements are present. Images like the ones you linked are often artificially colored to be more attractive for media releases. </p>
<p>The reason that the surface of these organisms appear so smooth (good eye by the way!) Is that the electron microscope is only capable of producing topographies of conductive materials, such as metals. In order to study organic (non conductive) samples, we <em>literally use a plating machine to coat bugs with literal gold</em> so that we can determine their features. The coating is extremely thin and the actual amount of gold used is so small that it is not expensive, but we are unfortunately unable to discern many of the surface details of non conductive samples using electron microscopy. </p>
<p>I have used this machine a lot and can assure you that the images are very real. I have also used much more powerful microscopic methods, and if you think tiny organisms are surreal, the lattice structure of atoms would blow your mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
