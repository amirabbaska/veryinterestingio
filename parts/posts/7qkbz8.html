		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most websites use third-party companies to process online transactions to reduce their own liability (PayPal, Cybersource).  Creditcard companies worked together in the early 2000's to create information security rules that dictate how other companies are allowed to handle customer creditcard information (mostly determined by how many transactions the company performs per year) called PCI Compliance.  Failure to meet these standards will result in Creditcard companies refusing to process transactions with your company.  </p>
<p>For most large ecommerce companies, such as Amazon, the seller NEVER sees the customer's creditcard information, and certainly cannot save it locally for re-use (without a developer deliberately creating a fraud scenario in code).  The exception to this is when customers call customer service and give them their creditcard information over the phone, where old-fashioned fraud is still possible.  PCI Compliance rules cover this scenario as well (for example, customer service people are disallowed from having cell-phones in the call center to make it harder to commit fraud).  If you want to save creditcards locally as part of your legitimate business, PCI rules are much tougher, so many companies just don't bother.</p>
<p>When you enter a creditcard into the checkout form on a website, most of that information is generally not saved anywhere.  When you click &quot;Submit&quot; your creditcard info is encrypted and sent to the third-party who validates the request and sends back a token (a temporary hash or string of characters) which can be used by the seller to authorize a payment on your behalf for a certain amount of time.  The concept of &quot;saved creditcards&quot; also uses these tokens, so your creditcard info is not actually stored on the website anywhere.  Companies are allowed to save the creditcard type, last few digits of your creditcard, and expiration date.  That's pretty much it.  Some companies also save the CVV code but this is not actually allowed.
These tokens can still result in certain kinds of fraudulent payments, but they are limited by the seller's inability to reuse the token on other websites and also because they are easy to track.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, if you directly provide this info to the website (which is typical), it's no safer than when you use your card in a store or restaurant. They <em>could</em> copy your info and use it. However, they risk getting caught, losing their credit card processing permission, and even going to prison.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the safety of credit cards is that in the event of a problem, the remedy (for the consumer) is straightforward -- refund the money. If someone fraudulently charged $300 on your card, then it's pretty obvious what should be done to make it up to you -- reverse that charge so you don't owe the $300.</p>
<p>So, for the consumer, that's pretty safe.</p>
<p>If you're asking what keeps the merchants from using that information to steal money from you, the answer is that it's a high-risk, low-reward situation. The chances of getting caught are very high.</p>
<p>You know about sometimes you hear about companies getting hacked and credit card information stolen? How do they know it happened? Various ways, but a very common way is that their bank told them that it happened.</p>
<p>When there are fraudulent credit card charges reported, the banks look for patterns. if they notice, for example, that there are suddenly a large number of fraudulent charges and all of them recently also had charges at the same major retailer, they are going to take a closer look at that.</p>
<p>So, if you are a retailer, and you have a bunch of credit card information, if you use it for illicit purposes, then there's a good chance your finances are going to be looked into, because you are what all those fraudulent charges have in common.</p>
<p>Also, that three-digit number that you type in on the back of your card? Merchants aren't allowed to store it, which is what makes it a good security check.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To take payments online youâ€™re required to have an account with an Acquiring bank/Payment processor. These are 3rd parties and act as intermediaries between customer and merchant. Merchants themselves will never at any point receive your full card number, let alone the Cvv2 code on the reverse. </p>
<p>In most cases the only information the merchant will have about you specifically will be a largely redacted card number, your name and address for shipping purposes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
