		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The light that goes through the lens either gets spread out, or focused. Either way, it won't cover the same area it would have if it hadn't gone through the lens. So those areas the light hits will receive more, or less, light.</p>
<p>With your glasses, <del>depending on which way round your hold them</del>, you'll get a dark &quot;shadow&quot; or a bright &quot;spot&quot;. The former will be accompanied by a brighter section around the shadow of the frames (where light is &quot;doubling up&quot;, see below), but you often don't notice this unless you're looking for it. The latter will be surrounded by an annular shadow within the frame's shadow.</p>
<p>(edit: it doesn't depend on which way round you hold them, but, I think, on whether they are convex or concave. Both cause &quot;shadows,&quot; but different types).</p>
<p>If you think of it from the point of view of someone looking up at the lens (don't do this if you're using the Sun or any bright light as your light source!), then in the two cases:</p>
<p>When the lens is acting to magnify the image of the Sun: there will be locations from which you will only see the unobstructed Sun; there will be locations where you only see a magnified Sun, through the lens (shortly before your retina is burned to a crisp, anyway); and there will be locations where you won't be able to see the Sun at all, because it is blocked by the lens and all you see through the lens is a magnified view of some empty sky.</p>
<p>When the lens is acting to shrink the imagine of the Sun: there will be locations from which you will only see the unobstructed Sun; there will be locations where you only see a smaller Sun through the lens (less light reaches your eye, it's still bad for you though), and there will be areas where you can see <em>two</em> Suns - one unobstructed, the other made of light refracted through the lens to reach your eye by a different path (this is the aforementioned bright ring around the frames).</p>
<p>So it's not a shadow as such, just a redistribution of light over a different area (smaller or larger).</p>
<hr />
<p>For those pointing out that lenses don't transmit 100% of the light, yes, but the effect is tiny in this case:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lens effects aside, glass is also not completely transparent to light. Hold up a clear, flat piece of glass in the sun: there's still a shadow. Some of the light gets absorbed and heats the glass material. Other light gets reflected. Together, these are the&quot;missing light&quot;  that makes the shadow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some good answers here, but I thought I'd add my two cents. While the refraction of the incident light is absolutely occurring, there are other effects in play as well. When light strikes a material interface, there are a few things that can happen:</p>
<p>1: the light gets transmitted through the interface, being refracted. The degree to which the light gets refracted is dependent on the ratio of the indices of refraction of the materials (see Snell's law). In the case of a lens, this is exactly the effect we are looking for.</p>
<p>2: the light can be reflected. The ratio of light reflected to incident can be calculated by Fresnel equations. Reflection is not ideal for a lens, but great for a mirror.</p>
<p>3: the light can be absorbed. There is no truly transparent substance, only in a vacuum will light travel indefinitely. When light strikes a particle, the particle might absorb it. There are a few ways that light gets absorbed, like electron excitation or bond vibrational energy. Most of the time the energy of the light is converted to kinetic energy of the absorbing material, i.e. heat. This is why things left in the sun are hot.</p>
<p>4: the light can be scattered. When a particle absorbs light, there is the possibility of it re-emitting the light. The direction of the re-emitted light is random (within bounds depending on particle size and polarization, see Rayleigh scattering and, if you really hate yourself, Mie scattering). This is the classic reason why the sky is blue, shorter wavelengths are more easily scattered by air. </p>
<p>In answer to your question, all of these phenomena occur. While refraction is certainly the largest effect in play, the others are important as well. For instance, take a piece of plate glass outside, it casts a slight shadow as well. Since a piece of flat glass shouldn't act as a lens, it shows the other effects (now the primary effect is reflection). Sunglasses demonstrate absorbance, and to see scattering, see milk (the casein particles in milk act as scatterers). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other reply from wonkeymonkey is excellent, but I figure I can answer it in a shorter way as well.</p>
<p>The fact that you can see the lens means that it is reflecting light, so clearly some of that light is not hitting the ground where it would have originally, thus there's a shadow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
