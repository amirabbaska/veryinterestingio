		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To simplify vouchers greatly, let's say it costs the local school district $10,000 per year to educate a student. Vouchers allow a parent to apply that money toward tuition at a private school. Proponents (generally Republicans) would speak in terms of giving parents greater choice and flexibility, while opponents (generally Democrats) would object to tax money being diverted from public education to private education.</p>
<p>Charter schools were designed to be a compromise between the proponents and opponents of vouchers. Instead of the $10,000 going to a private school, it goes to a charter school. Charter schools are public schools (publicly funded, tuition-free, open to all), but they're run independently. In theory, they're supposed to have greater flexibility that's combined with greater accountability. </p>
<p>This &quot;accountability&quot; is to an authorizer, which might be the state department of education, a university, the local district, or even a select group of non-profit organizations, depending on the state's charter law. A group of people applies to an authorizer to get a &quot;charter&quot; to open a school, and this authorizer has the authority to close the school if it isn't up to snuff. This is different from a traditional public school, which is accountable to a Board of Education, which is either directly elected or appointed by elected officials.</p>
<p>Charter schools were originally envisioned as alternative, specialty schools, but they're now mostly associated with low-income urban areas as alternatives to struggling traditional public schools. They've become increasingly controversial in recent years, with folks (primarily of a liberal persuasion) raising questions about their impact on traditional public education, their discipline policies, and possible issues of selection bias in admissions.</p>
<p>(I should note that I work in the charter world, but I am also sympathetic with plenty of charter criticisms.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try to keep this ELI5-ish: Charter schools are public schools that are run and maintained by three specific entities.</p>
<p>First, we need an entity to charter the school called an Authorizer.    This is most often a local or state university.  It can even be a community college.  Their charter is like a rule book for how the school should be run.  They also maintain state and federal compliance for the school.  In a sense, the vouch for the school in the eyes of the state and federal government. </p>
<p>If a chartering group decides to pull a school's charter, the school closes.  </p>
<p>Second, we have a Charter Management Organization (CMO).  It manages the school's logistics. They'll often shape curriculum and policy in the school.  They also hire personnel.  Teachers who work in given charter school do not work for the school.  Technically, they work for the CMO; therefore, if a school closes, the teachers might still have jobs if the CMO runs multiple schools and can relocate them. More often, however, a school closes and the CMO has nowhere to put the teachers and the teachers are let go.  Still, it's important to note that teachers and staff work for the CMO - not the school, itself.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the school board.  This is the one key piece that is similar to regular public schools.  They oversee budget issues, compliance issues, and authorizer issues.  They can be members of the community, business folk, student parents, or even people that have a secondary or tertiary relationship to the school.  Charters can often have difficulty being seen as &quot;neighborhood&quot; schools.  Kids are free to attend b/c they are still public schools, and those kids can come from just about anywhere in the area.  Miles and miles away, at times.  The school boards often reflect this disjointedness by having members who are not necessarily attached to the school, directly.</p>
<p>Each group gets a cut of the public per pupil allotment.  In Michigan it averages around $7,000-7,500 a kid.  The authorizer will usually ask for 3-10%.  The CMO gets about the same.  The rest of the $$ goes to the school's general fund and is used to run the school while monitored by the board.</p>
<p>This group of three kind of checks and balances each other in that once a CMO decides to open or run a school, they find an authorizer to maintain the charter.  A board is voted on and then approved by the authorizer. </p>
<p>The CMO gets a contact to run logistics for a set period.  When those contracts run out, the CMO can pull out or reapply.  The authorizer can say the CMO is shit and press the board to send out bids for a new CMO.  If they don't, the authorizer can pull the charter.</p>
<p>If the CMO and board find another authorizer, they can remain open.  This is possible but unlikely, so schools often close of the charter gets pulled.  </p>
<p>If the board thinks either the CMO or authorizer is shit, they can look to gain authorization for another group or find a new CMO.</p>
<p>Basically, the authorizer is like a regular public school's governing body.</p>
<p>The CMO is like the regular public school's district with it's CEO like a superintendent.</p>
<p>The board is like the regular public school's board.</p>
<p>Vouchers are a way for families in regular public schools to take the tax money allowed to their kid (remember that $7,000?  It's not quite as much as families get on a voucher, but it's a chunk).  </p>
<p>Families can take that money and go to another regular public school and &quot;pay&quot; that district with the voucher, so long as that regular public school has open enrollment, meaning they (with some guidelines) allow students who do not live in their district to attend their schools.</p>
<p>Vouchers do not apply to charters b/c charters can take in any public school kid from any district.  Like all public schools, they get their budget based on enrollment counts that occur twice a year.</p>
<p>And those count days come, school's basically turn into carnivals with raffle give away, games, ice cream socials, and even fair/carnival rides.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Charter schools use public money, but are semi privately run like a non profit organization. The rules for setting one up very by State, but they usually involve getting a certain threshold of students enrolled, and presenting some type of academic plan for educating the students. School Vouchers are tax dollars given directly to parents instead of the school district they reside in, where the parents can then find a school they want to enroll their kid in, and use the voucher to pay for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to point out one type of (American) school that hasn't been mentioned, Magnet Schools.</p>
<p>I went to a magnet High School. They are a sort of in between regular public schools and a charter schools. Magnet Schools are public schools and have unions and the same accountability/school board but they have more flexibility in subjects and lesson plan. Mine had more field trips (including a Shakespeare drama each year), senior internships, good teachers, smart peers, etc.</p>
<p>Magnet Schools can have selective enrollment and and usually  a focus on certain subjects(sciences, medicine, art etc.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main difference between charter and public schools is that public schools are part of a district which is managed by a public school board (publicly elected officials) while charter schools are managed either by the immediate school administration, or by private management organizations. Additionally, charter schools are often waived of having to follow the same regulations as public district schools. The waving of regulations vary by state.</p>
<p>The argument for fewer regulations is that there is more room to experiment. The flip side is that without regulations, it is much harder to hold charter schools accountable for how they spend public money, and what should be happening at each school. For example, charter schools in CA are not required by law to provide textbooks to every student.</p>
<p>Traditionally, charter schools began as a way to have 'teacher run schools' that could better adjust how funds were spent to best meet the needs of their kids (which vary based on school population), but in the last decade there has been a huge boom in larger 'chain store' models of charter schools - which are very interested in growth, often at the expense of quality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
