		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the rug (and especially all the gaps of air inside of it) transfer heat much slower than the ceramic tile does. The result is that when you are standing on the tile the heat quickly leeches out of your foot and spread out into the whole tile. On the other hand when you stand on the rug your body can quickly warm up the particular bit of rug you are standing on (since the heat canâ€™t spread out as fast through all the air/fabric pockets) so it feels warmer.</p>
<p>This also works the other way too, and is why a hot piece of fabric out of the dryer can be comforting, but a piece of metal at the same temperature can be painful to touch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because rugs don't conduct heat as well as a tile floor.</p>
<p>Your foot only feels cold when it becomes cold. If you touch your foot to something that is cold, but conducts heat poorly, it won't be able to suck much heat out of your foot. If you touch your foot to something cold that conducts heat well, it's going to suck a lot of heat out of your foot, and your foot will feel cold.</p>
<p>The same thing applies for hot things. If you were to put a rug and a ceramic tile into a hot oven, the tile would be much better at transferring heat <em>to</em> your hand. So, the hot tile might burn you, but you might be able to safely pick up the hot rug. Assuming the rug hasn't caught fire...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>we don't really sense temperature like a thermometer. what we detect in touch is a temperature difference (against the temperature of your skin at the moment). if  an object is at a higher temperature, heat flows to your skin, raising its temperature and allowing you to detect that difference. if it is colder, heat flows from your skin and you detect a negative difference.</p>
<p>the carpet and tile are both at the same temperature (room temp) so they both should feel cold against your skin if their ability to transmit heat energy was the same. what causes a discrepancy is the difference in conductivity of these materials. floor tile (ceramics in general) are good conductors of heat so you can quickly determine by touching it that it is cold (specifically, colder than your skin at that time of measurement). carpets by design are poor heat conductors because of trapped air. because of this, your skin cannot detect a temperature difference as heat cannot flow. </p>
<p>if there was a third material at room temperature like say, stainless steel, it would feel even colder than the tile. all this despite the three materials being at room temperature .</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

It's produced in a very easy to undertsand way, so IMO it is great for an ELI5.
It also means I don't ahve to type out the whole thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Rugs are like clothes, they are slow heat conductor and therefore very good at keeping you warm. When you step on them, it doesn't steal much of your heat and thus you don't feel the cold.</p>
<p>Tiles on the other hand are like cooking pots, they're good at conducting heat. When you step on it, the warmth of your foot gets absorbed by the tiles quickly and you get cold feet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
