		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered this. Essentially, running the A/C costs energy, so it's worse for the environment than just having windows open. But if you're going fast, the windows being open adds a lot of drag, so you have to spend more energy to maintain the same speed than if they were closed. What speed would I need to go for the energy &quot;benefit&quot; of not running A/C be equal to the energy loss of that drag?</p>
<p>This obviously depends on car model, temperature difference, wind, air pressure... I'm more interested in order-of-magnitude guesses. Is this achievable with a standard sedan? Are cars designed so efficiently that I'd need to break the sound barrier to get close?</p></div></div>
