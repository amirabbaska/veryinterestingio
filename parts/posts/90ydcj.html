		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>On crunches and 'the burn':</strong> </p>
<p>Accumulation of metabolic waste product.  When doing an exercise with a muscular metabolic demand similar to crunches (high rep pushups and squat jumps would be similar), the limiting factor is metabolic waste product buildup.  The 'burn' you feel is the accumulation of metabolic waste (particularly lactic acid) from the chemical reactions making your muscles 'go'. At this exercise intensity, you are operating at a rate of power where your muscles are accumulating metabolic waste products faster than that waste can be pumped out and excreted or processed.  Think of the burn you feel as a warning alarm, and the point where you can't do any more reps like your body hitting the emergency shut-off switch so you don't damage your muscles with excess waste buildup.  </p>
<p>*(Interesting anecdote: prey animals such as horses and rabbits have been known to 'run themselves to death,' as they seem to not have the same biophysiological safegaurds as humans in terms of the 'emergency stop' response to metabolic waste buildup.  Only time I've heard of a human doing that was the first ancient Marathon.)</p>
<p><strong>On pullups and acute fatigue at high-maximal power output:</strong></p>
<p>Because each rep requires substantially more force and power than each rep of, for example, crunches, the limiting factor here is creatine-phosphate (CP) availability.  You may have heard of 'creatine' in nutritional supplements; basically what creatine does is hold onto a phosphate, so when you break down adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) for energy, that creatine is waiting hooked up to a spare phosphate molecule to donate to spent adenosine-diphosphate (ADP), thus quickly and rapidly replenishing ATP for energy.</p>
<p>However, creatine is limited within the muscle, so once you've used up all of the creatine-phosphate 'donations', you're just out and can't produce power at the same capacity anymore until you allow some recovery time for the now free creatine molecules to pick up free phosphate molecules so they're ready to be again donated to ADP.  It takes roughly 10-20 seconds operating at maximum power to exhaust the vast majority (I don't remember the percentage off the top of my head) of your creatine-phosphate within a given muscle.  Once this happens, you suddenly feel your muscles being unable to produce the required force for a movement, which is where the &quot;my arms just stop moving&quot; sort of feeling comes from.</p>
<p>However! if you were to immediately jump off the pullup bar after a set and swap to a lower-resistance exercise using the same muscle groups (e.g. pulldowns, rows, etc.) you could continue operating with less force and power until you begin accumulating metabolic waste products in those muscle groups and get the 'burn'.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Here's a further breakdown of metabolic physiology!  </p>
<p><strong>Immediate phophagen</strong>: The previously mentioned creatine-phosphate donation system. Provides majority of power for the first 10-20 seconds of activity at high-maximal power output. Requires 3-5 min for recovery. *This reaction does not require oxygen.</p>
<p><em>Adaptaion mechanisms</em>: Increase in muscle cross-sectional area; shift of muscle fiber type towards faster-twitch glycolytic type (these fibers are actually whiter in color due to less blood demand)</p>
<p><em>Examples of activity with high phosphagen demand</em>: 40-100 yard dash, set of 5-15 reps of resistance training</p>
<p><strong>Glycolytic system</strong>: This system functions on the reaction of glycolysis within the cell cytoplasm. This chemical reaction replenishes ATP relatively quickly, but still more slowly than the phosphagen system. Glycolytic reactions create a byproduct of lactic acid (among other byproducts; citation needed), which can be cycled out and processed by the liver (if I recall correctly) or processed and used within the cell for aerobic respiration if the activity is at a low enough intensity. At high intensities, waste products from glycolysis accumulate and cause a burning sensation and eventual lack of muscular function until said waste products can be cycled out. *This reaction does not require oxygen.</p>
<p><em>Adaptation mechanisms</em>: Increased cytoplasmic glycolysis enzymes, shift of muscle fiber type towards faster-twitch glycolytic type (these fibers are actually whiter in color due to less blood demand)</p>
<p><em>Examples of activities primarily utilizing glycolysis</em>: 400 meter run; maximal set of pushups or other calisthenic exercise for trained individuals</p>
<p><strong>Aerobic respiration</strong>: Lastly, aerobic respiration. This is the process which is likely dominant right now as you're comfortably sitting at a computer screen operating at a low power output. If operating at a low enough power output, lactate from the aformentioned glycolysis reactions can be cycled to the mitochondria to be processed through the elector transport chain for ATP resynthesis. I'm not gonna get into the nitty gritty of all of these reactions, but aerobic respiration is more energy efficient than glycolysis, but a much slower process. Thus, aerobic respiration is the default mechanism used to supply energy at rest or at lower intensity/high duration activity (e.g. distance running)</p>
<p><em>Adaptaion protocol</em>: Increased capillary density, increased mitochondrial density, shift of muscle fiber proportion towards slower-twitch aerobic type (these fibers are more red in color due to increased capillary density.)</p>
<p><em>Examples of activity primarily utilizing aerobic respiration</em>: running &gt;1 mile, hiking, average pace over the course of a workout, resting state</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I work in the field; not academia.  As such I do not remember every single reaction, its components, and its products and byproducts.  This breakdown is intended for an audience of educated laymen outside the field of exercise physiology.  Experts on exercise physiology, please feel free to elaborate on any of my points!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body cheats its way out of uncomfortable situations when it can. Working a muscle so hard that it burns is one of those situations. </p>
<p>When you do a compound movements like chin ups (more than 1 muscle group involved, biceps, lats etc) your body can switch between how hard it taxes each of those. If it feels your biceps are getting too tired during chin ups it just won’t rely on them that much. Also compound movements use different muscles to a different extent during different parts of the lift. The bottom part of the chin up might be the easiest for the biceps but hardest for the upper back muscles. In the top in might be the opposite, but you won’t get to the top if your lats are too tired so you won’t train your biceps as much that’s why they don’t burn. </p>
<p>Crunches are ab isolation exercise. This means your body doesn’t have a choice but to use only your abs, and this makes it easier to overload it to a point when it burns. If you do a leg raise or something you probably won’t feel the same burn even though it’s also an ab exercise, but it is limited by hip flexor strength.
Alternatively if you do bicep curls you will feel the same burn in your biceps. If you do a lat isolation exercise you will feel the same burn in your lats etc. </p>
<p>Experiences lifters will be able to force these ‘burns’ even in compound movements but it takes more mind muscles control. Otherwise the body will just pick the path of least resistance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the chemical reactions your muscles use to activate and create motion. Chin ups are higher intensity than crunches. So you have to do a lot of crunches to fatigue. This causes a build of hydrogen ions (acid, I think lactic acid or lactase?) That burn. Strength training doesn't hurt as much which is why I prefer it. Body builders seek that pump, the burn, and the soreness in the days after they exercise. It's all about which chemical reaction the muscles use to use ATP to move.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While much of the physiology mentioned here is correct, any sensation is a neural function. Fatigue occurs when a lack of metabolic substrate or surplus of metabolic waste product affects the muscle cell(s); this affects tissue performance. A certain (im)balance of chemicals changes the internal environment of the cell. </p>
<p>The brain is alerted of the biochemical change of the tissue from its regular homeostatic value(s) through chemicals and electricity via receptors. This information is sent to the brain which perceives the incoming information as sensation. </p>
<p>Because everyone's neural circuitry is wired differently, we perceive stimulus differently for many reasons; think pain tolerance and how it varies from person to person or even body part to body part. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: You are &quot;feeling&quot; your brain's perception of the muscle tissue's state.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>from a Kinetics point of view; muscles work in tandem in synergy.  IT is rare for a single skeletal  muscle to fire off by itself:  for example; to bring your hand to your face your bicep on your upper arm has to initiate, and at the same time  the triceps on the back of the upper arm has to also kick in, the actions of two of the three muscles of the triceps helps to direct the forearm up to your face, by alternative pulling or relaxing to direct the desired motion.  This is called synergistic action.  (Yet, if only the biceps, brachialis and brachioradialis muscles contracted, the force of their contraction would be so great that it could pull the elbow joint apart. But when the triceps contracts to hold the forearm in the elbow so that no damage to the joint occurs. )   You body works as a single unit, our trunks need to be strong so that individual limbs can move flexing and extending, or abducting and adducting, rotating or being held in a stationary position against gravity.  Every time you move a limb, your core body has to stabilize the body  so that other effective motion can take place..... and may lead to fatigue, , etc, etc, etc.        Yet, from a chemical point of view, others have already correctly identified how chemical reactions kick in (lactic acid, phosphate, etc......)  explaining fatigue and over work at the micro level.    Some muscles carry double duty depending on what exercises you are doing and may end up being overworked thru manual effort until fatigued (so they feel the burn from lactic acid!)  As a therapist I'd deliberately {at times} worked patient bodies up to the point of fatigue under different circumstances depending on whatever we needed to achieve... (usually hoping to improve fine motor motion requiring more subtle movement in the presence of various medical problems or conditions.)   Creating fatigue is  just one way to teach efficient bodily motion (esp. when the person has spasticity.) My point of view comes from 40 years working as a PT.</p>
<p>[Spasticity is a condition in which certain muscles are continuously contracted. This contraction causes stiffness or tightness of the muscles and can interfere with normal movement. Spasticity is usually caused by damage to the portion of the brain or spinal cord that controls voluntary movement and damage causes a change in the balance of signals between the nervous system and the muscles. This imbalance leads to increased activity in the muscles...so we treat spasticity based on an individual needs with exercise or fatigue - which is only one small part of a exercise program to inhibit spasticity.  40 years ago the only way to treat spasticity was to leave it alone, or serial cast the body part or simply medicate the entire body..... damn! )     </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
