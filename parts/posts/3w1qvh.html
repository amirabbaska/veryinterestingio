		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a bit of a buzzword, and sounds more mysterious than it really is. The deep web is essentially anywhere you can access with an Internet connection but is not publicly visible without an account or some form of access control. </p>
<p>Forum that requires registration, even free, to see content? Deep web. Passworded Minecraft server? Deep web. Your online banking solution? Deep web. Your Google drive, Onedrive minus what you set to publicly visible? Deep web.</p>
<p>If you cannot see it with a Google search, then it's essentially part of the deep web. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Search engines work by using bots called &quot;crawlers&quot;. They go through every web page they can access, reading the content on the page and following every link on it to find more pages. They keep a list of the sites they find and some basic information, and every so often all the crawlers combine those lists into one big one, called an index. When you do a google search, you aren't actually searching the web itself, but instead google's index of what it crawled.</p>
<p>The deep web is basically just anything that can not be added to the index, or is not added because the owners of that page chose to opt-out. There are several reasons why this happens. Pages that need a password or other authentication to access can't be indexed since the crawlers don't know the login info. Pages that can only be accessed using something like flash or javascript can sometimes be unaccessible to crawlers. And pages that do not have a single link to them anywhere at all on the indexable web will never be found by crawlers, since they just follow links.</p>
<p>One example of a situation where a webmaster might choose to block part of their site from crawlers is online shopping. Of course you want the front page, products, etc to show up on a search, but what about the administrative login for employees? Finding that login page can tell a potential attacker a lot about what system you are using and its weaknesses, so this page is usually kept secret. Fortunately, there is a way to tell the crawlers <em>not</em> to index a particular page. There's a few variations, but typically it's a single line of code that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;meta name="robots" content="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>If a crawler loads a page and sees that code, it will not add the page to the index or follow any links on it. There's also a way to use a file called robots.txt to instruct crawlers to ignore whole sections of your site.</p>
<p>So any time you check your private messages on reddit, or use any other forum or service that cannot be accessed without a password, you're using the deep web. If you buy something online, the cart and/or checkout may be on the deep web - and your order history almost certainly is. Any company that has a website for employee use that requires a login but can be accessed from anywhere - deep web. Many people use the deep web daily and may not realize it!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surface web - anything that has been cataloged by a search engines. If you can find it via search engine then it's surface web.</p>
<p>Deep web - Anything that is not cataloged via a search engine. You can access the deep web from any browser if you know what you are looking for. You do not need to use TOR to access deep web content.</p>
<p>Dark web -  Part of the deep web that has been blocked off and/or hidden from normal access via standard web browsers. This is where you would need TOR or something to that affect to access. </p>
<p>Some of the information that people are providing here is misleading or flat out wrong.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way I've heard it explained is that the &quot;deep web&quot; is everything on the web that doesn't show up on a Google search (insert your own search engine). That includes the vast majority of internet traffic - emails, search engine searches (not the results, but the actual page of results), and gobs and gobs of other things.</p>
<p>The confusion comes when people mix up &quot;dark web&quot; - a corner of the internet accessed through a special client (I think it's called &quot;tor&quot; and the pages are .onion) where shady stuff like drug dealing, murder for hire, snuff films, and child pornography apparently goes down - with &quot;deep web&quot;, of which dark web content is only a tiny, tiny fraction of an iota.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The deep web just means that it does not get indexed by search engines.  This means a lot of companies websites that they dont want outside people to have access to is considered the deep web.  If you have worked for a company that has an intranet site for its employees then you have accessed the deep web.  It is not just all illegal sites for hiring hitmen and selling drugs.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
