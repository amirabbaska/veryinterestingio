		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once a banana starts to over ripen - be it from time or from some sort of damage to the peel - the starches start to break down into sugars. That's what makes brown, or bruised, bananas taste sweeter. You can eat a brown or bruised banana so long as you enjoy a sweet banana, but when they start to get darkened or blackened then they usually reserved for baking pies or something like that. </p>
<p>Does the nutritional content change? Yes, starches break down into sugars as the fruit gets bruised or ripens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, likely. The enzymes in the banana that were compartimalised before can come into contact with the vitamine C and break it down. Its a highschool biology experiment where you measure mashed bananas vitamine c concentration over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, we calls &quot;brown spots&quot; on bananas &quot;sugar spots&quot; as the startch has converted into sugars.</p>
<p>Also, plantains are a lot starchier, which is why they are typically &quot;brown&quot; at the market when they are ready, and also why its common to cook them instead of regular bananas, the heat converts the startches into sugars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slightly off topic, can anyone explain a red coloring on a banana? My bananas and his past week had red coloring on them. They weren't quite like bruises either. Not knowing what it was, I assumed it was some type of fungus and did not eat them. Anyone seen anything like that?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't lose like potassium and other important nutrients. It most likely becomes oxidized by the air which causes a breakdown in the molecular structures. Oxidizations of molecules can cause molecular structural damage. Depending on how damaged it is, it might affect the total caloric consumption (bc it damages the glucose/fructose monosaccharide structures) but it shouldn't affect the total available nutrients. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
