		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is zero security in a signature. No one checks them, and only a very few are able to detect what is a genuine signature and what isn't.</p>
<p>The best they can do is provide evidence if the holder of a card who did a transaction tries to charge it back. Then the recording of the signature can be verified by real experts, or, more importantly, video of them signing for the transaction produced in court to support a fraud charge. Similarly, the record of a fraudulent signature will be an extra fraud charge if they catch someone who uses someone else's card.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the main reason is fraud purposes. Someone used my moms credit card info, and while she never really signed her name at all the thief did. The fraud people pulled her record and saw a bunch of houses and suns and stuff instead of a signature and gave her money back. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For card transactions, the signature was intended to play 3 roles: So the clerk could compare the sig on the receipt to the sig on the back of card, to hold the consumer responsible as in a contract sig, and so the card issuer could hold the seller responsible for misuse.</p>
<p>The first 2 purposes long ago lost their utility as sellers overwhelmingly elected to ignore the fraud prevention purpose in favor of speed at checkout. They still collected sigs as protection from mass disputes of their transactions, but they basically chose to eat the occasional fraud that maaayyybeee could have been avoided by comparing sigs on card and receipt. (In the US, Ace Hardware is one place that, in my experience, has continued to train clerks to verify sigs. They ask to see the card and compare sigs. They make me sign the back of the card and show ID if it is not signed. This slows down the checkout process, but tells you Ace is a stickler for rules.)</p>
<p>Over the past 10-20 years, most card networks removed sig requirements for low-end sales, such as under $25 or under $50, for certain industries at least. Issuers kept sig rules around longer than practical because they pushed a small amount of the fraud expenses on to sellers. Sellers don't have enough incentives to prevent fraud as it is; they are just eager to make a sale. And clerks just want to move the line and make it to their next break with their sanity in place. :-)</p>
<p>Recently, however, Mastercard announced in Oct 2017 that it is eliminating sig at checkout rules as of April 2018 in the US. Discover and Amex followed suit, and Visa more cautiously announced no sig only for chip-based transactions.</p>
<p>So in the US, consumers may soon see far fewer sig requirements, although some sellers may keep them as the receipt may be considered an agreement between the consumer and seller.</p>
<p>In Europe and some other regions, Chip and PIN is prevalent and provides better security.</p>

<p>Tldr: Sig at checkout is going the way of copy paper and &quot;knucklebusters;&quot; into granpa's tales of how hard life was when he was a kid.</p>
<p>Edits: wording and spelling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
