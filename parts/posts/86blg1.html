<p>Factory line machines seem capable of insanely accurate and exact movements - surely achieving believable and organic looking walking in a robot would simply require the correct combination of well timed movements.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difficult part of walking isn't the precision of the movements, it's knowing what movements to make.</p>
<p>Assembly line robots have the advantage of knowing exactly where the thing they are supposed to cut/bend/move/rivet is going to be, exactly where the screw holes are, and so on.  Most of them don't even have any sensors, they just know that the work piece is going to be in position X, because the system holds it there.  And the ones that DO have sensors (for example, a robot that picks up objects from a moving conveyor belt and puts them in a box) still have it easy because the things they are picking up all look alike, and they are on a background that makes them stand out.</p>
<p>In other words, assembly line robots can do what they do with great precision because every part of the process has been designed around them, to make it easy for them.</p>
<p>For a robot, walking around in an un-controlled environment is much more difficult.  There are a million different floor patterns, and some of them might confuse the robot into thinking that there's an obstacle there.  Balancing is hard, because the robot has to figure out exactly how to balance right <em>in that moment</em>.  An assembly line robot has had its movements planned out for it ahead of time, because those are the only movements it will ever need to make.  A walking robot needs to be able to balance itself correctly under a huge variety of different circumstances.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that assembly line robots are barely even really robots.  Everything they do is planned out carefully by engineers.  If you had a team of engineers to plan out a robot's every single step, then sure, it could probably walk great.  But figuring out how to do those motions on the fly is WAY harder.  Walking may not seem like a challenging task, because you do it without thinking about it, but actually, that's just an indication of how fucking amazing your brain is.  Your brain does a lot of work behind the scenes to let you walk without thinking about it.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Factory line machines generally deal with precise, unchanging patterns of movement. The devices come in in the same way. They're moved in the same way. They leave in the same way.</p>
<p>Walking has to deal with terrain, which can vary in elevation, height, traction, slope, all sorts of things. You could undoubtedly make a robot that walks beautifully across a precise, featureless, flat terrain. Making one that can handle any old stretch of ground is much harder. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do not walk in a stable manner, we're constantly falling and catching ourselves.</p>
<p>Between muscles, bones, nerves, clothing, and the environment, there's a massive amount of variables in play. Every millisecond matters, as your center of gravity and inertia is constantly changing, requiring different corrections (and those corrections, in turn, change your center of gravity and inertia as well!) Any slight change in speed, angle, ground cover, wind, or loading, requires a compensating change.</p>
<p>If a compensating change doesn't occur, something known as a &quot;compounding error&quot; occurs. EX: Lean too far forward, but didn't step far enough to compensate, which means you're tipping even further forward the next step and eventually falling. If you watch videos of walking robots, I'm sure you've seen this happen.</p>
<p>Point is, you're not repeating a correct and well timed movement, you're creating a unique movement each and every step you take. The hardware to measure it accurately and instantly, the mechanical parts to actually perform the movement, and the software that brings it all together is something that has proven very difficult to bring together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, let me pose you a question: how do you think humans walk? </p>
<p>Perhaps you could say that the brain tells a bunch muscles to flex or relax at certain points so you can walk. But it’s not that simple. If that was all your brain was doing, no human would ever be able to walk. </p>
<p>A good way to look at it is from the perspective of a baby: they are extremely wobbly initially. Their brain is learning what muscles allow the baby to stand and learns how to voluntarily flex/relax them. But this isn’t enough to be able to walk realistically.</p>
<p>Then it must learn how much of each muscle they need to flex/relax. When you flex your bicep, you can decide to flex only parts of it or all of it. For every single movement and position in space, your brain must learn how much of each specific muscle to flex/relax. But this is still not enough to be able to walk realistically. </p>
<p>Calculating all that is nearly impossible for your brain because of how precise it needs to be. In fact, it doesn’t exactly precisely command all this to happen from the outgo. Your brain tell your body the general layout of the movement. Your body does the planned movement, and then your body sends feedback about its position, its balance, etc back to the brain. Your brain needs this to fine tune the movement. Your brain is getting a continuous stream of feedback from the body during any movement, and it will correct any inaccuracies. Of course, this is again all trial and error by the brain. But.... this is still not enough to be able to walk realistically. </p>
<p>Your brain must get information of it’s surroundings and the situation you are in and plan your movements accordingly. You ever wonder why we don’t trip whenever we go uphill? It’s because the brain noticed there was a slight incline, processed the information, and estimated how our body should move to respond appropriately. And your brain does this for everything. </p>
<p>Perhaps if you do all this you can walk like a normal person, but I’m sure I am missing something the brain is doing behind the scenes. </p>
<p>Now, imagine getting a robot to do all this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
