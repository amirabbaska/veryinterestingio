		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple experience. First, humans have long known that, at very high altitudes, we have a harder time breathing; therefore, oxygen equipment would be needed. We also know that extremely low pressure can be damaging to unprotected flesh, as a result of experiments, especially during the World War II era. Again, it was obvious that suits would be needed. Therefore, when planning for Space, which would see people exposed to extreme conditions, it was obvious that special equipment, such as suits, would be needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aviation scientists and engineers knew decades prior to Yuri Gagarin that specially designed and made suits were required for high-altitude flights.  And by high altitude that means heights well below what is thought of as &quot;space&quot;.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The experiments of Lavoisier in the 1700s showed that oxygen was necessary for life and human physiology studies established the lowest partial pressure animals can survive. Atmospheric science had long known that atmospheric pressure drops with ascent and at what rate. So the need for an oxygen support was recognized long before high-altitude flight was undertaken.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
