		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I found this question so interesting, and the answers so inadequate (Come on guys! Explaining the neurobiology is like saying men get erections because their penis fills with blood. True: but not illuminating) that I did a little digging myself. After finding nothing very helpful in my old neuro books, I found <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-are-cold-chills" target="_blank">this</a> answer on Quora, which was written so well I'll just quote </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thrill-induced chills are a physiological response to a number of seemingly unrelated types of emotional stimuli. The exact mechanism is still the subject of scientific investigation.</p>
<p>Thrill-induced &quot;chills&quot; are a physiological response that is called &quot;frisson&quot; by researchers. The main effect is &quot;goose bumps&quot; or &quot;hair standing up&quot; (piloerecetion), which is caused by contraction of tiny muscles around the hair folicles. There is also the full-body shudder, which is related to shivering and is caused by rhythmic oscillating contractions of the major skeletal muscle groups, most likely controlled at the level of the brain stem and spinal cord. Shivers are normally intended to generate warmth through physical exertion of the muscles.</p>
<p>The interesting questions are: 1) why is the sensation pleasurable? and 2) why can this response be induced by stimuli unrelated to cold (music, aesthetic awe, primal scream, threat of loss, certain physical and tactile sensations)?</p>
<p>On the first question, a PET scan study at McGill university looked at the effect of frisson in response to peak experience while listening to music (&quot;musical frisson&quot;). (<a href="http://www.mni.mcgill.ca/media/n" target="_blank">http://www.mni.mcgill.ca/media/n</a>...). They found that dopamine was released during this peak experience. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter associated with &quot;reward&quot; which are positive experiences that the brain attempts to repeat in the future. [1]</p>
<p>On the evolutionary origin or purpose of chills, David Huron argues that they come from our instinctual reaction to human screams, which is an alert and orienting reaction. Human screams are audible at a longer distance than any other sound, and are critical for avoiding danger (warnings) and protecting infants (distress calls). So a scream is an important sound that completely consumes attention.</p>
<p>Huron argues that in music, certain sound elements may trigger the alert reaction (causing the chills effect), but then are realized to be harmless, inducing the pleasurable response. The musical features invoking the sensation often involve a sudden increase in loudness which might normally be a signal of surprise and danger. (<a href="http://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/20" target="_blank">http://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/20</a>...)</p>
<p>Grewe et al (2010) argue that chills have many unrelated causes including &quot;fight and flight reactions, aesthetic awe or social loss&quot; and so may not have a single explanation or evolutionary origin. [2]</p>
<p>Overall, chills may be an ancient physiological response that has been (accidentally?) co-opted by evolution for new purposes, such as social danger alert. Art forms such as music and painting have found clever ways of activating this response.</p>

<p>I don't get them very often at random (maybe 1 every couple months) but if I want I can get the same 'random' shiver  just by focusing, though after a few waves of shivering they lose their intensity/warmth.
made an account to comment, I really want to know if anyone else can do this or perhaps try to :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an odd thing but possibly related. I get shivers when I cuddle with my boyfriend. It feels a lot like pee shivers in that it causes my body to spasm. Sometimes they're small spasms, and other times I violently jerk. They can happen 5-10 times in a row. It's usually a nice sensation. Once in a while it happens unexpectedly when he touches me in public, and I become alarmed. Never happened with anyone else before though. </p>
<p>Would love to have a better understanding of this if anyone has some insight or know if this happens to anyone else!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
