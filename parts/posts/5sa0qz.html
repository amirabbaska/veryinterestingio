		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many different policies for the usage of nuclear weapons, and most countries have numerous different attack plans within those policies, so there's a lot of possible variation. It's very difficult to say how any war would go without actually having it happen.</p>
<p>The best way a nuclear war could go, and arguably the only way one could possibly be won, would be if somehow you could use your bombs but the enemies couldn't use their bombs. </p>
<p>There's a lot of ways to go about this, but the simplest is to just blow up your enemy's missiles and bombers while they are still on the ground. Once they get in the air they're a lot more difficult to destroy. Because of this, in a nuclear war, the side that shoots first has a big advantage- they start with all their bombs in the air, while the enemy's would all be on the ground scrambling to launch before they're destroyed. This was a big headache during the cold war- there was a lot of speculation that whoever shot first would 'win', insomuch as the war could be won, but nobody wanted to be the one to start it.</p>
<p>That's also the major reason why the US has been hesitant to go to a no first use policy. Think of nukes like guns- you have a big advantage if you can shoot the other guy first.</p>
<p>Another type of Preemptive Strike is a Decapitation strike- basically trying to kill everybody who has the authorization to launch a nuke before they get a chance to launch said nukes. </p>
<p>The counterpoint to this is Launch On Warning. Basically, when you see a bunch of nukes in the air coming towards you, you go ahead and launch everything you have before it gets destroyed on the ground. This has a lot of safety issues- there have been tons of false alarms where we thought attacks were incoming when they weren't. </p>
<p>The backup is a second strike, using hardened assets to retaliate against the enemy. While a lot of missiles and bombs are not able to withstand a nuclear strike, some silos are hardened enough, and there's still the third arm of the nuclear triad- submarines. Even with our technology today, nuclear submarines are very difficult to track and destroy. Even if a nation is turned to ash, their submarines can emerge days or weeks later to retaliate.</p>
<p>Today, if two nuclear powers went to war, there are many ways it could go. It could have a bit of a leadup with conventional warfare followed by the usage of a tactical nuke or two on the battlefield. But eventually one side would launch the first strike.</p>
<p>The first strike would probably be a wave of ground-launched missiles, aimed at enemy missile silos, airbases, centers of government and military control, and anti-aircraft installations, with the principal aim of blunting the enemy's ability to retaliate and block the second wave, made of bombers.</p>
<p>From that point on the targets depend on what the aggressor nation is targeting. Many plans only list military installations, but if a longer conflict is presumed other targets would also be included. First Industrial targets, then population centers.</p>
<p>Important targets would be struck multiple times. I believe Moscow in the cold war was the target of as many as 60 bombs.</p>
<p>If the enemy possesses nuclear submarines, what would follow would be a period of high alert as they are hunted down. It's not impossible that a small number of sub-based missiles could be dealt with through missile defense systems, assuming that the enemy didn't get their ground based missiles into the air to destroy those defense systems.</p>
<p>The initial exchange would take less than an hour. The whole thing would be over in a day or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At first by proxy, this is what syria basically is, sides are involved but mostly with funding and not outright their armies.  It can escalate to minor skirmishes that do not threaten much.  </p>
<p>But the common theory is they really couldn't go to war.  Not conflict,  trade wars and proxxy wars would go up, international sanctions or resolutions to apply pressure and public image.  But as far as rallying the troops. This is why the bigger nations have avoided major conflict with each other since ww2, the nuclear endgame is basically garenteed, especially since most of them are allied in such a fashion that the majority of the world's troops will be involved anyway. </p>
<p>Now a smaller country like north Korea launching a nuke will not likely end the same way. A large country like usa or Russia could respond with enough conventional power to end it just as quickly with less danger. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most countries have a No First Use policy. </p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No first use (NFU) refers to a pledge or a policy by a nuclear power not to use nuclear weapons as a means of warfare unless first attacked by an adversary using nuclear weapons. Earlier, the concept had also been applied to chemical and biological warfare.</p>
<p>China declared its NFU policy in 1964, and has since maintained this policy. India articulated its policy of no first use of nuclear weapons in 2003.</p>
<p>NATO has repeatedly rejected calls for adopting NFU policy, arguing that pre-emptive nuclear strike is a key option, in order to have a credible deterrent that could compensate for the overwhelming conventional weapon superiority enjoyed by the Soviet Army in the Eurasian land mass. In 1993, Russia dropped a pledge against first use of nuclear weapons made in 1982 by Leonid Brezhnev. In 2000, a Russian military doctrine stated that Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons &quot;in response to a large-scale conventional aggression&quot;.This is because the balance of forces was reversed â€” NATO is now enjoying a clear superiority in conventional weapons.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an oversimplification, and yet I'm surprised not to see it here already.</p>
<p>That is exactly the point of having what is known as a nuclear deterrent - that is to say the fact that you have a nuclear arsenal basically means that another side who also has a nuclear arsenal will not use them on you because if they do, they will also be annihilated by yous in exchange. This is a doctrine called mutually assured destruction or mad for short. </p>
<p>Yes, it is literally called The Mad Doctrine on purpose.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a simple answer to this that everyone seems to ignore.</p>
<p>One side wants to win the war.  </p>
<p>Nukes assure that doesnt happen, so nukes wont be used the way everyone imagines.  </p>
<p>Nukes would be used when one side is so desperate that they dont care if they die too.  By that point there is a huge chance that most of the nuclear capability of a country would already be removed.  </p>
<p>Also, it may not seem like it, but for places like the USA most nukes shot at it wouldnt make it to their target (Which is one of the reasons why countries like the USA and Russia have so many nukes).</p>
<p>It wouldnt be like boom everyone dead.  It would take hundreds of nukes to hit their target to bring something like the US military to its knees.  </p>
<p>Now the aftermath, that is a different story all together.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
