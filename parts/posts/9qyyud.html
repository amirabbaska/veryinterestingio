<p>Foods biodegrade because yeast and fungus and other little beasts find it and eat it.  they break it down and poop it out and if everything goes right give you really nice dirt with which to grow new foods that will also biodegrade.  This is what a compost pile hopes to achieve.</p>
<p>If we make a something out of a material that little creatures don't eat... it'll just stay in it's current form for a long long time.  A lot of plastics aren't biodegradable because no little yeast-bros ever evolved to eat it (you know, because it wasn't around to eat until recently)</p>
<p>it's really as simple as that.  if the material is able to be eaten by something it can return to the earth.  If the material can't be eaten by something it's stuck the way it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, here's a cool thought; at one point in our earth's history, the land was entirely covered in plants and NONE of it was biodegradable! </p>
<p>Plants would grow, die, fall over and just... lie there. Nothing would break down, and new plants would grow atop the old plants. The old plants eventually got buried deep, compressed and heated. Eventually they turned into oil, some of it got dug up, processed and turned into parts of the device you're using to read this!</p>
<p>Then fungi and bacteria developed the ability to break down dead plants, and now there's no new oil being produced. Instead it's broken down, released into the air, turned into soil, or used to make some delicious mushrooms!</p>
<p>As other people have said, that's what makes something biodegradable; the ability for tiny creatures to eat it and break it down. </p>
<p>That's why there's an effort to find bacteria which can eat plastic; if plastic becomes biodegradeable, hopefully we can avoid or mitigate the terrible impact stray plastic has on the environment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two factors that come into play with microbial degradation, &quot;recalcitrance&quot; and &quot;bioavailability&quot;. Recalcitrance describes the difficulty of breaking down the materials while bioavailability is how easy it is for the microbes to access it. An example of a highly recalcitrant class of pollutants is PCBs. They aren't very hard to get into the cells but once inside, the bacteria can't do much and so they die. Evolution is a pretty powerful tool to improve this because we've seen new strains arise that are able to degrade PCBs, albeit very slowly. Oil is a good example of a pollutant that isn't very recalcitrant but with low bioavailability. Cells cannot access most of the pollutant because it exists in droplets and so it persists in the environment. That is why spraying surfactants on oil spills works really well to clean them up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything is made up of different atoms, which are very very small pieces of things. And these group together to form different chemicals. They're held together by special bonds between the different atoms and groups of atoms. The type of bond depends on the type of atoms. Some of these bonds are easy to break, and some are hard. Some can be broken down by the chemistry that's available in a worm's belly, at room temperature and some cannot. If a substance has a lot of difficult-to-break-down chemical bonds, then it will be more durable over time, resisting the digestive processes of bacteria, fungi, insects, and other natural creepy-crawlies that typically rot things left on the ground. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
