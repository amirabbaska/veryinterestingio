		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Industrial engineer here:  in general, it's not.  For the most part, having something &quot;handmade&quot; is a weakness marketed as a status symbol.  </p>
<p>The cheapest Toyota is going to be &quot;better&quot; than any bespoke car in terms of overall quality, assuming we define quality to be &quot;leaves the factory as the engineers intended it to leave the factory.&quot;  Robots and scaled production let you achieve error rates on the order of one-in-a-million in a best case. </p>
<p>Humans will never get there.  If something is hand made, a HUGE amount of extremely expensive post-production quality assurance is necessary to make sure the product is good to go.  For low production volume/high profit products, that's a fair tradeoff.  It's cheaper to do that expensive quality assurance at the end of manufacturing than it is to spend hundreds of millions &quot;front loading&quot; quality by creating a really great production system.  </p>
<p>And because the per-unit profit is so high, you can make a &quot;really good&quot; cars by over-engineering them to account for variation in the production process and such.  Toyota doesn't over-engineer things.   There isn't a lot of extra material in a Camry.  Instead, they figure out exactly how much material is necessary to make that car last 10-20 years with x number of failures, and that's how much material they put in.</p>
<p>And, as /u/cantab314 suggests, there are materials that resist automation because they aren't uniform or predictable.  </p>
<p>Edit: geez, if I'd known this comment was going to be seen I'd have taken the time to have been a little more specific...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the answers in this thread cover different yet equally valid points, and certainly for the automotive industry they hold a lot of water. </p>
<p>One thing I would like to point out is that &quot;handmade&quot; may not mean what you would assume.  These days most of the time it's means that most of the assembly work is done by hand rather than robots.  In modern luxury niche handed vehicles, the majority of what you see is production scale parts covered by hand with leather.  Everything behind it will be made on a large injection moulding, milling, or casting scale. </p>
<p>These days, &quot;handmade&quot; refers largely to the assembly method as opposed to the production method.  It's there because as someone else mentioned, if you're making low volume high profit products it's hard to front the cash for big production systems, especially when you can use it as a selling point.  If you can pay someone a low-medium hourly rate to assemble a car you can then sell for a higher price, why wouldn't you?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can give my 2 cents here. I'm a robotics engineer for automotive companies. Also, I've been to where some Rolls are built. Very skilled workers are much better than robots in certain areas. I'm saying better in the sense of quality.  I'll use an example I'm familiar with. It's applying sealer to various seams of the car where metal comes together. If you open your hood or trunk you can probably see some a bead of sealer around the edges. They're applied everywhere almost and on a Rolls they have to be absolutely perfect. Robots can do this but they are used for speed and quantity. Compared to a skilled human the seams a robot applies are just ok. Humans have an instant feedback loop that robots do not. Many variables like humidity, changing viscosity of material, metal fit tolerances affect the quality of the seam. Humans can feel it, see it as it's happening and adjust their application on the fly. A robot is just going to lay it down the same no matter what. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would say in short, rarity. These cars have low production numbers and variations can be made more frequently or tailored to each buyer. And at least based on their marketing, each car is unique, like a work of art. Factory cars by contrast offset the cost of the machinery and design through economy of scale. Everyone has the same thing. As with luxury cars in general, noone buys them for reliability, it only makes sense to own as long it's under warranty. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are not robots
Humans are social beings</p>
<p>Before automation buyers wanted absolute perfection. Not because perfection was better but because it was rare. </p>
<p>After automation buyers want hand craftsmanship. Not because hand craftsmanship is better but because it is rare. </p>
<p>Rare things are better because they are more desirable (just from being rare/exclusive). Desire creates status, status is important to social beings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
