		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very good question. It depends. If you put your transmitter above ground, it is almost impossible to get the signals deep underground and it would be a waste of energy to try to. If you put transmitters inside a tunnel you can actually reach quite far with them because the signals would reflect a lot. So we could do it. We probably don't because it takes a lot of money and it isn't really worth anyone's time since you will be above ground soon anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typical wavelengths used for cellular connections does not penetrate earth very well. They can manage a few walls in the house, but put a bit of solid of stone in between, and the signal will be soo weak that you don't get any connection. So we can't use normal antennas to radiate underground. </p>
<p>Instead, we can use what we call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_feeder" target="_blank">radiating cable</a> (AKA Leaky feeder). It is basically a very long antenna which you put in the tunnel, and connect a cellular basestation at the end. The antenna distributes the signal along the tunnel. This is used in many underground systems around the world, as well as in airplanes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Largely it is not difficult, however it is expensive. </p>
<p>Specifically you use what is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_feeder#Underground_railways" target="_blank">&quot;Leaky Feeder&quot;</a> which extends the antenna along the length of the tunnel. The user is in the same cell site/sector along the entire length of the tunnel so no rapid hand-offs are needed. Other than the leaky feeder antenna (with it's boosters), the radio equipment is the same as a normal cell site. The cell site needs power, cooling and connectivity of course.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>They have been rolling out 4G wireless at most stations in NYC, the only problem is your connection drops when you get a decent distance from the station.</p>
<p>For full coverage they would need to install quite a few access points (AP's) along all the tunnels so you can jump from one AP to another.</p>
<p>On a side note they offer free wifi but I abstain from using it since I'm not sure who has access to the logs.  I certainly wouldn't order anything or provide personal information while using it.</p>
<p>Long story short, it can and is being done but it's costing a lot of money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
