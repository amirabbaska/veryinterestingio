		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I pre-heat my oven to 400 degrees, then I open it and leave it open for 10-20 seconds or so to carefully put the food in the middle of the center rack without burning myself, I can feel a mass of hot air venting out of the oven, but the electronic thermometer doesn't change. Am I actually losing a meaningful amount of heat?</p>
<p>If so, do the recipes that call for a very precise bake time (&quot;32 to 34 minutes&quot;) compensate for this reality that for the first few minutes of the bake time, the oven is not at the optimal temperature?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One factor not mentioned is that the sides, top, &amp; bottom of the oven chamber, along with the rack or baking sheet you place the food atop, being solid metal will hardly give up much heat the time the door is opened to place something inside the oven.</p>
<p>This is the purpose of preheating, for it takes longer to heat up the metal than the small mass of air inside the oven chamber.</p>
<p>Which after the food is placed inside &amp; the door is again closed, it will take little time to heat the air up again to proper temp.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

However, don't rush, and as long as you're not leaving it open for an extended time or opening every 5-10 minutes to check on it, you should be fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, air holds barely any energy.</p>
<p>Air is heated really easily, and it doesn't hold much energy - that's why a blast of 200 degree hot air to the face doesn't do anything, apart from making you blink.</p>
<p>In technical terms, air has a heat capacity of 1.02/.77m^3</p>
<p>In comparison, steel has a heat capacity of 0.5/0.000127m^3</p>
<p>That means that the energi in the air that escaped is <em>nothing</em> compared to the energy that's already made the metal of the oven hot. It's really nothing to worry about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a scientist but I cook a lot and I recently got an ambient air probe because my oven is crap and I really need to keep an eye on it.  I lose about 10 degrees but how your oven works is it cycles on and off about 10 degrees in any direction anyway.  It's not steady at what you set it and it's probably wrong by an important number of degrees anyway.  That should be your biggest worry.  10-20 seconds isn't going to make much difference if you don't do it too often.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
