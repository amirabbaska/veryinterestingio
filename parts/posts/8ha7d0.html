		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know I'm late, but I'm in the unique position where I actually study corneas for a living and I've been consulted before regarding dolphin eyes. The real answer to this question is that dolphins rely on their echolocation almost exclusively. They have eyes, and they can see, but they are practically vestigial at this point. Many dolphins actually lose their eyes due to infection and trauma and it really doesn't affect their behavior much. So whether their vision is slightly blurry through air is kinda a moot point. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The refractive index of the lens in your eye as well as the fluid inside and on the surface of your eye all interact to give you a focused image. Air has a refractive index of 1, and water is higher at 1.333. This means that light passes through air differently than water. Human eyes are best adapted to see in air, while fish eyes (and dolphins etc.) are adapted to water, so while we can’t say for sure what that looks like to them since we don’t know what their normal vision looks like, it’s possible that they have some accommodation in their neural processing or eye anatomy that helps with the difference but most likely yes, it would be blurrier, or at least look differently, than underwater. </p>
<p>Edit: turns out dolphins can’t see that well underwater or in air as they primarily use echolocation. So most likely it’s blurry everywhere. Thanks /u/MyDogHatesYou !</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dolphins have good vision above AND below the water.  Stop thinking that basic optics and refraction is going to answer it for you, let's turn to some dolphin science, instead.</p>
<p>There is a LOT of misinformation floating around in these answers, here are some corrections and things to keep in mind about dolphin vision and sonar.  (background: I lived with several research dolphins, grad school with the scientists who published this research, but I'm in a rush at work so message back if y'all can't find the papers or want more info?)</p>
<p>As discovered at the Kewalo Basin Marine Mammal Laboratory, back in the 80's, dolphin eyes can physically change the shape of the pupil.  It goes from a circle, like we have, to two slits, formed by the center portion squeezing together, so you end up with a sort of horseshoe or U shape, where the two ends of the U are now the only slits where light enter above water.  So, below water, circle shape and everything is in focus.  Above water, pinhole camera from the sides of the U, and so the light is bent and is now IN FOCUS again. Almost all eye doctors prior to the work in the 80's had done corneal examinations, looking at eyes from dead dolphins, and never had seen that horseshoe happen because they didn't know to look for it.  </p>
<p>Sonar- it IS amazing, but unless you're talking about river dolphins, calling the eyes vestigial is a stretch.  Some folks mentioned that in theory, it should work above and below water because blah, blah blah.  Don't listen to that, it doesn't work above water.  Have you ever had someone shout at you while you were underwater in a pool?  Just barely hear it, yeah?  Something like 90% plus of the sound is bouncing right off the surface, because there's such a density difference between air and water it reflects, bounces right off.  Now, it's important to know that dolphin echolocation is sound, produced via air sacs and vibrations, that are designed to propagate in water.  The melon of cetaceans is amazing, consisting of dense bands of lipids and connective tissue, allowing them to squeeze it, focus sound, and more.  But that banding of lipids actually goes from density closer to air to density closer to water, so that the sounds is funneled forward in a cone and is able to flow into the water with a great amount of efficiency compared to if we were to just yell under water.  SO, reverse that, put the dolphin above water.  WHOOPS, now all the melon magic is working against you, that sound that has density shifted to flow into water just hit air.  Any reflections coming back, same thing, it's all backwards with the wrong density/air interface touching the melon instead of water.  At every mismatch between water/air, take another 90% or more of the sound away.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer: I've worked with a neurobiologist that studies teleost vision, not cetaceans.</p>
<p>So, the diffraction of light is very different in water than in air, hence the infamous broken straw illusion.  That contributes to the blurriness you notice underwater.  The structure of eyes is therefore variable due to these different constraints.  Our cornea does most of the work of diffraction, with the lens making adjustments to assist.  In humans, the cornea is rounder and the lens is flatter and farther from the retina than you would typically see in fish.  While I've never had the chance to examine any cetacean specimen, the cursory online search I did for their eye structure suggests a reversion to similar aquatic adaptations.</p>
<p>However, there's more to consider than the gross structure.  Photoreceptor density changes how clear an image will appear (think low-res v. HD).  Crosstalk and integration of these cells can also affect image clarity.  There is also a concept called &quot;circles of confusion&quot; that examines the smallest region that can effectively be resolved.  In effect, a wider field of view has to fit more into smaller areas, so the points of reflected and diffracted light get smaller as well, removing some of the fuzziness, but consequently making long-distance vision basically meaningless.  (This is not to say that real fish eyes cannot see distance, the term &quot;fish eye lens&quot; arose because of the shape of the lens compared to a fish eye, and not so much how we presumed fish actually see.)</p>
<p>What all of this means is that dolphins can absolutely see above water, and with what is likely an acceptable amount of clarity.  However, the resolution is likely hampered compared to in their natural environment, but clearly not enough to stop them performing tricks or spying on people swimming in the ocean.  I'd assume the difference in their vision in air is comparable to our vision in water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
