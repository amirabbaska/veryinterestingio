		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood in a great percentage is actually just water, what makes blood blood is the amount of cells (red and white) that circulate through our body, as well as proteins. </p>
<p>Red blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, they have a lifespan of 120 days, and after that they're destroyed by the spleen, and replaced by fresh red blood cells. </p>
<p>White blood cells are also produced in the bone marrow, they're responsible for the immune system.</p>
<p>And the kidneys actually purifies our blood which then turns into just pee. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since nobody else has explained this yet, as they pass through the liver red blood cells are effectively 'screened' by specialised white blood cells who destroy any that are looking a bit old or damaged. The components are then processed in the liver which much of them being recycled but some being turned into waste products like bilirubin. </p>
<p>Ever wondered why your poo is brown? Bilirubin.</p>
<p>As an aside, jaundice is where bilirubin isn't processed properly due to liver damage and so it accumulates in the skin instead of the poo, which turns your skin yellow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The old blood cells get broken down into their individual pieces. Some of it is what actually colors your pee yellow and poop brown. So you can imagine just how much blood cell turnover happens in our bodies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
