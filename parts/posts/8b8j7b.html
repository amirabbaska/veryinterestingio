		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would like to point out that native Chinese speakers actually have both L and R in their language and can easily tell the difference. In fact, in some dialects such as the Cantonese spoken in Hong Kong, L and N get confused. R is still an obvious separate sound (just for example, &quot;lemon&quot; is <a href="https://translate.google.com/#en/zh-CN/lemon" target="_blank">this</a> in Chinese).</p>
<p>Also here's an example of both liquids in Chinese.</p>
<p><a href="https://translate.google.com/#zh-CN/en/%E4%B9%90" target="_blank">L</a></p>
<p><a href="https://translate.google.com/#zh-CN/en/%E7%83%AD" target="_blank">R</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there are:</p>
<ul>
<li>sounds we can make but don't notice (aspirated stops, nasal vowels, etc). </li>
</ul>
<p>Example 1: There's a difference in pronunciation of the 'p' in both spot and pot. We don't notice, but other languages do. </p>
<p>Example 2: in English, we have both nasal vowels and non-nasal vowels. The 'o' in on and of are pronounced differently. We can't tell the difference. French can. </p>
<ul>
<li>sounds we can make but only sometimes</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 1: 'ng' at the end of a syllable we can pronounce just fine. Put it at the start of a word and we cock it up every time. 'mb' and 'ts' are other examples of this.</p>
<p>Example 2: the unstressed syllable, aka the schwa,which we use all the time but think is an o, u, e or a depending on the word</p>
<ul>
<li>sounds we make up because our grammer doesn't work like that:</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 1: a native English speaker always pronounces it &quot;Shri&quot; Lanka until they learn better</p>
<p>Example 2: a native Spanish speaker will always add 'eh' to sc- English words; <em>eschool, </em>escam, until they learn better</p>
<ul>
<li>sounds that only exist in certain accents:</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 1: rolled 'r' is common in Scots dialects</p>
<p>Example 2: glottal tap in certain British accents (i.e. Bottle becomes *bo'ul) </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>sounds we use only because of loanwords
Example 1: ñ, señor for example</p>
</li>
<li>sounds that simply don't exist in English at all, which is actually (relatively) rare compared to sounds we make but don't recognize</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 1: the Welsh double L</p>
<p>Example 2: the Spanish rolled double R</p>
<p>Example 3: the German glottal R</p>
<p>Example 4: the click</p>
<p>Example 5: è, a vowel from French </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Russian there is the character &quot; ы &quot; which makes a very difficult sound for us native English speakers... the best I can describe it in text is &quot;oo-uh-ee&quot; but one syllable, solid flow. I'm not sure that does it justice tho.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
