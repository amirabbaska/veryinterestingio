		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Snow IS ice. Hexagonal crystalline ice. Exactly the same crystalline ice as in ice cubes.</p>
<p>Anyway... Compressing snow would work fine to create ice cubes if that's your question. </p>
<p>Further compressing it would create <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg" target="_blank">different phases</a> with different properties.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pressure and time created the ice of earth's glaciers and ice sheets. Accumulation of snow over older snow applies the pressure. After a year of compression, a compacted snow called firn or névé is formed. More time and pressure squeezes the air from this and ice is formed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure. You don't even need that much force to accomplish this as an experiment. It's got to do with the pressure causing the frozen water to change phase (melt without heating) in localized instances.</p>
<p>I'm trying to think of a way to rig this up on a small scale, but the only methods I can think of would require a wood shop, which you might not have access to. (Lol also some snow. I'm Canadian, you may not be)</p>
<p>Maybe someone with a better imagination can help you design a small scale experiment to show this off. It's not hard to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So under a little bit of pressure the crystalline structure reorganizes and will form a matrix with surrounding molecules. </p>
<p>More interestingly, if you look at a phase change diagram you can predict what a material will do as you add pressure or heat.</p>
<p>Remember: quickly introducing pressure on a closed system will produce heat from compression.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on temperature. It is entirely possible it will become liquid water instead. Increased pressure makes the liquid phase (which is denser than regular ice) more favorable.</p>
<p>At lower temperatures, the snow/ice would just end up in other (denser) ice phases than the one we usually see on Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
