		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I am aware of world star performers like David Garret, Lang Lang but they still perform old repertoires  90% of the time. The closest star composer I know is Ludovico Einaudi but the music still sounds very modern and different. Is it because classical music no longer has a monopoly and because the world has become more diverse? </p>
<p>TL;DR where is the next Beethoven or Vivaldi?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Edit: „as ever“ as opposed to „es ever“</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, the landscape of classical music changed a lot over the course of the last hundred and fifty years because there are other means of entertainment. It used to be that classical music was the music of the common man, but now it has the appearance of an aristocratic activity. Composers writing academic art music aren’t necessarily writing for a wider audience, rather they’re writing for academically trained composers like themselves. That doesn’t mean that there aren’t composers that everyone knows these days, take John Williams or Hans Zimmer for example. They’re writing for the most popular media of today just like how Puccini, Verdi or Wagner wrote for opera, which was the most popular media in the 19th century.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>John Adams and Philip Glass are probably the two biggest art music composers today.  Interestingly, they both practice their own unique take on the minimalist style, perfected by Steve Reich.  My sense is that we are in a transition phase culturally.  Our world society is changing and music is changing along with it.  Where things will land is hard to say.  The Internet is transforming so many paradigms.  I find out about new, good music from people who send me links almost instantly.  But it still takes years of effort and study to create anything of high quality.  So society is moving much faster, but composers still have to woodshed their work.  It’s possible the ‘slow &amp; steady’ efforts of composers are, in a sense, time capsules that bypass faster societal development.  So a piece is completed for a society that has changed from when they began.  The Rip Van Winkle school of composing, if you will.  Not a deliberate decision, just a by-product of living in a fast, changing society.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I studied music composition in college, and there are a couple other points I think might help understand. Pretty much everything said so far is spot on, but the market for New art music is also very limited. You can make some money writing for commercials and tv if you are lucky/good enough to get in but it is highly competitive and like most fields now they want you to start off working for free and doing more than writing the music. I quit altogether because I couldn't find  lucrative work even with a master's degree. Of all the people I knew,  I can only think of maybe one who is making a living at it. </p>
<p>The other problem with modern art music is that it is kind of hard to get performers to play it. There are people and groups that specialize in modern music but a performer 's bread and butter is still going to be in playing the classic repertoire. Most concert goers don't like new music (sounds like shit or it's scary) and just want to hear the old music. As a performer who needs to pay the bills you have to spend as much time as you can at being the best at what makes money in a very competitive field. Not much time left over to work out new music. </p>
<p>It's just like any other art. In today's economy with the abundance of talent and lack of real demand it makes the skills almost worthless. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It only really seems like there are comparatively tons of old superstar composers because we've had hundreds of years to cement them as superstars. Gershwin, Stravinsky, Shastakovich, Cage were all active until the late (or late-ish) 20th century, and they're incredibly well-known composers. Their style of music might be different, but so are the styles of Tchaikovsky, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven and Handel. I guarantee you that in another fifty years, someone will ask this same question, and someone else will respond with another fifty years' worth of similar work that has become revered over the passage of time.</p>
<p>This segues into a phenomenon called &quot;availability bias&quot;. Essentially, think about the statement, &quot;They just don't make cars like they used to.&quot; Well, they actually make cars <em>better</em> than they used to--they generally last longer and crashes in them are more survivable (as well as getting better gas mileage and going faster and so forth). It only seems like old cars lasted longer because the few that lasted, have now lasted a <em>really long time</em> and are impressive for it, and our brains take that notable data point and emphasize it when creating our understanding of time/quality relationships. At the same time, we don't see the ones that didn't last, so we don't think about their non-existence (our brain de-emphasizes them). This overweighting of what is &quot;available&quot; is the fundamental characteristic of &quot;availability bias&quot; (see also &quot;survivorship bias&quot;, of which both of these are also examples)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
