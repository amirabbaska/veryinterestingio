		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I happened across a <a href="http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?Spec=C124389&amp;Index=1&amp;Type=IR" target="_blank">absorption spectrum</a> of CO2 which included the very end of the visible spectrum.  It seems to show CO2 absorbs light in the 630-700 nm wavelength, at least somewhat.  I'm curious why, if CO2 seems to absorb some visible light, high concentrations of it are not visible as bluish/cyan gas (white light removing the deep reds).  Is there something I am missing here?</p>
<p>What led me to this was an interest in replicating the sort of things shown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH-W3gYx8vY" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1fJ3UuSFaU" target="_blank">here</a>.  These all seem to use mid wave IR and a narrow bandpass filter.  I would imagine that if a narrow bandpass filter around 650 nm on a regular camera would let you see CO2, they would have done that instead.  But I don't see why it wouldn't work.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: As Shookfoot notes below, the units on the graph are wavenumber, not nanometers wavelength.  As such, the absorption isn't in the visible spectrum at all.</p></div></div>
