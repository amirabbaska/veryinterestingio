		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I happened across a <a href="http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?Spec=C124389&amp;Index=1&amp;Type=IR" target="_blank">absorption spectrum</a> of CO2 which included the very end of the visible spectrum.  It seems to show CO2 absorbs light in the 630-700 nm wavelength, at least somewhat.  I'm curious why, if CO2 seems to absorb some visible light, high concentrations of it are not visible as bluish/cyan gas (white light removing the deep reds).  Is there something I am missing here?</p>
<p>What led me to this was an interest in replicating the sort of things shown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH-W3gYx8vY" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1fJ3UuSFaU" target="_blank">here</a>.  These all seem to use mid wave IR and a narrow bandpass filter.  I would imagine that if a narrow bandpass filter around 650 nm on a regular camera would let you see CO2, they would have done that instead.  But I don't see why it wouldn't work.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: As Shookfoot notes below, the units on the graph are wavenumber, not nanometers wavelength.  As such, the absorption isn't in the visible spectrum at all.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there! The answer to this question is about the units of the absorbance spectrum you have shown us. The units are in wavenumbers, not nanometers. 600 wavenumbers is approximately 17,000 nm. Hope that clears things up!</p>

<p>700cmâ€“1 = 14285.71 nm</p>
<p>So, far outside of the visible spectrum, into the infrared. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm thinking spectral sensitivity might have some influence on this. The human eye actually has rather different sensitivity to different wavelengths in the visible spectrum. The sensitivity rapidly falling off close to the UV and IR region. Cameras might very well mimick this effect to make pictures look as natural as possible. This would make detecting weak CO2 absorption in the far red part of the visible region rather difficult.</p>
<p>The videos are using an IR camera which detect thermal radiation. Therefore the CO2 might show up due to its low temperature and IR emission. This does not really relate to the absorption of IR light by the gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was a long time ago but I used to calibrate visibility meters for the defence forces (I think they were used at airfields) and pure CO2 was used as a calibration gas.
I forget most of the details, I remember they used a small IR gas laser and a motorised chopper and simple optics, CO2 gave a quite drastic response to IR.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
