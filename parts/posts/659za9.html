		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming by caveman you mean early humans (homo sapiens sapiens), the answer is stone tools. Humans have had stone tools since before we became 'humans' - i.e. since about a million years ago (and some are argued to be over 3million years old). </p>
<p>Stone tools were the standard item for cutting and trimming - including nails and hair. Despite popular imagination of them as just rocks they were highly crafted and sophisticated tools, carefully shaped for purpose. We can see this behaviour described in the historical record when different cultures meet. People did also of course wear/break nails through daily use and tie their hair back, both of which happen today. Some cultures used animal fat in their hair as a kind of grease to hold it back or make it stick up and make them look bigger. </p>
<p>Medieval people used scissors for hair but the scissors that existed were too big for nails. They did it the same way Romans did - with small knives (think paring knives rather than daggers). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cavemen didn't cut their hair as hair provided extra warmth. As for nails they were used as tools so they were worn down naturally, if they became too long they probably chewed them or filed them with rocks.</p>
<p>In medieval times they had scissors that they used to cut their nails.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you think about it, the lifestyle of the primitive humans allowed them to succesfully pass on their genes and live in harmony with the world for hundreds of thousands of years. Here we are completely fucking everything up in a tenth of the time, wondering &quot;were our ancestors capable of basic hygienic maintenance?&quot;. Yet we don't ever ask &quot;how did they live in such a sustainable way in complete harmony with every other species on earth for so long?&quot; </p>
<p>*i should not have said &quot;complete harmony with every other species&quot;. What I really meant was that we weren't causing extinction at a massively increasing rate</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm so confused why people would think you'd need tools or teeth to cut nails here. My entire life I've been able to cut my nails using my finger nails like it's the easiest thing in the world. I can't imagine why you would bite them unless it's somehow more pleasant, but I think that's bad for your teeth so I've never been tempted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lindow man (Pete Marsh) was from around 2 BC to 119 AD and had manicured nails according to investigations.  I believe that the microscope revealed that his nails had been cut with an instrument which may have been scissor-like.</p>
<p>&quot;In life, Lindow Man would have measured between 5'6&quot; and 5'8&quot; (1.68 and 1.73 m) tall and weighed about 132 pounds (60 kg). It was possible to ascertain that his age at death was around the mid-20s. The body retains a trimmed beard, moustache, and sideburns of brown hair, as well as healthy teeth with no visible cavities, and manicured fingernails, indicating he did little heavy or rough work. &quot; </p>
