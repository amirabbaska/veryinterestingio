		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure this is a case of &quot;bad science writing&quot; but in three articles this week, <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/9/30/6875459/calm-down-youre-not-going-to-get-ebola" target="_blank">like this one</a> I've seen attempts to downplay the threat by saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But it's difficult to contract. The only way to catch Ebola is to have direct contact with the bodily fluids — vomit, sweat, blood, feces, urine or saliva — of someone who has Ebola and has begun showing symptoms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Direct contact with <strong><em>Sweat</em></strong>? That sounds trivially easy to me. HIV is spread through blood-blood contact and that's had a fine time spreading in the US. </p>
<p>So why is Ebola so &quot;hard to catch&quot;? Is it that it's only infectious after symptoms show, so we figure we won't have infectious people on the street? That's delusional, considering US healthcare costs. </p>
<p>Or is it (as I'm assuming) that it's more complex than simply &quot;contact with sweat&quot;? </p>
<p>Not trying to fearmonger; trying to understand. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing about ebola is that the disease lasts for a relatively short period of time (2-21 days but usually 8-10 <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/symptoms/index.html" target="_blank">for symptoms to appear</a> and most patients die <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2249.2002.01800.x/full" target="_blank">5-9 days after clinical onset of the disease</a>) and for most of the time when people are infectious, they are obviously very sick (Humans are not infectious until they develop symptoms says the <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/" target="_blank">WHO</a>-scroll down- and symptoms include vomiting and bleeding from the gums.  People very quickly become very sick--<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/04/01/297884573/why-is-guineas-ebola-outbreak-so-unusual" target="_blank">NPR interview with Doctors without Borders specialist</a>.  It <em>is</em> suspected that the virus could be sexually transmitted for a few months after the disease because viral particles were found in semen for quite a while after infection, but I can't find any documented cases of transmission actually occurring via that route).  </p>
<p>People with HIV can walk around for years spreading the disease through sex without ever even knowing they are sick (<a href="http://www.who.int/features/qa/71/en/" target="_blank">WHO says</a> the time to develop HIV related illness is 5-10 years, for an AIDS diagnosis is 15-20).  People with ebola can walk around for a few days at most (see above-usually only 5-9 days of showing symptoms and being highly infectious-and based on the rapid onset of severe symptoms, most of that time is typically spent severely ill-<em>much</em> shorter than the years to decades seen in HIV).  And after they get sufficiently sick they <em>will</em> wind up in a hospital-pretty much everyone who is that sick goes to the emergency room and worries about costs later-or a the very worst a morgue.  Then someone will notice they had ebola and will track down their contacts...which will probably be small in number due to the fact that they would have been very sick and not out and about.  And since you don't start spreading the disease until you start showing symptoms, if you can get to the people and isolate them in time you can reduce the chance of spread significantly (now obviously some of this is my interpretation, but I want to point out that both <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/health/ebola-outbreak-in-nigeria-appears-to-be-over.html?_r=0" target="_blank">Nigeria</a> and <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm63e0930a3.htm" target="_blank">Senegal</a> were able to stop single point introductions from getting out of control using exactly these methods, despite the fact that it took them days and days in Senegal to get the patient quarantined, and note that of 900 contacts followed in Nigeria, only 20 developed the disease, and of 67 followed in Senegal, none developed the disease).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ebola has a reproductive number (R0) of about 1.8. That means on average each infected person passes it on to 1.8 other people. So that's actually very poor. Where it (rightfully) grabs headlines is its extremely high mortality rate.</p>
<p>For comparison measles has an R0 of about 17 or 18. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HIV/AIDS was rampant in the population before we knew about it. There were thousands(probably more) infected and showed no visible signs of illness.</p>
<p>While Ebola is much the opposite. We know it exists, the symptoms for it, have tests to diagnose and there are very few cases(in the US). Furthermore, you are not infective without symptoms, the symptoms are very severe and is not airborne. This results in a very low transmission rate. </p>
<p>My understanding about Dallas is a few more people may get sick. These will most likely be people who cared for the sick individual. But those individuals will not get the time to infect others before the CDC is on their ass. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the things that makes HIV so dangerous is that the infected can pass as uninfected, and they can do so for a long <em>long</em> time.  Ebola starts showing symptoms in a week or so, and it ramps up in the next week or two after which point they are often dead.  During that time it is clear (to an educated populace) that the patient should be treated with extreme caution, contact should be limited, etc.  Even if you don't know they have ebola, once the symptoms develop it's pretty clear that you are dealing with someone who is very sick.</p>
<p>HIV patients can survive for years and years with the disease, and it's very easy for the patient to hide the fact that they have the disease, as its outward signs are minimal compared to ebola.  You can infect plenty of people without their knowledge, and they may even pass it on to others without realizing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's relatively easy to catch Ebola if you come into contact with someone who is symptomatic (i.e. very <em>very</em> sick). It's pretty difficult to actually contact someone who is symptomatic. Unlike AIDS, where you're pretty &quot;okay&quot; for a little while, Ebola hits fast, and it hits <strong>hard.</strong></p>
<p>All things considered, people have a week or so when they're contagious, then they die. (if they're not treated)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
