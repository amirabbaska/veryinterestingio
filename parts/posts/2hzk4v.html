		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure this is a case of &quot;bad science writing&quot; but in three articles this week, <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/9/30/6875459/calm-down-youre-not-going-to-get-ebola" target="_blank">like this one</a> I've seen attempts to downplay the threat by saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But it's difficult to contract. The only way to catch Ebola is to have direct contact with the bodily fluids — vomit, sweat, blood, feces, urine or saliva — of someone who has Ebola and has begun showing symptoms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Direct contact with <strong><em>Sweat</em></strong>? That sounds trivially easy to me. HIV is spread through blood-blood contact and that's had a fine time spreading in the US. </p>
<p>So why is Ebola so &quot;hard to catch&quot;? Is it that it's only infectious after symptoms show, so we figure we won't have infectious people on the street? That's delusional, considering US healthcare costs. </p>
<p>Or is it (as I'm assuming) that it's more complex than simply &quot;contact with sweat&quot;? </p>
<p>Not trying to fearmonger; trying to understand. </p></div></div>
