<p>EDIT: This question is NOT to propagate any stereotypes regarding Australia/Australians and NOT an extension of &quot;Everything in Australia is trying to kill you&quot; meme. I only wanted to know the reason behind the difference in the fauna in two countries which I believed to be close by and related (in a geographical sense), for which many people have given great answers. (Thank you guys!)</p>
<p>So if you just came here to say how sick you are of hearing people saying that everything in Australia is out to kill you, just don't bother.</p>
<p>EDIT2: &quot;choke-full&quot; is wrong. It should be chock-full. I stand corrected. I would correct it already if reddit allowed me to edit the title. If you're just here to correct THAT, again, just don't bother.</p></div></div>
