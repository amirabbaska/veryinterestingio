		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is more ELI am a teenager. I'm sorry, but it's the best I can do.</p>
<p>When a material fails, it can fail in two different ways. One way is for the material to deform which is caused by the atoms in that material moving past one another. This is called plastic flow. The other way, is for a crack in the material to propagate all the way through the material cleaving it into two different pieces. This is called crack propagation.</p>
<p>In general, failure of a material is heavily dependent on its atomic structure. In some types of materials their susceptibility to fail from plastic flow is heavily temperature dependent, while its susceptibility to failure through crack propagation is not. When these types of materials get cold they lose their ability to fail due to plastic flow (which is synonymous with their ability to deform), and so crack propagation takes over. When a material fails through crack propagation instead of through plastic flow, we call this a brittle fracture. Materials that show this change in susceptibility to plastically flow are said to go through a <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/source/html/50809/media/fig1.png" target="_blank"><em>&quot;ductile to brittle transition.&quot;</em></a></p>
<p>What this means is that some materials when they are warm fail due to plastic flow but when they get cold they begin to fail in a brittle fashion.</p>
<p>As a disclaimer, I will add that almost all materials become more brittle as they get colder, but some materials still stay what we would consider ductile as their temperature drops. This is due to the fact that plastic flow becomes easier when atoms are further apart which is the case when a material is warmer. Atoms are vibrating more quickly, and so on average they are farther apart from one another in a warmer material. Because of this they can slide past one another more easily, which is essential for a material to deform. Conversely, a material that is brittle will fail without deforming much at all... It will simply crack all the way through.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like others have said, it’s more of a question of <em>when</em> a material gets brittle, not if.
That said, the reason the temperature varies is that the atoms can be arranged in different ways that can then move (dissipate energy) in different ways. The best example I can think of is casserole.
Imagine a casserole made of small regularly shaped noodles like penne. Put it in the refrigerator. If you tried to break off a piece with your hands, it’d be pretty easy (brittle). Now imagine making be same dish but using spaghetti...suddenly when you try to break off a piece, it is tangled with the rest of of the casserole and doesn’t break off as easily or cleanly (ductile)! That said, if you put it in the freezer instead of just the fridge, it’d probably break in either case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Y’all need to chill about brittle transitions and glass transitions. You need to take it back to what’s causing all of this in the first place.
Energetics and kinetics. </p>
<p>Yes bcc metals will often be more ductile than hcp bc of slip planes in the system. Yes metals are more ductile bc of metallic bonding. Yes polymers experience a glass transition that allows for polymer flow to begin. Sure whatever fine. </p>
<p>Elit: But the reason materials fail in a brittle fashion in colder temperatures is because it’s more convenient to break bonds than it is to create more disorder in the system. </p>
<p>go look at a stress strain curve and take the integral. The area under the curve is the toughness of the material, how much work it can take before failure. Work and heat are the similar, and heat capacity is dependent on temperature. Hotter the material, more work can be done. How much the heat capacity varies in temperature determines how much more brittle it will be as it gets colder. </p>
<p>Then compare to what is favorable, adding entropy in forms of dislocation, or break a bond. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just like how some materials boil faster than others some materials freeze faster than others. All materials will become brittle at a certain freezing temperature. This has a lot to do with water content. </p>
<p>For those things with little to no water content you will have to go to an extremely low temperature to make them freeZe enough to become sufficiently brittle that you can break them easily.</p>
<p>Why do objects become brittle ? Because the bonds between molecules weaker as there is no room for movement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so everything will break if the rate at which you deform it is high enough. Think about silly puddy, if you pull it really quick it will snap. Let's call this 'brittle yield strength' - how high of a strain rate something can have applied to it before it breaks.</p>
<p>It just so happens that some materials have interesting atomic and molecular properties which make then have lower brittle strain rates as they get cold, and others are not as sensitive.</p>
<p>A true ELI5 is difficult without a few basic chemical principles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
