		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reading your question, I suspected the carbonation might be the cause. Carbonation dissolves into the liquid as carbonic acid, which would certainly create a burning sensation. </p>
<p>But, there are some problems with that explanation. First, the amount of CO2 present is going to be constant regardless of temperature. It's a sealed can after all. Second, there is <em>less</em> CO2 dissolved as carbonic acid in a cold drink. </p>
<p>Last, I don't think that has a significant effect on the pH. By chance I had 2 bottles in my fridge -- one that had gone flat and one that was unopened. Both were around 2.9°C. I popped my pH meter into a sample from each, and got 2.52 for the fresh one and 2.61 for the flat one. So at first glance it seems like the carbonation really isn't a factor. </p>
<p>My guess would be that your taste buds are reacting to the combination of cold, and the other acids present (citric acid, phosphoric acid, etc) to give you something you perceive as a burning sensation. The word <em>perceive</em> is important -- organoleptic evaluation (how people actually perceive tastes, textures, and flavors) can vary wildly from person to person. </p>
<p>I would love to hear if someone else can chime in with more specific research. </p>
<p>[Edit: some others have (correctly) pointed out that the dissolution of CO2 is more complicated, and may be the opposite of what I stated. I definitely defer to those with more specific knowledge. The basic (ha, ha) point stands though -- the pH of flat soda wasn't much different from fresh soda]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Our bodies nerves are pretty bad at relaying temperature. Once a threshold on either the hot or cold side is surpassed, our bodies start registering it as pain.</p>
<p>I don't understand exactly why our bodies do this... Probably because extreme temperatures are bad for us, so it should be painful.  am just recalling this from grade 12 biology. It wasn't part of the curriculum but it was a fun side lesson!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

You tongue has lots of nerves on it that tell your brain what it is you’re tasting/eating. Nerves have tiny little receptors on their surface that essentially recognise different chemicals in stuff you eat/drink. The idea is we evolved to have these receptors so we can recognise if food has good stuff in it so we eat more of it and bad stuff (like poison) in it so we don’t eat it. Some of these receptors also recognise very hot and very cold temperatures. </p>
<p>These are the same receptors you have in nerves in you skin. So when you touch a cold thing like a block of ice the receptor for painful cold is activated, and the nerve tells your brain about t, and your brain then pulls your hand away. </p>
<p>These cold receptors, as well as other types of receptor, can also recognise acidic things, like CO2 dissolved in liquid (carbonation). </p>
<p>Essentially the sensation you get is due to these receptors on your tongue being activated. It’s not entirely unpleasant because you are also lighting up a load of other receptors with pleasant flavours (sugar!). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
