But I was curious as to the reason I could not pass on my immunity to another via a blood transfusion. Is it simply because the blood cells are incapable of passing on what they have learned to the new host body?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem here is the white blood cells, or WBCs. They have a nasty tendancy to attack everything they don't recognize. When you get a transfusion, the blood is taken from the donor and put into the recipient's body - meaning they'll start going berserk and attacking everything in sight until subdued. Riot time! It doesn't really matter in small quantities, as the recipient's WBCs will quickly overpower the donor's WBCs. But in the case that you are giving a lot of blood or the recipient has a weak immune system (aka is <em>immunocompromised</em>), the donor's WBCs will wreck havoc for a while. Not good. </p>
<p>To prevent this, there are a few means for getting rid of the WBCs. You can use a filter / centrifuge to physically get rid of them, or you can irradiate the blood to kill the WBCs off. This is possible because only WBCs have nuclei (DNA) that can be damaged by the irradiation. Red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets (plts) do not, and so are unaffected. Since we are generally doing transfusion for the RBCs this works out pretty well.</p>
<p>And of course, no WBCs means no immunity, so nothing gets transferred in the end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Immunity is achieved by memory cells which are found in germinal centers of the spleen and lymph nodes, not in circulating blood. It is possible to achieve something called passive immunity by giving someone immunoglobulins from someone with acquired immunity. </p>
<p>The easiest way to explain the difference is that someone with acquired immunity is a person that their immune system has seen the antigen before and has created an immune response. One of the reasons breastfeeding is stressed so much is that a certain class of immunoglobulin is passed through breast milk (it is called IgA). So, mom passes immunoglobulins to baby which are short lived, but offer some protection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/voidwing had a good description of a transfusion reaction.</p>
<p>To add to that, part of the way we achieve immunity through vaccination is by training our immune systems to recognize a pathogen. Normally when we get sick, it can take a few weeks to develop an antibody response. If the immune system has already seen that pathogen, it can respond much faster.</p>
<p>One way the immune system responds is by the activity of plasma cells. Plasma cells are little antibody factories - they are trained to fight one very specific piece of a pathogen and then each cell will sit there and make antibody against that piece for the rest of it's life. Antibody circulates in the blood, and when it finds the thing it was built to destroy, it basically tags that thing for the rest of the immune system to attack.</p>
<p>A blood transfusion might provide some of your circulating antibody, but that has a limited lifespan in the blood. What you really need is the plasma cells to provide a constant stream of antibody. These stay embedded in your tissues, and won't be transferred in a blood transfusion.</p>
<p>To add to that, even if you did get an infusion of trained plasma cells, your own immune system would destroy them because they are recognized as &quot;non-self&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say our bodies are both banks and that we can print money. My body makes $5 bills and your body makes $20 bills. Both are money, but both bills have different details on them. </p>
<p>I can accept your $20 for four of my $5 bills and they're worth the same amount. However, I can't just start printing $20 bills just because they play nice with my $5 bills. My printing press is slated for $5 bills and those details are specific to me. </p>
<p>Blood types and immunology get much more specific, but you can't confer your immunity by just sharing some blood. Bone marrow (our printing press) is what produces cells ($ bills) specific to our body, and even though they can sometimes be exchanged with other people, our bone marrow doesn't learn how to &quot;print&quot; these different cells just by being exposed to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Definitely a thing! But it's a temporary immune system booster, IVIG (IV immunoglobulins) is a treatment where antibodies (the Ig's) are taken from one individual and given to another. </p>
<p>There was a case where a doctor, who had previously beaten Ebola, used his plasma to be transfused into an infected nurse saving her life.</p>
<p>There hasn't been good research in the effectiveness in transfusing WBC to fight infection, instead doctors will use drugs to help the body produce their own WBC.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
