I know that Cobalt 60 can produce up to 1.3~ MeV during its decay into nickel. I have also seen alpha bombardment of boron using polonium but that only gets up to 3~ MeV. I could not find any information on how higher values are achieved. How are values above let's say 7 MeV reached?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some common laboratory gamma ray sources (cobalt-60, potassium-40, sodium-22, cesium-137, etc.), but this will generally produce gamma rays of a few hundred keV to a few MeV.</p>
<p>To produce <em>very</em> high energy gamma rays (up to ~ 100 MeV), you can use inverse Compton scattering in a free electron laser. An example would be <a href="http://www.tunl.duke.edu/web.tunl.2011a.higs.php" target="_blank">HIGS at TUNL</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is my time to shine! I am a medical physics master student working at a hospital. Here in our hospital we have medical linear accelerators, they work in the 2.5 - 16 MeV. Here we mostly use the 6 MV energy for most treatments but for any electron therapy we have machines commissioned for up to 12 MeV (16 MeV is not commissioned but can be used for research). Medical linacs work using an electron gun, just like any x-ray machine, and then an accelerating waveguide is used to accelerate those low energy electrons to higher energies. <a href="http://www.ampi-nc.org/essayresult/LINAC-3.pdf" target="_blank">1</a> After the accelerating waveguide there is a bending magnet that shapes redirects the beam towards a tungsten target and then it is collimated to reduce scatter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For hospital use there are two general methods to produce high energy photons: one is to use Cobalt-60 as you've already mentioned. The other is a machine called a linear accelerator (linac)--basically, electrons are accelerated to a high energy level towards a high Z target producing photons which are then filtered and/or shaped. In clinical use energies &gt;= 20 MeV aren't used because of the increasing probability of pair production when higher energy photons interact with matter/tissue.</p>

<p>edit: Depending on the size of what you're irradiating and the machine you're using, the beam can be fairly flat and symmetric. There's likely to be a radiation oncology practice somewhere near you if this is a one-off thing. Make sure you work with a physicist to get whatever you need done. Imprecision in your setup can lead to large discrepancies between planned and delivered dose. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you don't need mono or dichromatic beams but can get away with spectrum of energies, a linear accelerator is probably your best bet. Depending on where you are located/what you are doing you can probably get in contact with a research group that at least has a small animal linac. Also has the added benefit of not having to deal with the NRC/your states agreement regulatory committee (or whatever the counterpart is in whatever country you are in). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It's all very cloak and dagger. What are you up to? If it's legit you'll get help and advice. If you can't answer then it seems like maybe it's a bad idea and the advice will all be very circumspect because no one wants to be the guy that enabled a nuclear nutcase!</p>
