		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because the nerves responsible for sensation **on your skin (called &quot;dermatomes&quot;) look like <a href="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/445845/Brittany_Blog_Images/Locating-and-alleviating-pain-with-the-dermatome-chart-and-estim.png?t=1469557207573" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>Each one of those lines correspond with a region of the brain that causes sensation. Notice how there are 3 sections in the hands alone, but 3 sections in the entire leg. Your hands need to be much more sensitive, which is why there are more nerves dedicated to those areas than the legs or arms (for example). </p>
<p>So when you can't get that itch, it's not that it's <em>under</em> the skin, it's that it's in a different area completely. You just can't tell very well, because the nerves aren't as accurate in some areas, and you're just feeling that there is an itch in that general direction instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically your sensory nerves are confusing your brain.  The nerves are telling your brain the itch is in one place when it's really in another.</p>
<p>A common related example, though not an itch, is when someone has an injury near the groin - their entire leg may feel pain, or just a particular part of their leg or foot may feel pain.  The injured nerve near the groin is responsible for carrying the messages from the legs as well, and so it can send a confusing message to the brain when it's injured, signalling pain the leg, when there really is none.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your skin is many layers thick, and there are different nerves present in each of these layers. Some nerves are deeper, others are closer to the surface. If the itch is being caused by a neuron that's in a deeper layer of your skin sending signals to your brain, scratching the surface of the skin might not stimulate that neuron enough to make the itch go away.  <a href="http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v12/n3/images/nrn2993-f1.jpg" target="_blank">Here's</a>  a figure showing all the different kinds of neurons you have in your dermis and epidermis as well as their relative depth in the skin. They all respond to different kinds of sensation, such as pressure, vibration, pull, stretch, light brush, etc. If you find scratching an itch doesn't make it go away, try stimulating the skin in a different way! Rubbing it, pushing down, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
