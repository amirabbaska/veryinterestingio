		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey there! Patreon is how I make <a href="http://patreon.com/fek" target="_blank">my living</a> (Weird / NSFW), and I've also had successful campaigns on both Kickstarter and GoFundMe.</p>
<p>So the main differences between Patreon and other crowdfunding sites (like Kickstarter and GoFundMe) are:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Patreon is about <em>recurring</em> donations.</strong> You don't just make a $20 pledge, you make a pledge to donate $3 every month. And while there's nothing stopping you from just unpledging whenever you want, most people don't. They're there to support the artist over the long-term, not just with a one-shot donation.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Patreon has looser terms than Kickstarter and GoFundMe.</strong> Kickstarter and GoFundMe campaigns are structured for people/teams who are making a single, actionable, deliverable product. Patreon is structured for <em>people</em>, not projects. As long as you're a person doing something creative, you can use Patreon.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Patreon has a fairly lenient policy on adult content</strong>, and has actually fought many battles on behalf of their adult content creators. For instance, Patreon recently struck a deal with Paypal to allow Paypal payments on adult projects, something that Paypal is normally <em>very</em> averse to. To the best of my knowledge, this is actually the first time Paypal has officially allowed its service to be used for the purchase of adult goods and services.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure of the mechanics of gofundme, but the way Patreon works fits youtubers quite well and it's a matter of market share. Patreon did a few very smart things though:</p>
<p>1) They branded themselves as a means to support &quot;artists&quot; which appeals to the creative spirit and ego of youtube video creators whether they are particularly artistic or not. </p>
<p>2) They also tailored their service to the format. Patreon followers can pledge, for example, $2 per video released per month up to a maximum of $10 or $25 per video per month with no max. Or just donate once. It makes it highly customizable to fit every budget. </p>
<p>3) They've enabled creators to give bonuses to patreon followers at different levels. It's like a PBS fund drive in that way. Donate $5 per video and you get a tshirt, but $25 gets you a bloopers DVD. That sort of thing. </p>
<p>3) But most importantly, they had some youtubers who made a lot of money using their service and that caught the attention of other creators. I follow a sailing channel, for example, that at one point made something like $10,000 per video they release because of their Patreon followers, which is just incredible as far as I'm concerned. They get to sail the world and make incredible HD videos, and they make $40-50,000/month. Makes me feel like going to school for 19 years and amassing $200k in debt wasn't such a grand plan after all. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Patreon, Kickstarter, and GoFundMe are three separate services with three separate purposes.</p>
<p>GoFundMe is intended to be charity work for the donators. One person or group has a need for money, and people give it to them. There is no expectation of reciprocity.</p>
<p>Patreon and Kickstarter are services to be used by a business.</p>
<p>Kickstarter was based on the idea of &quot;I have an idea and a design, but I have no capital to produce my first line of product. If you invest in me, you'll get one of the first products I make.&quot; If the project makes enough to justify the production run, then it gets made. If not, all money is returned to the donators and the project goes unfunded. It's a one time purchase for a one time return.</p>
<p>Patreon is aimed toward continuous content creators in a subscription-style service. For a monthly payment, users (&quot;patrons&quot;) gain access to a profile where the content creator posts media accessible only to various levels of patrons based on their monthly subscription amount. Some patreon profiles release their content for patrons early before releasing it for free on another platform (YouTube) but patrons get to see it early. This is more common when Patreon is a supplemental source of income, or when Patreon is seen as a &quot;donation box&quot; in exchange for the work the creator has done that they intended to be free from the start.      </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference is in a GoFundMe it's a one time thing you set up a campaign collect money for that one thing and then that's it.  Pateron is ongoing support.  So you set up your page and people agree to give you $X per month or per video or whatever.  They can support you as long as they like.  </p>
<p>Youtubers like it because the ad rates on youtube aren't great.  If you are supporting yourself solely on Youtube ads you need about a million views a week to have it be a full time job.  Pateron lets people with passionate fans keep youtube their full time gig when they can't get that many views.  Maybe their videos are niche so there aren't 100,000 people that will watch ten videos a week of quilting but the people that do love quilting videos really love them.  Maybe the videos take a long time to make like animations so even if a million people watched each video they only come out once a month.  Maybe it takes a team to make the video like a web series so you'd actually need 4 or 5 million views a week to support everyone as full time employees.  One $1 patron is worth more then 1000 views and a lot of people donate more then that a month.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just Youtubers, you can find virtually any sort of artist, content creator.  </p>
<p>Yes, Patreon is kind of like Gofundme, except instead of giving a single amount to a project you can effectively subscribe to someone donating a planned amount each month.  In exchange the content creator is expected to provide additional benefits to their supports (usually in the form of exclusive content or early access).</p>
<p>Thinking about it another way - people have been doing this for a very long time.  Being a <em>Patron</em> of an Artist in the Renaissance meant giving them money or resources to continue to make their art.  Patreon is just a modern version of that, crowd funding money so a popular artist can devote more time to their art.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
