		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every day I do very similar things: take shower, put contacts in, take medicine, fill water bottle in backpack, etc.  Sometimes it's genuinely confusing to remember if I did or didn't do something, because I've done it hundreds or thousands of times before.</p>
<p>This seems to fall between long- and short-term memory.  I know where my contact case is in a strange hotel, even though I put it down somewhere 12+ hours before.  I can find it in the dark the next morning.  But a day later, there's no particular trace of these daily events.  I probably couldn't even describe the hotel room with accuracy.</p>
<p>Are these types of events creating long-term memories that are ruthlessly pruned because of no reinforcement, or are they stored differently?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is some pruning going on, if you remembered every detail from your daily life you would be a rain man and probably not function &quot;normally.&quot; It could also be mentioned that a lot of memories are stored in relation to your physical environment. For example, if you returned to that hotel room you'd probably easily recall the exact spot you put your contacts before, because that memory was stored in association with your memory of that location. As far as repetitive things like showers, it's easy to forget if you took one today because you have e a ton of competing/overlapping memories of the same thing, and your brain has to search thru them for the most relevant incidence. Not sure if that fully answers the question but there ya go. Out of date psych degree here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you've got two different things here: repeated acts, and one-time acts that have low salience. You take a shower every day, so &quot;how to wash self&quot; gets treated as a learned skill/task and is not impacted by other memories created that day. If you do the same routine for long enough your brain starts to treat each of the separate actions involved like components of a single task. The parts of it are not recalled separately, either when you're doing them or when you want to remember them later. That's why when you get interrupted in the middle of it, it's hard to remember what part you were at. </p>
<p>Remembering where you put your contacts in a hotel room (and appearance of the room itself) is a one-time event with low saliency. When it was occurring you did not attach importance to the actions involved by involving otherwise-unrelated parts of your mind, like executive decision making, emotions, other memories, etc. This memory is not connected to anything else and you don't spend time afterward activating it by thinking about it, so it's a good target for overwriting later when you need to remember something else for an hour or two. This is why mnemonics tricks often involve telling yourself a little story about the thing you want to remember: this attaches the thing to a bunch of other things such as visual images or jokes or music, and this causes your brain to treat it as less of a target for pruning. After rehearsing the story a little bit, the memory stabilizes, becoming long-lasting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
