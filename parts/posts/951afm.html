I would think that an object striking the moon at an angle would form a less perfectly circular crater than a direct hit.  If the moon's gravitational pull isn't very large, and it has no atmosphere to slow objects down, why does it appear that most impacts come at a very high angle?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't have to be at a high angle to create a circular crater. If the object is moving fast enough (and it will be, since it's falling at interplanetary speeds), it will create a massive explosion when it hits. The shock wave is circular, and will be much much larger than the object itself. That's what creates the crater, not the actual path of the meteorite.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/Marlsfarp answer is correct.   At extremely high speeds, and at angles greater that a few degrees from glancing (something like 2 or 3)  the impact function becomes a single point explosion,  not two objects crashing into one another.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unless the object striking the moon comes with a grazing angle, it will stop almost instantly once hitting the surface. The only difference you would get is a higher ridge of the crater on one side and a maybe slightly distorted shape (depending on the soil's material), which isn't easy to spot from a picture taken from orbit. This isn't limited to the moon too, see <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mars_topography_(MOLA_dataset)_with_poles_HiRes.jpg#/media/File:Mars_topography_(MOLA_dataset)_with_poles_HiRes.jpg" target="_blank">Mars</a> here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The kinetic energy of the impacting object exceeds the binding energy of the material within the object so it explodes. The binding energy is different depending on the composition of the object. For example a ball of loosely packed snow requires only a very small amount of kinetic energy to break apart. If you throw a ball of snow against a hard surface at an angle hard enough you should observe the snow explode in a mostly circular fashion!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
