		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, your examples are not mating <em>rituals</em>. They are mating behaviours.</p>
<p>Octopus rips off <del>tentacle</del> arm, because that arm (called <em>hectocotylus</em>) is actually an  autonomous female-seeking semen carrier (yes, octopuses are <em>that</em> freaking weird/awesome). Praying mantis female simply would eat anyone, and male have chance to mate by presenting something to stuff her mouth (or is that what spiders do?). Sometimes they get away before female finishes her meal, sometimes not. And its all good for babies, anyway - male's genes are already accounted for, so it doesn't matter what happens to him afterwards.</p>
<p>Now, by mating rituals they mean specific instinctive behaviour used for choosing mating  partner but not leading directly to mating. Usually it is some form of dancing, fighting other males (either actually fighting or by <del>rap battles</del> contests of songs, bright feathers and such. Male mantis presenting food for female is a ritual, too.</p>
<p>As for why they do this from evolution viewpoint - AFAIK this still considered unsolved. There are several theories on <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection" target="_blank">sexual selection</a>. One, handicap theory, says that male that can spend resources on otherwise useless things like <del>jewelry</del> bright feathers (more visible to predators) is more able at survival. Still, I heard there are some problems with this theory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about the whole octopus tentacle tearing, and I think it's better to consider the praying mantis eating the head of it's male mate an act of survival rather than a mating ritual.</p>
<p>However, there are mating rituals such as dances that can certainly seem odd...</p>
<p>To understand what is happening, one must consider things from the perspective of genes.</p>
<p>Genes don't think or feel, but it's a handy tool to think of the gene as a greedy thing that wants to survive and spread. In reality, it doesn't care about anything. It's just that all the genes that don't survive and spread tend to die off and cease to be around, and when the gene is gone, it can't induce traits in a species.</p>
<p>The genes of the female praying mantis &quot;want&quot; to do anything that ensures they propagate and survive better. To the female's genes, the male is a ticket to reproduction. There is some value in keeping the male alive so that it can enable the female's genes to pass to another generation....
However, as soon as the male has served its use to the female genes, it is no longer helpful to keep it alive. The male is a food source for the female, and so once the male serves its reproductive purpose, it is fair game for eating in order to ensure that the female has enough energy to continue to serve its genes in the task of reproduction.</p>
<p>Why would the male ever put it's self in a situation of such certain death? Because to the male's genes, it doesn't care about what happens to the male after firtilization. There is no use in a male mantis that doesn't mate to save it's skin. The genes prefer that the mantis dies to make babies than to live, not make babies and die eventually anyway.</p>
<p>Basically, everything about life on earth is defined by this basic principle of things evolving to perform whatever tasks best enable life to propagate, by random creation of new genes through mutation, and selection of the most effective genes by elimination of less effecive ones.</p>
<h1>Mating rituals</h1>
<p>Mating rituals are normally the result of what is called &quot;sexual selection&quot;. In sexual selection, an individual, normally a female, will be careful to select it's mates because the female has to invest a lot of time and energy into producing offspring, so care must be taken to ensure that the the male she mates with; as donor of 50 percent of her children's genes; provides the healthiest genes available so as to increase the chances of survival of her own genes within those offspring.</p>
<p>So females in many species often tend to observe males to make sure they are fit and capable before mating with them, as weak, unhealthy or injured males are more likely to create children that are weak, unhealthy, or likely to injure themselves.</p>
<p>And males therefore evolve behaviors to exhibit their healthiness and even evolve decietful activity to increase their chances, and this arms-race between females trying to figure out how good a mate a male is and males contantly trying to appear to be good mates even if they aren't leads to some quite complex behavior.</p>
<p>A lot of the time we don't even know exactly why they do what they do, but sexual selection for the sake of getting a survival advantage is our best guess.</p>
<p>Maybe birds do some dances to show off their ability to move: a skill injured birds are lacking in...
Maybe parrots mimic the sounds of other things as mating calls because it shows off some form of intelligence helpful to survival?</p>
<p>But we can probably bet that if performing these complex rituals takes a lot of energy, but doesn't lead to any survival advantage for the genes, the animals wouldn't evolve them.</p>
<h1>How the heck do animals know how to do it?</h1>
<p>Genes. While mating rituals can certainly incorporate elements learned by experience; such as parrots learning different calls, they tend to be dominated by instinctual behavior.</p>
<p>This is behavior that an animal will perform even if it is never shown how to.</p>
<p>The only way to explain how the animal knows to do this behavior is that it is the result of some sort of fixed pattern put into the brain during development by genes. Certain stimuli lead the brain to perform certain actions leading to certain behaviors.</p>
<p>For instance, you eat a food, it produces a unique taste, and you somehow know that the taste is good and you for some reason want to eat more. You never had to have it explained to you that this food has this taste and you should eat things that taste like this because you need food to live. Your brain just automatically creates the positive reinforcement mechanism without being taught because your genes know roughly what good food tastes like. You don't have to teach kids to like candy. They like candy because candy tastes sweet and sweet is the taste of sugar and sugar is full of energy.
You don't need to be taught that keeping your energy levels high is good so you should eat sugar because your genes already encoded the want to consume sugar in your brain.</p>
<p>Do humans have mating rituals? There's a question! Do we only like to dance to a catchy tune because it allowed our hunter-gatherer ancestors to assess each other's ability to move?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insects eating each other as a result of mating behaviours is fairly rare. It does occasionally happen in Mantids, as you mentioned, as with spiders. Even then, natural occurrences (not in captivity) are rare. </p>
<p>When they do occur however, it has been shown to be linked (in spiders at least) to the initial personality of the female - if she's a angry fucker and has a size advantage, the male is at serious risk. If they're more evenly matched it often occurs without incident. This personality factor matters for tarantulas too - from what I know of breeding them, the more aggressive and jumpy spiders are harder to breed, specifically because of risk to the male (amongst other things). </p>
<p>As for the evolutionary why, it probably has a lot to do with the fact that post mating, your genes really dont matter much. If you're only going to breed one to two times, it's very very hard for any evolutionary pressure to occur on post mating problems. Problems might appear, like a tendency toward getting cancer, but even if it kills every animal in the group it doesn't matter because they've already wed. If you get better odds for your offspring by offering yourself up as an  hors d'oeuvre, thats more evolutionary meaningful than any remaining aspect of life. </p>
<p>Spiders rarely eat the male, but tarantulas (male) do die very soon after reaching their maximum age, whilst the females continue to live for many years/decades to come. This has the effect of massively skewing the male/female balance of mature spiders in a local population, which benefits the species. More odds of the male encountering a female spider, more odds of males getting have two chances at making baby spiders. It could have something to do with  this as well - artificial one child policy for optimal gender control</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
