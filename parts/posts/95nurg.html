		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good observation!  Most of these lakes are relics of past ice ages.  The Laurentide Ice Sheet sat over most of Canada and the northernmost United States: it pushed the continental crust beneath it downward, and fast-flowing ice streams gouged out channels in the bedrock.  Once the ice sheet melted away, these areas filled with water.  The melting ice sheet also left behind countless lumpy piles of gravel which filled in with water to form the tens of thousands of smaller lakes that cover Minnesota and Canada.</p>
<p>Farther south, where the ice sheet didn't reach, natural lakes are pretty rare.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question! Glaciers are definitely part of the story, but the bedrock is driving their location. Notice that most of the major lakes (except Michigan) are at the boundary between the Precambrian Shield region of NA (all super old igneous and metamorphic rocks) and the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks (sandstones, limestones, and shales). Michigan and Huron follow the outline of the Michigan basin and are where soft Devonian shales were more easily eroded than the rocks above (in the lower peninsula of Michigan) or below (Silurian dolomite that stretches from Door County WI to Niagara Falls).</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a good map showing the relationship between the lakes and rock types/ages: <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/i2781/i2781_c_low.pdf" target="_blank">Tapestry of Time and Terrain (USGS).</a>  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
