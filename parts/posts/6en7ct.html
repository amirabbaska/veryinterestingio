		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered how credit processing fees effect large businesses (and various size businesses).  Here in Oregon we have very large grocery store that does not accept credit cards.  It also seems more and more common for gas stations to have cash prices different from credit prices.  I carry cash for small purchases like a soda from a minimart, but how does it add up for the store owner if I use my credit card for my $1.50 purchases?</p>
<p>So I guess a perspective for my question is how much can a company save (assuming sales are unaffected) if they do not take credit cards?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to address the last part of your request:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how much can a company save if they do not take credit cards?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other commenters have done a great job explaining credit card transaction fees, but the answer to this particular piece of your question is quite subjective and somewhat intangible.  Businesses save money <em>per transaction</em> by accepting only cash - there's no doubt about that.  This is a great business model for your local ice cream parlor, barber shop, or small business where they tailor to a specific community.  Here's the kicker - how many transactions/customers are you losing because you only accept cash?  Many people carry little to no cash in today's digitally-driven world and therefore don't patronize cash-only businesses.  Businesses therefore need to plan accordingly, whether by having cash-specific prices (gas stations), minimum electronic transaction amounts (popular in bars/pubs), or pricing products/services accordingly to cover the expected transaction fees.  Credit card companies have obviously figured this out and have made themselves indispensable, ingraining themselves into the global economy and introducing strategic new products (cash back rewards, frequent flyer miles, etc.) and services (fraud protection, purchase protection, global helpline, etc.).  Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like some others said, 2.5-3% but it's a complicated question because the interchange rate is dependent on a few things (merchant, merchant type, purchase type, amount charged, platform).  </p>
<p>Merchant is just the store that has the credit card terminal.  All of the interchange rates can be negotiated by the merchant. So for example, Walmart has a lot lower fee that your local mom and pop's store since they have a lot of leverage. </p>
<p>Merchant type is grocery store, gas station, retail, etc.  Because of the different margins of those businesses the interchange fee can be different.  </p>
<p>Purchase type is card present, card not present. These are different because fraud rates differ depending on how cards are used.  You can probably guess card not present (online purchases) have a higher fraud rate and thus a higher interchange rate.</p>
<p>Amount charged mattered because in a lot of cases there is a minimum charge of a few cents for each transaction + a percentage of the transaction (e.g. $0.15 + 1.5%).  So small purchases can actually be more costly to a merchant on a percentage basis.</p>
<p>Platform and network is the probably the most important. You have MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express,  for example. And  they all have their own payment systems and fee matrixes. Here is Visa's matrix in PDF. Amex tends to be the most expensive. Furthermore, within each matrix there are different platforms.  For example Visa has (had) Visa Platinum, Visa signature and some others.  The reason they have these is to attract different types of spenders through additional benefits.  Visa signature people tend to spend a lot more than Visa Platinum so the interchange rate is higher.</p>
<p>Anyways this was just an overview. It's a little bit more complicated than this.  I used to be a business analyst for a major credit card company for years so I was just going off the top of my head.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1.5-3% of the transaction is what I pay.  AMEX is the highest and pretty much set by AMEX.  There isn't a lot of negotiation room with them.  Visa and MasterCard have more haggle room with them.   You also pay some additional flat fees.  There is a small swipe fee on some cards + the transaction %. If I hand key in the card number there are additional fees because that is considered a higher risk transaction.   Debit card cost me less since there isn't reward and kick back programs the fees have to cover.
Then there is a batch settle fee.  Whenever you settle your terminal with the cc processor.  Some companies will only do this once a week to save this fee and that is at some transaction will sit on your card as &quot;pending&quot; for so long.  We settle nightly.  Cost a bit more but we get paid faster.</p>
<p>The actually bill I get each month is several pages long and confusing as heck.   So many little charges that really add up. Ra</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A small-medium sized grocery store will do about $40,000 a day, roughly. Assume that about 50% of transactions are with credit cards, so approximately $20,000.</p>
<p>Most CC companies will charge about 2.5%, so about $500.  </p>
<p>This isn't a problem if the average customer spends something like $50+, but if you're heavy on foot traffic and everyone is buying $5 worth of eggs and leaving, that can really cause issues.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, the currency argument becomes a thing. While many webbased businesses don't handle cash or cheques, the personnel cost involved in handling these currencies is lighter on credit card purchases than the other types, so while you do see a cost on many cards, there is also a saved cost due to less cash/cheque handling. </p>
<p>I live in Denmark which for many people outside our country is kind of utopian. We have had to send our cheque system on pension this year and are also currently discussing to allow corporations to reject cash payments. This isn't because we don't like money, but people are simply advancing into card and mobile payments at a scale you don't see elsewhere, which eases the administration required by maintaining a currency cashier position.</p>
<p>So while the cost for card payments are 0-3%, those corporations save the time to run the daily cash to the bank and the time needed to count the days incoming payments/sales. Propably salaries in the amount of an employee on a five year basis.</p>
<p>Also credit cards allow the corporations to dip into sales that would otherwise be postponed because now, people have it in a credit option in their wallet - this increases revenue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
