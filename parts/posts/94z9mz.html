		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They donâ€™t spoil but they do lose flavour, smell and water. If you store honey in fridge, some times you might notice it crystallises. This will happen in room temperature after a couple of years. So the expiration date is really a best by date.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The date is about the integrity of the packaging. It's the same reason water bottles or sterile IV fluids &quot;expire&quot; - the packaging can't be trusted after a certain amount of time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm no honey packager, but it would make the most sense to look at it this way: water doesn't spoil, yet bottled water has an expiration date. That date is for the bottle, after then, it isn't guaranteed to continue to keep that water safe. So, most likely conclusion is that bottled honey is the same way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because expiration date is actually the minimum expiration date, in Germany for example they have to write &quot;mindestens haltbar bis&quot; which directly translated means 'at the minimum keepable until'.</p>
<p>Now about the honey, if you keep you honey dry, cool and in the dark it will probably be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey#Ancient_times" target="_blank"><em>in 5000 years</em></a> by some archeolgist, but if you don't it will spoil, some people even do that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead" target="_blank"><em>on purpose</em></a>! After 5000 years it will however not taste the same, and because the expiration date for honey is defined as how long it will keep specific properties, including taste, companies will print the earliest date it could change in taste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
