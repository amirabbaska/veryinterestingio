		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As long as it doesn't get absorbed by something, then yes, light will continue to travel indefinitely. However, due to the expansion of the universe that light wave will get stretched out along with the space it travels through, becoming lower in frequency and energy. This is why the Cosmic Microwave Background, which began its existence as <del>gamma rays</del> visible light emitted very shortly after the Big Bang, has been reduced down to microwaves after traveling through space for ~13.8 billion years.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/what-is-the-lifetime-of-a-photon/" target="_blank">Depends a bit on the theory, some theories have photons have some mass in which case from the frame of reference of the photon it could decay in about 3 years (which is roughly 10^18 years from our frame of reference)</a>. However if photons do not have mass they do not decay. In that case we only have the expansion of the universe which if it continues on forever slowly increases the photon's wavelength which saps energy from the photon until it's no longer detectable. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's rare because the charasteric lifetime of the excited triplet hyperfine state is so long; IIRC it takes about one million years for your average hydrogen atom to undergo the transition and emit a 21 cm photon. However, because there's a lot of hydrogen in the universe, we see lots of 21 cm emission from HI on large scales. Since the lifetime is so long, the interaction probability between a hydrogen atom and a 21 cm photon is very low, so hydrogen is mostly transparent to 21 cm radiation, further contributing to its visibility.</p>
<p>However, neutral hydrogen is highly opaque to Lyman and Balmer series radiation; it is relatively difficult for ionizing radiation to escape galaxies due to the neutral gas and dust present. The universe as a whole is actually transparent to these wavelengths because the intergalactic gas density is very low and most of that gas is ionized.</p>
<p>As to the original question, the answer is highly dependent on the wavelength of the light, what's in the way, and how much of it there is. Dust is highly opaque to UV and optical light, but virtually transparent to the far IR (coincidentally where cold dust emits most of its radiation). We can see out of the galaxy in the UV and optical only because there isn't very much dust above and below the plane of the galaxy, so it does not completely absorb or scatter the light away. Radio, however, isn't heavily absorbed by much of anything in interstellar space, and can go a very long ways before finally being absorbed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So if we went by the theory that if celestial bodies were not gravitationally bound, and that if they moved far enough away from each other to the point of not being detectable, wouldnâ€™t that mean that the Big Bang could have just been one phenomena of many that has occurred before it, but because it is the only thing we have proof of and we can still detect the light waves from it, that we cling to that as the origin of the known universe? So basically is it possible the Big Bang is not the creation point of the universe, but rather it is just what we call the creation point of the known universe due to the possibility that other celestial bodies outside of that area being just too far away to be detectable?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
