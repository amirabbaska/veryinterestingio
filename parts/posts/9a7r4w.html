		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending upon the lens fStop (how much light it allows in) and focal capabilities (magnification), there are potentially multiple layers of glass, and lots of highly accurate moving parts inside the lens.  Then there is the quality of the construction of the lens and how well it keeps all of the light focused correctly.  When you have a lot of lenses in the path, color separation begins to happen (chromatic abberation).  Manufacturers spend a lot of money on research to minimize abberation, ensure the speed of the mechanism is as fast as possible for both auto-focus machinery as well as the shutter speed. The glass used is also manufactured to different tolerance levels and is more/less clear and accurate in their curvature.</p>
<p>More R&amp;D costs more - more accurate tooling costs more - more pieces and complex construction costs more.</p>
<p>Cheaper lenses have cut costs in manufacturing, or don't have as much spent on R&amp;D.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it is based on how they have to actually make the lens. How many pieces of glass, size, shape etc. of said lenses...and depending on that, the manufacturing costs can be way different. For example, look at the 14-24</p>

<p>Then you also have way different drive motors (speed, noise, precision), different coatings, stabilization, etc </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a designer making cinema lenses, by far the most expensive--the high precision needed is the top reason, second being usability: when a lens is a pain to accurately focus with, for instance, it can add time to each take, and more takes, which is time you have to pay everyone on set for... which means it can be cheaper in the long run to use one $90,000 lens rather than a $1,000 lens that takes more time to use.</p>
<p>On precision: the production runs can be relatively small, with lots of precision parts per lens, and that means that the error rate can be much higher, meaning that to produce 1 lens, you're paying for 3 more that didnt come out right. For a simple re-housing of an old prime lens, which is not including the glass, you're looking at 2 to 3k in machining costs alone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you send light through a svarovski glass, you'll get a rainbow. This effekt is bad for image quality, though manufacturers try to limit this. If you have a camera with multiple lenses alligned, this effect enhances with every lens further.
You need multiple lenses to be able to focus on different distances. This requires the lenses to be moved.
Because the foto is taken in a very short amount of time, it is very difficult to arrange those lenses perfectly while also limiting the rainbow effect (chromatic abberation).
Because the focalquality of lenses and the arrangement for the lenses is so difficult to perfect,these objects are very very different in their quality, because limiting these minor movements and picture quality effects can cause vastly lower prices depending on the quality that is targetet by the manufacturers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
