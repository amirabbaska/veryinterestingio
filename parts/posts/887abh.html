		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Personally I'd argue this is a 'reclassification' rather than a 'discovery'. We've known about the interstitium for a long time. The idea that it should be viewed as an organ it its own right (rather than as part of the organs its found within, or as an extension of the lymphatic system) doesn't make it a new discovery... just a new way of thinking about things. </p>
<p>The media storm sounds very similar to earlier this year when they said we'd 'discovered' the mesentery (basically a tissue structure that attaches to your gut)... again this wasn't the discovery of a new structure... rather a proposal to think of the structure as an 'organ' rather than an extension of the gut. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not like a meaty solid organ like finding a new kidney or liver. This is a network of delicate fluid-filled spaces. </p>
<p>These spaces are <strong>microscopic</strong> in size.  60–70 micrometres (0.0024–0.0028 in). </p>
<p>They were not discovered before because such delicate fluid filled paces are not noticeable on samples and slides because of how <em>microscopic samples</em> are prepared for viewing <em>under a microscope</em>.</p>
<p>They were discovered now because someone went inside a bile duct with an endoscope that had a <strong>microscope</strong> on it, looking at microscopic scale structures <em>in a living tissue not a prepared slide</em> that nobody had ever looked at with a microscope before</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
