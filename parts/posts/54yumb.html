I found that the word liberal doesn't exactly have the same meaning in academic politics. I was stuck on what the difference between classical, keynesian and neo liberalism is. Any help is much appreciated! </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Classical Liberalism</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Political ideology</em> that was started by a 17th century philosopher named John Locke. </li>
<li>Rejected the ideas of hereditary privilege, state religion, absolute monarchy, and the Divine Right of Kings. </li>
<li>Supports civil liberties, political freedom, representative democracy, and economic freedom. </li>
<li>If that sounds familiar to Americans, it's because it's the philosophy that the Founding Fathers used when starting the United States.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keynesian Economics</strong> (I don't think anyone calls it Keynesian liberalism.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Economic theory</em> that was started by 20th century economist John Maynard Keynes. The founder of modern macroeconomics, he is one of the most influential economists of all time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keynes was one of the first to extensively describe the business cycle. When demand is high, businesses grow and grow. More people start businesses in that industry. The economy booms. But then there's a point when too many people start businesses and the supply is too high. Then the weakest companies go out of business. This is called a recession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keynes argued that governments should save money when the economy booms and spend money on supporting people when there is a recession.</p>
</li>
<li>During the Great Depression, his policies became the basis of FDR's New Deal and a bunch of similar programs around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Neoliberalism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Economic theory</em> largely associated with Nobel Prize-winning economists Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supports <em>laissez-faire</em> (meaning <em>let go</em> or <em>hands off</em>) economics. This supports privatization, fiscal austerity, deregulation, free trade, and reductions in government spending in order to enhance the role of the private sector in the economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Friedman argued that the best way to end a recession wasn't to coddle the companies that were failing. Instead it was to let them quickly fail so that the people who worked there could move on to more efficient industries. It would be like ripping off the band-aid, more painful in the short term, but the recession would end quicker and would be better in the long term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He also argued that if everyone acts in their own self interest, the economy would become larger and more efficient. Instead of hoarding their land and money, people would invest in others who are more able to effectively use it. This would lead to lower prices and a better quality of life for everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>Hayek and Friedman are also incredibly influential economists, and their work became the basis of Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and many other prominent politicians' economic strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Classic liberalism is a political ideology, and the other two are economic ideas. All modern democracies are founded on classical liberalism. The other two ideas are both popular economic ideas today. Keynesian ideas tend to be supported by left leaning politicians, and neoliberal ideas tend to be supported by right leaning politicians. Economists debate which one is better in academic journals and bars all the time. Many proponents of both ideas have won Nobel prizes for their work, so there isn't any clear cut winner. Modern day politicians tend to use elements of both theories in their economic strategies. For example, Donald Trump endorses the tax cuts associated with neoliberalism, but opposes free trade.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of other common meanings of these terms, but since you asked for the academic definitions, that's what I stuck with. There are also a lot of related terms such as libertarianism, social liberalism, etc., but since you didn't ask about them, I left them out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Classical liberalism is about philosophy and is deeply rooted in social contract theory. John Locke is widely regarded as the father of Classical Liberalism and many of our founding principles are derived from his work, most notably natural rights to life, liberty, and property, although the concept of property rights was and still is very much debated among liberals and Jefferson replaced property with &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot; in the DOI. Modern libertarians claim to be classical liberals but completely reject the concept of the social contract, which is quite hypocritical since it is the essence of liberalism. Classical Liberalism focuses on rights and has almost nothing to do with economics. </p>
<p>Keynesianism isn't really a form of liberalism, just an economic philosophy based on the work of John Maynard Keynes, who theorized that government spending during economic downturns would fuel demand. His theories were dismissed as nonsense for quite a while until he was later proven to be accurate after the Great Depression when war spending and New Deal policies pulled the economy back together.</p>
<p>Neoliberalism is a political and economic philosophy based on the work of Milton Friedman which focuses on privatization, small government, and a global economy.  It is the prevailing philosophy of both parties, even though they try to hide it in their campaign rhetoric. Bill Clinton declared in his 1996 State of the Union address that &quot;the era of big government is over&quot; and proceeded to cut social programs and deregulate banks. The Democratic Party has been entrenched in neoliberalism ever since and this is the basis of criticism of them by the the progressive left.</p>
<p>Edit: Social Contract Theory a la Rousseau, the foundation of representative democracy:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>
<p>Keynesian Liberalism believes an underactive economy is a market failure, and government intervention is necessary to promote demand and such in an underemployed economy. The Government has a place in the economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neoliberalism, believes too much governmental intervention in the economy leads to a lack of innovation and misaligned incentives that hinders growth.  Get the government out of my economy.</p>
</li>
<li>Classical Liberalism is more focused on economic property rights and does not really concern itself with is the economy working towards its full potential.</li>
