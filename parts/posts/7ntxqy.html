		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some causes are pretty straightforward: hearing loss, developmental disorders, neurological problems, cleft palate, brain injury. However, in a lot of cases the answer is that we just don't know.</p>
<p>My significant other had a serious speech impediment growing up, and when I met him in college he still could not pronounce R and L sounds quite right, but it wasn't very noticeable. I was studying phonetics at the time, so when he asked me how he was pronouncing the letters wrong and how other people pronounced them, I was able to point out the specific way the shape of his mouth was different from normal when he said those letters, and with that information he managed to change how he said R and L so it's unnoticeable (I didn't want him to, I actually really like his voice, but it wasn't up to me). </p>
<p>In his case it's pretty clear that he never learned the proper ways to move your tongue and lips to produce certain letters, but despite years of speech therapy nobody was able to tell him why.</p>
<p>It's an unsatisfactory answer, I know, but we just can't point to a specific cause for most people right now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is dependent on how you hear sounds and the way you were raised. If your family mostly uses trilled R’s then you would have a slightly higher chance of developing it. This is abundant in Asian countries.</p>
<p>A better explanation would be from this video:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SLP here, we usually refer to it as &quot;derhotacism&quot; because when a sound is rhotacized, it has an &quot;r&quot; sound. When you aren't producing the &quot;r&quot; sound, you are de-rhotacizing it. </p>
<p>As others have mentioned, a speech issue may be secondary to another significant condition. You can have physical conditions (like cleft lip or palate) or a neurological condition (like cerebral palsy). Or, the speech impairment may be the only present condition, meaning nothing else explains the articulation or sound difficulty. </p>
<p>In this case, the person may be unable to say &quot;r&quot; for a variety of reasons. One example is when children are young, they frequently naturally say &quot;w&quot; instead. If the parents or other family members think it is cute and encourage it, the child never learns the correct pronunciation and the &quot;w&quot; becomes habit. </p>
<p>The child is usually not tensing the tongue (keeping it too lax) which results in the &quot;uh&quot; sound or is not moving their tongue to the correct place in their mouth (up and backwards in one of several different movements, depending on the person's preference and dialect). Or, that person may move their lips instead of their tongue, making a &quot;w&quot; sound. </p>
<p>It is also possible the child grew up around someone else who cannot say the sound so now that incorrect speech pattern has become part of their speech. In general, the students I have worked with usually struggle to understand how to move only their lips and not their tongue at the same time or struggle with tensing their tongue. This reflects some difficulty with brain-muscle communication that is usually undiagnosed. </p>
<p>Any speech issue should be diagnosed by a speech-language pathologist to discover exactly what the articulation or phonological disorder is and why it is happening. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Special Education teacher here.  Some kids are just not there developmentally.  Speech pathologists will work on these miscues and correct them, but the accountability to fix the sound at home and in the classroom makes a big difference.  I always refer to the speech path for support on correcting speech sounds because if all children ever do is work on it in a specialized setting, he/she won't correct it.   Some kids are of average ability, too.  It's not necessarily a reflection of their cognitive ability.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
