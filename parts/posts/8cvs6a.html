		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just visited the European Astronaut formation centre in Cologne recently and they mentioned cleaning the ISS as a regular, planned activity. Excess dust is hazardous in such environments and the task of cleaning is taken quite seriously.</p>
<p>Don't quote me on it but I remember something like a full day a week goes to cleaning duties.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it was on <del>Skylab</del> Mir where they had some malfunctioning electronics that they were going to fix. When they removed a panel to access where the wires were they found a large ball of water floating there filled with mold or algae or something. It wasn’t that anyone had purposefully dumped out a bunch of water, just that water vapor had condensed there and started an ecosystem.</p>
<p>This led to them being more careful with water recyclers. ISS has machines to condense water vapor out of the air and filter it for reuse. I’m sure they do regular checks for buildup of water or filth in poorly ventilated areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said..filters and vacuum cleaners..</p>
<p>However. I am a scientist who's done some work in the field of space travel and something not usually mentioned is...the smell.</p>
<p>When you pack 6 people in a sealed environment for years...rotating the crews every few months...it gets a little...ripe on-board. </p>
<p>Ive had the smell described as a relatively clean gym with hints of foot-stink in the odd place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, thay are astronauts and cosmonauts.  </p>
<p>Cmdr Chris Hadfield and some other crew membwr explianed ir in one of NASA youtube video that they clean themselves periodicly to cause less dead skin, sweat. And hair loss. They eat food through packages or in liquid form. And what ever leftover floats thay catch it with utensils then eat it too. Deinking water is same. </p>
<p>The dust we know doesnt exist inside ISS. Because there is no soil. Except in lab racks. Which is isolated.
Whatever cargo comes from Earth gets to bo cleaned before launch. As do people. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
