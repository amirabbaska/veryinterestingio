		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a primitive response to danger. Your body releases large amounts of adrenaline and triggers your fight or flight. Everyone will usually feel this in different symptoms. Some people get tingles in their feet, others get a really fast head rush, palpitations, etc. But basically your heart rate will elevate to pump blood to where ever it feels it needs to go in order to help you escape your situation and your breathing quickens to get that good sweet oxygen inside you and even you muscles will tense. </p>
<p>The feelings of dread or impending doom usually come before, not after the attack, and usually have to do with trauma or deep seated fears. Once you've had a triggered response, your brain will interpret other similar responses, and put you in full panic mode. Sometimes it doesn't even need to be that similar to a previous experience, but your brain will just assume it so. Remember that one time you felt sick after eating seafood on that really long car ride? Well now maybe just eating and being in a moving vehicle triggers your anxiety.</p>
<p>It's very common for people who have anxiety to also have obsession disorders, and it's a cyclical thinking that will continuously trigger the attacks. Can't sleep, but you know you need to, makes you anxious. Anxiety than in turn keeps you from sleeping. But you know you need to sleep, big day tomorrow. But you keep thinking about trying to sleep, more anxiety. </p>
<p>There doesn't even need to be external trigger either. There is a lot of evidence for people who are very sensitive and in tune with their bodies to get frequent attacks. There are lots of studies that the gut may have something to do with anxiety attacks. For example, having acid reflux, or bad gut flora. </p>
<p>Mostly though, everyone gets some sort of anxiety at some point in their life. The people that seem to get it the worst, and often enough to be a disorder, seem to be those more sensitive to internal/external factors, and those who have constant obsessive or obtrusive thoughts, in which case it really needs to be taken seriously and the person should be assisted. </p>
<p>EDIT: words. Thank you. </p>
<p>EDIT2: Been through it myself, and done a lot of research. For the people asking what you do in situations like this, people have mentioned them down below; mediation, but mostly just breathing. Focus on your breathing. As hard as it may seem sometimes because you have so much going on in your head, go back to your breathing and continue to focus on it until your body calms itself down. Like I mean really focus on it. Feel it go in and out of your body, take really deep breaths. 4 seconds in and 4 seconds out. It's a life saver.         </p>
<p>EDIT3: Hey everyone, just remember you're not alone in this and it's nothing to be ashamed or scared of. Find something that works for you and make yourself better!   </p>
<p>EDIT 4: Thanks for the reddit gold kind stranger! I hope this post is informative and helping others out!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have described the initial &quot;fight or flight&quot; response. I would just add that as an episode of acute anxiety progresses, you have adrenaline pouring into your system. You breathe faster, and this changes the acid-base balance of your blood. You can break down the physical sensations into a few processes:</p>
<p>-Adrenaline:</p>
<p>*Your muscles tense, getting ready for physical action. You may also notice a &quot;lump&quot; in your throat and tightness in your chest.</p>
<p>*You breathe faster, increasing oxygen flow in anticipation of action. You may feel like you can't breathe or are suffocating.</p>
<p>*You may tremble, sweat, and have pupil dilation</p>
<p>-Fast breathing / changed acid-base balance in your blood (because you rapidly breathe out carbon dioxide):</p>
<p>*You start to feel lightheaded</p>
<p>*You notice tingling, typically first in your hands, feet and lips</p>
<p>*You may feel &quot;dissociative,&quot; like you are &quot;removed&quot; or watching yourself</p>
<p>-Changes in activation of the Vagus nerve (going from your brain through your gut):</p>
<p>*You notice &quot;knots&quot; in your stomach</p>
<p>*In extreme cases, you may pass out (this is quite rare)</p>
<p>There are other signs and symptoms of anxiety. Mindfully recognizing and allowing these sensations to unfold can help nip an anxiety attack in the bud. For further reading, check out Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Russ Harris has written good books about this (The Happiness Trap, The Confidence Gap).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Parts of your brain take in information about your environment, like when you feel a small tickle from something you didn't see or hear a frightening sound, but your brain also stores memories of where you are and the context in which you experienced something. All these factors contribute to your brain reacting, which produces a fear response in a part of your brain known as the amygdala. When this happens, your amygdala sends signals out to other systems of your brain and body, which cause your heart rate to go up, certain hormones like adrenaline to release, and your body temperature to change in preparation for danger. This can happen even if the perceived threat is all in your head. </p>
<p>Usually if you find you're not in danger, you will learn that the cues that made you feel fear and dread are no longer dangerous; it is possible that you do not learn this though, and the fear stays with you anyway for a variety of reasons (for example, trauma). This is how PTSD is believed to work, and is why it feels uncontrollable to people who have it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was young I always wanted to stay on computer and my parents put password on it. Ofc I cracked it and then I was scared shitless that they will find me that I know. So I always played when they were not home but when I heard ringing keys coming to our doors, I automatically turned off power on PC to shut it down instantly. I was always panicked and in rush so now I'm 23 years adult that get's anxiety everytime I'm on PC and someone is opening doors with keys.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The feeling of dread spreading through the body is the sudden release of cortisol/epinephrine (your stress hormones) in response to something you want to avoid. Its your body's way of alerting you shit is about to go down and to get you prepared for survival mode.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
