		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, your body doesn't really measure temperature - it measures a little something known as heat flux.</p>
<p>Heat flux is pretty much the rate at which heat enters or leaves your body. For us, the most comfortable state is when we have a little bit of heat leaving our body. </p>
<p>In all of these cases, heat is moving from the body to the surrounding environment, since your body is always warmer, but the important part here is the rate. Different materials touching have different willingness to transfer heat to each other, as it turns out, water transfers heat easier than air does. The farther the temperatures between the two materials is, the faster the heat transfer will occur as well.</p>
<p>So, 90 degree air is uncomfortable because your body wants to move more heat from your body to the surrounding environment, but water, which conducts heat better, will transfer the heat from your body to it much faster, making it a comfortable feeling.</p>
<p>The opposite is true. 65 degree air pulls quite a bit of heat from you, but still it is within normal comfortable range. Water on the other hand will pull much more heat from you, making it cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is essentially a heater, and in order to be comfortable, it needs to be able to lose some of its heat.</p>
<p>Water is much better at transporting heat away from your body than air, so if it's a little colder than your internal body temperature, you feel fine. If it's significantly colder, you lose too much heat.</p>
<p>Air is not very good at transporting heat, so the temperature difference between the body and the air needs to be larger. If it isn't large enough, there's no way to get rid of the excess body heat without sweating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat your oven up to 300 degrees and put your hand inside the middle of the over for a second. It will feel hot, but you will be fine.</p>
<p>Now heat a pot of water up to 140 degrees and put your finger in for a second. Whoa! Better take it out quick before you get burned!</p>
<p>Air is really bad at conducting temperature. Air is kind of like an insulating blanket that the heat or cold has to move through slowly.</p>
<p>Water is really good at conducting temperature. It's like removing the blanket of air and putting the fire or ice directly on your skin.</p>
<p>When it comes to weather and feeling comfortable, you have to realize that the body's default temperature is around 98 degrees, and it always strives to maintain that temperature.</p>
<p>If you are in a 65 degree environment, that temperature is held in the air, and is slowly applied to your body. If your body is burning fuel (food), and if you are wearing clothes and have a decent metabolism, you should be able to maintain a temperature of 98 degrees pretty easily, since the slow cooling effect is roughly equal to how much excess heat your body is generating.</p>
<p>65 degree water, on the other hand, has a much more rapid effect on your body's temperature. Temperatures get transferred very quickly in water!</p>
<p>If your metabolism is trying to keep your body at 98 degrees, but you are in 65 degree water, that difference in temperature starts to quickly become a problem. As time goes on, the water starts to cool down your body, and your metabolism simply can't keep up! The reason why it feels uncomfortable is because your body is warning you that you are in danger!</p>
<p>The key to keep in mind is that your body is essentially a furnace that is generating excess heat, and to keep it at 98 degrees, you need to find ways to cool it down. If the air is cool, this is easy. If the air is hot, then you sweat, and the evaporation of the sweat cools you off. This enables you to survive hot temperatures for a lot longer than you would otherwise normally be able to. Your body also has a limited ability to scale your metabolism up or down, burning more fuel when cold, and less when hot.</p>
<p>Sweating can only introduce temperature change so fast, though. This means that in 90 degree weather, it's easy for your body to overheat past 98 degrees (and sweat won't provide enough cooling effect to maintain your core temperature). That's why 90 degree weather feels so uncomfortable. Air isn't fast enough at moving the temperature build-up away from your body, and you may overheat.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are in 90 degree water, you are immersed in something that is very good at rapidly conducting temperature. Additionally, the temperature is less than your body's core temperature (but relatively close to it). This means that the pool of water is able to cool your body down at about the same rate that your body is generating excess heat. When you are in such an environment, you will feel comfortable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
