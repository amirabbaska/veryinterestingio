		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long story short: because of water-rock interaction.</p>
<p>There are two main pathways where the water cycle has opportunity for chemical exchanges with large volumes of rocks:</p>
<p>1) - <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/graphics/watercycle-usgs-poster.jpg" target="_blank">At the surface of the continental crust, where the flow of water in rivers, lakes and aquifers allows to evacuate ions dissolved as water interacts with rocks in conditions conducive to chemical weathering</a>. These ions travel downstream to the oceanic reservoir, where they concentrate.</p>
<p>2) - <a href="http://jgs.lyellcollection.org/content/jgs/174/6/954/F3.large.jpg" target="_blank">In the ocean floor, where ocean water infiltrates in pore space, fractures and faults. Given the relative thinness of oceanic crust and the higher geothermal gradient, the water heats up at depth to temperatures of 200^^o to 300^^o and and interacts strongly with minerals in the oceanic lithosphere</a>. In particular, these interactions contribute to the alteration of mafic minerals into clays and serpentines. These mineral-laden hot brines eventually reach a state where their density is less than that of fresh seawater, and buoyancy channels the flow upwards towards areas of discharge on the ocean floor, where they emerge in focussed flow, notably in black smokers and other hydrothermal systems. They then disperse and mix in the ocean, further increasing the amount of solutes in the seawater.</p>
<p>Assemblages of solutes in the water emerging from these two pathways are somewhat different, surface waters for instance have very large volumes but low concentrations, while the brines emerging from deep sea vents are smaller volumes, but with concentrations of salts reaching three times that of seawater. The combination of these two processes is responsable for the amount and composition of salts observed in our oceans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Freshwater falls on the land as rain.  It flows to the sea, dissolving minerals as it travels, including salt.  When it gets to the sea and ends up evaporating back into rain, it leaves the dissolved minerals behind.  This cycle repeats for billions of years.  Growing and shrinking ice caps will affect the salinity of the sea, but it will generally become saltier and saltier from the cycle of runoff over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All water that flows to the seas/oceans contains minerals (salt) from rocks and such. The only way water can leave the ocean is by evaporation. The salt does not evaporate, thus getting left with a more salty water. Over a very long time you end up with a salty body of water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something that hasn’t been mentioned here are terminal lakes that are part of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorheic_basin" target="_blank">Endorheic Basin</a> or watershed, like the Great Salt Lake within the United State’s Great Basin.  These type of systems can amplify the salt concentration in the lake due to them being completely cut off from other water systems and quite often in a desert climate.  </p>
<p>But as others have said, as the fresh water lands within the water system’s reach, the rain will collect minerals from the soil and rocks, flow down rivers, lakes and streams, until it arrives at the ocean or terminal lake. The salt concentration will be fairly low in the rivers and streams; however, as the water collects in a terminal lake or the ocean, the concentration increases. Add to that evaporation of water from the lake and ocean, while the minerals remain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All freshwater bodies have rivers to drain them of salt. The salt is just a conglomerate of nutrients from the water runoff that has drained into them. Since the ocean cannot drain anywhere it is forced to carry the nutrients or &quot;salt&quot; from all the runoff in the world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
