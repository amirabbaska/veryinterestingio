		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern day humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Our ancestor apes must have had 24 pairs of chromosomes. Meaning that a mother with 24 chromosome gave birth to a 23 chromosome child. How did this 23 chromosome ape breed with its 24 chromosome pair species? Wouldn't their child have 47 chromosomes meaning its sterile?
Edit: not anti-evolution, just curious
Edit 2: thanks for the great responses guys! Gonna read all of them</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What /u/xalteox has told you is accurate for most situations and it is true for our relation to apes. Our human chromosome 2 is the result of merged chromosomes from them, complete with a vestigial centromere. Chromosomes are just disorganized filing cabinets, as long as the information is there, nothing should be amiss (although some expression patterns would likely be different, but any noticeable difference is rare).</p>
<p>As to how this could propagate in a population (not /u/Xalteox's condition necessarily but just a reduction in chromosome number in general), it's not that complex really. Genes can be duplicated or missed during replication or mutation, but what happens if a centromere is duplicated? Now you have 3 centromeres that will be pulled by microtubules to the ends of the cell, but what if the one with 2 centromeres is broken in two? Let's say the full chromosome has genes A,B on the short end and C,D,E on the long end. If it is broken in two, you now have A,B on one end and C,D,E on the other, and A,B,C,D,E in the other chromosome. The cell is actually pretty stupid, so it just randomly pulls centromeres in either direction, and if one side gets AB and CDE and the other gets ABCDE then everything is good because each daughter cell has the appropriate information. This 2 chromosomal variant can propagate, it just has a handicap. This handicap being, that just as often one side would get AB and the other CDE and ABCDE, leading to gametes with many chromosomal errors. The result (which may or may not be the case for /u/Xalteox) is reduced fertility by virtue of gametes that don't quite make it due to these matching errors. Eventually, if enough people mated and spread this 2 chromosome variant, it becomes the norm in the population; this happens mostly by drift, since there usually isn't any benefit that would correlate to natural selection.</p>
<p>This also happens in reverse, in the situation you're asking about. if two separate chromosomes (like the ancient ape ones) merge and form human chromosome 2, this fused variant can spread in the population in a similar way, so long as the accounting is accurate and each daughter has the same amount of information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>The early human ancestors likely did not have 23 chromosome pairs. It's very likely that they had 24. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even when the chromosome number changes, this doesn't automatically make the two species biologically incompatible.
Similarly, having the same chromosome number does not convey biological compatibility. Wheat has the same number of chromosomes as a rhesus monkey. </p>
</li>
<li>Even in the odd case that one of your parents is a mutant that's going to create offspring of a completely incompatible nature, you can still breed with siblings in many cases. If you're a mutant who's biologically incompatible with everything, your line dies out. This has probably happened about a billion times or more throughout evolutionary history.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only mutations that are carried forward are the ones that CAN be carried forward. Fortunately, most of the time, a duplication or deletion is not that big of a deal. Millions of people have transcription, duplication, or deletion errors in their DNA and are living examples of first-generation mutations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Awesome question! As it happens chromosomal rearrangements (called karyotype changes) are actually pretty prevalent in evolution when one lineage branches into two. I drew you a very simple figure to answer your question in this case. If you'd like some more detail or are confused about any of it, respond to this comment and I'll go into more detail! <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RqUo54Z.png" target="_blank">Imgur</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This article actually covers a man with 44 chromosomes today, which explains how it might have happened that humans moved from the 48 Chimpanzees/Gorillas have to 46.  (My understanding is Chromosome 2 is composed of parts of 2 chromosomes from a common ancestor).</p>
