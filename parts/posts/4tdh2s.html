		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern day humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Our ancestor apes must have had 24 pairs of chromosomes. Meaning that a mother with 24 chromosome gave birth to a 23 chromosome child. How did this 23 chromosome ape breed with its 24 chromosome pair species? Wouldn't their child have 47 chromosomes meaning its sterile?
Edit: not anti-evolution, just curious
