		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, two days ago, I was a happy healthy guy who could lift 50 pound bags of cat litter, run (literally) a few blocks down to the corner store, and leap out of bed in the morning when I wake up. I now have a cold. Coughing, sneezing, phlegm, headache, etc. I am also very weak and can barely walk my body across the room. What specifically is causing this? Are all the body's resources tied up in fighting the virus or has the virus itself actually somehow made my muscles weak?</p>
<p>In a week or so, I'll be better and back to normal, but it's weird how even though my muscles have not had time to deteriorate due to lack of use, it seems like they're only one third there.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Specifically, the cause of the crummy feeling is due to your innate immune system cells, like macrophages, detecting foreign materials and releasing cytokines to call attention from more and more immune cells (this starts the inflammation response).  Some types of cytokines are specifically responsible for triggering the brain to make you sleepy, sore, and have a fever.  Here's a great little video with a little more detail:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gVdY9KXF_Sg" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/gVdY9KXF_Sg</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fatigue is likely caused by fever. In response to an infection with a cold-causing virus, your immune cells begin to secrete cytokines that cause both localized inflammation and a full-fledged immune response from the rest of the body. Chemokines like Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 are considered major endogenous (meaning they are produced by your own body) pyrogens (molecules that cause fever). </p>
<p>In addition, other endogenous molecules are also produced that aid in inducing a fever. IL-1 and IL-6 can both activate the <a href="http://www.cvphysiology.com/Blood%20Flow/BF013" target="_blank">arachidonic acid pathway</a>, which ends in the synthesis of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 is a major regulator of the febrile response and acts on the hypothalamus and other areas of the brain, which induces shivering to create heat, constriction of blood vessels to prevent heat loss, and can also cause the release of adrenaline. </p>
<p>The virus itself can cause tissue damage, which further exacerbates inflammation in the area of the infection. Not all viruses that cause colds replicate through the same mechanism: some are lytic and others are lysogenic. Lytic viruses like rhinoviruses rupture cells once the infected cell reaches its burst size. The insides of the cell can trigger inflammatory signals from neighboring cells as well, further exacerbating the immune response. Lysogenic viruses such as coronaviruses tend to bud or undergo exocytosis from cells, and the immune response to these is somewhat dampened by the lack of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that would trigger inflammation from nearby cells.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, from what I can find it's not totally clear what it is about fever or inflammation that causes lethargy, though I would speculate it likely has to do with the modulation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system" target="_blank">autonomic nervous system</a> by prostaglandins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cells that have been hijacked by the virus no longer perform normally but instead dedicate themselves to replicating the virus. To add to this, when the virus emerges, these cell of yours lyse and are destroyed. Your immune system goes into overdrive, not only having to identify and destroy virus, but having to clean up your lysed cells and heal those areas. Your raw throat and nasal passages are due to those destroyed cells, and the swelling compounded by the inflammatory response. This is tiring.</p>
<p>I can't back up my next theory with any literature, but my guess about the muscle weakness (in part) is that the glucose that is normally used in your muscles is instead being utilized to fight the infection. Maybe someone else can comment on that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short everything you feel from a cold is not actually caused by the virus. It's caused by your bodies response to the virus. Your body increases swelling and inflamation to the part of the body effected due to increased blood supply to those areas. This causes pain. Your body is using large amounts of resources in terms of energy to fuel the immune response which causes fatigue. </p>
<p>This is why people who have allergies display the same symptoms as colds. The pathogens are benign but your bodies immune response causes you to feel ill.</p>
<p>Some have even theorized fatigue and pain may be an evolutionary response in order to get you to rest so your body can use as much energy as possible to fight off the infection. </p>

<p>It concludes that fever and sickness behaviour are likely to have evolved to protect organisms and improve outcomes.</p>
<p>It now appears that there may be specialised processes in the brain that detect elevated levels of cytokines and then trigger the subsequent full range of effects that sickness can have on a personâ€™s subjective experience and behaviour:</p>
<p>Fever
Increased sleep and general lethargy
Loss of interest or motivation for usual activities
Increased pain sensation
Reduced appetite
Depressed mood
Decreased social interaction
Impaired concentration</p>
