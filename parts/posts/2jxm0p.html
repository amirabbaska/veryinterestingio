		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading about it in an article here.  <a href="http://www.wbur.org/npr/120391729" target="_blank">http://www.wbur.org/npr/120391729</a></p>
<p>&quot;GROSS: Give us an example of an industry in which there's been a lot of private equity buys, and the industry, the whole industry in a way, has been squeezed with a lot of layoffs and cuts within what the business does.</p>
<p>Mr. KOSMAN: Sure. An easy example is the mattress industry. Private equity firms bought Sealy and Simmons about a decade ago - actually, it's 2009, so let's say 15, 18 years ago - and then they bought and sold them between each other, but buyout firms acquired, or private equity firms - and private equity firms, by the way, I should also note, these are the same guys who were the leveraged buyout kings of the 1980s, the exact same people often, but when leveraged buyouts got a bad name, when Michael Milken went to jail, when movies like &quot;Wall Street&quot; were made, they underwent a marketing change and very cleverly started calling themselves private equity firms, but they're one and the same.</p>
<p>In the mattress industry, private equity firms bought Sealy and Simmons, the number one and number two brands by a mile. They stopped really competing against each other. They cut costs, and they raised the prices of the mattresses. They started focusing only on the top end and stopped even making mattresses really for middle-income people that cost less than $1,000. So basically simplifying this over time, as they bought Simmons and sold it to another PE firm three or four years later, and same with Sealy, the buyers -the sellers would make a lot of money, and the buyers felt, well, we can keep raising prices because there's no competition. We own Sealy, and we own Simmons. It's different firms, but they both have the same aim: to make a short-term profit, not to beat each other up on price. What happened over time was they couldn't raise the prices anymore, and the prices were raised double the price of inflation, double the rate of inflation. They cut the beds in half, so you came up with no-flip mattresses. That cut their manufacturing costs, but it also...</p>
<p>GROSS: Wait, wait, let's explain for a second.</p>
<p>Mr. KOSMAN: Sure.</p>
<p>GROSS: I thought great, no-flip mattresses, you don't have to go through the work of flipping it, and the bed's kind of extra-good, so you don't have to flip it, but there's another reason why you don't have to flip it.</p>
<p>(Soundbite of laughter)</p>
<p>Mr. KOSMAN: That's right. Initially, they made the mattresses thick. They kept putting - creating thicker and thicker mattresses so they had an excuse to keep raising and raising the prices. So they thought, both Sealy and Simmons both had the same thought. The private equity firms that owned them both thought, well, why don't we cut costs significantly and cut the beds in half and introduce these no-flip mattresses.</p>
<p>Simmons did it first, early this decade. Sealy stood back. Sealy even made a statement when Simmons did it, saying we would never offer a no-flip mattress. That's why you should buy our mattresses. Simmons's sales didn't rise, but their earnings went through the roof. The private equity firm that owned Sealy at the time, which was Bain Capital - the same firm that Mitt Romney owned during that period, the Republican presidential candidate - decided okay, well, we'll change tack. You know, even though our market share is growing, their earnings are going through the roof, and that's what we care about. So then they introduced no-flip mattresses, and now and for the last six or seven years, Sealy and Simmons only offer no-flip. There are no two-sided beds anymore.</p>
<p>GROSS: But are their no-flips any better or worse than the two-sided ones?</p>
<p>Mr. KOSMAN: Well, they certainly have less of a life. You can't flip them, so just like a tire, you know, when you rotate your tire, you know, beds that used to last 15, 20 years on average - and those were Sealy and Simmons beds - now these beds last six, seven years. So it's a much cheaper bed. And what ended up happening in the middle of this decade is Tempur-Pedic came out of nowhere. And Tempur-Pedic offered a very nice sleep on a - I guess they call it, you know, it's those foam beds, and those mattresses, on the high end, which is all that Sealy and Simmons at this point were now competing in, they started to really outsell Sealy and Simmons. And that puts - and then Sealy - for Sealy and Simmons, not only were they losing market share, now their earnings were starting to fall.</p>
<p>GROSS: What's the state of Sealy and Simmons now?</p>
<p>Mr. KOSMAN: Now they're both in a really tough state. Simmons just got bought by - went bankrupt, and it got bought by Serta. So that means Simmons, a company that's been around for more than 100 years, doesn't exist anymore. A quarter of their employees were laid off in the last year, and now - I shouldn't say - the private equity firm that owned Serta bought them and says they'll keep them independent, but that's a little hard to buy.</p>
<p>As far as Sealy, they were veering towards bankruptcy, and their private equity owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, put in some more money in the company to keep it going, but Sealy is also having some problems, though they're probably a step above where Simmons is.</p>
<p>If you look at it historically, though, Sealy's market share around 1990, when the first buyout of Sealy happened, was about 28 percent. Today, they're at about 20 percent. So I certainly believe that private equity firms, you know, from the time of 1990 through today, have not done Sealy any favors, although those private equity firms, by buying and selling Sealy to each other, have generally made huge profits but in the process have hurt the business. &quot;</p>
<p>edit: sorry just realized it was ELI5.  Basically private equity firms bought up all the top mattress manufacturers and stopped competing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mattress developer here.
I have been in the mattress business as a manufacturing engineer/product developer for several years now.  We should first differential two categories for when it comes to manufacturing mattresses.</p>
<p>1) Foam mattresses (very complicated industry; I explain this one in another post)
2) Spring core mattresses</p>
<p>Spring core makes up the bulk of the industry.  The sad news is, whether you buy a really cheap $200 mattress or a high end $1500 mattress, it cost the same to make it.  The materials for mattress manufacturing are cheap.  And I mean CHEAP!!!  The total cost to produce is in the ball park of $75-150, depending on the spring count and finished fabric that is being used.  The low manufacturing cost allows companies to be more flexible with how much they wish to charge for their product.  </p>
<p>For example, unknown brands (where mixing and matching is common practice), the mattress can be sold for next to nothing.  The profit margins are very low, the marketing cost is $0, and there is a consumer base that will purchase a $200 mattress and be okay with replace it every 3-5 years.  In many cases the mattresses are unlabelled well known brands that the manufacturer needs to get rid of from their inventory.  Some sellers is okay with making $50 a mattress because they can find ways to capitalize on the accessories that they will push off at multiple times their cost.</p>
<p>Now, knowing that all spring mattresses cost very little (75-150) to produce, big brands such as Sealy and Simmons will sell their product at a much higher price tag because they have a marketing overhead.  Many mattress manufacturers want to include literature, advertizements, and promotions to claim that they are &quot;better&quot; so to speak.  Marketing costs a lot of money and that cost is then pushed off to the distributer and then to the customer.  his is why some spring mattresses will cost you $1500 and up.  But I want you all to know one little secret.  Most mattress manufacturers whole sale they goods with a 25-30% margin.  That means, the mattress that cost $100 to produce was sold to a distributor for $125-130.  The distributor will then push it to a store for the same profit gain.  Now we are at $170-ish.  Somewhere along the lines, someone will endure some serious marketing expenses.  At this point the store will push that off to the customer at $1000.  This is where you, as the consumer, have TONS of space to haggle.  This is why stores can afford to give you 40% off, free pillows, and local delivery included, because they made their money.</p>
<p>The reality is, the big brand quality is better only by a fraction.  They use a better finishing fabric, higher density materials for the quilted top, edge-to-edge springs rather than spring cores with foam edging, and such. In the end, the amout of profit made off of a mattress huge.</p>
<p>My advice is, anytime you buy a mattress, haggle your butts off because they can, and most likely will, give you a better deal than advertized.  Its worth the effort and time put into it.  Just know, almost all the mattresses sold cost roughly the same to make.  Some cost much more because big brands will spend the money to market, while smaller and uknown brands will not.</p>
<p>(i would like to explain how the foam mattress industry functions as well, but it would be too much info for a single post.  Foam mattresses is a lucrative business overall). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) They last for around a decade. The per-day use price is very low.</p>
<p>2) It's one of the highest profit margins in the furniture industry.</p>
<p>3) It's impossible to comparison shop. The manufacturer's can, and often do, &quot;label&quot; the exact same bed with a different cover and name for two stores in the same market area.</p>
<p>4) The used market is practically non-existent. It's like selling your used underwear. Nobody wants your filth. So everyone buys new every time.</p>
<p>5) There are only a handful of suppliers for the basic ingredients for a mattress. Legget &amp; Platt, for example, supply almost all the metal involved for the approximately 1,000 U.S. mattress companies. Latex is made by two major companies. </p>
<p>6) Consumers buy when they need, not when they want. This makes a mattress set more of a last minute purchase, than say a car.</p>
<p>7) There are limited sources online to understand the build of a mattress. Therefore consumers have no idea what they are sleeping on. Most people could not imagine a visual of what it would look like if they sliced their bed open.</p>
<p>Source: I owned a 6,000 sq. ft. mattress store for several years. </p>
<p>Edit: Well, this blew up. Thanks for the Gold! I've tried to answer as many of you as I could. I guess I need to do the &quot;Mattress Guy AMA&quot; you all requested. Keep an eye out for it soon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former mattress salesman here.</p>
<p>It's all about the sale. Mattress salesmen range in technique and method from selling the science of sleep to selling comfort to selling name brands, but what it comes down to is this: you're investing in something you don't want to have to replace in short order. Sleep science techniques tell you about the negative effect of a poor sleep surface, comfort techniques is exactly what's written on the can, and brand techniques try to build the value of long standing companies (like Stearns and Foster or Sealy.)</p>
<p>Replacing mattresses is not something anyone wants to ever do. It's no fun or flashy. A big part of the upsell to higher ticket items is the idea that since you are going to sleeping on this thing for the eight to ten years, you want to make the best investment.</p>
<p>For the uninformed, mattress sales are as cut throat and competitive as car sales. If you're willing to do the footwork and a little research, that 1599.99 queen set that's on sale for 1299.99 can be had for under $1000 out the door, with all kinds of little bonuses like bedframes, pillows, and mattress pads.</p>
<p>Also: regarding mattress pads. They are sold with the idea that it will protect your warranty in the event of -ahem- stains on the mattress. This is utter bullshit. Mattresses warranties are against manufacturing flaws. You'll know if it was put together wrong in the first couple days. Normal wear and tear is never covered. The high-dollar mattress pad is only a good investment if the person sleeping in the bed is prone to something that will soil the mattress (ie incontinent adults or bedwetting children)).</p>
<p>Some terms used to hike up the price of mattresses:</p>
<p>Viscoelastic foam, memory foam, latex foam all basically mean a higher grade of padding package. It's a personal preference deal. It does nothing for back support.</p>
<p>Pillowtop, plushtop, firm top, extra firm top are all comfort preferences. It's all in the padding package. Makes no difference on durability or back support. That rock hard mattress won't support your back any better than the same mattress with a pillowtop, nor will that pillowtop wreck your back because it isn't &quot;firm&quot; enough. The coils ( or foam or water or air) under the padding is what will support you.</p>
<p>Pocket coils are the only spring mattress design in common use that isn't a Bonnell coil derivative. They are marketed as stopping motion in the bed, which they do pretty well. Whether it does this well enough to warrant a 20%-50% price increase over a Bonnell bed with similar padding package is left to the consumer.</p>
<p>Water beds, all foam mattresses and air beds all variants on the same concept of eliminating metal springs. They don't do anything special beyond change the comfort and feel. If you like the feel go for it, but don't expect a Tempurpedic to suddenly cure your back pain. If your back feels better after swapping to a gimmick bed, it's likely because your old bed was worn out and wrecked.</p>
<p>To summarize, there is a great deal of upselling and value-building to make the buyer happier with their purchase that makes no difference in terms of real benefit. It's mostly smoke. Best advice is to find a bed type you like, get the entry level of that style with no pillowtop and add your own comfort layers to make it more comfortable to you. it'll be less expensive in both long and short terms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bed makers have exploited a few competition thwarting techniques over the years to great effect. Most commonly, every bed is specific to the seller preventing comparison shopping.  If you go to Sears looking for a Sealy you'll find three or four &quot;models&quot; there. If you go to JC Penny, they will have two or three models as well, but the NAMES of the models will never be the same. The result to the consumer is an inability to go from one retailer to another and compare prices. You may find a few smaller stores with a model or two in common, but never enough to price shop effectively. Since the model is changed by merely sewing on different name tags, it's a very easy and inexpensive technique for the manufacturer. </p>
<p>TL;DR price shopping is mostly impossible due to labeling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
