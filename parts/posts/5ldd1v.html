		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The association of human emotions with internal organs come from antiquity-- the spleen is the source of malice (hence the dual meanings of &quot;bile&quot; and the term &quot;splenetic&quot; for an angry man) and the liver the source of cowardice (&quot;lily livered&quot;)</p>
<p>The heart is identified with love, and with courage, probably because people noticed that your heart beats fast in either instance. No matter what your emotion, you don't feel anything in your brain, but you do &quot;feel&quot; fear in your guts etc . . . so for a long time people associated these organs with feelings.</p>
<p>The abstract and simple version of the heart is likely Christian in origin-- this particular simplified shape is the symbol used in the Catholic Devotion of the Sacred Heart</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human hearts can have significant differences in exterior morphology, but if you google images online - they mostly have a pointed lower end with two slightly bulbous areas on either side at the top with the left and right atria. That, along with the color red, isn't too far-fetched for a crude symbol.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From Wikipedia on Silphium.  </p>
<p>There has been some speculation about the connection between silphium and the traditional heart shape  Silver coins from Cyrene of the 6–5th century BCE bear a similar design, sometimes accompanied by a silphium plant and understood to represent its seed or seed pod.  </p>
<p>Silphium is a now extinct plant that was important in antiquity and was probably used as a contraceptive.  Other sources say that the romans harvested it into extinction for its contraceptive properties.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the subject of the heart shape, nobody really knows the origin. There are all kinds of theories as to where that came from. Perhaps somebody could expand on that, though, if they know anything more. On the relation to love, back in ancient times, specifically Egypt, the heart was thought of as the center of all emotion and reasoning. Since the heart is connected to all the various body parts using channels, they assumed that the heart must be what controls the body. You could assume how love came to be from this, considering love is an emotion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is actually a very old symbol dating back to at least the 14th century. We don't know why the shape looks like that and all the ideas are from modern times. It varies between the heart looks like sex organs (a butt or two breast, or two testicle, or a vulva), that the symbol looks like the seed of a plant that is now extinct, but used as a contraceptive which associated it with love and sex, or that the heart is an artist's interpretation of the human heart and it was described to the artist badly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
