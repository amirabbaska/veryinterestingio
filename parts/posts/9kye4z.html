		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question! Have you ever watched how a dog swims? It is very similar to how they walk.. if you throw a human into water they too would flap their arms around and try and keep their heads above water. It is just extremely tiring.. the main issue arises from panic when a human panics all logic goes out the window and we sink. Animals on the other hand try doing what they always do. Elephants try walking, dogs try walking, etc.</p>
<p>If you throw a chimpanzee in the water (do not do this) they will drown.. or likely they will panic and try and keep afloat until they tire and drown (I repeat do not actually throw a chimpanzee in the water) but chimpanzees can learn to swim by copying others if they spend enough time around animals.
The same is true for gorillas.
<em>Do not throw gorillas into pools lakes or the ocean.</em></p>
<p>Edit: it's spelt panic not panick.</p>
<p>Edit edit: spelt in the original edit is used correctly. Both spelled and spelt are correct depending on where you are from in the world. But I feel like the core message should be do not throw bipedal creatures into bodies of water without prior affirmative consent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Swimming isn't particularly easy for bipeds (without practice), it's very dissimilar to our normal walk cycle (unlike a dog/cat/horse/etc.). All great apes have this problem but many <em>have</em> been observed swimming, contrary to popular belief. Some even enjoy it.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_swimming" target="_blank">Although humans do have a basic diving reflex</a> it's a bit disingenuous to call it &quot;swimming&quot; because babies obvious can't resurface and tread water with this reflex alone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't. Ever see those videos of babies swimming? It's pretty cool. </p>
<p>Since babies spend their entire time floating in fluid while they develope, they instinctively know how to move in water and not to breathe it in. </p>
<p>The only thing is you have to do it while they're very young. Which probably seems scary for most parents. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
