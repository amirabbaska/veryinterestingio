		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly the universe is either finite or infinite, we don't know which.</p>
<p>If it's finite it either has borders or it doesn't, we don't know which.</p>
<p>You're assuming it has no borders. Meaning either it is infinite or it is finite but a closed loop. In other words the 3d shape of the universe curves through 4d space so that while the amount of space might be finite there is no edge.</p>
<p>If the universe is infinite then an object travelling forever in linear motion will just keep on getting further away.</p>
<p>If the universe is finite but unbounded then an object travelling forever in linear motion might eventually arrive back at its initial spot but it depends on the topography. You might end up three feet to your initial left and draw out an infinite but never-repeating spiral. There are lots of ways <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/WhatIs/Infinity/Length-Area.shtml" target="_blank">to have an infinite curve on a finite plane</a></p>
<p>If the universe is finite and unbounded and topographically simple enough then yes object travelling forever in linear motion might eventually arrive back at its initial spot but the object might not have enough time to do so. Even if the object is a photon it can only travel at the speed of light and the distance it has to travel is unknown but has to be at least many hundreds of billions of light years. And it is not guaranteed that the universe will last hundreds of billions of years.</p>
<p>If the universe is finite and unbounded then the universe will probably end in a big crunch. How long this takes depends how big the universe is, but either way there probably isn't time to do a lap.</p>
<p>There's some theories that suggest that if there's enough dark energy in the universe then even if the universe is finite and unbounded the big crunch can still be avoided. So then we're racing against heat death. If the object is anything other than a photon it will decay within 10^100 years which might be enough time to do a lap of a small universe but nothing big, and even if its a photon it will decay (be annihilated) eventually.</p>
<p>Tl:dr depends how big and bendy your universe is but probably not.</p>
<p>Edits:</p>
<ul>
<li>thanks for gold</li>
<li>yes I meant topology, although I'm not 100% convinced that my usage of topography was totally wrong</li>
<li>I cheated/simplified a little by folding in the whole factor of if the universe is expanding and at what rate into the question of its infiniteness/shape but this doesn't make any substantive difference I can see to the answer to the question</li>
<li>Yes the universe probably is flat, and infinite/expanding so fast it is effectively infinite. But if that is the case then ops question becomes boring and trivial, so I'd rather explore some of the more interesting possibilities.</li>
<li>Thanks for all the comments, sorry I didn't reply to all of them but I tried to reply to most that weren't repeats. If I didn't reply to you it either means I missed you, I answered someone who was saying something similar, or your question had me so stumped I couldn't think of an answer.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a two-dimensional creature living in what it can only sense is a two-dimensional physical universe. What it cannot comprehend is that it actually lives on the surface of a massive three-dimensional sphere. It can never get to the center of its universe because the center is straight down, and up-and-down is a third physical dimension, one of which it is unable to comprehend because of its flat, two-dimensional nature. So, if it travels in a straight line (a great circle), it will return to the point of origin. And its universe is expanding, like a balloon blowing up. </p>
<p>I imagine the same is true of our universe, only with one extra dimension. We are three-dimensional beings living on the surface of a four+ dimensional universe (physicists posit that there are ten physical dimensions, but I have a hard time grokking it). So, if we travel in space in a single direction, we would also end up right back at Earth. And our universe is expanding with the center of expansion being along a dimension(s) of which we cannot conceive.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus mindfuck:</strong> As the two-dimensional creature's universe expands, the surface area of its universe increases. Each point on the sphere moves away from every other point on the sphere. New 2D space is created as the sphere expands. The same is true for our universe; as our three-dimensional universe expands, every point in space moves away from every other point, and new space is constantly being created.</p>
<p><strong>Super Bonus Mindfuck X-treme:</strong> &quot;Now&quot;...what you conceive of as the present moment...the center of your consciousness...is new time being created by the expansion of the universe in a similar way to how new space is being created.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If all we knew about the universe was that it has no boundaries, it would be impossible to answer your question. Maybe an object would return to its original starting place (if the universe is sufficiently small and doughnut or sphere like) or it would continue forever (if the universe is infinite).</p>
<p>But we do know more. Below I try to outline the logic best I can based on the evidence we have.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">We know, for example, that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate.</a> So a star 90 billion lightyears away from us today will be further away in the future. </p>
<p>We also know the universe is a finite age: about 13.8 billion years. So a finite age, combined with a fixed speed of light means the universe <em>we can see</em> is definitely finite. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">It's the part of the universe from which light has had time to reach us in the last 13.8 billion years.</a> Since a point that was 13.8 billion lightyears away from us is now further away, due to expansion, the observable universe is wider than 13.8 billion lightyears. It's actually a sphere about 93 billion lightyears in diameter. </p>
<p>Finally, we know that, as best as we can measure, the curvature of space (as a <em>slice</em> of <em>spacetime</em>) is flat. Spacetime as a whole is curved, but a slice of space at a given time, on average over the whole universe that we can see is not. This tells us that the universe can have three shapes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Infinite and flat</li>
<li>The three-dimensional version of a doughnut, which can be flat (weirdly enough).</li>
<li>The three-dimensional version of a sphere, but <em>really</em> huge so that it looks flat to us. (Think about the surface of the Earth. From space it looks curved, but your bedroom looks flat.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of scenario 1, you travel forever. In the case of scenario 3, the universe is already too vast, a spaceship could not beat the expansion.</p>
<p>In the case of scenario 2, however, it might be possible for a spaceship going in a straight line to return to its original position. It would have to be traveling fast enough to beat the accelerating expansion of the universe, however. We know the radius of this torus must be larger than the observable universe because otherwise we'd see that stars on one side of the sky are the same as on  the other side of the sky. (Since tests of this have been done.) I don't have the numbers at the moment, though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question - we don't know for sure.</p>
<p>But, actually, it probably doesn't matter. If the current expansion of the universe continues, you would keep traveling in a straight line forever because the space ahead of you would keep expanding away from you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
