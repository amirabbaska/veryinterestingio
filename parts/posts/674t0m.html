		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So many reasons... </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Alcohol causes far more impairment. Alcohol can quickly put a person in a stupor where they can barely see, have no balance, very slow coordination, etc. Marijuana? The effects are almost entirely mental and far less overpowering. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alcohol can outright kill you. You can overdose and die from alcohol poisoning. Roughly 6 people die each day in the US from alcohol poisoning. Marijuana overdose deaths? Zero in history. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alcohol is highly addictive. It's withdrawal symptoms are right up there with heroin - your body can become so dependent upon alcohol that you can literally die from the withdrawal. Marijuana? Most people don't believe it has any addictive properties, and those that do will admit it is very mild. Sugar is much more addictive.</p>
</li>
<li>Alcohol causes a wide range of long-term health issues. I can't even bother to begin listing them because the list is insanely long. Marijuana? It's actually used to <em>treat</em> a wide variety of illnesses. It does increase risk of lung cancer if you smoke it, but that's just from inhaling any kind of smoke, period, not from marijuana itself. Many people vaporize it so they don't inhale any smoke. </li>
</ol>
<p>Those are the big ones. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol can lead to several fatal conditions, either in a single round of consumption, or over a prolonged period of excessive consumption.</p>
<p>Marijuana can be bad for your lungs, just as is inhaling any particulate matter, so a lifetime of excessive smoking may lead to lung related ailments, but you can't consume enough to easily kill yourself. </p>
<p>You can kill yourself with alcohol pretty easy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol poisons (nearly) every tissue in your body (not a complete list):</p>
<p>(1) Your nervous system: Cerebellar degradation, Wernicke's encephalopathy, peripheral polyneuropathy, alcohol induced seizures, not to mention withdrawal
(2) Your GI tract: Barrett's esophagus, gastropathy, GI bleeds, pancreatitis, liver failure (both acute and chronic)
(3) Your Heart: Alcohol-induced myocarditis
(4) Your lungs: Aspiration pneumonia
(5) Your muscles: Alcohol-induced myopathy
(6) Your psyche: Suicide and suicidal ideation, depression, insomnia, judgement, domestic violence, homicide, </p>
<p>Marijuana has a couple of psychiatric associations, including an increased risk of psychosis when used in teenagers, increased risk of depression, and poor GPA when used by kids.  There is some evidence that MJ might make people sicker if they already have HCV, but those studies aren't great. It can lead to cannabis hyperemesis syndrome if you use it too much.  Plus there is some data that if you use bud, you are at higher risk of a fungal pneumonia called Aspergillosis.  These pale in comparison to the incredible risks of alcohol use, especially chronic alcohol use.  Add to it that alcohol is &quot;socially acceptable&quot;, even heavy drinking, and you have an epidemic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main reason that alcohol is considered “worse” for you than weed is the fact that alcohol can kill a person if too much is used at once.  Alcohol is poisonous to human cells, whereas weed has never killed anyone, and an overdose of weed only results in some anxiety and possibly a fast heartbeat.  Also important to keep in mind is that alcohol is physically addictive, and a severe addict can die from the withdrawal symptoms alone, weed is not physically addictive, although people can develop a mental addiction to weed, it will not kill you if you stop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a nurse that frequently works in ER. This is why I will continue to stand by the idea that alcohol is way worse on our society than pot: I have seen countless people come in from the effects of alcohol. More people come in for alcohol related causes than anything else. Whether it be seizing from Withdrawals, drinking too much, getting into fights or car wrecks because of it, or people who have been at the hands of someone intoxicated (spouses , children, bar fights etc). My personal favorite is the people delirious and withdrawing and telling me they're going to kill me, spitting on me, and physically and verbally abusing me. Pot on the other hand? Once. He was a high school kid that smoked up for the first time with his friends and greened out and threw up. Gave him some fluids and his dad took him home. Would have been just fine without our help but the school had to call an ambulance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
