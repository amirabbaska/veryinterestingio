<p>It isn't about the actual, physical representation of the animal. It's about the symbolism and ideas it represents. Europeans thought of the Lion as &quot;king of the jungle.&quot; A powerful, noble animal at the top of its food chain. There really isn't an analogous animal in Europe (aside from wolves, which always had a negative connotation).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lion was widespread in Europe until roughly 100BC, and was often used by the Romans in the Colosseum, so it isn't like the lion was completely unknown to the European nobility. </p>
<p>The lion represents strength, power, nobility, dignity, wisdom, courage, and dominion. These are all fantastic traits to have represent you as a king. Having a lion in your herald is a statement of your strength and bravery, the authority and power you hold. </p>
<p>Heralds are almost always symbolic, so whenever you see a herald depict some animal or object try to imagine what said object represents, what statement that herald is trying to convey about the people bearing it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the 900s, the Kingdom of Leon (Leon means Lion) was in the Spain/Portugal area.  I don't know how they got their lions, but Spain/Portugal kind of kept them.</p>
<p>In the 1100s, Richard I used them.  Heraldry was kind of formalized, so later designs English and French used them in corners.  </p>
<p>Then with Great Briton, Scotland and Ireland also adopted designs containing them from England.</p>
<p>I'd say this is why they're common: the largest countries used them, and over several rulers.</p>
<p>That's not to say Lion-Mermaids, and Unicorns and other mythic beasts weren't commonly used.</p>
<p>Also, many of these lions are &quot;leopards&quot;, when on crests of Abbots, or bastards.</p>
<p>In the 1500s, the Nordic Countries, Denmark first adopted the lion presumably for &quot;The Lion of Judea&quot;.  These usually carry weapons.  This sort of broadly explains Flanders and Norway.</p>
<p>Mostly, you see it a lot because England was very successful.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
