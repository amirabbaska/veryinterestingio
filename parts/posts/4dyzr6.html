		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few ways to deploy a modern parachute system. Here's a quick run-through of the more common forms.</p>
<p>On a typical sport skydiving rig, deployment is handled by throwing that smaller pilot chute out of a small pouch on the bottom of the container [the &quot;backpack&quot;]. That little drogue parachute catches air, pulls the bridle it's attached to taut, and removes the pin which holds the container [&quot;backpack&quot;] closed.</p>
<p>Once the container is open, that same little parachute drags the larger parachute away from the skydiver in a &quot;deployment bag&quot;. This bag keeps the larger parachute contained, while slowly releasing the larger parachute's lines on the way. Once that little drogue parachute has pulled the large parachute [still in the deployment bag] to the appropriate distance from the skydiver, the deployment bag opens and larger parachute begins to inflate.</p>
<p>As soon as the larger parachute is out of the deployment bag, the smaller pilot chute actually collapses. There's an extra line on the inside of the pilot chute lanyard which collapses the pilot chute to reduce its drag on the main parachute after deployment. The collapsed pilot chute and empty deployment bag are what you see trailing along behind a fully deployed sport parachute.</p>
<p>Theres a nice explanation with pictures here: <a href="http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/skydiving4.htm" target="_blank">http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/skydiving4.htm</a></p>
<p>On certain high-performance main parachutes, there is a way to release the pilot chute and deployment bag assembly from the top of the main parachute after deployment. These very high-performance canopies would not perform properly with the extra drag of the deployment system on top, so these parts are released and reeled in by the skydiver before executing a landing. </p>
<p>Another system you may have seen would be the tandem parachute system. Instead of using a pilot chute, they are deployed from a drogue parachute.</p>
<p>A tandem skydive pair has the same approximate surface area of one skydiver, but roughly double the weight. Without any other changes, the tandem pair would fall significantly faster than a single skydiver in the same body position. This is where the drogue comes in.</p>
<p>The tandem master deploys the drogue parachute shortly after exiting the aircraft by throwing it from a pocket on the bottom of the container. That drogue parachute inflates and provides the required amount of drag to slow the tandem pair to a normal freefall speed [roughly 120mph]. A drogue has a very different design than a pilot chute - it is engineered to withstand the different stresses of its modified task.</p>
<p>When it's time to deploy, the drogue is released by pulling on a handle. The handle pulls a pin, which allows the drogue to drag the main parachute out of the container. The rest of the deployment process is similar to the sport parachute above.</p>
<p>Finally, there are spring-loaded pilot chutes. These are generally only used on reserve parachutes these days.</p>
<p>This works how you'd think. The pilot chute has a spring inside of it which is compressed in a packed reserve container. To deploy, the skydiver would pull a handle which is connected to the pin keeping the reserve container closed. As soon as that pin is pulled, the pilot chute shoots out of the container and inflates.</p>
<p>The rest of the deployment process is similar to above. The pilot chute is attached to a lanyard, which pulls the reserve parachute out of the container. In this case, however, the pilot chute and deployment bag actually release from the reserve parachute and must be located afterwards. Generally speaking when you're using your reserve parachute, you're not enormously worried about having to hunt for the freebag.</p>
<p>This isn't exactly an ELI5 answer. But hopefully it helps explain.</p>
<p>TL;DR - It's either a pilot chute or a drogue chute. Both are used in deployment of the larger main parachute. The latter is also used during freefall on a tandem jump to slow freefall speed and stabilize the jumpers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>USAF Egress technician here - I work on F-22 Ejection Seats for a living. There are two primary purposes of the smaller parachutes. </p>
<p>The first involves the drogue chute, where the parachute deploys to drastically slow down a seat during ejection to prevent trauma from the excessive g-forces the pilot endures, depending on the mode of ejection. This prevents a snapped neck or similar acceleration induced injuries. The seats punch pilots out at 14Gs and 5,000lbs of thrust in less than half of a second.</p>
<p>The next parachute is the spring-loaded pilot chute, and is used to quickly deploy the larger chute, because the smaller chute opens faster, and the drag pulls the larger one out and open.</p>
<p>*EDIT: Drogue not Drove. Autocorrect sucks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Called a pilot chute(can be anywhere from 24 to 32 inch depending on the size of the canopy it is deploying) and it is attached to the deployment bag via a 7 to 9ft bridle and is located in a 'pocket' at the bottom of the container called a BOC(bottom of container). When deployed it inflates and extracts the closing pin which allows the container to open, then extracts the d-bag from the container and the lines unstow from the d-bag. As the last of the lines unstow it allows the bag to open and the canopy is extracted and inflates. The pilot chute then collapses to reduce drag when flying the canopy. This is for a solo rig. On a tandem rig it is called a drogue parachute and is much bigger. It's function then is also to help stabilise the tdm in freefall and slow down the freefall to approximately the freefall speed of a solo jumper flying flat(on his belly and approx 120mph/200kph). Without it deployed the tdm would accelerate to a much higher speed due to the much heavier combined weight of the instructor and passenger but due to them being one behind the other  they only cause about the same drag as a single person and the faster you are travelling the faster the canopy deploys and inflates. Not good for the canopy or the people. It stays inflated through the entire freefall and doesn't begin the opening sequence until another deployment handle(drogue release) is pulled to extract the pin which opens the container. Then it works exactly as a pilot chute does. I am a full-time skydiver and Tdm instructor</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the parachute. Personal parachutes have what is called a pilot chute. This is pulled at the time of deployment. Deployment takes place after tracking away from others skydives an agreed upon heights. Normally 5,000-5,500 feet depending on the amount of people participating.</p>
<p>The pilot chute is pulled out and thrown with an extended arm to the right. This catches air and pulls the bridle that attaches to a pin which closes the container. The action of the pin being pulled by the length of bridle from the pin to the pilot chute is referred to as &quot;snatch force&quot;.</p>
<p>Once the pin is extracted the bridle continues to pull the parachute out of the bag by extending and pulling the lines out of their respective rubber band stows (unless you have a magnetic bag for free stowing).</p>
<p>The parachute begins to catch air and the cells inflate causing the user to drastically slow down.</p>
<p>Tandem rigs have much larger pilot chutes called drogues. These are several feet in diameter depending on make and model. They are thrown shortly after leaving the plane in the same fashion as a pilot chute.</p>
<p>They are used to create stability and slow the tandem master and passenger down to ~120mph (depending on weight). Think of a bauble in the water. Upon deployment the tandem master pulls a release located on the chest or near the hip (again, different manufacturer's have different deployment methods). This then follows the same principle of a personal parachute (or rig for slang).</p>
<p>The pilot chutes in both case then deflate and trail behind the main until you land and it is packed again.</p>
