<p>Hello AskScience! We are members of the <a href="http://vertpaleo.org/the-Society.aspx" target="_blank">Society of Vertebrate Paleontology</a>. We study fossil fish, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles — anything with a backbone! Our research includes how these organisms lived, how they were affected by environmental change like a changing climate, how they're related, and much more.</p>
<p>You can learn more about SVP in <a href="http://vertpaleo.org/the-Society/We-are-SVP.aspx" target="_blank">this video</a> or <strong>follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/svp_vertpaleo" target="_blank">@SVP_vertpaleo</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>We're bringing you our <em>fifth annual AMA</em> from our 78th Annual Meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Ask us your vertebrate paleontology questions! We'll be here to answer your questions at 10am Mountain Time (noon eastern)!</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Joining us today are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Matt Borths, Ph.D.</strong> is the Curator of the Division of Fossil Primates at the Duke Lemur Center. He’s also a co-host of <a href="http://www.pasttime.org" target="_blank">Past Time</a>, a paleontology podcast. Matt’s research focuses on changes in African ecosystems during the Age of Mammals, and he studies the evolution of carnivorous mammals. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://eps.utk.edu/faculty/drumheller.php" target="_blank"><strong>Stephanie Drumheller, Ph.D.</strong></a> is a paleontologist at the University of Tennessee whose research focuses on the processes of fossilization, evolution, and biology, of crocodiles and their relatives, including identifying bite marks on fossils. Find her on Twitter @UglyFossils.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.DrNeurosaurus.com" target="_blank"><strong>Eugenia Gold, Ph.D.</strong></a> studies brain evolution in relation to the acquisition of flight in dinosaurs.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dr. Randall Irmis, Ph.D.</strong> is chief curator and a curator of paleontology at the <a href="https://nhmu.utah.edu/" target="_blank">Natural History Museum of Utah</a> (@nhmu), and an associate professor in the <a href="https://www.earth.utah.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Geology &amp; Geophysics at the University of Utah</a>. He specializes in understanding in how ecosystems change through time in response to climate and other events, particularly during the Triassic Period, the beginning of the age of dinosaurs.  You can listen to his recent appearance on Science Friday here: <a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/utah-is-a-gold-mine-for-fossils/" target="_blank">https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/utah-is-a-gold-mine-for-fossils/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jessica Lawrence Wujek, Ph.D.</strong> main area of study is in marine reptiles, specifically Ichthyosaurus. She did her Ph.D. work on the genus <em>Ichthyosaurus</em>, looking at the phylogeny and morphometrics of the genus. She currently teaches geology at Howard Community College part time, and is trying to get my 3 year son into dinosaurs! She also has <a href="https://theprehistoricreview.wordpress.com" target="_blank">a blog talking about the accuracy and entertainment value of books with any prehistoric theme</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://crocdoc.ifas.ufl.edu/staff/jennifernestler/" target="_blank"><strong>Jennifer Nestler</strong></a> studies crocodylian ecology and evolution. She has studied both modern and fossil crocodylians, and is a project manager for the Croc Docs, a research lab at the University of Florida that focuses on reptiles and amphibians in the Everglades. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://ashinonyx.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Ashley Reynolds</strong></a> is a PhD student at the University of Toronto and Royal Ontario museum. She studies the growth, ecology, and behaviour of living and extinct cats, with an emphasis on the famed sabre-toothed cat Smilodon fatalis. You can find her on Twitter and Instagram @ashinonyx</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deborah Rook, Ph.D.</strong> studied extinct mammals for many years, and they are still quite close to her heart. She's now the Faculty Mentoring Network manager for the QUBES organization, working with undergraduate professors to increase the amount of data and math presented in life science classrooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://ashleypoust.weebly.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Ashley Poust</strong></a> is a Ph.D candidate at the University of California, Berkeley. He is interested in links between animal life history and major events in evolution. His focus is on the evolution of paleogene mammals, primarily using osteohistology. He also works with other taxa, especially dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and marine mammals, to address similar questions of diversity, ontogeny, and life history across vertebrates. You can find him on twitter @AshPoust. </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Adam Pritchard, Ph.D.</strong> studies the early history of the reptiles that gave rise to lizards, dinosaurs, crocodiles and birds. He is a co-host of <a href="http://www.pasttime.org" target="_blank">Past Time</a>, a paleontology podcast.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard about the Permian-Triassic extinction when we lost a lot of really weird vertebrate fish and of course a lot of strange Arthropoda, but have we ever had an extinction where we lost a whole lot of mammalian taxa?  I know most of the megafauna have gone, but has there ever been something similar to the really big extinctions?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This probably more for Dr Gold and Ashley Poust. Is there a lot of difference between how dinosaures got into flight and how pterosaurs did? I vaguely remember reading that pterodactyls are not dinosaurs and I find that fascinating that flight has evolved so many times. </p>
<p>Appart form relatively modern birds, was there ever massive flying dinosaurs like some of the pterosaurs?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
