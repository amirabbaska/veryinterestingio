		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Was labor lawyer for a long time.  I think it is 3 things:  </p>
<p>(1) Our labor laws create dumb incentives for unions.  A union has to represent a terminated employee and will try and get jobs back for members who hide all day and sleep, cause massive damage due to laziness and incompetence, fight, bully, are insubordinate, etc.  I always implored our union reps to focus on wages and benefits and working conditions and to quit fighting for the lowest common denominator employee.  Americans don't think its fair for someone who gets caught stealing to get their job back and hates the union for trying to.  Also, America has a very strong &quot;at will&quot; employment ethic which people generally support - you should be able to be fired at any time.  </p>
<p>(2)  PR.  America has a weird political system where a small number of billionaires have created a small number of think tanks, almost exclusively funded by billionaires, to create junk &quot;science&quot; and PR which is then widely disseminated and used by rightwing politicians to turn people against their own interests.  It is a relentless, well oiled machine.  It is a frequent refrain that unions cost jobs and cause companies to offshore.  I was part and parcel of this machine, which we used in union campaigns to convince these poor dopes that the union was going to cost them their jobs.  My mother was a nurse who complained for 30 years about how terrible and arbitrary her employer was, and I would keep telling her how they are violating various labor laws, but she hated unions because a talk radio host repeated the Heritage Foundation talking points over and over (and to be fair used actual anecdotes about bad employees getting their jobs back) and suffered her whole career because of it.  </p>
<p>(3)  Fairness.  Unions actually do a great job at raising wages and benefits (though the threat of a union accomplishes almost the same).  As a consequence union workers are paid six figures despite not having even finished high school some time.  If the union is a pain (see #1) and workers refuse to do anything they don't have to (like if there is trash on the floor and they refuse to pick it up because it's not in their contract), Americans find this lazy and unfair, especially when they are paid a lot and especially if they cant be fired for it.  As a final subpart I will say unions have had a history of corruption and mafia ties so Americans find that unfair.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grew up in a big union area.   I'll throw out some key items, some of them overlap. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unions got greedy. It simply became very easy for manufacturers to leave </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They don't do this so much anymore but unions would strike in a manner that people found unbecoming.. i.e. - when nurses strike, people suffer. When teachers strike, students suffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jealousy - often the most well off families in town were union</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Related to jealousy - often the well paid union members was dumb as a box of rocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficiency part 1 - everybody has stories about the new guy being told to slow down (threatened) because they were working too hard and making it worse for everybody else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficiency part 2 - everybody has stories of trying to get things done in a union shop but due to union rules, the simplest tasks (sweeping up, repairing/maintenance) made ridiculously time consuming and expensive because doing said task had to be completed by specialized union members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficiency part 3 - (I'm going to generalize based on personal anecdote)  it you are an engineer working to improve assembly line at UAW shop, is hard as hell to just go out and change things up because changes are frowned upon. Job protection is number 1.  It was easier to change things up at another facility where they were Teamsters. I imagine it would be super easy at non union shop.</p>
</li>
<li>Mob influence - not an issue so much now, but it does exist. Criminal gangs ran union leadership. Family member worked at union HQ  where bomb went off during internal war. Odometers were rolled back for free just because. I'm giving personal anecdote. Big picture, think Jimmy Hoffa types. </li>
</ol>
<p>Non union people working in the community see and hear of this kind of crap and have watched the jobs leave and they blame the unions. Personally i think much of the criticism is justified, but I don't think that justifies letting 3rd world manufacturing import at no cost.</p>
<p>I'm sure I've forgotten other reasons.</p>
<p>Source - multiple family members work(ed) for GM, Chrysler, Toyota, Teamsters, and other miscellaneous parts and suppliers. Multiple UAW members. Some went into management/engineering.  I was briefly a Teamster.</p>
<p>Edit - I can appreciate union membership. There is no doubt that the personal benefits can help. Still, I have many family members who have drank the Kool Ade and the union can do no wrong. Some like me have at times really resented the negative effects of unions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First we need to distinguish a difference between Trade unions (Carpenters/Welders) and Labor unions (United Auto Workers).  Generally speaking, everyone respects Trade Unions, as they actually train their people, and deliver on promises.  Labor unions are the ones giving organized labor a bad name. </p>
<p>To form a Labor Union, all employees within a given designation (say floor workers) at a particular employer vote to unionize.  If more than 50% vote YES, 100% of employees within that designation are now in the union, may appoint a representative, and the employer MUST bargain with them collectively.  Anyone that joins the company within that designation must also join the union.  </p>
<p>Labor Unions are pretty objectively bad for the employer, but that's also why they get started.  Employees that vote for one have usually been asking for raises, sick leave, or generally not-shit work environments, and unionizing forces the employer to fix shit.  Otherwise, the union will go on strike, and the employer will have to either negotiate or replace 100% of their floor workers, likely including those that train the floor workers. </p>
<p>Labor Unions are objectively good for society by creating a better/safer work environment, and generally forcing the employer to do right by their employees.  However, eventually things reach a happy medium, and then Labor Unions start having problems justifying their membership dues without something to &quot;fight&quot; for.  That's when they start making unrealistic claims, and threaten to choke out the management.  </p>
<p>By their nature Unions have to be 100% either way.  All of the value for the members comes from collective bargaining.  Without the 51%=100% rule, Labor unions are neutered, as an employer really could live without 50% of it's workforce when they fire all the strikers.  </p>
<p>&quot;Right To Work&quot; laws make union membership optional in most workplaces.  It seems attractive to someone just getting in, as you might get a marginally higher wage than your union peers, AND don't have to pay dues, but you also don't have the same days off or health benefits.  If enough people don't join, the union has no leverage to negotiate with, and working conditions start slipping back to their pre-union days with no way to fix it (because they don't have to negotiate).  </p>
<p>TL;DR: Unions can be objectively good, but they need to get better at leveraging their purpose in society.  If they don't figure it out soon, Right To Work laws are going to kill them forever. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having worked for a Union based company for a long time, I can try to provide some insights.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
It doesn't matter how much you know, or how amazing or capable an employee you are, everyone under the same job title and contract is paid exactly the same.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the employee who knows everything there is to know about the job inside and out ( your go-to type ), to the one who couldn't do this job if their life depended on it. The pay is the same. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This causes two problems. </p>
<p>1:  Eventually, your super employees realize their efforts are for nothing as their pay is exactly the same as the idiot warming a chair two cubicles over.  As a result, over time, they tend to do less as they realize there isn't any reason to continue busting their ass.  </p>
<p>2:  Your less than stellar employees will never do more than the bare minimum because they realize that doing as much work as the super employee doesn't pay any more than they're already making.  As a result, there is no motivation to put in any additional effort.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:  The less than stellar may have once been the Rockstars of the group.  Over time, they've come to the realization that their extra efforts go unrewarded and eventually become the employee they've hated for much of their career.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also notoriously difficult to fire a Union Employee unless they do something just completely outrageous.<br />
The paperwork and steps involved to fire someone are so immense, that most companies won't even bother to mess with it.  The craftier ones know this and get away with quite a bit.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could probably strip naked, smear yourself in Nutella and go stand on the roof armed with a rifle shouting obscenities at the homeless and still not get fired.  They'll put you into some sort of Employee Assistance Program for a month and let you come right back to your job :|    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In larger companies, multiple Unions can be involved all of which are under different negotiated contracts.  Imagine working next to someone where they are paid more than you are to do the exact same job and you have ZERO ability to re-negotiate your pay.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine how you would feel about Bob making 10% more than you do, while doing the same work, at the same location, during the same hours.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Demotivating as hell.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, the Unions themselves don't give a damn about their members.  They like to pretend they do.  They put on the big show like they do, but they don't.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They care about exactly two things:</p>
<p>1:  The number of Union jobs in a company<br />
2:  The pay level of those jobs in a company  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Union will fight for the two items above fiercely because Union Dues are typically a percentage of a Union Members base pay.  As a result, if more Union jobs are created or current Union jobs receive a pay increase, then the Union pulls in more Dues.  It's a self serving fight for them.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They like to tell you they're fighting for YOU but, in reality, they're fighting for themselves, just using the members as a proxy to do so.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This becomes evident in things such as healthcare.  They don't fight for it at all because they've already got their money from you.  Since your dues are a percentage of your base pay, the fact you have to pay extra every year in healthcare premiums isn't their concern. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why I cannot support the Unions any longer.  I'm lucky to reside in a State where I have the choice of joining the Union or not instead of it being forced on me.  It is noteworthy, however, that joining the Union is far easier than leaving one.  They intentionally make it difficult to leave to dissuade such things.  In my company, joining up is as simple as signing a simple piece of paper.  To LEAVE it, you have to send in a certified letter explaining your intentions to leave, during a ONE WEEK window of the year based on the date you joined.  Miss that window, and you're stuck with the Union for another year.  :|</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my experiences with them,  they're just not worth it any longer.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory, I don't really mind unions. However my own personal experience with them was not so great. My group at my old workplace was a bit further along than expected and we needed these big server racks in place in order to continue. The union guys were unpacking the racks from these shipping pallets. They needed three people per pallet and had five. Since I had nothing else to do, I asked if I could help. They said yes and we got things done fairly quickly. Well, the next day some dude I'd never seen walked in with a few of the union guys, who pointed me out, and he slapped a paper down on my desk and informed me that my project was being fined a thousand dollars (or something roughly that) for taking union work. The looks on the faces of the union guys (that had seemed like decent people the other day) was so smug as they looked at me. I went over to my boss and handed him the paper, he just shrugged and said &quot;If I could pay a thousand dollars to get a day ahead of schedule, I'd take that trade any day. Don't worry about it.&quot;</p>
<p>So yeah...unions...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
