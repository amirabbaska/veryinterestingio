<p>Streaming video, on the other had, is computationally more expensive, but you wind up sending a lot less data.  Not only is the compression for each frame better, but it can compress from frame to frame, essentially only transmitting the differences between each frame.</p>
<p>On top of that, streaming video can detect when you don't have enough bandwidth, and lower the image quality to compensate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you have an animation that's just a black and white stick figure moving around in a white background,</p>
<p>A Gif would download the data for each pixel, white or black, individually, resulting in a lot of data being downloading and causing it to be slow.</p>
<p>A good video codec will basically say: This whole area is white, and only these bunch of pixels will change from white to black and black to white, so only download the data for that part.</p>
<p>And most the popular video codecs (i.e. Youtube's native codec, flash, or HTML5) have been optimized to the fullest to give you the fastest stream possible, while .gifs aren't given as much attention.</p>
<p>EDIT: As a lot of people have mentioned, my explanation is full of holes, and is pretty vague. I'd like to apologize, I'm still getting my degree in computer engineering, and I've made quite a few assumptions. Probably should have done a bit more research before showing off to others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also video is composed using a codec, most of which are more and more standardized.</p>
<p>Some of these standardized codecs, like Mpeg2, Mpeg4, h264 and very recently h265 are being accelerated by the SoC (your phone's CPU/GPU).<br />
So even though it's more work, your phone has an offload engine for that work which makes it very easy.<br />
In some video playback apps, this is called hardware vs software decoding.<br />
Software is the CPU doing it without the special accelerator.<br />
Hardware is leveraging that offload accelerator.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can stream video, meaning it can start to play before the file is finished downloaded, and download as you watch so it appears seamless.  </p>
<p>A gif is not a video file and is not meant to be.  It's an image file.  It has to be downloaded entirely or else it will stutter, and the frames of a gif are much, much less space efficient than frames of a video.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other commenters have summarized the basic point: gifs store all the data in every frame of the animation, while mp4s and other video formats only store the differences from frame to frame. GIFs are largely a relic of the early internet, back when it was a cutting-edge image storage format with animation slapped on top of it to make your website a little more dynamic.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about why we still even use GIFs    to this day I highly recommend <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a21457/the-gif-is-dead-long-live-the-gif/" target="_blank">this fantastic article</a> in popular mechanics. It discusses how we got in this mess, and a potential path forward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
