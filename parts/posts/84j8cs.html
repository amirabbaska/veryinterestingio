		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds are vibrations. The faster the vibration, the higher the pitch. (And the larger the vibration the louder the noise).</p>
<p>So speeding it up increases the vibration rate making a higher pitch and slowing it down decreases the vibration, lowing the pitch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every persons natural sound is a combination of one fundamental frequency, with a mess of harmonic frequencies that add to the timbre of their voice, but don’t define the note as it would be picked up by a guitar tuner. That note is all fundamental frequency.</p>
<p>The note is also just an ugly sine wave, and the frequency of that sine wave (which has the fundamental frequency) is measured by how many times the sine wave goes up and down every second.</p>
<p>People with very high voices have sine waves that go up and down more times every second than people with very low voices.</p>
<p>Let’s say you sing lalalalalalala, and that takes you 2 seconds. Welp, if you speed that up, and it only takes 1 second for the full string of ‘la’s to finish, then you had to have made all of the ups and downs happen in half the time. </p>
<p>Now you have the same number of ups and downs in half the time, so the frequency of the speeded up version is doubled for every second that the sound goes on.</p>
<p>Since higher frequencies sound higher to our ears, we hear that as a Mickey Mouse voice.</p>
<p>The reverse is true for slowwwed dowwwwn versions of the original Lalalalala.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all about frequencies(occurrences per second in the case of sound waves). Every sound you hear(between about 20-20,000 cycles per second, or Hertz) travels through the air as a wave. As the frequency(Hz) of something increases, it's perceived as in increase in pitch. The threshold of human hearing is roughly 20Hz-20,000Hz. So any sound wave that travels through air fewer than 20 times/second, will almost certainly be too low of a frequency for your ear to perceive, same for anything above 20,000, it'll be too high to hear(think of the &quot;silent&quot; dog whistles).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound is air waves hitting our ears. when we take a recorded sound and slow it down, the main way we do this is by 'stretching out' the wave. Longer 'waves' have a lower pitch, and shorter waves have a higher pitch. so the shift in pitch is actually a product of how sound is recorded and shifted. It is also possible to speed up/slow down sounds without messing with the pitch, but that uses a different, more complicated process. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we hear sound, what we're actually hearing is the air around us vibrating against the sound-sensing bones in our ear. Basically, the air taps on our ears, and our ears takes the pattern of taps and turns it into a sound that we can make sense of.</p>
<p>The type of sound we hear is based on certain properties of these taps. How loud a sound is based on the strength of the taps; the harder the tap, the louder the sound. The pitch, or type of sound is based on how often the taps tap; the faster the taps, the higher the sound. A deep, rumbly sound might tap 25 times per second, while a high whine might tap thousands or tens of thousands of times per second.</p>
<p>When we play back a sound at a different speed, we end up changing how fast the tapping comes in. If we play back a sound twice as fast, that means that it's tapping twice as many times every second, which makes the sound squeakier and higher pitched. If we play it back half as fast, it taps half as often, which makes it sound deeper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
