		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not really a reaction by the body to get rid of something toxic or poisonous.  During an extreme physical event such as running, your muscles need a huge supply of oxygen, and your body responds by decreasing blood flow to your stomach and intestines and other internal organs, and increasing the blood flow to your heart and muscles.  The decreased blood flow to your stomach means that it is not able to digest food as efficiently, so it may try to get rid of the food by vomiting.</p>
<p>This is why serious long-distance runners will try to keep their energy up with those energy gel packs that are easy to digest, because it's basically just carbohydrates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After strenuous exercise it's likely the result of lactic acid buildup. In my exercise physiology lab back in college we had to do a Wingate test. 30 seconds of super high intensity cycling. When your body can't convert lactic acid fast enough to energy it has to get rid of it somehow, and vomiting is the easiest way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
