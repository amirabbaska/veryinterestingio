		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it's less complicated than it sounds. an inch of rain is an inch deep no matter the surface area. could be the size of a dime, could be a square inch (that would give you a cubic inch of rain), could be a square mile. just means that, on the whole, in a given area, enough rain fell to cover the ground in an inch of water (assuming zero drainage).</p>
<p>[EDIT] woah, fifty times more points than i've ever gotten before. that's hilarious. to anyone who is still confused: you are totally overthinking this. imagine a football field with a thousand straight-sided plastic containers, all of different sizes, scattered about. if that football field gets an inch of rain, all of the containers will have an inch of rain in them. it's like measuring the depth of the carpet in a house. the shape and size and contours of the floor just don't factor into the equation. whatever the carpet depth is, it's the same everywhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An inch of rain means that if you would catch the rain on a flat surface, it would reach up to an inch in height. To properly measure this, you need to make sure that the water can't flow away or dissipate into the ground, so you'd need a waterproof box with an open top for the rain to fall in. The amount of water it takes to reach a certain waterlevel obviously depends on the surface area of the measurement box. However, so does the amount of water entering the box via rainfall, so that evens out and ultimately it means that the size (and shape) of the measurement box is not important.</p>
<p>1 cubic inch of water will raise the water level in a 1 square inch box to 1 inch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Put out a tray to catch the water.  Doesn't matter how big or small.  A big tray will catch a lot of drops.  A small tray will catch fewer drops.  At the end of the rainstorm, all the trays (except the ones you out under trees) will have the same depth of water in inches</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I pondered this same question for some time during my childhood. Then I realized that it doesn't matter what the lateral dimensions of your container are. If you have a 1x1 foot container and a 2x2 foot container, they will both collect 1 inch of rain water given the same rainfall. This is because the water is distributed evenly over the area in which it is falling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What it really means is one cubic inch of rainwater per square inch of land. But since inch³ / inch² = inch, you can shorten it.</p>
<p>Conveniently, this also happens to be what you get if you measure it: put a tube (or box or barrel, or anything with a flat bottom) outside when it's raining and the depth of the water in that tube afterwards (in inches) will be how much it rained (in inches).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
