		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a guy on reddit who insists that the Lense-Thirring effect (L-T) somehow causes the orbital plane of a planet to align with the equatorial plane of the (rotating) star about which the planet orbits. Similarly, the orbital plane of a moon would align itself with the equatorial plane of its host planet, assuming the planet is spinning. He cites <a href="http://philica.com/display_article.php?article_id=281" target="_blank">this paper</a> to support his thesis.</p>
<p>From what I've read about L-T, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9704065.pdf" target="_blank">this is not the case</a>: the orbital inclination, or the angle between the orbital plane and the equatorial plane, remains the same. However, the orbital plane precesses about the axis of rotation of the star. And there's also nodal precession, too, but that also doesn't affect the angle of the orbital plane.</p>
<p>The one case where L-T <em>does</em> result in something aligning itself with the equatorial plane is <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1975ApJ...195L..65B" target="_blank">in the accretion disks of Kerr black holes</a>: if (for some reason) an accretion disk forms that is out of alignment with a fast-rotating black hole, L-T causes the the orbital planes at different distances to precess at different rates, which causes shearing in the viscous mass of the accretion disk, and as the disk relaxes into a lower energy state, it will end up in the same plane as the plane of rotation of the black hole. But this is due to internal friction within the disk, and that is not a significant factor in ordinary orbital mechanics involving stars, planets, moons, and even rings.</p>
<p>Is he right, or am I? Or are we both wrong?</p>
<p>Edit: concise answers such as &quot;you are right&quot;, although appreciated, tend to be too short and will be pruned by automod unless there is some additional supporting argument. Let's not be lazy!</p></div></div>

<p>That is not a paper, that is a text published on something similar to a web forum, by <a href="http://philica.com/advancedsearch.php?author=4682" target="_blank">an author</a> who posted various nonsense articles there. Oh, and he is not a physicist, just in case you wondered. But he finished courses in college physics.</p>
<p>&quot;Your surgery will be done by our new surgeon. Don't worry, he never did surgery before, but he finished all his college biology courses!&quot;</p>
<p>Lense-Thirring does not change the inclination, and even the precession effect is negligible for the solar system. It is of the order GS/(c^2 r^(3)) where S is the angular momentum of the central mass. For the Sun and Mercury, we get a time scale of 100 billion years (<a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+pi*((speed+of+light\)%5E2+*+(58+million+km\)%5E3\" target="_blank">calculation</a>)%2F((gravitational+constant)<em>2</em>10%5E41+kg+m%5E2%2Fs))).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm far from an expert, but I think the fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon" target="_blank">the orbit of earth's moon</a> is inclined by 5 degrees to the ecliptic and between 18.3 and 28.6 degrees to earth's equator disproves that guy's theory.  Since the moon doesn't align with earth's equatorial plane, then the L-T effect doesn't require moons to orbit on the equatorial planes of their planets.</p>
<p>There might be something to the idea that the L-T effect caused the  early sun's accretion disk to orbit on its equatorial plane, which is why the planets tend to orbit very close to the ecliptic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently doing a masters astrophysics course where we touched on the L-T effect during a black holes module. I am inclined to agree that you are correct (in fact, your explanation is a nice clear one). </p>
<p>Though just to clarify: the L-T effect causes a precession of the plane of an inclined orbit, like a spinning coin on a table top. The inclination is affected by dissipation of energy in the disc (from different orbital radii precessing at different rates). In our coin analogy, though it is spinning, it only falls down because of friction dissipating energy.</p>
<p>So, the L-T effect may have had some impact in the early solar system with regards to the protoplanetary dust disc. But without a source of dissipation, the L-T can do nothing more than precess an orbit, not change the inclination. Does it precess the moon? Yes, it probably does on some level. However the masses of the Earth and the Moon are so tiny that the L-T effect may as well not exist (especially when compared with the much more important tidal forces present in planetary systems). </p>
<p>I've had a quick look through the first paper, and I don't really trust any of it at all. It doesn't seem to have been referenced by anyone and the whole thing seems off. The arguments they've used don't seem to add up either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not on the theory side, but there are plenty of known planets with orbits completely misaligned to their host star's rotational axes, with some proceeding retrograde. These orbits are very close in (orbital periods of days), where any GR effects are far stronger than the Earth-Sun system! The planets and stars are also old enough that they've had several gigayears to realign their axes through whatever mechanism you choose, but haven't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other responses on why this guy is wrong, I want to point out that his comment that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By using the concept of frame-dragging force, we can explain many puzzles in our universe such as the formation of planet rings and the problem of angular momentum transfer in our solar system. It can also explain why our moon is moving away from earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Implies that there is actually an unanswered question of why or how angular momentum in some objects is converted to linear momentum in others. That's not true, it's a well understood mechanism that can be modeled based on the distances, rotations, and mass distributions involved. <a href="https://squishtheory.wordpress.com/why-is-the-earths-rotation-slowing/" target="_blank">Here is a decent overview</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
