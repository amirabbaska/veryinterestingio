		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine putting 22 oranges into your cart, then put orange juice next to that.  Notice how much space each takes up?  If you weighed them, the oranges would weigh more (because of skin and other things that are removed when juicing).  The same thing goes for shipping!  That's why &quot;flat packed furniture,&quot; like what's sold at Walmart and Ikea, is so much cheaper than pre-built furniture stores.  It's also why a package of dehydrated or condensced food costs much less.  Like dry beans vs canned beans.  Or Gatorade powder vs Gatorade Bottles. </p>
<p>When shipping, 2 things matter: Size and Weight.  Decrease either of these, and the costs go down.  If you imagine a semi-truck, one full of packing peanuts and one full of bricks, which costs less gas to move?  The one full of packing peanuts.  However, it still costs money to move the semi truck full of packing peanuts. </p>
<p>The other thing to know is that not all Produce is created equal.  The produce that shows up at the grocery store is often larger and is <em>much better looking</em> than the produce used to make refined goods like juice.  This means that if you used pretty, large oranges, you might use less than the 22 needed, and they'd all look pretty, but only the juice-maker knows that. </p>
<p>If you can find a local place that sells &quot;ugly&quot; produce (that tastes the same), you will save a lot of money.  The reason for this is that you essentially pay for all the ugly food that is thrown away.  <a href="https://youtu.be/i8xwLWb0lLY?t=470" target="_blank">John Oliver did a piece on it.</a> The link takes you to the part showing a field after they've gone through and picked everything.  This is also why baby carrots are a thing... baby carrots are the ugliest carrots trimmed into the &quot;baby&quot; shape! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the orange juice you drink is not freshly squeezed.  they take oranges, squeeze them, store them in tanks for months (they do this to even out price fluctuations, and because oranges is a seasonal crop--you want orange juice year round, right?), then when it comes time to make orange juice, they take the stored juice and mix it with flavoring chemicals (because when you store orange juice for a long time, it loses flavor).  minute maid orange juice tastes candy-ish because they like to add sweet flavors to it. tropicana has it's own flavor profile.   </p>
<p>here's a tropicana &quot;pure premium&quot; orange juice tank farm. each tank holds one million gallons.

<p>not freshly squeezed, right? nope. pure premium, and other &quot;not from concentrate&quot; is a marketing <del>gimmick</del> scheme designed to get consumers to pay higher prices for possibly not so good juice. </p>

<p>edit: if you want fresh orange juice, look for a higher end market, and see their selection.  the best ones will be hpp, high pressure processed to kill germs, and preserve fresh flavor.  the second best ones will be pasteurized, but pasteurization involves heat, and that will cook the orange juice (Trader Joes is pasteurized).  cost maybe $7/half gallon to $9 in major american cities.  </p>
<p>edit: still interested in orange juice, but can't afford the more expensive fresh squeezed juice, yet don't want flavor packets in your orange juice? here's a list of brands that use/don't use them <a href="https://www.toxinless.com/orange-juice" target="_blank">https://www.toxinless.com/orange-juice</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Used to work in an orange packing shed. The juicing oranges were usually the lumpy, weird shaped ones that can't be sold loose, and don't fit nicely into the packing boxes. They all get lumped together in a bin, so would be much cheaper to transport. There's also more of them than the nice &quot;Grade A&quot; ones that get sold loose. </p>
<p>There were also &quot;Grade B&quot; oranges which were perfectly fine to eat but couldn't be sold in America because they were &quot;ugly&quot;. I.e. Have slight marks or be differently coloured. These usually went to less economically developed countries. </p>
<p>Remember the produce you buy in shops is the most aesthetically pleasing pick of the crop :) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The oranges sent to the juicer are usually smaller, uglier, thin-skinned varieties grown for that purpose.  Because you never see what they look like it doesn't matter if the color or shape is irregular of if they get bludgeoned during shipping.  The waste (and cost) here is a lot lower.</p>
<p>The oranges that hit the produce section need to be babied a lot more and shipped carefully and rapidly, which significantly increases the cost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The oranges you buy as oranges are the biggest, prettiest oranges possible, and had to be transported quickly and carefully to prevent spoilage before you buy them. The orange juice is made from the small or ugly or excess oranges, and they are turned into a concentrate that is easier to preserve ASAP and then stored up to a year before being sold if necessary. Most of the cost of an orange is in preserving and transporting it, not growing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
