		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As u/fael_7 said, a sharp edge basically concentrated the force applied. If you weigh 60kg and walk on your toes in sand, you will leave deeper footprints than if you walk on your entire foot, right?</p>
<p>Same idea, basically. If you apply an equal force using a sharp point it edge compared to a blunt surface, that force is pressing on your &quot;target&quot; on a more concentrated area, increasing the pressure (force divided by area) you can apply.</p>
<p>If this localized pressure can break the material (either on a macroscopic scale by separating individual pieces or segments, or on a molecular/atomic scale by breaking bonds) and if your sharp tool is strong enough to withstand the force being applied with it, so as not to break itself, you will cut.</p>
<p>It can be complicated to describe it exactly as different materials have different properties and mechanisms for failure (being broken or cut) so if you are unclear or want to ask about a specific example, please do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pressure is equal to Force/Area. Having a large force or/and a small area increases pressure. A sharp object is an object with an edge that has a very small area. The sharpness makes the pressure much greater than if it was dull. </p>
<p>If you then try to cut(split) something, then you apply a much larger pressure on the object, forcing a small amount of molecules to move. They then break the bond with their neighbours which makes a split.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its basically all about the force that that something exerts onto another object. You might not think that there is much force behind the slice with a knife, but all of the force that you're effortlessly placing down is concentrated into a very, very small area that the other object can't compete with, so it yields. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Things that are sharp take relatively small amounts of force to apply relatively large amounts of stress to a material. Stress, in a general equation is just force/area, so  a knife or spear applies a force via an extremely small area (that's why a sharp edge's tip is very very thin). Materials all have stress levels they can endure in specific situations, but the idea of a sharp tool is that it allows you to channel your bodily force into a tiny area on an object, to make precise cuts, whereas to break the same material by pinching your fingers (larger surface area) would take much more force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
