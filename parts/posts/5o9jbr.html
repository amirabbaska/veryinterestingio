		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cancer is basically uncontrolled reproduction of cells. The cells in your body all have a job and a timeline. So for example, and this is not an actual number, but a bone cell will replicate itself 10 times and then it dies. Or if it gets damaged it sends out a signal to other cells &quot;hey! I'm not going to make it!&quot; And it's broken down and absorbed by the body.</p>
<p>Cancer starts with a single mutated cell that replicates and replicates and now you have a tumor. It's a damaged cell but it doesn't send the &quot;kill me now!&quot; signal. And that tumor just grows and grows and develops more mutations that allow it to get nice and cozy where it's at. At a certain point it gets the body to send it blood with it's own system of vessels. Then pieces of it travel through the blood or lymphatic system and nestle in and grow more. This is called a metastasis. These growths put pressure on the tissue, organs, etc around it. They also steal blood from the surrounding tissue. </p>
<p>And it's completely unregulated because the body thinks it belongs there. Because it's made of your own cells. So it just takes the resources your body needs and pushes your organs and tissue out of the way to make more room and takes more blood and more nutrients while destroying functional tissue in making room for itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the beginning stages of many breast cancers, the cancer cells are contained in a limited area like the milk ducts. If left undiagnosed and untreated though, the cancer can spread. </p>
<p>In an ideal treatment, there would be a single tumor in a non vital area that could be easily removed. In an un-ideal situation there are many tumors spread throughout the body and manually removing could kill the patient, or is otherwise not possible.</p>
<p>In the case of breast cancer, the cancer cells can spread to the rest of the body (Metastatic breast cancer), growing new tumors. This not only makes it harder to treat, but depending on where those tumors grow, it can be deadly. For instance imagine one growing in your liver or lungs, or even your brain. It could damage the organ and cause organ failure. The organ failure in turn leads to a painful death as the organs shut down and the body slowly dies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not really the <em>cancer</em> that kills you, per se. If breast cancer remained confined to the breast, it would be a problem, but it (probably) wouldn't be lethal. The problem arises when cancer decides to venture out into the big, wide world of your body (aka metastasis). </p>
<p>If the cancer undergoes metastasis, odds are it's going to create a new cancer somewhere really important (stomach, brain, lung, etc). THOSE cancers can be really deadly (do YOU want something growing out of control on your brain? Thought not.) Alternatively, if the newly metastasized cancers are pushing up on something important, that can lead to impaired function and eventual death as well. </p>
<p>Another way that cancer can create problems is something called paraneoplastic syndrome. This basically happens when the hormones and chemicals the body uses to fight off cancer results in new problems, which might easily be fatal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very short and to the point. What kills in Cancer is the cells rapidly multiply until the pinch or sever the wrong nerve or blood vessel. Or it  spreads into a vital organ stopping it from properly functioning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
