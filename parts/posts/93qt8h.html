It just seems like making them white makes them impossible to see during games. Like sure you might be able to see it better on the ground, but I feel like it's important to see it flying through the air for safety if nothing else. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, it's tradition. Mass produced golf balls started off white because they covered them with latex, and then stayed that way as a general thing. </p>
<p>Second, golf balls are actually more important to find on the ground than they are in the air. The &quot;fore!&quot; cry is intended to warn people when a ball gets too close, not visually spotting it; they're almost impossible to pick up when in flight regardless of colour due to their size, so &quot;duck and cover&quot; to reduce the chances of getting hit somewhere really bad. So you trade off the slim chances that someone will see it inbound and avoid getting brained, against the higher chances that you'll be able to find your white ball in that field of yellow dandelions, or not lose that red ball when it's getting dark and red becomes really hard to see.</p>
<p>Finally, there are lots of fluorescent and non-white balls for sale - quite a few people golf with lemon-yellow ones - but upper-tier professional golf is a bit slow to change and has stuck with white. Again, the tradition thing comes into play.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>White is actually pretty easy to spot on the ground, whether the ground is green or brown. I've played with a neon-yellow ball before, and it was very hard to find. Dark orange may be easier, but white is traditional.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
