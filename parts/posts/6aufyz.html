		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We already have a few- artificial hearts exist, and have been used successfully as 'bridges' for people waiting for donor hearts. They aren't used yet as long term heart replacements, but that is certainly a possibility. Artificial kidneys exist too- dialysis machines. These are external and quite large, but conceivably someday could be configured to be small enough to be implanted. As for the hardest, the brain for sure- that's a whole separate conversation about AI probably- though some of the more basic electrical signaling from the brain could be/ is done artificially. But another organ at the top of the 'synthetic difficulty' list would be the <em>liver</em>. The liver has hundreds of functions- it stores energy, produces vitamins and components of the immune system, breaks down toxins, monitors blood sugar, regulates hormones... Any artificial liver would have to be able to do all of these things, at the right time and to the right extent. [Here] (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072577/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072577/</a>) is a good starting point for understanding liver function. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory they can probably ALL be replaced. As far as we know, there is nothing inherently special about one clump of cells versus another clump of cells (or machine) that performs the same function.</p>
<p>As for the difficulty of replacing them...obviously the brain would be the most difficult. The human brain is the most complex structure in the known universe, so we're nowhere close to being able to do that.</p>
<p>The easiest would probably be the skin...it's relatively easy to make artificial skin grafts. The kidneys aren't too complex either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the hardest thing to replace would be bone marrow. A lot of our organs are filters of some sort, or pumps, but bone marrow creates our blood cells which is a lot harder to do than just filtering or pumping something. There was a thing created recently that can almost be considered an &quot;alternative&quot; organ to bone marrow. It's basically a sac that creates red and white blood cells but I don't know if that can be considered actually synthetic or not. It depends on if by synthetic you mean like robot bits or include engineered bits.<br />
Other than that I'd say the brain would be the hardest to replace. If done slowly enough I don't think you'd ever notice switching our organic neurons with synthetic ones. It's just engineering the artificial neurons that would be the hard part.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A follow-up question to the OP if they are allowed: what about replacing all but the brain at once? Could we make artificial 'blood'  and pump it through the arteries to keep a brain alive in absence of any other organs?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming that the brain is out. I'd say lymphoid and hematogenous tissue of any sort would practically have to be cellular. Any tissue with endocrine or secretory function is out as well. That doesn't leave you with a whole lot. Nearly every organ has secretory functions even if they are not traditionally considered endocrine. Your heart produces natriuretic peptides reactively to blood pressure and distention. Endocrine organs are inconcievably complicated. The liver is basically a chemical factory. Kidney has endocrine properties even though it's not a traditional endocrine organ (EPO secretion, renin angiotensin aldosterone system). Even the lungs convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II and facilitate one of the most important mechanisms of blood pressure and volume control. But if you really need an answer, I'd say heart and lungs are the easiest to replace with synthetic ones. And I'd say liver, kidneys (No, hemodialysis does not replace kidney functions) and endocrine organs are the hardest in no particular order.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
