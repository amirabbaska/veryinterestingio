		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a super ELI5 it's the 80 - 20 rule. Really what it means is that the majority of your problems (80%) will come from a small amount of rootcauses (20%) or if you relate it to sales that the majority of your sales/revenue (80%) will come from a handful of clients (20%).</p>
<p>And how it helps in decision making is that it helps you focus on what's important. For instance in the industry I work in (Supply chain) when we look at quality errors/complaints you tend to find that the majority of them (give or take 80%) tend to be caused by the same small group of rootcauses (say 20%).</p>
<p>So if you now turn this around and look at all your problems, and then focus on fixing the top 20% of them you will have fixed the majority of your customer complaints (roughly 80%). And this helps you allocate resources. It makes sense to put the most amount of effort/best quality resources on fixing this 20%. The remaining 80% of problems are less important and go down on the priority list. </p>
<p>So really what it does is it tells you to focus on the small group of problems that are causing the majority of your problems.  (Or focus on improving the relationship/upselling to your small group of customers that buy the most of your product/service) </p>
<p>keep in mind it's a rule of thumb and not an exact science. It just helps making quick decisions on where to focus your effort and resources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The principle states that 20% of the invested input is responsible for 80% of the results obtained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, say I want to tidy up my bathroom, but don't want to spend all morning going over every square inch.  I spend a couple of minutes looking for the tasks that would make the biggest difference and do those.  If I choose wisely, I can make the bathroom look 80% as good as a full top-to-bottom cleaning with 1/5 of the effort.</p>
<p>On trickier tasks, identifying the 20% of work to do is harder.  Experience helps.  Tools like statistics and Gantt charts can help, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<li>
<p>The Pareto principle states that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
The simplest way to visualize (and used almost everywhere to explain Pareto principle) is the iceberg. Only 20% of the iceberg is above the sea level, while the rest is submerged, invisible to us.
Other cases:
80% of sales come from 20% of customers.
20% of patients have been found to use 80% of healthcare resources.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In decision making, the 80-20 ratio is not as important as the thought behind it.</p>
</li>
<li>Imagine a situation in which customers of a particular car model complain about the constant breakdowns the car goes through. The company decides to do something about it - and after a lot of number-crunching,  decides to give Sam (the manager) $100,000 to fix the problem. </li>
</ol>
<p>Sam needs to decide where to invest the $100,000 so that the customer complains go down. What does he do? </p>
<p>Each time a car breaks down, it can be traced back to a car component that malfunctions. Sam did an operations course as part of in-job training and has heard about the Pareto principle. </p>
<p>If Sam decides to follow the Pareto principle approach to decide where to invest $100,000, Sam will study all the breakdowns that the company has serviced. He now has a list of all each breakdown and the component that malfunctioned next to it. He will count the number of times a component caused a breakdown. He notices that a vital few components help explain most of the breakdowns. </p>
<p>He decides to invest the $100,000 in drastically improving ONLY the vital components. The result? Most of the breakdowns have stopped. </p>
<p>In the real world, it will be hard to say that exactly 20% of the car components will explain 80% of the breakdowns. However, we can definitely say that a vital few car components will explain most the breakdowns. Or in other words, Sam decided to invest in &quot;vital few component, over trivial many components&quot; </p>
<p>[ I hope this helps you. It's the first time I'm posting on this Subreddit. If there's any way I can explain it better, please do share :) ]</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea of a Pareto chart is it will let you bin things into categories.  If I am building a widget for sales and they keep getting returned to me as the manufacturer, I can use this process to determine where to focus my improvement efforts.</p>
<p>So I make up general causes or returns based on similar categories:</p>
<p>Wrong size</p>
<p>Wrong color</p>
<p>Broken in shipment</p>
<p>Broken before shipment/not put together right</p>
<p>Then I take all the return reasons and bin them into these general categories.  Then I chart it out. Usually it is more than 4 categories but you get the idea. What I may find is that 3 of these each have about 5% of the returns making up only 15% of returns. </p>
<p>But maybe &quot;broken in shipment&quot; represents 85% fo the returns. SO I focus my decision making and improvement on that. I contract for a new shipper. Or we package them differently. Butthios is the area where I can get the most return for my invested money in research and improvement. </p>
<p>This decision tool helps you make decisions based on facts/actual numbers. Without doing the research/binning of the reasons you may actually have the idea that color being wrong might be the biggest problem in your widgets because the complaints phone line has tons of calls listed for wrong color, but only a few for broken calls.  That could be due to the nature of your widget, When it is the wrong color they just complain, if it is broken, they just send it back for a refund with no complaint call.</p>
<p>It can be hard for a business to figure out what is not profitable and what will make them more profitable. It is very easy to get caught in perceptions and make decisions based on the wrong info or anecdotal info. </p>
<p>You need to figure out what part of the process to improve. Where does spending a little money get us the most bang for the buck? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>80% of these comments are trash and will get few if any upvotes.  20% of them will be at the top and will get 80% of the karma. </p>
<p>In a normal distribution, things regress towards the mean. You have an average, some people are better than average, some people are worse, but on average people are ok. </p>
<p>Pareto is not a normal distribution. It is a power law probability, and the average can go fuck themselves. The winners are really going to win. </p>
<p>See that bear over there? It fucks. A lot. It gets most of the food, fucks most of the lady bears, and has most of the stuff. </p>
<p>See those other 5 bears over there? They are loser bears who will be lucky to survive the winter. </p>
<p>How does this help in decision making? It basically says that you can say fuck it to 80% of things, they do not matter. </p>
<p>Those 20% of things are REALLLLY important. They are everything, if you can control those things, you will get most everything. </p>
<p>20% of people smoke 80% of the weed. If you are selling weed, you want to sell it to these heavy users and skip the looky-loos. </p>
<p>Pareto principal works with things that can are not bounded, like money. You have a few dudes with all the money and most everyone else with nothing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
