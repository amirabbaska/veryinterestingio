		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They know how to pronounce all their names because they are very knowledgable about the sport and have heard/seen all players many many times. Probably for years while they are in college. They know all of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of my friends is a sports caster out in Nebraska and I asked him the same thing years ago(he casts football games). He said that he spends an average of 20-30 hours studying for every game he calls, from memorizing the pronunciations of players names, the number they wear, stats they are known for as well as interviewing players to get little known facts about their lives. In addition to this, the casters have producers who are constantly combing though a database about these players and feeding this information to that caster though an ear piece. They can give them up to date facts about the players, as well as what was seen in different shots and different camera angels. He let me see the inside camera once from their booth and hear the audio feed from the producers(This is what they use to help themselves get better and even have a breakdown session after each game). It may seem like a great gig from the outside, about the amount of work and stress that actually goes into calling a game well is incredible. Much respect. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Media guides that are available in the press box have certain players' names spelled phonetically. These guides are given out each game and include names from players on visiting teams. Broadcasters review this leading up to the game. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's about practicing. Most people get really offended if you can't even attempt to pronounce their name properly, so they are generally giving you as much help as possible to get it right if you just ask them.</p>
<p>Many international sports events come with a cheat sheet with phonetic pronunciations of names, so that the hosts at least can try to pronounce names correctly.</p>
<p>That is really all it takes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
