		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were a lot of things that made her unpopular and worthy of protest. The straw that broke the camel's back was her relationship with a cult leader. A news organization found a laptop in the trash. Files on the laptop proved that Park Geun-Hye was giving confidential information to a cult leader, asking for advice, and even allowing the cult leader to edit her speeches. The cult leader was not elected or part of the government, so giving her confidential data was illegal.</p>
<p>That clearly illegal act started the impeachment process. Her approval rating dropped down to 1% and massive protests started. The Korean legislative body and the highest court both removed her from office (Korean law requires both the legislative and judicial branches to agree to an impeachment).</p>
<p>After she was forced out as President, she could no longer continue covering up or blocking investigations into her other crimes, such as bribery. Charges continued piling up against her as investigations found more evidence of more illegal acts. It would be hard to give a list of every crime she committed to warrant a long prison sentence, but suffice it to say that she was accepting bribes often, She also stole public money and facilitated money laundering by organized crime.</p>
<p>Two of her other crimes which have got a lot of attention:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sewol Ferry disaster. It was one of the biggest disasters in Korea's modern history. A large passenger ferry capsized, killing hundreds of high school students. The magnitude of the tragedy brought the entire nation together: the entire nation <em>except</em> Park Geun-Hye. Not only did she seem unaffected by the tragedy (going to a salon to get her hair done as soon as she heard about it), but she actively (and criminally) blocked investigation into its causes. There were a lot of things that went wrong to cause the disaster, but the government's unwillingness to enforce safety regulations was seen as a big one.</li>
<li>Blacklisting in the media. There had been rumours that journalists or comedians critical of Park Geun-Hye unfairly got blacklisted from television. It later came out that this was real, deliberate, and orchestrated by Park Geun-Hye herself in an attempt to control her image in the media.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People here are saying she was sharing info with a cult leader. Not exactly true. She was more or less a puppet of a small elite circle. The literal stuff conspiracies are made of. All of her decisions had to pass through their main leader. So it's not like she was just passing info. She was directed by an unelected shadow government.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
