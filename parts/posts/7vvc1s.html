		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their skin cells divide to increase surface area. Individual cells have limited elasticity and if they simply stretched to cover the increased fat tissue underneath, it would be like blowing up a balloon (e.g. getting thinner). In fact, more than just the skin cells help cover the area. Blood vessels, connective tissue, the fat cells themselves all have to accommodate the increased tissue volume. As a corollary, when someone has massive weight loss, you can see the large amount of loose and excess skin. The signals from the body to make the skin cells divide to cover the larger area can't just reverse instantaneously (you also have issues with looser connective tissue, loss of elasticity of various components, etc.) so now you have large folds of skin hanging around. </p>
<p>EDIT: Forgot to respond to your follow-up. You can have issues with less touch sensitivity but it's hard to say that it's just because of less nerve endings (your nerves can make new connections so you still have touch sensations). More often, losing feeling in really any part of your body (bodybuilders with massive skeletal muscles, areas of fat deposits) is a combination of factors like poor blood flow to the cells rather than just not enough nerve endings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Source: I'm a plastic surgeon.</p>
<p>The phenomenon you are asking about is termed &quot;tissue expansion&quot; and is a phenomenon we use frequently in our practices to reconstruct defects such as after breast cancer.  Patients will have their breast tissue removed (some skin, lots of subcutaneous fat, all of the breast parenchyma) and will have a smaller pocket than what they are looking for aesthetically speaking.  We place basically inflatable balloons into the skin pocket and slowly expand the balloon over the next 5-6 weeks until the pocket will fit a more normal-appearing silicone or saline implant to reconstruct the breast.</p>
<p>To answer your question more specifically, tissue expansion works by 2 main functions.  Mechanical expansion, aka &quot;creep&quot; happens when you pull skin very tightly and occurs immediately.  This occurs like others have said due to the elastin component of your skin microfragmenting, thins the skin out, and decreases the water content of the cells.  It also causes your collagen fibrils to line up in parallel to the direction of force  True tissue expansion over weeks or years or that occurs during pregnancy or obesity is known as &quot;biological expansion,&quot; which causes cell division, fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis, and mitosis via transduction pathways.  Thickness of the expanded skin IS less (with the exception of the epidermis, which thickens).  It does not return to normal thickness until about 2 years.  The one caveat to this is that pregnancy has a ton of hormonal influence on every cell in the body, so these changes will be markedly different.  Obesity has endocrine abnormalities and metabolic disturbances as well, so there are some other slight differences.</p>
<p>Stretch marks are areas of attenuated dermis.  Dermis is the strength layer of the skin so areas with stretch marks are weaker components.</p>
<p>In contrary to what many people are posting here, there is NO GOOD WAY TO TIGHTEN SKIN NONSURGICALLY.  Regardless of how you lose your weight, you are decreasing the fat content (either by shrinking the cells or causing fat necrosis) but the skin will not change significantly.  Some options do exist for VERY MODEST skin tightening, such as dermabrasion, lasers, chemical peels, etc; but these are much more relevant for wrinkles than significant skin tightening.  This is why massive weight loss patients virtually always require surgery.  It has nothing to do with the speed with which they lose weight you simply cannot get your skin to shrink without sharp excision.</p>
<p>EDIT: in addition, lipo only removes fat.  Does not tighten skin.  Ultrasound assisted liposuction causes some thermal damage which again can cause a VERY MILD skin tightening.  This is why fat people who get lipo don't get amazing results without concomitant skin resection.</p>
<p>About the nerves.  Don't forget that your 2-point discrimination or sensitivity to touch is different in different parts of your body (you can feel &lt;1mm difference in your fingertips but it's not abnormal to have 5mm or more on your back).  I can't comment directly on if stretched skin reduces 2-point discrimination as I have not read anything regarding that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I've always found amazing by morbidly obese people (I've been watching My 600 lbs Life clips on YouTube recently) is that the human body can even get that massive. </p>
<p>Think about it.  For ~300,000 years it could be argued that no human ever reached even 400 lbs, let alone 800 (heaviest man so far is like 1,300 lbs!!!) The fact that the human body has the capability to reach such sizes and still stay alive, having absolutely no evolutionary necessity, is mind blowing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a related side-effect of new tissue growth: new blood vessel growth. Many tumors produce signaling molecules to trigger blood vessel growth, just to feed themselves. Many obese people suffer from high blood pressure because every new pound of fat adds roughly one mile of blood vessels. (Estimates vary, but all generally in excess of a mile.) So, larger tissue implies additional tissue, not just stretched tissue, including nerves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
