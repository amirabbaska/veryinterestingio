		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt. You have tons of salt in your body, it's in your blood, inside your cells, etc. It only takes a little bit of it to makeup the acid in the stomach. Your stomach lining secrets sodium and chlorine ions into your stomach, while reabsorbing the sodium. Meanwhile, proton pumps maintain the acidity of the stomach environment, and naturally the H+ ions pair up with the Chloride ions. The Sodium ends up balancing things out by being used to create sodium bicarbonate in the duodenum that is used to neutralize the stomach contents after they have passed through the stomach (this also effectively deactivates several enzymes that are optimized to work in acidic conditions).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the secretion of Cl^- was the cause of gastric acid, it would the stomach would be basic and not an acidic. And since HCL is a strong acid, H^+ would not be attracted to it. So I don't how u/rocketsocks explained it is the process. According to wikipedia, this is how the parietal cells produce HCL^-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hydrogen ions are formed from the dissociation of carbonic acid. Water is a very minor source of hydrogen ions in comparison to carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is formed from carbon dioxide and water by carbonic anhydrase.</p>
<p>The bicarbonate ion (HCO3−) is exchanged for a chloride ion (Cl−) on the basal side of the cell and the bicarbonate diffuses into the venous blood, leading to an alkaline tide phenomenon.</p>
<p>Potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl−) ions diffuse into the canaliculi.</p>
<p>Hydrogen ions are pumped out of the cell into the canaliculi in exchange for potassium ions, via the H+/K+ ATPase. These receptors are increased in number on luminal side by fusion of tubulovesicles during activation of parietal cells and removed during deactivation. This receptor maintains a million fold difference in proton concentration. ATP is provided by the numerous mitochondria.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TL;DR The parietal cells exchange H+ produced by the dissociation of bicarbonate for potassium in the stomach</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dietary intake of chloride ion in foods and by addition of sodium chloride to food. Stomach parietal cells actively secrete hydrogen ions into the lumen and chloride ion follows to maintain electroneutrality through chloride channels in the apical membrane. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
