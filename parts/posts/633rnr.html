<p>The rate at which a lithium-ion cell is damaged varies based on how far the cell is from its nominal voltage (~3.7V). The voltage limits for your device are chosen to balance the total cycles, and the capacity available. The deeper you discharge the cells the quicker it will die. So if you are looking to conserve your cells life, it is best to only partially discharge the battery between recharges, 40-70% Depth of Discharge results in a pretty good balance. </p>
<p>Battery University is typically a good resource for lithium-ion related questions:<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most probably your phone occasionally starts getting terrible battery life because there's some app or process running in the background that's using up your battery. When you let the battery run out, the phone shuts down, and that app or process gets killed. This can be a hung process that's using up all the cycles in a cpu core, or something more subtle, a poorly written app that for instance stops the wifi from dropping to power saving mode when it's idle.    </p>
<p>As dragoneye said, it's not good for your lithium-ion battery to either completely discharge it, or to keep it 100% charged all the time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No you do not want to over discharge for long extended cycle. Even though most battery do have voltage protection, continuous discharge until depletion can cause two problem: mechanical degradation of the cathode and side reaction with electrode or electrolyte. If the battery is brand new you could do it for few times just to induce crack (increase surface area) but if the battery is already in its 1-2 years of use you want to avoid it. </p>

<p>There's no real measure of &quot;mAh left&quot; in the cell.  Your phone estimates the life of the battery by knowing a few things</p>
<ul>
<li>The battery's full voltage (typically 4.2v)</li>
<li>The battery's &quot;empty&quot; voltage (typically something a little over 3.0v)</li>
<li>The rate in change of the voltage over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Newer phones might have better sensors to measure current in various components (gpu/cpu/screen/bt/radio/etc) to improve accuracy.</p>
<p>But more or less your phone's software is learning how long it takes (with various loads) to change voltage.  E.g. (simplified) if every 0.1v change takes an hour than from [say] 4.2v to 3.0v you have &quot;12 hours&quot; of battery left.  So if the battery reads 3.8v then you have &quot;8 hours left&quot;</p>
<p>Of course that's just made up numbers for starters the change in voltage isn't linear.  It also depends on load.  An idle device obviously will stay at the same voltage for longer, etc.</p>
<p>But that's the gist of it.</p>
<p>On older phones you can mess up the software by having non-typical power usage.  E.g. do a heavy load on the battery and the next cycle the OS might think that you have less power left than you do.  Not unlike how cars do distance left on the fuel remaining.  If I do a lot of city driving my car might tell me on a full tank I have 400km left but if I do a lot of highway it might say 550km.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
