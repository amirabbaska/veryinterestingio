		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, Hydrogen bonds form between sulphur that is in keratin in your hair and the water molecules. They're relatively strong bonds so they can retain shape.
Also, this is used when getting a 'perm' - they add  ammonium thioglycolate (afaik - might be any generic reducing agent) to your hair which react with the keratin to release the sulphur molecules to form semi-permanent hydrogen bonds. These retains the hairs shape until it eventually washes out after some time.
Alternatively, when getting your hair chemically straightened they add calcium hydroxide or some other non-lye based straighteners to reduce the number of disulphide bonds in the proteins that are in your hair, causing it to be less frizzy or curly. </p>
