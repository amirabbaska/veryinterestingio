		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends what pill you take and if you stay in bed or not. If you take something like an OTC antihistamine based sleep aid, you’ll most likely feel very drowsy and lethargic all day. If you take a proper benzodiazepine based hypnotic and stay in bed, you’ll knock out for sure. It depends on how active you are, what time of day it is, what you’ve had to eat and how much sleep you had prior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no straight answer for this question unfortunately. There are quite a lot of different types of sleeping pills and everyone reacts to them differently so it could range from it having zero effect at all, to making you feel like a zombie for half the day, to knocking you out of course. But the worst side effects of sleeping pills are the blackouts where you are up and awake but have zero recollection of what you did once the drug wears off, and of course you are walking around high as hell. It also makes you extremely impulsive, sometimes paranoid and you can even have extremely vivid hallucinations in some cases. But not the good kind of hallucinations so I definitely don't recommend it. There are actually quite a lot of cases of people taking sleeping pills and waking up in jail. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've mistakenly taken Ambien twice right away in the morning, accidentally mixing it up with my Lipitor.  </p>
<p>I thought about forcing myself to throw up, but I powered on through it.  30 minutes of intense sleepiness,  followed by 30 minutes of intense goofiness, followed by a nice warm fuzzy feeling.  </p>
<p>You can power through it if you want, or you can give in and go right back to sleep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/E4cKD9iTWHaE7f3AJ/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know" target="_blank">Melatonin: Much More Than You Wanted To Know</a> explains a bit about how melatonin works. Melatonin is a hormone that influences your sleep cycle. It also specifically addresses your question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if you want to go to sleep (and wake up) later? Our understanding of the melatonin cycle strongly suggests melatonin taken first thing upon waking up would work for this, but as far as I know this has never been formally investigated. The best I can find is researchers saying that they think it would happen and being confused why no other researcher has investigated this.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've taken half a prescription strength sleeping pill two times in my life and both times I couldn't wake up for at least 24 hours. I might just be super sensitive to them but I can say with great certainty I'd just fall back asleep, no matter what I was doing, if I took one right after waking up. I think it really depends on the person and the strength of the pill though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
