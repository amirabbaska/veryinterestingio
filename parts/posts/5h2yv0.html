		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ryanair does not &quot;offer a multitude of flights for less than $10 USD&quot;: It sells a small handful of flights at that price, and the vast majority for way more. And even for the few sold at that price, you have to turn yourself into a pretzel to avoid all of the hidden fees which typically inflate your ticket price to cost just as much as a traditional airline, and then some.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have some pretty cheap airlines between very specific city lists... check out Frontier or Spirit.  Frontier I know goes between a select set of cities for like $30 to $70.  The discount is  not quite the same order of magnitude as something like Ryanair, but it was low enough to be surprising to me.  There's no service and you pay for luggage, etc. but if you're just looking to spend a weekend in Vegas you could do worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lack of competition in the form of rail, unlike Europe. I'd also venture to guess that a lot of American airports are at a pain-point distance from each other in terms of drivability, whereas maybe less so in Europe - particulally in the central part of the US. Literally flyover country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
