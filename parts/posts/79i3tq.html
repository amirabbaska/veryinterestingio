<p>Bonus question: how different are snails and slugs? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shell is attached by the inner surface, and it grows a bit like a toenail. Snails and slugs are not exactly taxonomic terms, but in general they're actually pretty far apart. </p>
<p>Assuming you're talking about just land ones, snails are generally herbivores while slugs will eat anything. Dead animals, insects, plants, mushrooms, worms, and all sorts of things will get eaten by slugs while snails will <em>usually</em> stay away from most of that. There are carnivorous land snails though and many water snails also eat meat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the snail grows, adds to the &quot;leading edge&quot; of its shell. So the small twist at the top never gets bigger; the snail just adds more rotations as it grows. Most snails will max out at a certain size, but some marine species will grow indefinitely.  </p>
<p>The snail's shell is made of calcium carbonate, the same material as eggshells and oyster shells. </p>
<p>Slugs are all over the place. The majority of land slugs <em>are</em> in the same order as snails (Sigmurethra), so they're basically shell-less snails. But some land slugs are in a totally different order, more closely related to sea snails. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
