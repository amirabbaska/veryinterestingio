<p>How does this disappearing purple effect work? Do all these products use the same compounds or mechanism to produce this effect? Why is it purple and not some other color? Can someone explain this at a layman level?</p></div></div>

<p>Briefly, the color of something can depend on the environment, particularly the polarity of the solvent. When the solvent evaporates, the environment changes and so does the color.</p>
<p>Less likely possibilities are the dye being volatile and evaporating or the color not really changing, just the amount used is small enough that you can't detect the color in a thin layer like you can in a thick bottle.</p>
<p>If you have particular products in mind, we can try to find the composition and determine if one of these hypotheses is correct. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another possibility (although I don't know if this is responsible in your case) is simply that the large dye molecules, when hit by UV radiation, sometimes break apart into non-colourful smaller molecules. Since sunlight contains UV radiation (it's what tans our skin), anything that spends a long time in the sun might fall victim to this effect. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
