		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question is literally almost as old as recorded history, being (to my knowledge) first asked and discussed by Plato, in his <em>Theaetetus</em>, and the answer to this day is still: we don't know.</p>
<p>The reason I refer to philosophy is not just for the sake of historical context, but because the question is necessarily two-fold: on the one hand there is the philosophical perspective, concerned with what it <em>means</em> for the brain to 'reach out' to 'bits' of information that is physically stored somewhere; on the other hand there is the (neuro)physiological perspective, which simply aims to measure what interact at what times and quantities when the brain reaches out to its information.</p>
<p>See, even if we were to identify that part A and part B of the brain are activated when we remember language, and that part X and part Y fire up when we think of imagery or emotions, then we still have no clue what it means to know these things: for example, I know my name is VehaMeursault, but when I'm eating food or doing maths, am I still 'knowing' my name, or do I not know <em>until</em> I actively think about it and retrieve that fact from wherever in my brain it is stored?</p>
<p>Also, although we can identify areas in the brain that pertain to specific types of phenomena (thinking of music light us different part of the brain than thinking of speech or maths), we still cannot perfectly map those thoughts of phenomena, because there are no dedicated particles in play. There is no 'neurone #A018' that is exclusively lit up when you think of 'Careless Whisper', or a 'neurone #X24' when you're having an orgasm. This is because (it seems that) it's not the neurone itself that stores information (like a CD or DVD would) but rather the <em>organisation</em> of neurones. </p>
<p>Think of the alphabet: no letter in itself informs you of anything much, but by organising 26 different letters we can suddenly create entire languages! Even if a language could only use 5-letter words, there would still be 12million unique words one could make with 26 letters!</p>
<p>In a similar way, the organisation of non-specific neurones seems to be what makes 'information'.</p>
<p>Finally: <em>even if we did</em> manage to map it all and to confidently say &quot;this part of the brain does that, and that part does this,&quot; then we would still be stuck at the problem of experience: <em>even if</em> your brain and my brain would light up <em>exactly</em> the same way when you and I both eat chocolate, then we would <em>still</em> not know if you and I are experiencing the same phenomena.</p>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
<p>The question is a tricky one to answer, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>it involves <em>experience</em> (and thus philosophy) on the one hand, and </p>
</li>
<li>because it involves mapping the brain, which consists not of <em>dedicated pieces</em> of matter, but rather of a few types of particles whose <em>organisation</em> seems to hold the keyâ€”a fact that would make it only harder because as I said with the language example: 5-letter words of 26 letters already make 12 million permutations possible, let alone hundreds of billions of neurones communicating at the speed of electricity.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't completely understood but we know some things about how it works.  We have 100 billion neurons that any one can connect to multiple others.  Any sensory input we have can make many connections.  But any single neural connection doesn't amount to anything mentally tangible and can be undone (short term memory).  Repetition makes multiple connections that basically maps out some concept in your brain.  Then, as you repeatedly traverse this mapped concept, or map whole other concepts together, the brain also processes these signals to form shortcuts for those &quot;mapped concepts&quot; with even more neural connections, so that accessing that stored information is faster.  The brain is continuously reconfiguring these connections based on the input it receives (what you are doing) so whatever is repeated most could be retrieved the fastest.  Trying to remember something is basically your brain looking for those shortcuts and if you were providing other sensory input, the reconfiguring to optimize whatever you were attentive would have used some of those neurons. Things you remember very easily, the connections were repeated enough to make so many connections that they'd never be completely undone again in your lifetime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain is soft like porridge, but contains several* thread-like cells called neurons. The neurons are tied together in different circuits. Scientists know that electricity flows through these neurons and can trace the flow. Scientists can also study individual neurons, but because there are so many of them, they can only study a selected few at a single point in time.</p>
<p>One part of the brain contains a special circuit, called the hippocampus. One patient once needed surgery because there was some misswiring of the neurons, which caused epilepsy. Today, this type of surgery is a rare choice of treatment, but the doctors had no better option back then in trying to relieve the patient from the suffering that his epilepsy caused. They removed the hippocampus. The consequence was that the today famous patient - Henry Molaison - could not remember things in the long-term.</p>
<p>Scientists know that the hippocampus is crucial for long-term memories, but despite decades of research, little is known about the nature of the storage of memories. One very likely explanation is the formation of very small proteins that grow on the tree-like part of the neuron - the dendrites. Memories are probably stored like small buds on a tree with many branches and each neuron in the hippocampus has multiple &quot;trees&quot; like this.</p>
<p>The many dendrites of neurons reach out to other neurons and receive electricity from them. This electricity is then passed on to a single branch of the neuron called the axon. In one part of the hippocampus there is a loop between the neurons, which probably means that there is some kind of rehearsal mechanism, as the electricity passes around the loop multiple times. This could strengthen the memories that are important to remember.</p>
<p>Although the hippocampus is very important for creating new memories, other parts of the brain are just as important in recovering stored information. The interaction between the deeply seated hippocampus and the rest of the bark-like part of the brain - the cortex - interact when processing memories, both during storing and retrieval.</p>
<p>When neurons get continuously excited in the same circuit, over and over again, the neurons become trained to give a stronger signal. The result is what we call long-term potentiation (LTP). This is one of the major ways that learning works in the brain. When retrieving memories, the strength of the connections between different neurons could determine what should be remembered. The principle behind the idea that &quot;Neurons that fire together, wire together&quot; is called Hebbian learning.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something to do with synapses + action potentials + repetition = strengthening of occurrence of action potentials + increase in number of synaptic clefts and bonding regions = increasing number of neurons relating to that memory or already established neurons have stronger connections</p>
<p>Memory is &quot;stored&quot; in these neurons and when they are not used often they become weak and recycled so you forget useless stuff, when neurons are damaged physically (ie. Blunt force, concussion) by external force, or physically by internal force (ie. Stroke brain hemorrhage, plaques related to dementia in old age) the neurons die and cannot be regenerated. </p>
<p>I don't know the exact process of the searching part but I imagine when you're searching, you're also recollecting related images, sounds, other related memories of this instance and these processes happen to fire and set off relating nearby neurons and they keep firing off others that are connected until a region is triggered that allows you to recall that desired targeted memory. </p>
<p>Sorry if this isn't helpful, I've learnt it many times as a student but never really paid that much attention, I had a background in physiology and science psychology. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in artificial intelligence and I can give you a different perspective on how intelligent systems store memory. In AI we study the brain because it's our best natural example of intelligence. </p>
<p>Let's work through an example. Your intelligent system uses a camera to see with. It sees an apple and an orange. When the light hits the grid of optical sensors, each sensor responds differently. This response signal is then interpreted. You have to somehow get from &quot;this is a pattern of lights&quot; to &quot;this is an apple and an orange&quot;. That's where your memory comes in. Your system has some idea of what an apple is. That idea is called a model and is comprised of the different features of an apple. Apples are red or yellow, have a certain shape, taste, and feel. Your apple model accounts for the variances of size, texture, taste, etc. so you're not keeping a perfect record of every apple you've ever encountered but instead a record of the types of apples and their characteristics. The same is true for an orange. When your system assesses the image, it's not looking for an apple or an orange; it's looking for characteristics that tell them apart. If it sees red instead of orange, it can stop looking for characteristics of an orange. Once it has determined that that portion of the image contains an apple, it updates its apple model to account for the new experience. Sometimes it's a big change but most of the time no change is required. </p>
<p>Your human brain works the same way. When you think of an apple, you think of what sets it apart from everything that's not an apple. Your brain actually takes it a step farther and considers timing as a factor. You recognize dancing as a series of movements for a specific purpose usually to a beat. It's hard to formally define dancing because so many things share the characteristics of dancing (it's that way in all forms of art). One of our biggest strengths is our ability to abstract our own memories so that we can identify both an apple and an orange as fruit and then recognize other fruits without relating them to apples or oranges. </p>
<p>So in summary, you don't remember every little thing you've ever encountered but you remember what makes each type of thing unique. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
