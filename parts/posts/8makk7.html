		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suppose someone eats a berry, dies. Another person eats a berry, dies. The man who sees that there is a pattern here does not eat berry for fear of death. The person who does not see a pattern eats a berry and might die. So the pattern-finders survive and we keep this trait.</p>
<p>If the man was wrong, worst case scenario is we don't eat the berry until we're about to die anyway, so being wrong doesn't really punish people nearly as much, which is why you can overanalyze things sometimes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here’s an example I read once:</p>
<p>You know about pareidolia- seeing faces in random patterns? </p>
<p>What would would be worse for our ancestors in the bush, seeing a face where there isn’t one, or <em>not</em> seeing a face when there <em>is</em> one? The second would be worse- it could be an enemy. It’s better to be safe than sorry, so pareidolia has remained a part of the human condition and wiring of the brain </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question has a flawed sort of conception.</p>
<p>Our brains find patterns.  Patterns sometimes <em>emerge</em> in random events.</p>
<p>For instance, if I take a coin and I flip it and it comes up heads 10 times in a row, my brain would notice the pattern and say: &quot;Hey, I bet that coin is weighted.&quot; Since there was only a 0.1% chance of that occurring.</p>
<p>But it is fully possible that it was a normal coin and you just got a statistically unlikely sequence of coincidences that produced a pattern that seems non-random.</p>
<p>There's literally no way to tell which is the case - you can guess at the likelihood, but until you do some external measure, like weighing the coin itself, you will never know.</p>
<p>However, were you to repeatably flip the coin, your certainty of the truth is likely to improve.  10 heads (or tails) in a row is a 1 in 1000 chance with a fair coin.  20 in a row is a 1 in a million chance.  30 in a row is one in a billion.</p>
<p>If you flip a coin and get 10 heads in a row, you can be <em>pretty</em> certain it's a weighted coin.  If you get 20 or 30 heads in a row... yeah, you're pretty much guaranteed that it's weighted.</p>
<p>The outcome of random events will <em>tend towards</em> the random distribution after many occurances.  But especially when you only take a few samples, it is quite possible for patterns to appear.  Coincidental Patterns indistinguishable from true patterns.  And since our brain picks out patterns - we notice them.</p>
<p>Now, one related flaw with humans is that we might get a few samples of a process, determine a pattern that is more coincidence than underlying distribution, and then <em>fixate</em> on that pattern.  If I got 10 heads in a row, but then the next 20 flips were a fairly even assortment of heads and tails... it is likely that the coin is a typical coin with little or no tampering.  But if I anchored myself and said unequivocally: <em>&quot;No! This coin came up heads ten times in a row once! It's Definitely weighted!&quot;</em> I would probably be in error.  I'd be privileging the results of my first impression, my initial trials, over the total results across all trials.</p>
<p>Which in and of itself also isn't the worst instinct.  A departure from one behavior to a completely different behavior (seemingly weighted to seemingly fair) is itself a change worth noting.  Maybe someone swapped out your weighted coin for a fair one while you weren't looking, to try and pretend the coin was fair all along?  I mean, this concept is what a lot of magic tricks rely on.  There's really no way to be certain.  Just varying probabilities and expectations of those probabilities, based on models built from incomplete data.</p>
<p>So how do we balance it?  How to we ride the line between appropriate skepticism indicating true changes, and coincidences that grab our attention but ultimately are worth discarding as notable?  It's difficult, if not impossible to say.  Humans do a <em>decent</em> job of balancing the two, all things considered. But nothing is perfect. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every time your brain gets input from senses it compares to what you've experienced before so that you can understand what's going on. If you're experiencing something you've never experienced before your brain might try to link that new experience to something you've experienced before despite it being unrelated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
