<p>I've tried searching for maple syrup ripples/waves/evaporation/pattern but haven't found anything explaining this. I'm guessing it has to do with some of the water from the syrup evaporating, but not sure why it seems to dance around like this.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't be certain about this, but after doing some research I came across <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/zna.1977.32.issue-1/zna-1977-0109/zna-1977-0109.xml" target="_blank">this</a> paper, which describes periodic ripple formation in other media.</p>
<p>What could be happening here is that a very thin skin is forming on the surface of the syrup. As the pool evaporates, the total volume of syrup is decreasing and a compressive stress is applied to the skin as it shrinks. When the compressive stress reaches a certain limit, the skin buckles, causing the ripples.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a physical chemist so here's how I rationalize it: </p>
<p>Maple syrup is a saturated solution of sugars dissolved in water; any change in temperature on the saturated liquid will cause the sugars to solidify (aka &quot;crash out&quot;) in addition to the small amount of evaporation (increasing saturation). </p>
<p>Assuming that the syrup is warm, any air movement temporarily cools the surface or causes evaporation - causing the temperature to drop or increases the local concentration of sugars; allowing the sugars to crystallize and crash out momentarily. As the local temperature equilibrates with the overall temperature of the body of syrup, the crystals warm up and gets dissolved back into the liquid to repeat the process over again.</p>
<p>Crystallization can be very temperature dependent, so think about water that is right at the cusp of being solid and liquid simultaneously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It happens rhythmically, and I can see this being the result of someone getting really close to the syrup to see it better, thus making the effect stronger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the surface molecules vaporize, dropping in temp from the heat of vaporization, causing the top to temporarily solidify.  (The kinetic energy required for the vapor molecules is pulled as heat from the surroundings which cools and solidifies the surface) At this point there is no more vaporization, so the top layer absorbs heat and melts.  The pattern is likely caused by a slight movement of air or slight change in pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
