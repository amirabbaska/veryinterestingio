		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the morning it's usually because you've been dehydrated due to sleep or if symptoms just arose, you aren't used to it. In the evening, because of being tired and talking all day, you get worn out. Just think of going to a sporting event all night yelling then getting home and having a sore throat. Wear and tear of everyday things just exaggerates your ailment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In your case, if you have a stuffy nose, then you will mouth breathe the entire night when you sleep and dry your throat out, hence more throat pain when you wake up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It maybe due to Autonomic nervous system, at the evening, nigth and morning hours, the body is stimulated by parasympathetic system leading to bronchoconstriction, mucus secretions to rise and adrenaline secretion to drop. This could make you feel weaker and make harder to breath.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I find it depends on what I have.</p>
<p>A Cold, Flu, I feel better in the morning worse as the day progresses.</p>
<p>Bacterial infections, I feel horrible in the morning and better as the day progresses.</p>
<p>If you routinely feel bleh in the morning, drink a big glass of water before sleeping.  You may be dehydrating since u are going 6+ hours without any water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
