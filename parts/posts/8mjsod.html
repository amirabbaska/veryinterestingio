		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is why they use iodine in halogen lamps. The lamps is filled with iodine gas. Evaporated tungsten will react with iodine and return to the filament where it will split and the tungsten deposits on the filament. Then the filament can have a higher temperature giving better light without burning off the filament to rapid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure, just heat it to a high enough temperature and they'll enter a gaseous phase.</p>
<p>Sometimes you don't even need much. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpZF88fqrl8" target="_blank">Mercury at room temperature evaporates slightly</a>, sufficiently to pose a chemical hazard.</p>
<p>In the past, some places that used a lot of liquid mercury used to have some mercury pooled under the floorboards, because it would evaporate and condense back to liquid form.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not just metals.  Most substances CAN be in a gaseous state at a high enough temp and low enough pressure.</p>
<p>Now, like, wood can't, not as wood.  At a high temp wood will self-decompose (even without oxygen) and release gas which is not &quot;wood&quot; anymore.</p>
<p>Carryin &quot;wood&quot; further, it decomposes into gas and ash, ash is mostly calcium carbonate, which has no boiling point because IT decomposes first into solid quicklime and CO2 gas, at about 840 째C.  This is not &quot;burning away&quot;, no oxygen is used.  The calcium carbonate just splits by itself, you can't stop it.</p>
<p>Quicklime (calcium oxide) boils at 2,850 째C.  So, THAT.  If you heat wood to 2,850째C in a vacuum, you will get nothing but gas- first flammable woodgas and ash, then the ash becomes CO2 leaving calcium oxide, then calcium oxide becomes gas, leaving.... nothing solid at all.</p>
<p>Uranium boils to a gas at 4131째C, btw.</p>
<p>Also, there may be a limit on calling it a &quot;gas&quot; in that before it gets hot enough to be a gas, it self-ionizes and becomes a plasma first.  Which is like a gas in many ways, but defined differently.</p>
<p>Also, like CO2, pretty sure if it's hot enough the carbon and oxygen don't stay together as CO2. </p>
<p>Carbon burns to CO2 if you have oxygen.  But if you don't have oxygen, it evaporates to a carbon gas at 3915 K.  There is no liquid stage.  It sublimates. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
