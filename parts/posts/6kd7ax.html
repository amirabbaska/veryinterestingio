		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, we know the chemical compound responsible for the effect - nepetalactone. It binds to receptors in the olfactory tissue (the cat smells it, basically), and that leads to the characteristic effects in most cats. A minority of cats don't respond to it. It's not just domestic cats that are affected, other cat species respond similarly, even big cats like leopards and tigers.</p>
<p>I'm not sure the specifics of the signaling have been studied in-depth, but it seems like catnip is spuriously activating the cat's pheromone recognition. That's supported by the fact that only sexually mature cats react.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is a nice summary of the effects of catnip on cats, written by Ronald K. Siegel in the book Intoxication: The Universal Drive for Mind-Altering Substances. I believe that it gives a reasonable response to your question, which, is more or less, we don't have a good way of knowing what hey are experiencing, and whether or not they are hallucinating, but we can suppose that they are:</p>
<p>&quot;Do cats also hallucinate on the plant? It could be argues that we have no way of knowing whether another animal is hallucinating. But animals might confirm the presence of hallucinations by responding to them, trying to grasp them, track them, avoid them, or in some other way behaving as if things were actually there. Much of the behavior of cats under the influence of catnip suggests that they are having such false perceptions. When cats gaze vacantly in no particular direction, their accompanying actions indicate that they are seeing things. Some cats will paw and play with 'phantom butterflies' in the air; others lower their ears and pounce on 'invisible mice'; still others show fear and hiss in the absence of any other animal or object.&quot;</p>
<p>I think more interesting is the information a few paragraphs higher. It suggests that catnip may more closely approximate an aphrodisiac than a hallucinogen:
&quot;The nature of the pleasurable intoxication becomes increasingly evident when high doses of catnip in the form of concentrated extracts are offered to the animals. The subsequent reactions are intense: cats head-twitch violently, salivate profusely, and show other signs of central nervous system excitation. One sign is sexual stimulation. Males have spontaneous erections while femals adopt mating stances, complete with vocalization and 'love-biting' of any available object.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While on the subject, can i just ask why do some people give this to their cats?<br />
Sorry if its a stupid question but i come from a country where we dont do it.<br />
If you asked a random person here about catnip they wouldn't know what you were talking about.</p>
<p>Im genuinely curious. I asked a few years ago but people just said &quot;Because they like it&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
