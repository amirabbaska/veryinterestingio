		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do.  An electron at room temperature has about 25meV of thermal kinetic energy, which correlates to a speed of 100 km/s in a random direction.  Conversely, they have a mass of 9.11 x 10^-31 kg, which means, assuming g=9.81, in 1 second they will fall:</p>
<p>(1/2)(9.81)(1)^2 ~ 5 m. </p>
<p>So if we assume their random thermal motion was entirely horizontal (just to create a picture of the relative magnitudes), in a given second they will make it 100,000 meters to the right, and 5 meters down.  That's just their thermal velocity, if you accelerate them horizontally...</p>
<p>The point is gravity plays a non-zero but thoroughly negligible role in the dynamics of an electron. (Barring specific experiments specifically designed around the influence of gravity on electrons).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electron beams are attracted by Earth - but the force is completely negligible in all setups we can build today. Electrons have a huge charge to mass ratio. With current technology we cannot produce a region where the gravitational force is more important than the electromagnetic force.</p>
<p>If we could do that, a <em>very</em> slow electron beam could get deflected notably by gravity. This wouldn't be very interesting for electrons, but we could test the gravitational attraction on antimatter that way - which would be very interesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, gravity does influence the electron beam, and given that a storage ring (like an electron synchrotron for example) could have electrons whizzing round for minutes/hours, you'd think the electrons would drop off.</p>
<p>A big part about modern accelerators (especially synchrotrons) is focusing the beams- all particles have some displacement in the x, y and z directions from the centre of the bunch. So as a particle gets too far away from the centre of the bunch it will either get guided back towards the center by focusing magnets/some other cooling mechanism or it will be lost from the beam.</p>
<p>Not an expert in this field fyi, but doing my masters in physics and have done courses on particle accelerator physics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
