		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the main source of sustainable weight loss is through breathing. You can of course lose mass by sweating and peeing, but that is not sustainable as most of that loss is water which needs to be replaced for proper function of organs. Weight loss (specifically of fat) follows the same formula as burning gasoline:</p>
<p>fat molecules CnHmO6 (rough chemical formula of a component of fat) are oxidized by O2 to produce CO2 and H2O. The CO2 is expelled through breath, the H2O is, as mentioned before, added to the overall water balance of the organism. Since the majority of the mass of the fat molecule is stored in the Carbon (roughly 4-6 times more massive than hydrogen on a weighted average in fat molecules), the majority of the mass is lost through production and exhalation of CO2.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a fun question to ask people, because, as you did, most people guess poop.</p>
<p>You lose the weight through breathing and releasing carbon dioxide. That being said, if you're heavy and trying to lose weight, don't just start breathing in and out quickly, you'll just hyperventilate.</p>
<p>Similar to the question of how a tree grows wood. People guess it sucks up nutrients, ect form the soil, but the mass (wood) on trees and plants is all from the carbon dioxide in the air that it takes in through photosynthesis, but I digress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Here a simplified version of how our bodies metabolize food:</p>

<p>There's a bunch of chemistry to go from fatty acids to Acetyl Co A, and then that feeds into the citric acid cycle (a bunch more chemistry), and you get energy + CO2 from that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A follow up question if I may:</p>
<p>Given you can lose weight without exercise my assumption here is that the rate of breath is mostly inconsequential. Does that mean a person &quot;burning fat&quot; has a higher concentration of CO2 in their breath?</p>
<p>Does that mean we can lab analyze the fat loss rate of an individual in that instant by some calculation of rate of breath against CO2 concentration?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
