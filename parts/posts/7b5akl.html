		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much like in an RV.  There are tanks to hold clean water, typically refilled with a hose at the ends of the line.  These are usually mounted above the sinks and toilets, so gravity delivers the water.</p>
<p>The drains all connect to storage tanks under the cars, which are pumped out at the end of the line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can chime in on this as I maintain trains for a living. Trains are filled on either end of the train set via a potable fill inlet. The water is then pressurized (for our train sets it's set at 4.5 bar) . </p>
<p>To fill you purge the water system of air via cutout cocks or valves . Fill the water until it is spitting out the bottom much like an rv and an overfill hole. Then you return the cutout cocks to position to bring the system back to a pressurized 4.5bar supplying the trainset with water </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trains, like planes, have storage tanks for potable water. These are refilled either at major stops, or back at the yard at the end of the day. They also have waste storage tanks to captures the waste water, and that is pumped out, again at designated stops or back at the yard. There would be a pair of tanks like that at each car with a restroom in it.   </p>
<p>As far as &quot;management&quot;, the fixtures are often low-flow types to use as little water as possible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a summer maintaining railcars: every individual car has a potable water tank for sinks and bars and blackwater tank for toilets. The Grey water (soapy water or rinse water) was fed in a drain system that emptied onto the track below. All of the cars were outfitted with valves on either end to hook up to a flexible food grade hose that would sit slack between the cars. We would have to bleach all fittings before hooking up hoses to the fill ports and when connecting two cars. There is another pump on each tank that allows for movement from one car to another in the event that one car (or more) ran out of water. Water would be pressurized throughout the railcar by activating a pump. All of these features were controlled on a switch board mounted on a door next to the entrance of the rail car that also controlled all light, generator usage, head end power Control (half of the diesel electric generator on the engine is used to power up to ten rail cars.) black water would be pumped out at the end of the day and all tanks would be filled with fresh water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
