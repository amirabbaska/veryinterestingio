		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to using centrifugal force to simulate gravity you can also use linear acceleration. If your spacecraft can sustain accelerating at 9.8 m/s^2 for a long period of time the occupants inside the spacecraft would experience a force equivalent to gravity in the opposite direction to the acceleration. </p>
<p>This is one of my favorite parts of the show &quot;The Expanse&quot;. Often when they are travelling in space they have gravity and it was established early in the series that this is achieved by constantly accelerating toward the destination. Then when the spacecraft is halfway to its destination there is a warning followed by a brief moment of weightlessness as the craft flips around to point in the opposite direction. Then the deceleration burn begins and the simulated gravity is restored. That is a super neat detail in that show. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear, the aircraft NASA use to simulate weightlessness are not in any way &quot;generating&quot; zero-g or removing the force of gravity. They are simply free-falling toward the Earth. Gravity is pulling them down, but there is nothing stopping them from accelerating so they experience the sensation of weightlessness.</p>
<p>This is similar to why astronauts on the ISS feel weightless. They are moving so fast horizontally that they are in free-fall around the Earth. They are still under the force of gravity, but they don't feel it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big part of the problem is that sci-fi artificial gravity isn't typically based on any solid scientific foundations - just the idea that they didn't want lack of gravity to be an aspect of such media (especially in visual media because it would be expensive to constantly simulate).  As others have mentioned, gravity certainly can be faked via centrifugal force or acceleration, but presumably these aren't the methods in place in either Star Wars or Star Trek.  The best guess as to how such an artificial gravity could be created would be through manipulation of gravitons - the hypothetical elementary particles that mediate the force of gravitation in the framework of quantum field theory.  The issue is that these particles are still mostly theoretical and we are only recently having some success measuring gravity waves but have yet to model and detect specific subatomic particles that we are certain are related to this force.  So until we can better map out this area of quantum mechanics, we are far from understanding how to manipulate it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if we use detection and understanding of the standard nuclear model as an example template, our first steps were to blow things up (e.g., hydrogen bombs and various fission-based bombs), gradually worked towards using radiation for power, still are working on understanding all of the specific rules of atomic makeup, and have yet to master cold fusion nonetheless low-cost manipulation.  Similarly, even if we make major breakthroughs in understanding how gravity works on a quantum level in the next decade, it'll likely be many more before we can manipulate such forces on a practical scale in a way that would be cost-effective from either an energy or fiscal sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can use centrifugal 'force' to fake gravity, but doing that involves some real engineering and cost that no one has been willing to do yet. (though I have no doubt this is coming eventually)</p>
<p>If you mean the kind where you push a button to turn 'on' fake gravity, there exists no know physical process that could do that.</p>
<p>Electromagnetism is the only force humans can really exploit on the nessessary scale, and human bodies don't react to magnetic fields. At least ones weak enough to not destroy the entire ship.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not impossible, it is just expensive. You just need to build a rotating space station or something similar. There was a proposed module for the ISS that would have done that (mainly for scientific tests, not for living in), but it was scrapped.</p>
<p>You can simulate higher gravity on Earth by putting people in a centrifuge (which is done for astronaut training) or on a rapidly decelerating train.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
