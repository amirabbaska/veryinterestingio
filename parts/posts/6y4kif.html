		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pressure. By sleeping on your back, gravity's force, and the stress of your weight, are distributed across a much broader surface, meaning less stress on any individual point. There's also more things absorbing that stress, i.e your spine, muscle tissue. Etc. When sleeping on your side, all the stress is on that particular area, which is much smaller, and more notably there's less assistance being given to your spine. This results in eventual discomfort, and it's worth noting that your nerves still send those signals of distress saying, &quot;Hey! Too much pressure!&quot; but since you're asleep, you don't &quot;feel&quot; it, meaning the pain is technically still there but you aren't conscious to actively decide to switch to a different position.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It might be anecdotal, but I recall reading that:</p>
<p>When you're sleeping, your brain sends signals to your body telling you to move to see whether you're asleep or not. It's when you stop responding to these signals that your brain starts doing other things, like dreaming. But, if you're not asleep, those signals to move are interpreted as discomfort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
