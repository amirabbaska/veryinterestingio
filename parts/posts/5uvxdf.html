		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's use humans as an example. Most of our cells have two complete sets of 23 chromosomes (46 in total). One of those in each set is a sex chromosome, that exists in X and Y versions. In females, both sex chromosomes are the X version, in males there is one X and one Y.</p>
<p>Sperm and egg cells, however, have only a single set of 23 chromosomes. Each one is more or less randomly chosen from one or the other of the two complete sets we have. Since females have two X chromosomes, all egg cells contain an X chromosome. But since males have an X and a Y chromosome, sperm cells have either an X or a Y, with a 50:50 mix.</p>
<p>So when sperm and egg combine to give two complete sets of chromosomes again, if the sperm cell contains an X, the offspring will have two X's and will be female. If the sperm cell contains a Y, the offspring will have an X and a Y and will be male.</p>
<p>tl'dr: sperm cells randomly get assigned an X or Y chromosome, and that ultimately determines the sex of the offspring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one has mentioned Fisher's Principle, which describes why the sex ratio of most species is approximately 1:1 between males and females.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a situation where male births are less common than female births and, subsequently, there are fewer males than females in a population. This means a male in that population will have better mating prospects than a female because the male has are more mates to choose from. A male can, therefore, expect to have more offspring. That means if any set of parents in this population are genetically predisposed to produce more male than female offspring, they will then tend to have more of grandchildren born to them. Therefore, whatever male offspring favoring genes they have, will spread more quickly, and this leads to male births becoming more common in that population. As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, whatever advantage associated with producing males dies away. The same process would occur if the situation was reversed for the sexes. Therefore the 1:1 ratio is the evolutionarily stable strategy.</p>
<p>Edit: Changed &quot;less common&quot; to &quot;more common&quot; at the beginning so it made sense.
Edit 2: Changed &quot;more males&quot; to &quot;fewer males&quot;. I hope this makes sense now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sperm and egg cells form through <a href="http://www.biology.iupui.edu/biocourses/N100H/ch9meiosis.html" target="_blank">meiosis.</a> Normal cell division (meitosis) duplicates the DNA in a cell, but meiosis splits it into two halves. In a female this results in all eggs having an X chromosome, but in males it results in exactly half the sperm having an X and the other half having a Y. When sperm combine with eggs, then, half of the resulting are male (XY) and the other half are female (XX).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The male testicles make the sperm that determine a babies sex. Because sperm is produced by splitting the chromosomes into 2 halves, x &amp; y, there's an even split of male producing sperm and female producing. </p>
<p>This even split is what should result in a 50:50 split. As others have said, that's not exactly what happens but pretty close. </p>
<p>Regardless, testicles are responsible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a male you have XY chromosomes and when sperm is made it basicly takes a chromosome and rips it in half making one X spermcell and one Y spermcell thus there is a 50/50split between them. It should be noted that the Y chromosome has less mass the spermcell is somewhat faster causing a 51,5/48,5 (with variations) split</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
