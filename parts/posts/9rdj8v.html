		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually studying something relevant to this for an exam. First, we need to know that one major cause of cancer is reactive oxygen species (ROS). These are usually peroxides (like H2O2) that form free radicals (highly reactive molecules). Most free radicals can pass membranes easily and wreak havoc on DNA. DNA alterations (mutations) can cause cancer. This is an oversimplification, but is all we need to know at the moment.</p>
<p>There is a lot involved with ROSs, but one major process our body needs to get rid of them is the pentose phosphate pathway. This pathway helps make reactive glutathione. Glutathione is a molecule that reacts with peroxides to convert them to water (via reduction reaction with enzymes like glutathione peroxidase).</p>
<p>So how does this tie in to exercise? Exercise stabilizes the amount of insulin we produce by stabilizing blood glucose levels, decreasing fat storage, decreasing stress, and probably other ways we don't fully understand yet.  Insulin is a stimulator of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the first step of the pentose phosphate pathway. So when insulin is being released properly, this pathway works more effectively to ultimately reduce ROS and thus reduce cancer.</p>
<p>TLDR: Exercise = better insulin regulation. </p>
<p>Better insulin regulation = more pentose phosphate pathway activation. </p>
<p>More pentose phosphate pathway = more active glutathione. </p>
<p>More glutathione = LESS reactive oxygen species. </p>
<p>Less reactive oxygen species = less cancer</p>
<p>There are lots of other factors and pathways that probably contribute to exercise preventing cancer, but this is the one I am studying now and probably one of the most important.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for asking this question. Typing this up actually helped me review the concept a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A major factor in reducing cancer risk involves lowering insulin levels. Exercise is great for that, especially if it lowers BMI into healthy ranges (avoids insulin resistance). Insulin does a number of things related to blood sugar but it is also a growth factor. Growth factors are part of the uncontrolled cell cycle that is found in cancers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How I understand it is that obesity leads to inflammation, and lowered immunity. A healthy immune system is always fighting cancer cells and mutations. If your immunity is down, you canâ€™t as readily kill mutated cells that lead to cancer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physical exercise, and intermediate fasting do two things to help prevent cancer. 1. by introducing stresses on the body weakened and senescent cells die off more easily, and since those cells are the ones most likely to turn cancerous, it is a clear benefit. 2 Lower body mass = fewer total cells, and the fewer cells in your body the less likely for you to develop cancerous mutations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
