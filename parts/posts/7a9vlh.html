		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Through constant struggles between workers (through unions) and employers, which currently sets it at a compromise at 40 hours. There is a pretty strong movement to reduce it further, usually 30, 32 or 35 hours, but we are not there quite yet.</p>
<p>I suspect it will happen. Increasing automation means that we will have to decide between:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>less time worked per person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mass unemployment;</p>
</li>
<li>people doing &quot;fake&quot; or &quot;constructed&quot; jobs of little real value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of those alternatives, less time seems the best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's something I remember from my grandparents, who were involved with the unions in the 1930s - my grandmother was involved in the Textile Strike of 1934 and my grandfather was a member of the IWW and their attempts to organize railroad workers (he worked for the Southern Railway at the time).</p>
<p>They both had a saying: &quot;Eight hours of work, eight hours of sleep, and eight hours of what we will.&quot; So five days of work at eight hours equals 40 hours. That was their goal. I believe this saying originated in England and was brought home by American soldiers who had served overseas alongside British troops.</p>
<p>So that's my understanding of the &quot;40-hour&quot; week.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is: Blood, violence and death. </p>
<p>In the fully developed industrialsation, around the end of the 19th century up until the early 20th, workers had very little rights. You worked 12 or more hour shifts, you got paid by results (kg of coal found - you only struck rock today? Well, bad luck for you!). They were basically (ELI5) modern slaves, the employer could set rules, remove pay, they had no insurance for illness or retirement. They lived in very small flats, and beds (!) often were rented out to strangers - you do do not need a bed when you are working, right?</p>
<p>If you annoyed your employer, you lost a job in a time without any social welfare and no way to safe up money. If you had an accident at work, you might have been brought to the hospital ward, which was conveniently outside of the factory area which means that if you die after your (work) accident it happens outside of the factory/mine and this means your family cannot get pay. After all, you did not die at work, right? (The list goes on and on)</p>
<p>Then people got fed up with it and went on strike. Often that was to the dislike of the state which send the police and the factory owners who sent strike breakers (workers and muscle for punching).</p>
<p>This went on and on, workers formed Unions to fight back and over time the violence led to peaceful strikes which leads to the systems, workers' rights, social security and welfare you have today. Even the whole environment-debate is part of this, as by now we decided that the health of a countryside is more important than the profit of the factory-owners. In some countries all that is better developed than in others. </p>
<hr />
<p>Now, why we do have to work more than in past times (40 hours a week) is a whole different matter. I doubt Neanderthals worked more than some 30 (or something rather low) hours <em>per month</em> for getting food and firewood. The pay and recreation options were probably just cheaper. ;)</p>
<p>[And since so many &quot;nice&quot; people asked so &quot;nicely&quot;, here is some link <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_time#Hunter-gatherer" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> but because they were such &quot;nice&quot; people I am not willing to do more research for such &quot;nice&quot; people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
