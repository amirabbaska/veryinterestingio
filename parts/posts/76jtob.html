It also sometimes occurs while watching sports.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are a social species. Empathy is an important part of our lifes. When you observe babies or children interact with their parents or someone they feel empathy for, you can notice they will copy their movements and behaviour. That instinct doesn't really fade away when you grow up, you just learn to control it.</p>
<p>When you're watching a movie or a game, you're not really focusing on controling those minor movements, thus, you begin copying what you see on the screen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This allows you to understand their action. Admittedly, there's still controversy over the subject matter in regards to humans but eh.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not the same thing, but similar: if I lose track of what I’m doing, my hands will make a motion to remind me. It doesn’t happen often but it strikes me as odd. It’s nearly automatic. Example: I’m about to go to bed, but I know I’m forgetting something. To jumpstart my thinking, my hands will make a brushing motion. I then remember I need to brush my teeth. This happens with a lot with menial tasks. I’m on an ssri and migraine medicine that destroys my short term memory. Years of weed use probably hasn’t helped. For whatever reason, my body reminds my mind  of what I was supposed to be doing. It’s quite strange to me. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Everyone first learns how to do something by watching someone else do it and then copying that.  For some reason, (science isn't sure because it doesn't understand it well yet,) some people are more sensitive to this than others and when they see someone doing something it triggers their muscles to try to copy it before they realize what is going on.  This can even make it hard for someone to stand still if they are being told a story about how someone else is moving.</p>
<p>I had no idea this was even a thing, but my SO was reading over my shoulder and said 'oh yeah, that thing, I get that!'  So thanks for posting this one, we learned something today!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
