		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15824636?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" target="_blank">2005 report in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine</a>, scientists with the Joint Bank Group/Fund Health Services Department pointed out that in studies in which subjects had their hands contaminated, and then were instructed to wash and rinse with soap for 25 seconds using water with temperatures ranging from 40 degrees Fahrenheit to 120 degrees, the various temperatures had “no effect on transient or resident bacterial reduction.”</p>
<p>They found no evidence that hot water had any benefit, and noted that it might increase the “irritant capacity” of some soaps, causing contact dermatitis. “Temperature of water used for hand washing should not be guided by antibacterial effects but comfort,” they wrote, “which is in the tepid to warm temperature range. The usage of tepid water instead of hot water also has economic benefits.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Hot water for hand washing has not been proved to remove germs better than cold water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The consensus in this thread appears to be that the temperature has no effect. I wonder though, if in practice, warm water may correlate positively with hygiene due to no other reason than that people are likely to wash their hands for a longer period of time with warm water as opposed to frigidly cold water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has been said already that water hot enough to kill bacteria is hot enough to hurt you.  This is true, and why we don't wash our hands with boiling water.  It has also been said that warm water is more comfortable than cold.
However, I did not see, with a cursory look, anyone mention the simple fact that warm water cleans better than cold just in terms of dissolving dirt.  If you do not scrub at all, and just held your hand under running water, a hand under warm/tolerably hot water would be cleaned more than one run under cold water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
