		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ancient Greeks did not classify colors by hue, but instead by whether it was light or dark. κυάνεος (kyaneos), was used for dark blue, also dark green or violet. While Γλαῦκος (glaukos) was used for light blue, also light green and yellow. Why they did this, no idea. In modern Greek we do have a word for blue, it is μπλε, pronounced ble. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The Greeks didn't have a <em>word</em> for blue but they certainly could see that color. They just lumped it in with &quot;bronze&quot;, something they would use to describe the sky and ocean.</p>
<p>Think about how you consider colors now. If you go to a paint store they will have a huge number of additional color names which you don't know and don't use, just considering them another shade of a color you already have a word for. This is the same sort of thing they did before the word &quot;blue&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The distinction between different colours is often more cultural than anything. For instance, there used to be no word for the colour orange (it was later named after the fruit). Instead, orange things were lumped in as being red. Hence redheads, robin red breasts (the bird), and probably other things too. Now we have a word for orange and it seems crazy that it could be called red.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That being said color is a pretty relative concept, you can make colors disappear by going deep enough underwater (red first) and you just see other colors instead, usually yellow, then shifting down the color wheel, or grey if there isn't another being emitted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why do we have separate words for blue and indigo? They're essentially the same thing, only darker and lighter. </p>
<p>What we refer to as 'blue' is a colour that was always there, there just culturally wasn't a seperate name for it.</p>
<p>In the same way that we Brits talk about rain in terms of drizzle, sleet, spitting, raining cats and dogs, mizzling, pelting down etc. It's not that other countries haven't seen these kinds of rain before, they just haven't chosen to differentiate in that level of detail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
