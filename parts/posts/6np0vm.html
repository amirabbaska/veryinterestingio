		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically, the thing you plug into the phone is not a charger. It is a 5 volt constant voltage (CV) power supply. OK, some can put out different voltages, but they are still CV supplies. </p>
<p>The charging is controlled by the phone. When the phone decides that the battery is fully charged, charging terminates, and the power supply continues to provide power for the phone. </p>
<p>When the power supply is plugged in to AC without a phone, it still puts out a constant 5 volts.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on how the charger is made, it can claim 100% when, in fact, is not yet 100%.</p>
<p>A battery charge is done in several step.</p>
<p>First, you charge the battery with a limited current (constant current mode). You charge until you reach the maximum voltage, for example 4.2V. The voltage will raise.</p>
<p>Second stage: Constant voltage until the current drop bellow I beleive 4% of the capacity (3000mAH then 120mA charge current). During this stage the voltage is stable but the current drop.</p>
<p>Third stage is optional: float charging (not for lithium) or maintenance charge (ex: charge for a few seconds). This keep the battery full. All battery self discharge due to the chemistry and build construction...</p>
<p>What happend with the battery charge indicator? Well, it may be really monitoring the battery voltage: 3.0V = 0% and 4.2V = 100%. The voltage curve when you discharge it is kinda linear during that range, so very easy to simply go proportional and work well enought!</p>
<p>A proper fuel gauge (that is the proper term somehow for the battery gauge) will not go with the voltage, but the actual energy that go in and out of the battery. However this is very complex to do: the battery self discharge in an unknown way, which is also dependent of the actual state of charge, temperature and aging, and of course the individual battery characteristics. The charge and discharge efficiency is also variable with the same factors. This is also why sometime the gauge say you still have power, and first thing you know is that it shut down hard on you: it think it still have power, but the low discharge voltage has been reached. This actually reset the fuel gauge and it start back to count the energy in the cell...</p>
<p>Now, laptop battery are more complicated: there is several battery in series. Each have different characteristics, so may not fully charge equally. So what the battery pack do is: discharge a bit the battery that is full, then charge all, repeat until all are full. This can take a long while, hence why some pack get stuck a long while at 99%: it is balancing the cells.</p>
<p>As for the charger: First, it is NOT a charger, but a power supply. The charger is inside your phone (same with a laptop). If disconnected from the device then it just waste a bit of power, only what the internal circuitry consume, which is very little, but do add on at the end of the year. Even if it is 0.1W ... 0.1<em>24</em>365 = 876Wh, which is still only a few cents. Per charger...</p>
<p>As to why it is not a charger: lithium is way too sensitive and require too much precision in charging. For example, a lithium polimer is 4.1V max, and it can catch fire at 4.4V. Your usb cable with the connectors can actually lose about 0.2-0.5V, depending on the quality and current. This mean that the charger wouln't be able to sense proprelly the battery voltage and may under or over charge it. Also, the charger need to get the battery temperature and adjust the charge voltage, or stop charging. If it do not then a fire can happend! Also, remember the end of charge? How can it could figure out what is consumed by the battery and what is by the phone itself? And also each battery have a different capacity/size, and even some different chemistry, so different current and voltage limit (my cellphone batt is 4.35V when full, higher voltage than normal). It would get just too complicated. Better to put a charger inside the phone that take care of all that proprelly and safelly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, it's my understanding that phone batteries are damaged by being overcharged, especially while being used. Why is this an issue and why is it that phones don't stop charging at 100% and wait till 95% to start again?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 3 phases of charging a lithium ion battery that need to be followed in order to prevent damage to the battery and increase the life-time. Deep-discharge trickle charging, Constant current, and top-up <strong>trickle charging</strong> (this is the state your phone remains in after being full). </p>
<p>Deep-discharge: the charge controller charges the battery with low current in order to prevent creating irreversible metallic formations in the cells. This might be why your phone seems to take forever to charge when you've let it go to 0%. </p>
<p>Constant Current: The battery is charged at a constant rate. This is where most of the &quot;juice&quot; is coming from in your charge cycle. It lives between the 10-90% &quot;fullness&quot; of your battery.</p>
<p><strong>Trickle Charge</strong>: The battery is charged at a constant voltage and the charging current gradually reduces to 0 when the charge controller thinks it is &quot;full&quot;. Batteries tend to naturally dissipate current so the trickle charge may turn off and on all the time while your phone is plugged in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
