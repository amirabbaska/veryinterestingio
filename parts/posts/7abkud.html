		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eh. Not entirely. A few things.</p>
<p>First, depending on the food we're talking about, salt might be an inherent part of the process, either of canning in particular or just the food in general. Pickles? Olives? Gotta have salt. You just do. Salt is also a critical ingredient in any number of fermented foods, many of which are canned. </p>
<p>Second, salt is a flavor enhancer. Processed food manufacturers have tended to add loads of salt to a wide variety of foods for the better part of a century as a way of making their products tastier. Canned foods are hardly unique here. </p>
<p>Third, while canned vegetables are certainly saltier than their raw counterparts, they're not necessarily as salty as you might think. <a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/baked-products/4872/2" target="_blank">One 30g slice of white bread</a> has a little less than <em>three times</em> as much sodium as <a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2344/2" target="_blank">28g of canned green beans</a>. </p>
<p>Fourth, while canning certainly <em>tends</em> to kill biological organisms, it's not magic. Some organisms are merely weakened. Some may even survive, though in small enough numbers that they can't cause a problem if the food is eaten within a year or two. A little salt goes a long way towards ensuring that fewer bacteria survive, and those that do stay dormant. </p>
<p>But lastly, bacteria aren't the only things that contribute to food spoilage. There are other chemical processes that have nothing to do with bacteria that can make food go bad, or at least lose quality over time. Discoloration comes immediately to mind, but that's not the only thing. Flavors can change. Textures can break down. Foods can take on flavors from their containers. Salt creates an environment inhospitable to bacteria, to be sure, but it also tends to interfere with some of these other processes, making it useful as a preservative even in a largely sterile environment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><del>Too lazy to find the article, but</del> I remember reading that bitter compounds are produced in the canning process.  To balance out the bitter, additional salt is added for flavor.  I believe the article was on researching chemicals that act as 'bitter blockers'.  The idea was that they could be added to canned foods to balance the bitterness without all the excess salts.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Canned soups are produced in retorts. Effectively, these are giant pressure cookers with two main variations: Rotary and Hydrostatic. Hydrostatic, as the name implies, keeps the cans static during the processing. Rotary, as the name implies, rolls the cans in a big spiral to help mix the soup. </p>
<p>Because rotary mixes the soup, processing times can be much shorter than hydrostatic. Static cooking can sometimes be 9 times longer than rotary. Another way to think of this is that rotary induces convection in the can whereas hydrostatic only induces conduction. Both process at temperatures well above boiling. </p>
<p>These high temperatures for 90 minutes or more sterilize the food. There's a lot of science that goes into pinpointing exactly how much time and temperature needs to be applied to the product to make it safe to eat. However, major food companies obviously prefer to err on the side of overcooking because that ensures their products are safe for the masses. </p>
<p>It is important to note that, at least in canned soup, <em>sodium does not play any role in the safety of the food.</em> Food safety of the canned products are 100% guaranteed by the heating process they undergo. Salt content is just for flavor. </p>
<p>Many products lose their flavor in steam retorts over long periods of time. Something that doesn't lose its flavor at these high heats is salt. Sodium is universally delicious, present in almost every cuisine in some form or another. It's a cheap way to build back some of the flavor that is degraded from the retorts. </p>
<p>I think it's been very clear in the last 20 or so years since more evidence has come out about how sodium influences high blood pressure, more consumers are trying to lower sodium in their diets. Even the RDAs by the US Government have lowered the maximum limit of sodium in one's daily diet. As a result, many companies have tried to lower sodium in their products. Retort technology is improving, slowly but surely, so I anticipate that sodium will decrease over time in canned foods. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To make up for the flavor lost when processing and storing. Even though the nutrition value does not really change, the flavor does.<br />
Sodium is very versatile. For example normal salt (sodium chloride) for a salty taste, but also msg (monosodium glutamate) for umami. Most processed food flavorings contain multiple sources of sodium. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
