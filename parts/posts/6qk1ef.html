		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While /u/TheGamingWyvern has given you the usual explanation, it doesn't even hint at the whole story.</p>
<p>The passage in Isaiah 14:12 is a type of poetry called a &quot;taunt song&quot;  a sort of Old Testament celebrity roast. Isaiah is actually sarcastically referring to the King of Babylon: one of his titles was &quot;The Shining One&quot;, which was also what they called Venus, the Morning Star; another of his titles was &quot;Son of the Dawn&quot;. And that's how Isaiah addresses him: &quot;O Shining One, Son of the Dawn...&quot; It's just that the King James Bible decided to use the Latin word &quot;Lucifer&quot; at this point.</p>
<p>This Lucifer actually has nothing to do with Satan. In verse 4, God tells Isaiah that he is to give the following prophecy to the King, and then the taunt starts. Verse 12 basically means: &quot;Hah! You call yourself the Morning Star? Well look at you now, fallen out of the sky!&quot;</p>
<p>In the New Testament -- Luke 10:18 -- Jesus is quoted as saying, &quot;I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.&quot; Actually, a more accurate translation of the original Greek would be &quot;I was watching Satan falling...&quot;, and he was reacting to his disciples' report that they had been successfully driving out demons. Nobody really knows whether Luke was deliberately referencing Isaiah 14, but in the popular imagination the connection took hold and people equated Lucifer with Satan.</p>
<p>The idea of Satan as a fallen angel is a much more modern idea.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for gold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Satan in Hebrew is just &quot;adversary&quot; or &quot;accuser.&quot; There is no one Satan in the Old Testament, it's just a title; the New Testament is where the singular Satan/Devil is developed as a figure. That's important to bear in mind because there are so many misconceptions about Satan.
Lucifer is attached to Satan because of a prophecy in Isaiah 14 regarding the king of Babylon at the time who is sarcastically referred to as the &quot;Shining Morning Star&quot; in translation. For some ignorant reason, despite the text quite literally prefacing the statement by saying it's about the king of Babylon, people have relentlessly attached it to Satan because of speculation about his origin. Tradition is a powerful thing and it's not helped by the influence of various religious groups, especially Gnostics, on contemporary understanding of pseudo-religious myth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's been a while since I did my degree (theology) but I focussed heavily on the Satan myth in my dissertation and if I had pursued academia further word have been the basis of any doctoral work. If memory serves the simple explanation is the character is actually a mix of translational issues, biblical references, pagan artifacts and several apocryphal stories that have all been amalgamated into one overarching narrative.  </p>
<p>Satan in either Hebrew/Greek/Aramaic (can't remember the language for the source text) is actually a title, the correct term being something like 'Hasatan' or 'Hashaitan' (it was 10 years ago I did the research, bare with me). This title was actually a political stab at some infamous despot or another at the time. I think the literal translation is 'the adversary'. This was interpreted by early scholars as a proper name and was characterised into this malevolent persona. Over time it got swept together with things like the serpent myth in Genesis, Origins poems, the signs of the first rapture in Daniel and the second in Revelations, Hades from Greek myth, Zaroastrian Angra, Chernobog, Djinn Legends from Persia, Enoch's story of the Fall and a thousand other cultural influences into this broad overarching narrative. Satan itself just represents 'that which we are opposed to', whereas the Lucifer tale of the fallen angel comes from Enoch, Dante, Blake and Milton.  </p>
<p>It's important to remember that there is no one 'Bible' there are thousands of texts, written across hundreds of years by thousands of authors in dozens of different languages (most of which we can only guess at reading). What you commonly think of as the Bible is just what a few old dudes decided they wanted to cram together into one book at Nicea, or under King James or in some church or university somewhere. What one you refer to just depends on your chosen breed of insanity/sun worship. There isn't really one Satan story because the story is actually a cultural phenomenon. It's a persona we invented as a society over two thousand years of culture.  </p>
<p>I'm sorry if that's a bit of a tangled mess to follow, but I'm skimming over a lot of detail from my memories of research I did a decade ago.  </p>
<p>Fun fact: Of all the characters associated with Satan in the NRSV edition of the Bible, not one of them ever tells a lie. The devil always tells the truth (which probably had a significant impact in tying him to the Lucifer story from Enoch).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In biblical lore, before Satan was cast from heaven, he was the leader of the angels and the most favoured angel in heaven.  But a rift between God and Satan resulted in Satan being cast down to earth.</p>
<p>In history, the Babylonian king referred to himself as the first star. Kings always think very highly of themselves, and the first star of the morning is impressive.  But this title of first star of the morning comes from an scene that occurs on many clear  mornings. This scene is the shining of a star as the sun rises.  That is, it is the last star visible before the sky is flooded blue. The light bringer refers to this star, also known as the first star of the morning, or the morning star. </p>
<p>Lucifer is a Roman translation that means morning star. This was apt for early Christians because they considered Satan to be the first among the angels, or the leader of the angels.</p>
<p>However, the morning star to which they are referring Venus. Venus appears as the brightest star on the morning depending on the time of year.  This is because it is relatively close to earth and reflects the light of the sun easily. It's usually the last star to disappear form the morning sky as the sun rises.</p>
<p>So when Isiah was referring to Lucifer, he was in fact referring to Venus.  The later Roman translation creates Lucifer, which became the name of Satan, as a means to identify a fallen star, or the great first star among the angels, or the angel that was cast from heaven.  The translation was wrong, and Lucifer as Satan was born.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting to note that the figure of Satan/Lucifer is actually an amalgamation of three figures in mythology.</p>
<p>1) The Serpent in the garden of Eden.  A figure of corruption.  </p>
<p>2) Ha-Satan, which means 'The Adversary.'  Think of him as a celestial District Attorney that lays out your sins when you die and stand before God and are judged.  He also has a spot in Heaven and converses with God on a regular basis.</p>
<p>3) Lucifer, fallen Angel, which others here have covered very well.</p>
<p>They all sorta got mashed together over the last two thousand years.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
