		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't get me wrong here, I'm not a climate change denier, but every time I read these hopeless, apocalyptic articles about what lies ahead for the planet in regard to climate, the numbers I see always seem so small. &quot;OMG the temperature will go up by <strong>2째F</strong> (or apparently the absolute worst-case scenario, it might be more like 9째F) and kill EVERYTHING!&quot;</p>
<p>I think this is going over my head a little bit. Can somebody explain to my dumb ass why the global temperature going up by a piddly couple of degrees is going to make most of the planet uninhabitable, kill most of the life on it and destroy everything in the oceans? I don't understand how such a small increase in temperature is going to cause global droughts and melt all the ice caps (and all the other stuff I hear about). The temperature goes up by a LOT more than that with the goddamn season changes, so why didn't the world end the first time we went from summer to winter and back again? Is this planet that's been around for billions of years honestly that delicate that a little bit of a fever is going to wreck everything?</p>
<p>Or is it more about the gases in the atmosphere trapping the heat close to the surface and sort of steaming us like a bag of vegetables? I apologize if any of what I just said is ignorant - I haven't really researched this whole thing, I'm just going by what I've read in the news. I realize none of this shit is probably even going to come to a noticeable head in my lifetime, but I'm just wondering how this all works.</p>
<p>I know the big deal is carbon emissions. Makes me wonder if it's possible to create some kind of a doodad that could filter some of the carbon out of the air. Not all of it since plant life needs some, but if we can make machines that distill normal air into pure oxygen (though I think oxygen machines remove nitrogen) and we can take liquid coffee and suck the moisture out of it leaving behind solid, concentrated granules of goodness, why can we not invent something that would filter carbon out of our air? I realize these would need to be made on a very large scale to have a possible effect, but hear me out. If enough carbon is distilled out of the air, would you eventually wind up with an actual solid piece of carbon (like pulling the coffee out of brewed coffee and leaving behind something firm) that you could use for something else? I have no idea how something like that could possibly work, but just a playful thought.</p></div></div>

<p>The planet has been through ice ages, volcanic periods, hit by giant meteors, even had the moon torn off of it at one point early on and yet it survived.  </p>
<p>The planet will be fine. </p>
<p>Whether the planet will still be fit for human habitation is the question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The impact of the temperature rising by a few degrees F isn't that it feels hotter when you go outside on Saturday afternoon, that it's now 93F instead of 90F.  That's not it.  It's that a bunch of the earth's cycles now operate significantly differently.  This leads to dramatically different weather patterns and sea levels, which pose risks for civilization.  It's not inherently <em>bad</em>, it's just risky for humans and what we have built.</p>
<p>If you need an analogy to reason through this, think of human body temperature.  It's normally around 98.6F.  Crank it up to 102F, and you're very sick.  Keep it at 102F for an extended period, and you are suffering, sick, and probably(?) eventually die.  And if your body temperature stays at 95F for an extended period of time, you suffer and probably(?) die.  That's an example of a system that runs into serious problems if its temperature changes by a few degrees.</p>
<p>As for filtering carbon out of the air, there are three main problems.  The first is that this process would require tons of energy.  The second is that it would have to be deployed at a positively ENORMOUS scale.  We emit 36 billion <em>tons</em> of carbon per year.  The third problem is what to do with all of that carbon, do we turn it back into oil and bury it, or what?  And the last problem is, of course, the astronomical cost.</p>
<p>Science can make carbon filtration systems, they already operate on some power plants.  It is possible.  But to deploy them at large scale is not feasible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This <a href="https://xkcd.com/1732/" target="_blank">XKCD</a> shows what a 2 degree temperature rise looks like in terms of historical perspective. Notice that the &quot;ice age&quot; was only 4 degrees colder on average than it is now and that when it was only 2 degrees colder polar ice sheets covered Chicago, and that the 0.5 degree little ice age was cold enough that the river Thames froze thick enough to have shops on top of it.</p>
<p>So yeah, a world with an average temperature 2 degrees higher is a very different world with way more extreme temperatures, although the average difference will be only 2 degrees</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer the second part of your question first, there are in fact ways to filter carbon out of the air. A quick Google search would likely show a few of such methods. The main problem is simply money. The only way to encourage people to spend the amount required to filter the air and then store it somewhere suitable would be to make it profitable. As of right now, it's not.</p>
<p>One of the reasons going up two degrees is problematic is the ocean. The last time earth was two degrees hotter was the Pliocene of the tertiary period 3 million years ago. The ocean was 5 or 6 feet higher, meaning that rising oceans will create many environmental refugees along just about every coastline in the world. Europe is already struggling with Syrian refugees, imagine if the entire Mediterranean tried to storm northern Europe too. </p>
<p>Additionally, the ocean traditionally acts as a &quot;sink&quot; for carbon dioxide stored as carbonic acid. As the ocean gets warmer, the ocean will not be able to absorb as much carbon dioxide. If you've ever taken a basic science course, you should have learned that solids, liquids and gasses all have particles the move against each other. Every system on earth is constantly changing state, but it's at a dynamic equilibrium where the same number of particles evaporating are condensing. As heat puts more energy into the ocean, the carbonic acid molecules gain more energy and shift the equilibrium towards the gaseous phase of CO2. This accelerates the heating process further.</p>
<p>Less oxygen can also dissolve if the water is warmer, potentially wiping out or damaging marine species. We already see this with coral bleaching, but worse could happen. The warmer waters mean tropical storms increase in both number and severity. The US struggled with Katrina, and even Ike, what if storms like that happened on a yearly, or even biannual basis? People would flee, increasing the refugee crisis.</p>
<p>The heat also affects land as well. If we get to two degrees, bacteria in the soil that digests plant life will increase their metabolism, releasing more CO2 into the atmosphere from the soil, again, accelerating the heating process further. This especially hurts the Amazon, as there is a great amount of decomposing organic matter. Additionally, even two degrees means increased heat waves especially in the summer. Rivers would dry up, the lower parts of year round ice on mountains would unfreeze causing avalanches (it already is). The West US would be desert (talking Kansas and Nebraska) as well as the rainforest. The Amazon dried up in certain parts in 2005 due to a heat wave. As temperatures rise those droughts will only become more common. Fire would be a huge problem, especially as rivers dried up.</p>
<p>I'm on mobile currently, so I can't include links.
The equilibrium stuff is just Le Chatliers principle
Most of the sea ice and soil predictions are based on fossil records of when the Earth was that temperature. </p>
<p>Tl;dr As earth heats up, more carbon is released, speeding up the heating process. Environmental refugees due to desertification and rising sea levels will be a thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the last glacial maximum, when there was permanent ice cover over much of europe that was so heavy that the crust sank, the temperature was just 4 degrees less than today. The Earth is a finely balanced system, and the main thing is that the current warming represents an untested experiment in the history of the Earth. Though the Earth has actually warmed in response to an injection of carbon in the atmosphere before (e.g. PETM), the current &quot;experiment&quot; has no precedent because it is far, far more rapid than anything that has happened in the past. The Earth is actually colder now than at most points in its history, and the past million years the most stable in the Earth's history, but usually there is a gradual transition from an icehouse world to a greenhouse world, allowing the earth system and ecosystem to gradually adjust. This is the main reason why current climate change is the gravest danger to the Earth; undoubtedly the system will eventually reach equilibrium, but the transition period is going to be tumultuous and much of the ecosystem may not cope with the rapid change. The main impetus for keeping the change in temperature to 2 degrees is to slow down the rate of change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
