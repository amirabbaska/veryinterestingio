		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Refreshing seems to solve a lot of stuck website issues. A popular website or app will have many duplications of hardware resources at their data center, some of which are chosen for you at random. Sometimes the combination of hardware you are assigned to is having issues, and it can hang. When you refresh, you're dealt another combination, one which works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many streaming sites use UDP to send large packets of data: essentially, the server sends video out and don't ask back if the target has received it. So if your computer doesn't get a part of the video, the server won't notice and it will keep sending video. If the web player is written correctly, it'll ask the server to rewind and your playback will continue smoothly eventually.</p>
<p>If the player hasn't been written properly, though, the player will never ask for the packet again or it won't be asking for it correctly (either the session has been invalidated, the player has sent out too many requests, etc) so playback will be stuck. When you refresh the webpage, it does a refresh of your session and it takes some time until the page is loaded so you can send a new request for video.</p>
<p>Note: this are only some of the reasons it can mess up. There are probably many edge-cases I haven't covered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a followup question, why can Netflix nail every stream every time. I don't think I have ever had a failed or shitty Netflix stream and the only place it ever buffers is with  extremely slow connection speeds. Meanwhile youtube its a daily occurrence to get a fucked up stream and don't get me started on hulu. </p>
<p>Why is netflix so much better than everyone else at delivering my content? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>because a part of software(maybe even hardware) that is involved in the process of getting your video to play is badly designed and ran into a problem (there could be many different problems)</p>
<p>resetting the whole process can cause it to run like it was planned since (aside from cookies or eventual account data) you should get to start from 0</p>
<p>every other answer here trying to describe in detail whats exactly wrong is probably wrong because there can be many problems and even more symptoms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many times this can be attributed to session timeouts and stateful devices.  Whether TCP or UDP, intermediate stateful devices such as firewalls have timeout values for allowing established session replies.  In the case of UDP, which is used by many video applications, timeout is the only value used.  If for some reason the session times out, refreshing the session actually creates a new session and things work again</p>
<p>Universal plug and play (uPnP) is a capability in many home routers intended to solve this problem, where the router can by told by a uPnP application that Iâ€™m going to open a session, to watch a video,for the next two hours for example, so keep the session open for that time.  The IETF created a scalable extension of this called port control protocol (PCP) intended to allow your ISP to know about requested persistent sessions and to assist.  Unfortunately, uPnP and PCP have a number of security issues related to them, and for other privacy and security reasons many streaming content providers have transitioned to using TCP-based SSL/TLS (what HTTPS uses on your browser to encrypt web sessions) to transport video.  There are no broadly adopted standards for delivering encrypted UDP within browsers or outside of specific applications</p>
<p>But with overall network performance improving, and the SSL performance of user devices improving with new CPUs, this is slowly becoming less and less of a problem</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
