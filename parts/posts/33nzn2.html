<p>TL;DR: The islands were colonized by Spain which named them &quot;Las Islas Filipinas,&quot; after King Felipe II. In English, <em>Filipe</em> is translated to <em>Philip</em>. When the USA took over the control of the islands they anglicized the name to the Philippines. Because English language likes to be purposely confusing the noun <em>filipino</em> describing people who come from the islands did not get anglicized to <em>philipino</em>. Thus you ended up with filipino's living in the Philippines. </p>
<p>Then the USA left and the people living on those islands want to reclaim their native language(s) thus they changed the words to describe themselves yet again, and now we also refer to these people as <em>pilipinos</em> living in the <em>Pilippines</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Philippines was colonized by Spain for 300 years, naming it &quot;Las Islas Filipinas&quot; for King Philip II of Spain. In 1898, The Philippines got its independence from the Spanish rule when the Treaty of Paris was signed which surrendered the Philippine Islands to the USA. Since then until about the end of WW2, the country was a colony of the United States. It was also during that time that the name &quot;Philippines&quot; was officially adopted. The name for its people, Filipinos, was retained. It is also spelled &quot;Pilipino&quot; locally.
From a question below, Filipinos have Spanish last names because of the colonization and most can't speak Spanish because it was taken out of curriculum during the American rule. Many older citizens can still speak Spanish though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The filipino alphabet doesn't contain the letter F. Newly Immigrated Filipinos have a tough time with Ps and Fs and sometimes call them Fee(P) and Ep(F). It's pretty common and a lot of Filipinos I know will laugh when I point it out to them.</p>
<p>I answered the wrong question, oh well its still <em>somewhat</em> relevant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a Filipino-American born here this was interesting until the racist comments popped up. </p>
<p>For what it's worth my relatives born in the Philippines tend to pronounce all variations of it using &quot;P&quot;, not &quot;F&quot; (and no, its not because of the accent, they're speaking the native language). </p>
<p>Like other answers here I would just chock it up to Westernization of the language and pronunciation. People tend to forget that the Philippines was more or less ruled by others (Spanish, Japanese, American authorities) up until the end of WWII. That leaves a big mark of Filipino society, whether we're aware of it or not. </p>
<p>/rant. Sorry. Kind of like discussing this shit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Filipino languages are a mix of English, Spanish, and early Filipino (pre-1700) it tends to make weird inconsistencies like the Ph and the F.  Another example is in Cebu they speak Cebuano but don't have a C in their written alphabet.  Another weird rule is that every number after 10 is counted in Spanish or English not Filipino (at least in the Visayan languages)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
