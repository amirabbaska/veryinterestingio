		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're looking at two different things - artificial flavorings &amp; artificial sweeteners.  Artificial flavors trick our nose into sensing some other food product &amp; are relatively easy to come up with.  Artificial sweeteners trick our body into sensing <em>sugar</em>, something that's fundamentally essential to animal survival.</p>
<p>Coming up with an artificial flavor is usually just a matter of finding the chemical that's responsible for most of the scent of something &amp; figuring out how to make it synthetically.  Coming up with an artificial sweetener means finding a molecule that can trick the <em>very</em> specialized sensors on our tongue into thinking &quot;sugar&quot;.</p>
<p>Nobody's been able to come up with a 0-calorie sweetener that actually tastes like sugar.</p>
<p>So, when you're mixing a diet soda, you can't just substitute your artificial sweetener for sugar because <strong>it tastes wrong</strong>.  You need to change the flavors a bit to compensate for how artificial it tastes.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> thanks for the gold!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diet Coke is not suppose to taste like regular Coke Classic, a different flavour profile is used in that product intentionally.
Coke Zero has the same flavour profile as Coke Classic.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Diet Coke was so popular when it was introduced Coca-Cola decided to change the formula of its regular product creating &quot;New Coke&quot;, which bombed so hard they had to go back to the original recipe and Coke Classic was born</p>
