		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air bubbles in the bloodstream (called air embolisms when they interfere with circulation) are a concern following organ transplantation because they can cause circulatory, and even neurological, problems. To preserve the organ during transportation, the blood in the organ is replaced with a solution designed to preserve tissue function following explantation. During the transplantation process, the organ must be connected to the circulatory system of the patient (individual blood vessels are connected through a process called anastomosis). Surgeons will connect arteries first (the inlets for the organ) before connecting the veins (the outlets for the organ), and thereby allow the patient's own blood flow to clear both the preservative solution and any air bubbles from the new organ.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Awww nobody will see this since I'm late to the party... but I work in heart surgery and can tell you how we get air out of the heart after we open it. It's also important to know that air in the arterial system and left side of the heart is waaaaay more dangerous than heart in the venous system and right heart. This is because the air goes to the lungs before it goes to the left heart. Once in the aorta, air can enter the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart and the brain. In the heart, air can cause ventricular fibrillation and in the brain it can cause a stroke.</p>
<p>So to keep this from happening we utilize the clamp that is placed across the aorta (cross clamp) and vents that are inserted in the left ventricle (the chamber that pumps blood to the body) and the aortic root (where the aorta exits the heart). These vents are connected to pumps on the cardiopulmonary bypass pump (heart/lung machine). Before the cross clamp comes off the aorta, the perfusionist (person running the heart/lung machine) will fill the heart with blood. This causes the heart to contract and pushes blood out through the vents. If there is air, it hopefully exits the heart through the vents with the blood. At the same time, an anesthesiologist or cardiologist is looking at an echocardiogram, which allows them to see the air in the heart and aorta. The patient will be placed in a head up position so that the air will rise, and if there is a large amount of air, the surgeon may shake the patient. When this is done, the cross clamp can be taken off and the heart hopefully begins to resume normal function.</p>
<p>Edit: a word</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, we flush the donor organs with a preservative solution which removes almost all of the blood from the organ and  stabilize cell membranes to prevent cell death. </p>
<p>When sewing organs like liver transplants  in we have to sew the inflow (hepatic artery and portal vein) and the outflow (hepatic veins or vena cava). This is done while the recipient vessels are clamped off. If we open up the outflow clamps first, blood will flow backwards through the organs, essentially pushing out an significant amount of air.  We then open up the inflow vessels after we confirm their is no major bleeding from the outflow. </p>
<p>Some surgeons might leave a small hole in the outflow and vent blood through it with a clamp above it to flush air out and “purge” the system, then close the hole after reperfusion. </p>
<p>Some surgeons will also distend  some of the clamped vessels with saline in order to remove air from the connections. </p>
<p>Edit:  I would remiss if I didn’t take this opportunity to encourage anyone who is reading this to be sure to consider signing up as an organ donor. And tell your family your wishes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During organ procurement, the main vessels are clamped and a flush solution is run throughout the system. This flushes out the all the blood leaving it filled with flush solutions.  After the organs are removed from the body, they are again flushed with preservative solution for transport. So basically organs are filled with this and not air bubbles. When they are hooked up in the recipient, the artery is attached allowing blood to pump through the new organ while the rest of the organ isn’t hooked into the recipients circulatory system yet. Basically pumps the blood throughout the organ while flushing things out, then the other side is hooked up. So any air bubbles or preservative solution are just pumped into the surgical field not the patient. I hope that makes sense? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
