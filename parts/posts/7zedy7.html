		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi everyone, I'm Melinda Krahenbuhl, and I'm the Director of the Reed Research Reactor in Portland, Oregon. I'm here to answer your questions with help from Atlas Obscura, who <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/reed-college-research-reactor" target="_blank">wrote about the reactor</a>. I received my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Utah in 1998. I've previously served as the Director of the Dow Chemical Research Reactor (2008-2011) and the Reactor Adminstrator of the University of Utah Research Reactor (2004-2008). Under the Department of Energy's Industrial Assessment Center program, I completed 120 energy assessments for manufacturers in the intermountain region, ranging from manufacturers of ice cream to rocket motors. I participated from 1998 to 2008 in the Joint Coordinating Council for Radiation Effects Research-Project 2.4 analyzing exposures, bioassay data, and the biological fate of plutonium in the Russian weapons development workers. I have served on the National Organization of Test, Research and Training Reactors (TRTR) executive committee since 2008. In 2014, I became <a href="http://www.reed.edu/reed_magazine/september2013/articles/eliot_circular/krahenbuhl.html" target="_blank">the first female chair of TRTR</a>. I served as the chair for 2 Ph.D.'s and 6 Master students and employed over 100 undergraduates in her academic roles. I have 15 peer reviewed publications, and I've received federal funding for 17 projects with a financial value just over 2 million dollars. My research interests include biokinetic modeling, neutron activation and fission track analysis.</p>
<p>I'll be on from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. (18 UT), AMA!</p></div></div>
