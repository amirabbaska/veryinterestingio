		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a good question!  </p>
<p>For the sake of argument, let's say that 'the universe' is infinite.  Here, by 'the universe', i mean everything that exists.</p>
<p>We know from our observations of the cosmic microwave background (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" target="_blank">CMB</a>) that to a very good approximation, the universe is both homogeneous and isotropic on very large scales.  More importantly, we know that we can define a frame of reference that is at rest with respect to the universe as a whole.  This is a very important point, because it means that we can talk about the age of the universe <em>in some standard frame of reference</em>.  </p>
<p>This is important because we know from relativity that fast clocks run slower.  That means that two observers might disagree about 'the' age of the universe, without either of them being wrong.  It is only <em>comoving</em> observers that will agree on positions and lengths and times and distances.  But so, by defining a frame of reference that is comoving with the universe at large, we can establish a standard or common use measure for the age of the universe.</p>
<p>In this way, modern cosmology measures the age of the universe to be 13.7ish billion years.  (As a fun aside, a year in this context is defined to be 365.25 x 24 x 60 x 60. That is, a year is defined to be the number of seconds equivalent to a standard Julian year.  Strictly speaking, this has nothing to do with the number of times that the earth has gone around the sun -- not least because the earth has not be around for all that many of those 13 billion years!)</p>
<p>Next thing: light travels at the speed of light. This means that it takes time for light to travel from one place to another.  Sometimes you will hear people say something to the effect that this allows you 'to look back in time', but i think that this is potentially misleading.  A better way to think about this is that when you look across a great distance, you see <em>parts of the universe that are younger</em> than the here and now.</p>
<p>To see this, imagine that two points in space somehow had two identical clocks from the very beginning of the universe. A person standing right next to one clock would see that 13.7 Gyr had passed.  But looking at the other clock some distance away, they would see significantly less time had passed, depending on the amount of time it took for light to travel from one place to the other.  If they could measure the distance, and account for the light travel time, then of course everything would work out. But the point is that the age of that part of the universe that they are looking at is younger than where they sit.</p>
<p>And of course, both of them see the same thing -- both see that their observable universes appear younger and younger as they look out across greater and greater distances.</p>
<p>And the same is true for us: the age of the observable universe varies as a function of distance.</p>
<p>This is actually what limits the size of our (or anyone else's) observable universe: as we look back to the CMB, we are in a sense seeing the big bang <em>as it happens</em>. </p>
<p>Thus is our observable universe finite, even <em>if</em> the universe in its entirety is infinite, or if it's just <em>effectively</em> infinite, or if it's just big.</p>
<p>Great question!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;observable universe&quot; varies depending on age / distance (which are effectively the same thing - things further away are younger).  in particular, inflation makes this technically quite complex.</p>
<p>so &quot;observable universe&quot; is not as simple a concept as you might expect, which is what the top answer is basically saying.</p>
<p>however, that is largely an interesting diversion and doesn't really answer the core of the question.</p>
<p>the answer to the core of the question is that we don't know, we just assume so.  in fact the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle" target="_blank">cosmological principle</a> is a <strong>basic assumption</strong> that astronomers make.</p>
<p>so we <strong>assume</strong> it is the same everywhere - see the link above for more info.  we do not <strong>know</strong>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Observable universe is a part of &quot;Our universe.&quot; When I say &quot;Our universe&quot; it means the space-time that came out of big bang that we live in. Our universe has been expanding for a long time and at a rate much faster than speed of light. Again, expansion means that the galaxies are running away from each other in every direction at an accelerated rate. Now, light takes time to reach us. So, the farthest we can see in space is also the farthest we can see back in time. The oldest light observed in CMB radiation was 13.8 billion years old. Which means the oldest light has been traveling for that long. So, we conclude that the universe is 13.8 billion years old. And since we depend on light for &quot;observing&quot;, our observation limits to 13.8 b light years in distance. However, the space expanded much faster than light speed and is currently estimated to be about 98 billion light years across. Of which we can theoretically observe only 26billion light years (13.8b in each direction) This is what they call &quot;Observable universe.&quot; Indeed, the farthest observation made by hubble telescope was about 13.2 billion light years away. Isn't that amazing?</p>
<p>EDIT: There's a mistake in my answer. The 92 billion ly across (not 98) is still observable universe with the earth in center. Since objects that were right next to us back then are currently 45.5 billion ly away, due to expansion. Actual universe is much larger and may be infinite and has been expanding continuously. All of that is 13.8 billion years old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to quote Wikipedia to explain why I am writing about what is called the cosmological horizon. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though the universe might in theory have a longer history, the International Astronomical Union[4] presently use &quot;age of the universe&quot; to mean the duration of the Lambda-CDM expansion, or equivalently the elapsed time since the Big Bang in the current observable universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now for the confusing bits...</p>
<p>Each of us are surrounded by what is called a cosmic horizon. This is a sphere centered on us inside of which all things are moving at speeds relative to us slower than the speed of light. To explain, as we all know, no thing can exceed the speed of light. But, because the universe is expanding, and as you get further away, it expands faster, the expansion itself can move away from us at a faster rate than the speed of light.</p>
<p>To understand this, take an empty balloon and glue pennies to it. When you blow into the balloon, take note of one penny. The pennies nearer to the one you have chosen move away, but at a slower rate than the pennies furthest from the one you've chosen. The expansion of the surface of the balloon is exponential relative to the single penny you chose. You can choose any penny on the surface of the balloon and it will hold true for each. The universe expands away from every other independent object in the universe equally. </p>
<p>At about 13.8 billion light years away from us, the universe seems to swallow up galaxies. Now, of course, we've never witnessed this specifically, but at around this distance, the universe expands so fast that it is exceeding the speed of light relative to our position in space. </p>
<p>A troubling component to this is to think that beyond our horizon there may be worlds, universes, etc., which have exceeded our ability to detect them. In science, if you cannot observe something, that is to say - it is unobservable in principle - then it does not &quot;exist&quot; to science. It becomes metaphysical speculation. </p>
<p>Of course it makes no sense to think that as a world passes beyond the cosmic horizon that it ceases to exist, for we ourselves are passing beyond the cosmic horizon of some distant world and are effectively blinking out of their existence. </p>
<p>One other interesting fact about the &quot;edge of the universe,&quot; the cosmic horizon, is that it displays similar properties to black holes. As objects reach the edge of our known universe, they appear to slow down.</p>
<p>To us, the objects at the edge of the cosmic horizon disappear in the same way they do as they pass into a black hole. Temperature becomes infinite, they slow down until they appear to all but stop. If you could extend a theoretical thermometer to the edge of the galaxy, you would read infinite heat... but this doesn't mean the worlds are roasting. </p>
<p>To the worlds, passing this theoretical limit is a non-event, just like passing through the event horizon of a black hole is a non-event to anything doing so. The only difference with the horizon and the black hole is that there's not a singularity crushing the objects as they pass beyond our limits. </p>
<p>The question is, what happens to the information they contained? The data that makes up these objects? Is it painted on the horizon of our universe like a hologram? This is what is suspected of objects which fall into black holes, so it stands to reason the mathematics work similarly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer from a my limited understanding of the subject, being a non-scientist but interested in the subject: in the time just after the big bang, all the energy and matter in the universe was a dense plasma that was opaque. Radiation (light) could not pass through it. Once you reach a certain point in the universe's age, the radiation cooled enough to let photons decouple from matter, and allow light to move through the universe freely. That cooled off plasma became the cosmic background radiation. It exists in every direction we point our telescopes, and its a bit over 13 billion light-years away, which means, it existed as an opaque plasma back 13+ billion years ago. Scientist did the calculations and worked out that it would have taken at least 380 thousand years after the big bang for the plasma to cool enough to let photons decouple from matter and allow light to freely travel through space.</p>
<p>So, the edge of the observable universe is 13.8 billion light years from us, AND also is 13.8 billion years old. </p>
<p>The physical size of the universe might be much larger than our observable bubble of 13.8 billion light year radius, but the cosmic background radiation is the smoking gun evidence of its &quot;birthday&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
