<p>As you can see there don't seem to be any apparent fins on either of the rockets. So how do these rockets remain so stable?</p></div></div>

With one engine you get pitch and yaw, but not roll control. I don't know how they do that with just one engine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I haven't seen mentioned is the fact that all these rockets are aerodynamically stable without fins. Their centre of lift/drag is behind/lower than their centre of mass, so they tend to keep going roughly in the direction they're pointed, even without thrust vectoring. The length of the rocket is a big help in this. Being long relative to its weight means that the area aft of the centre of mass is large, increasing the amount of force pushing the rocket to face the direction it is moving.</p>
<p>A good comparison is a javelin, which, unlike an arrow, has no feathers to stabilize it, but flies relatively straight and true regardless because its front end is the weighted end. If it were the reverse, it would tend to spin around so that end faced the target no matter how it was thrown. This is one of several reasons why the movie move of throwing your sword would have been a very bad idea. Now, a javelin does not fly as straight as an arrow because the feathers of the arrow make it even more stable; but at the same time, the javelin's flight is much less likely to be impacted by the wind, even if it is the same size and mass, because the surface area of the feathers increases drag overall.</p>
<p>With rockets, the increase in drag and weight from fins usually outweighs any gains in stability, especially since a rocket is unlikely to be pointing anywhere except somewhere very close to the direction it's going. Correcting big deviations from centre are where fins shine. It isn't as simply as just slapping them on there, they have to have a structure that connects them to the rocket, require a different weight distribution in the stage, and perhaps even control surfaces for steering, all of which adds weight that rockets can ill afford.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also if they had big fins, landing the rockets would be harder. The thrust vectoring would have to work against them.  Fins work great one direction, not so well backwards and trying to steer for a clean, balenced landing </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
