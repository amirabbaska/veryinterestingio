		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Uber loses money because they are investing in scaling their business...</p>
<p>They are spending a ton of money on litigation and lobbying to be allowed to operate, since most urban areas had strict regulations on taxi services. They are fighting law suits, they are hiring lobbyist to pitch legislation changes to allow them to operate.</p>
<p>Uber also needs to build a symbiotic network of drivers and passengers in order for their platform to work. Drivers don't drive if there's no passengers, and customers won't use this service is they can't dependably get a ride when they need one. This means sign-on bonuses to drivers and discounts/artificially low fares to lure in passengers to build up a base of supply and demand.</p>
<p>Once they've established that they can operate legally, and have a base of drivers and passengers, then those expenses taper off considerably and the make profits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I saw a study not that long ago (end of 2016?) that basically looked at how Uber can lose so much money. They found that if they stopped spending money on expansion, and just operated in their current markets, they would be profitable. They are constantly trying to grow into markets, which is very expensive. The idea is that they are &quot;investing in the future&quot; and once they are in all these markets, it gives them more avenues for profit. It's about growth basically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because Uber is undercharging for rides (charging customers less then the net amount being paid to the drivers) in an attempt to force the competition out of business and gain a monopoly, after which they can charge what they want because they'll be the only choice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Uber heavily subsidizes each trip. ie when you book a trip on Uber it costs Uber more than you're paying. Uber has some costs: the biggest is paying their drivers but there are also costs involved in running and maintaining the app and marketing to consumers and recruiting drivers. They're also investing heavily in expanding their business and in developing driverless cars technology. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Original comment was automodded (oh the irony) so I will type a slightly longer contribution to fool our burgeoning robot overlords.</p>
<p>Uber is predicated, as a business, on the principle that human vehicle operators will soon become obsolete in light of AI transportation models.</p>
<p>Uber (and the sociopathic hedge funds that propagated them) will spend untold billions asserting market dominance to ensure that when the fall comes they are in prime position to profit from the eradication of human flesh from the transportation workflow.</p>
<p>It's a bit like that film The Matrix - every time you book an Uber ride you condemn human beings to a hunted existence of starvation and suffering. The upside being that a handful of already massively rich individuals get even richer.</p>
<p>Happy trails!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
