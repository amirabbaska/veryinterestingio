		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This article explains it pretty well.  It's like language, we are born with the ability and the amount of time we spend on tasks that use sense of direction directly influences how developed or underdeveloped our directional awareness becomes.  There's a lot of cool ethnographic research about sense of direction. We use egocentric coordinates that depend on where we are...but many cultures describe where they are and how to get places using fixed geographic locations....that requires them to basically have a compass updating constantly in their brain.  I wouldn't quote me on the exactness of these details because I read this quite a while ago in a cultural anthropology textbook, but some cultures have such a highly developed sense of direction that anyone can be taken out into the woods blindfolded at night and spun around a bunch of times and still know exactly what direction they were facing when the blindfold came off....really cool stuff.
Hope that helps!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17024677" target="_blank">This study</a> looked at structural MRIs of London taxi drivers (and bus drivers) and found the taxi drivers have a higher grey matter volume in the hippocampus compared to controls. The study suggests this is a consequence of a complex spatial awareness or &quot;map&quot; that allows taxi drivers to be expert navigators. As a control for similar job conditions minus navigation, they compare taxi drivers' brains to bus drivers' brains and see taxi drivers have more grey matter in the mid-posterior hippocampus and bus drivers have more in the anterior hippocampus. This may be indicative of a trade-off made in the brain of taxi drivers, wherein the complex spatial map sacrifices ability to acquire new spatial memories. I've pretty much just laid out the abstract here, so I'd recommend giving it a read.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Dr. Oliver Sack's book The Minds Eye, he discusses many of the standout cases he's seen. One thing he discusses is how his inability to remember faces is a condition that is on a spectrum. Some people are great with faces, some are awful, some in between. He describes navigation/sense of direction similarly as that you can have a type of agnosia that is topographical in nature. Not only can you not grasp directions given nor are you able to give directions, but even remembering how to get to work takes you months of repeatedly using the GPS morning and evening. Thats me. Used the GPS to get to school and work the first two years of each. Cannot remember landscape or directions. Can't get to my childhood home without struggling even, and lived there 16 years. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's got to do with a person spatial memory which is related to their hippocampal volume. There was an interesting study on how <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17024677/" target="_blank">London cab drivers have an increased hippocampal gray matter volume</a> that talks about how because of their need to know streets and how to navigate the city they have a greater spatial knowledge which lead to an increased hippocampus size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
