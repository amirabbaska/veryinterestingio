		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends what you mean by &quot;very similar&quot;, but I believe you will find the answer you seek in the concept of convergent evolution. This is what happens when different unrelated organisms converge upon the same solution to the set of problems which is a given way of life.</p>
<p>There are numerous examples, but a classic one is the overall shape and structure of dolphins and Ichthyosaurs. Dolphins are modern and need no introduction. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyosaur" target="_blank">Ichthyosaurs were swimming reptiles</a> which emerged in the Triassic and bit the bullet in the Cretaceous. Both faced the same problem: how to adapt a land-dwelling vertebrate to the ecological niche of a marine predator. And both developed similar features in response to the demands of that life strategy, and converged on the same solution developed by other lineages which shared that lifestyle [swordfish &amp; tuna for instance]: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a long, hydrodynamically tapered &amp; powerfully muscled body,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>limbs were redesigned as flippers and contributed to maneuverability,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the mouth became long and narrow on a narrow triangular skull with rows of pointed teeth well suited to gripping slippery fish,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the tail became finned and a powerful motive organ capable of sustained speed and sprinting,</p>
</li>
<li>Ichthyosaurs became viviparous and capable of delivering their young without leaving the sea to lay eggs on the shore – dolphins started viviparous and were sort of pre-adapted in this regard.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are other subsidiary problems on which Ichthyosaurs and Dolphins developed different solutions. The problem of locating prey for instance. Dolphins went the way of sonar and modified their skull and brains accordingly, while Ichthyosaurs located their prey by sight and developed the largest eyes in relation to body size of any vertebrate. Then there was breathing – dolphins migrated their nostril into a fused blowhole on the top of their skull, while Ichthyosaurs migrated their nostrils to the sides of their head in a pre-ocular position.</p>
<p>So, to come back to your question, convergent evolution has allowed lineages as unrelated as mammals and reptiles to converge on a roughly similar body plan in order to adapt to a similar ecological role. Ichtyosaurs dissapeared 65 Ma ago, while dolphins and other toothed cetaceans didn't really emerge in a form we'd recognize today before <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2777972/" target="_blank">about 34 Ma ago</a>. If you saw both side by side, you would not confuse one with the other, but you would recognise a series of similar traits. In that sense, you could argue that dolphins are recently evolved creatures similar to an extinct lineage. And there is indeed nothing precluding other lineages from such convergent evolution in the future, say for instance some other lineage of mammals such as rats (for arguments sake).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it does happen sometimes because of convergence.  If it occurs soon after a mass extinction the situation even has a name: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_taxon" target="_blank">&quot;Elvis taxon&quot;</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Convergent evolution is certainly capable of producing similar creatures to extinct ones, however there are several reasons why this is unlikely.</p>
<p>For one the environment is never likely to be identical to what it was in the past. For another the &quot;stock&quot; of creatures that might evolve to fill some niche are also different, so they might evolve differently to fill the same ecological niches. Perhaps most importantly, a &quot;dinosaur retread&quot; would face a very different competitive landscape than dinosaurs did historically, likely making it more difficult for them to exist in their &quot;primitive&quot; forms.</p>
<p>Exclude, for the moment, the impact of humans, let's imagine a world a million years ago for example. Consider a therapod dinosaur or analog trying to exist as a meat eating predator. They would have to subsist on the prey available to them, such as deer, antelope, bison, water buffalo, and such-like. They would have to compete against other predators like big cats, which would not be easy.</p>
<p>In fact, a sort of dinosaur analog in the form of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phorusrhacidae" target="_blank">terror birds</a> did exist in the Americas roughly from the time of the extinction of the dinosaurs up through only perhaps 2 million years ago. They were large two legged ground dwelling birds that preyed on other animals which would have lived a lifestyle quite similar to many therapod predators. They seem to have died out largely due to being out competed by other predators such as sabre toothed cats.</p>
<p>Many other species have lived in similar ecological niches as certain extinct creatures but being different and having different biologies they often ended up with rather different lives as well. For example, there are many oceanic predators that have some similarities to ichtyosaurs such as orca, dolphins, and sharks. But each of those brings a different biological toolset to the table and they have a different ecological landscape to inhabit (different populations of fish, different oceans, etc.) so they end up being substantially different despite their similarities. Similarly, elephants and sauropods have similarities but due to different biologies and different ecologies they also have substantial differences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Similar sure through convergent evolution.  This is how octopi have camera like eyes just as humans do.  Same solution to a similar problem.  However, it is quite unlikely that the earth will ever see anything like a stegosaurus again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
