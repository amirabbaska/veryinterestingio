		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your kidneys produce urine by filtering your blood stream. Urine is made of water, salt and wastes like urea and acid, among other things.</p>
<p>But your kidney isn't like your dumbass intestine which absorbs every single hamburger you ate at McDonald's and keeps it all in the form of fat. No, no, your kidney is smart and knows what should be kept and what should be discarded. This is done through a completely overly complicated system (which medicine students hate) that senses what do you have, what you don't need and what you really need. </p>
<p>If you decide to drink 7 liters of water because someone dared you or something, then you are going to <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/14/local/me-water14&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXxoDNg6DTAhULkpAKHTLPDHQQFggOMAE&amp;sig2=1COwxLl2klYxd_9YLs3fcw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHVxRFcHQ2R0SKsjh58N0_lBfAS7A" target="_blank">die </a>(first from the alteration of your, hydroelectric balance, then because from the embarrassment of appearing on YouTube &quot;Pranks gone wrong&quot;). But if you manage to survive, then you are going to pee mostly water. If you decide to dehydrate yourself because you heard it was a good way to lose weight (pro tip: it's not), your kidney will try to keep as much water as it can inside your blood stream while filtering everything else so your pee will look very dark or worse, you don't pee at all and keep all the wastes inside you. &quot;The composition of the body fluids is apparently determined not by what the mouth takes in, but by what the kidney keeps&quot;*</p>
<p>Your body is smart but it isn't magical. If you do stupid stuff like I mentioned earlier you are overworking it, so to answer your question: it's not good to have it too clear or too dark. &quot;Normal urine color ranges from pale yellow to deep amber â€” the result of a pigment called urochrome and how diluted or concentrated the urine is.&quot;**</p>
<p>But since you are constantly losing liquids through breathing, skin evaporation, urine and stool and you absolutely need water to live, it's safer to be a bit overhydrated than it is to be dehydrated. It's like money, I prefer to have $100 and waste it if I don't need it than having only a dollar and suffer for every cent spent. </p>

<p>Fun fact: alcohol confuses your body, it start thinking that you are well hydrated so your kidney filters water (that's why you have to pee so much) but you are actually running out of liquids. The party puts the music really loud, so you are forced to shout and you realize that your mouth is really dry so you keep drinking. And then you decide to dance with that friend of yours, losing even more liquids, but things got really hot and heavy so you decide to buy another cold beer, losing more and more liquids and you get where this is going.</p>
<p>Edit: added that you can die from drinking too much water. I don't want to be blamed of promoting that kind of behavior. If you want know more about it, I answered it to someone on the comments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To understand this, you have to know why we have urine at all. Your blood has to have a very precise chemical balance for your body to be able to work. If it's off even a little bit, you will get sick and eventually die, unless it's corrected. Your kidneys have the job of doing the corrections. They work by filtering out any excesses, returning blood that is chemically &quot;balanced&quot;, and they are very good at it. The stuff they filter out is basically urine. The most important things filtered out are extra water, extra salt, and urea, a chemical produced continually by the body. Another chemical filtered out by the kidneys is urobilin, which makes urine yellow. Removing certain amount of water is necessary to the process, whether your blood has excess water or not.</p>
<p>If you are dehydrated, meaning you have not been drinking as much water as your body needs, your kidneys will do their job by removing the bare minimum amount of water to get the other stuff out. That means the urine will be concentrated. Think of it as being like strong tea. Because everything including urobilin is concentrated, its color will be dark yellow. This is actually normal first thing in the morning because you don't drink water while you're sleeping. During the day, it's a reliable sign that your body could really use more water. But it doesn't have to be clear for you to be healthy; a well-hydrated person's urine will still be light yellow unless they are drinking much <em>more</em> water than they need.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was a tanker in the National Guard. We did our gunnery qualifications at Ft. Irwin...in August. They told us &quot;drink water, drink water, DRINK WATER. YOUR PISS SHOULD BE FUCKING CLEAR.&quot;  I did just that. I wasn't hungry and didn't eat much. I ended up passing out because I drank so much water I washed the electrolytes out of my body. I vaguely remember going to the first aid area, a shady place where they put you in the shade and plug in an IV until you can go back to work. I guess they didn't like my vitals. I briefly came to in the ambulance and one of the medics, a great kid named &quot;Mort&quot;, of all things, was leaning over me. He looked scared and sounded scared. He didn't think I could hear him. He said my pulse was &quot;thready&quot; and &quot;we are losing him&quot;. At the time I was ok with that and I was out again. I woke up for good in the hospital with a I.V. and a my pants pulled down to my knees. A big bag of ice was over my groin. AT was over for me that year. I was fucked up for over a week. Fuck those days. And Mort, if you are out there, thanks again man.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clearer urine is a sign of hydration but it doesnt need to be that clear, just not very dark. Side note, caffeine and alcohol are diuretics so they pull extra water into urine in the kidneys. So if you've drank something with them in it you'll have clearer urine but won't necessarily be hydrated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of comments discussing the color of urine (darkness), but none discussing the clarity.</p>
<p>The color of urine is determined by how much you drink, but also what you eat. Eating beetroot will turn your urine pretty dark, but it is not alarming. Not drinking enough water (or soda or beer or wine) will darken your urine too. 2-3 liter of fluids per day should be sufficient in a moderate warm climate.</p>
<p>Your urine should always be clear, with only the occasional floq in it. If your urine is having the clarity of orange juice or white beer, go see your doctor, as you will have a urine/bladder infection. Do not underestimate this, it can kill you. A simple test and antibiotic treatment will usually fix this. </p>
<p>If your urine is only mildly unclear, just drink a lot of water a couple of days (4-6 liter) and it will flush out the infection.</p>
