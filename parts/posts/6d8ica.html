		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple factors in play.</p>
<ol>
<li>Not all water sources are contaminated to the point that they will cause a problem for anyone, humans or animals. Most mammals have a highly developed sense of smell and they can smell water that is very bacteriologically active and they won't drink it. A muddy puddle is full of mud, but not necessarily anything else. Also, a lot of waterborne illnesses are simple bacterial infections that are inconvenient, but not deadly to animals or humans with functioning immune systems.</li>
<li>Animals gain resistance and immunity to waterborne pathogens in their area due to exposure over a lifetime. Notably, sudden changers in the pathogens in the water (often due to human activity) can kill large numbers of native wildlife.</li>
<li>Animals routinely <em>do</em> get sick from drinking contaminated water. Sick animals usually hide until they either recover or die, so you don't see them very often unless you know where to seek them out. (House pets like cats have this behavior mechanism, as well.)</li>
<li>In placental mammals, immunity gained by mothers can be passed along to offspring in a single generation. Certain genetic adaptions can also provide resistance or immunity to pathogens found in the animals' native environment. Animals who did not develop these immunities are often dead as of several generations ago.</li>
<li>Modern humans in developed areas have lived for many generations without having to worry about most waterborne pathogens, therefore we have bred the immunity for these pathogens out of ourselves. They are not a factor in survival and reproduction; Everyone survives and reproduces regardless of this factor. In areas without access to water of modern levels of cleanliness you will find resistance to the local waterborne pathogens in the population. Probably the example most familiar to people from the US is &quot;Montezuma's Revenge,&quot; illness northerners tend to contract from the water in Mexico. Mexicans are resistant/immune to it, people who are not regularly exposed to it are not.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit for further thoughts: All of these factors illustrate that, like many things in nature, the status quo is in fact a delicate balance of a combination of interrelated factors rather than a single simple mechanism. All of these act as a natural system of checks and balances that act to control populations of species by, yes, sometimes killing some of them. Upsetting one important factor among many can topple the entire web of interactions and result in the deaths of a lot of animals (or plants) or a permanent shift in which are the dominant species within an area. It goes without saying that most of the time this happens when we are able to observe it is due to human interference: A new foreign pathogen is introduced, animals are pushed away from their favored water sources by human development, parasites get moved from one location to another, etc. Natural disasters can have similar effects, too.</p>
<p>I've seen one or two comments suggesting gold for this post. If you're thinking about it, please don't. Reddit gold is ultimately pointless, and if those few bucks are really burning a hole in your pocket I suggest you donate them to some kind of wildlife or preservation charity instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have a ridiculously exaggerated understanding of the risk of contracting illness. In order to fall ill from dirty water, the contaminant has to actually be present in the bit of water you drink (it may not be mixed throughout it) in sufficient concentration. It has to survive your body's initial defences like stomach acid and proteases (another way of digesting and breaking down food, and also germs), and then take hold as an infection (in the case of germs - if the water is contaminated with heavy metals, say, this doesn't apply) and the infection needs to go unchecked by your immune system long enough that it presents as an illness. None of these stages are guaranteed, but there is a perception, presumably because in developed countries pretty much no-one drinks anything but clean water, that a single drop will make you ill.</p>
<p>Worldwide, 1.8 <em>billion</em> people only have access to unsafe, potentially contaminated water. They die from waterborne illnesses at a vastly greater rate than we in developed nations do, yes, but they are not in danger of extinction. Many people contract illnesses when young, fight them off, and gain immunity, as other people have said. Many infections are just asymptomatic - the infectious agent never takes hold enough to cause illness, or is of a strain which is less harmful.</p>
<p>EDIT: just in case it wasn't clear, this is not a good reason to drink dirty water. It's dangerous, just not as dangerous as a lot of people think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In part it's immunity gained by getting ill once, or a few times and surviving it. The immune system remembers what foreign organisms it encountered before and fights them a lot faster and efficiently when an infection happens again (with exceptions from the rule, not all pathogens produce a lasting immunity). </p>
<p>In part it's evolution at work. The wolf that couldn't handle half-rotten meat simply didn't live long enough to reproduce. Disadvantages like that get culled very quickly in nature. Most people living today have a genetic immunity to illnesses that were devastating a few generations earlier. The Spanish Flu wouldn't be as bad today as it was 1918 because we're the descendants of the survivors.</p>
<p>If there are few water sources, then those have an advantage who can use even the dirtiest puddle without major consequences. </p>
<p>But, you also only see the animals drinking, not hiding in the undergrowth puking their souls out, or dying prematurely from infections and poison. Just because they drink something doesn't mean it's automatically ok for them to do so. If there's nothing better to be had, they'll go for it and hope for the best, not like they can go to the next convenience store and buy a bottle of water instead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would refute the top comment on this post. The largest part of our innate immunity (that which defends us all the time in regards to pretty much all organisms) is our natural flora- or basically the bacteria in our colon. Yes, our immune system interacts and accepts this flora but that's above the ELI5. Everyone has different ratios and compositions of this flora. However, in some regions of the world, some humans have similar species profiles of flora.  </p>
<p>For instance- think of Montezuma's revenge. This is a bacteria commonly found in water in Mexico that American's don't encounter. When the American guy (gut, but what a funny autocorrect) encounters this bacteria it causes diarrhea. When Mexican's drink it, it doesn't because this bacteria is already in their gut and they live with it, and it doesn't cause any problems!!  </p>
<p>There are some fun flora profiles that scientists are experimenting with right now that protect against certain diseases and provide unique amounts of nutrition to people in food-scarce environments. There even is a c-dif treatment called a fecal transplant where they take someone's poop that has awesome flora makeup and stick it in your colon to try and reset your floral makeup.  </p>
<p>Also: you have to get ENOUGH of the bacteria in you to get sick. Your body can handle small amounts of certain deadly or non-beneficial organisms. You eat bacteria in meat all the time. Some people are seemingly immune to food poisoning when others get sick. Maybe they are one less taco, maybe they ate their boogers as a kid because staph is commonly in the nose and staph is the MC food poisoning bug. Shigella is well known as a bug that has a very low threshold for infection, with some estimates placing the number of bugs needed to ingest for infection around 10!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many are mentioning expsoure immunity, which is part of the case, as is evolutionary selection for ability to survive it.</p>
<p>But also important is simply a higher social tolerance for death rates.  Animals die all the time from this sort of thing - when you read about a flock of birds suddenly falling dead; or go out and see a bunch of carcasses around some water that looks a lot dicey.  In nature, drinking whatever water you find might give you some death rate (say 1-10%) which your species can survive.  Among humans, we'd notice and worry about that.  If your species does better on average by drinking whatever water is there and losing some fraction of the population (as opposed to limiting your population size to only safe water) then evolution might move you in that direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
