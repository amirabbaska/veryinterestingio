		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A black hole built from antimatter or one built from matter with the same mass are identical.</p>
<p>The quantity that distinguishes matter from antimatter is the baryon number. It is the total number of baryons (like protons and neutrons) minus the number of antibaryons. Baryon number is conserved in the standard model and that is what you would recognize as &quot;conservation of matter&quot; in some sense, and the reason for which the proton is stable in the SM: it is the lightest baryon and so it cannot decay to anything else because it needs to preserve its baryon number of +1. So the proton can only release its mass in energy for lighter particles if it meets an antibaryon carrying -1 baryon number, so they total to 0 and they can produce lighter non-baryon particles such as photons or mesons. That's why matter &amp; antimatter annihilate.</p>
<p>(A similar argument works with leptons, with a thing called lepton number).</p>
<p>These, baryon and lepton #, however, are not conservation laws with any specific deep or fundamental justification behind, they are just accidental symmetries of the standard model. (Unlike, for example, charge). As soon as you step out of the SM, these are violated. Black holes are well outside the SM and do not care in the slightest about baryon number. Black holes don't have a well-defined baryon number and throwing a proton or an anti-proton* into a black hole produces the same final black hole, whose only macroscopic distinguishing properties are mass, charge and angular momentum. After a lot of time the black hole has evaporated into Hawking radiation which is made of standard model particles, and the final baryon number of the radiation does not have any discernible relation with the baryon number of all the stuff that fell in. </p>
<p>* woops forgot: except for charge, charge is conserved even by BHs. So maybe you can throw a hydrogen atom (baryon # 1, charge 0) or an anti-hydrogen atom (baryon # -1, charge 0). Or neutron/antineutron.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even if the matter and antimatter inside of the now-merged black holes annihilate, the total energy of both is still contained inside of the black hole and cannot go anywhere anyways. Given that there is an equivalence between mass and energy, which does apply to particles with a mass of zero according to the full mass-energy equation (E^2 = (mc^(2))^2 + (pc)^(2), from which the famous E = mc^2 is derived), and that the only path available once inside the event horizon is towards the center of it, the mass of the resulting black hole would simply be the sum of the masses of the two colliding black holes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically speaking, we have not yet demonstrated that Antimatter and matter behave identically in terms of gravity. CERN was able to run a few tests, but the error bars were on the order +/-100%.
If antimatter moves away from normal matter and toward antimatter due to gravity, then an antimatter black hole would have an event horizon for which no normal matter could get any closer, making it impossible for such a collision to ever occur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A black hole can be considered to be two separate things, one a phenomenon of matter, one a phenomenon of space-time.</p>
<p>A black hole is formed from a very high-density collection of mass. Typically this is something like a collapsing neutron star or stellar core. The composition of the matter inside the black hole after the formation of the event horizon is a very complicated question, and something that theorists still haven't decided on completely.</p>
<p>However, the nature of the black hole to the rest of the Universe is very much different. From the outside the black hole is no longer a phenomenon of matter, it's primarily a phenomenon of space-time. What's &quot;inside&quot; the black hole is almost entirely irrelevant to the rest of the Universe. This is because there is no way for the matter trapped inside a black hole to influence the rest of the Universe, except gravitationally (and electrostatically if you want to get technical).</p>
<p>Many people have a fundamentally classical idea of how a black hole works. Generally something along the lines of an object with an escape velocity higher than light, so that even light can't escape from the black hole. This ignores the fundamental nature of black holes, however, which is closely tied into relativity and the behavior of space-time. Within a black hole's event horizon there is simply &quot;no way out&quot;. The event horizon is a one way door, once you pass it there are no space-time trajectories that go forward in time which leave the black hole (in fact, that do anything other than eventually travel to the singularity). This is important to understand because it recasts a black hole from a weird phenomenon related to light somehow to a phenomenon that directly affects the nature of, well, the fabric of reality. A black hole is like a little pocket Universe with no way out.</p>
<p>Once you shift to that conception some of the details of black holes might make sense. For example, whether a black hole is made of matter or anti-matter (or, indeed, entirely of photons) is irrelevant externally. Nothing that happens inside the black hole can escape the event horizon. If, hypothetically, you had one black hole that was formed from a collapsing star and another black hole that was formed from a collapsing anti-star merging them would still necessarily result in just a bigger black hole (mass-energy is just mass-energy). What happens inside the black holes isn't something that can affect the event horizons themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it takes too many people to point out that once matter or antimatter goes into a blackhole, it's no longer matter or antimatter. It's becoming the blackhole. A blackhole is not a lump of matter or antimatter; it's a singularity of space-time, but it has the mass of matter/anitmatter that falls into it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
