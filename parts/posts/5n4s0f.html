		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most tribal lands (barring the huge gigantic ones in created by mashing a bunch of completely different people groups together) are pretty small. They're also almost never on valuable land. What's an industry that doesn't take up a lot of space, is pretty damn lucrative, and doesn't need a ton of natural resources? Congrats, you've got gambling. Pretty much just gambling. </p>
<p>Casinos are one of the few fairly reliable large industries the US lets tribes have, but trying to build a casino when there hasn't been one before is hell itself. For real, recognized tribes have to fight local legislation tooth and nail to build on land they own. </p>
<p>Fun fact, a lot of tribes don't have federally mandated reservations. Some were either never forcibly removed en masse (many ojibwe nations) but rather had land &quot;purchased&quot; from them over time; or lost all their land but returned to find it under new ownership (nansemond bands). Under these circumstances, it's super difficult to convince local governments that they don't have the right to govern lands owned by the tribes.</p>
<p>As for the whole tradition and honor thing, that's pretty much 90% Hollywood bs. Family is important, learning the culture is important, sure, but in what culture is that not true? And it's pretty hard to keep your culture alive when you're forced into poverty, had your grandparents taken to what's essentially child prison camps to get their language and way of life beaten outta them, then told you're not a real country/American/Indian enough, and constantly legislated into not being able to do the things your ancestors did. Pretty much fucking sucks all around, honestly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tribes are technically &quot;Sovereign Nations&quot; this means US laws do not apply on reservation land. Some even go so far as to have their own <a href="http://www.caretakersoftheearth.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Haudenosaunee-passport.jpg" target="_blank">passports</a>.</p>
<p>It's an odd scenario where they can be US citizens, but do not have to be.</p>
<p>Though back to the casinos. many US states have laws against gambling. Or laws requiring certain odds. These laws do not apply to the reservations, as they are not part of the state, <em>technically</em>.</p>
<p>So they can have much worse odds. Usually the state will indefinitely lease the land to the casino in exchange for a cut of the profits. This allows them to circumvent all laws and regulation, without compromising their &quot;values&quot; against gambling.</p>
<p>basically it's one giant loophole and it makes lots of money, so it keeps happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before Europeans colonized North America, tribes were essentially their own countries. Colonization/conquest eroded that status over time, but under American law, tribes still have many of the powers they originally had as independent sovereigns.
Before the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, there were multiple court decisions (like Seminole Tribe v. Butterworth) that said the ability to allow gaming was one of those powers still within tribal sovereignty. IGRA limited that inherent authority, regulating how tribes have to go about gaming activities and coordinating with the states -- it didn't create their authority, though.
Indian gaming grew because, in some places, tribes had a competitive advantage and a good market. But only about half of  tribes actually have any gaming at all, and only a fraction of those have very large, profitable casinos. Some have decided not to do gaming for the reasons you hint at: they think it creates too many problems, isn't consistent with their culture, or just won't be profitable in their situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
