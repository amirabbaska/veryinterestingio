		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many organisms thrive in acidic environments, or at the very least are able to survive in them. We frequently ingest organisms that could cause illness, but in small enough populations that, even if they survive, they can't get enough of a foothold in our bodies to actually cause symptoms of illness. When a large enough population is introduced all at once, there's not a lot your stomach acids will do for you, and some organisms will actually grow faster in a highly acidic environment.</p>
<p>On top of that, not all food-born illnesses are caused by living organisms. Listeria is a common cause of food born illness because the organism itself doesn't make us sick, rather it produces waste products that are poisonous to us. If a large enough population of Listeria is allowed to breed in food that is then cooked, the organisms themselves will die during cooking, but the toxic waste byproducts they created don't actually break down when cooked.</p>
<p>Microscopic organisms are extremely resilient, because they have to be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your stomach acid isn't very strong (or more properly, concentrated), in the scheme of things. Much of the work is done by enzymes, in conjunction with the acid. Furthermore, the acid is produced as needed. You don't walk around with half a litre of concentrated acid sloshing around.</p>
<p>The acid is produced by special cells. Some people, like me, have over active ones. We take drugs known as proton pump inhibitors, so we don't make too much acid (protons).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When the acidity of your stomach is off balance from what it usually is, it can cause a purge of it's contents in an effort to resume proper pH levels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question. When we eat food the stomach helps break it down but not so much that we end up with elemental carbon in our gut instead of sugars fats and proteins right? So it helps break the food up but doesn't destroy everything like ripping apart protein chains. </p>
<p>Food poisoning may usually be caused by bacteria, but it's not a bacterial infection that makes us sick, it's the metabolic byproducts of that bacteria. Take botulism for instance; the bacteria create a poison as they multiply and it's the poison that makes us sick, not the bacteria. That poison ends up deposited in the food and so eating it is literally eating poison. And much the same way the stomach doesn't turn protein into carbon, it doesn't turn poison into carbon, it stays as poison. </p>
<p>Even from a bacteria stand point our stomachs don't sterilize the food we eat with acid. Living bacteria makes its way into the gut where it has to compete with the colonies already living there. Along with our own immune system we end up with a good balance of beneficial bacteria with malign invaders not gaining a toehold in our gut. We benefit from this because gut fauna help us digest our food even better and get more nutrients from it than we would without it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm a second year microbiology student. Microbes are quite a cool bunch with lots of adaptations that make them able to colonise quite a broad spectrum of places. Whilst the stomach is highly acidic, which is generally good enough to kill most microbes that enter the gastrointestinal tract. There are some microbes, such as helicobacter pylori that are able to evade this acidity by secreting neutralising agents, along with burrowing into the stomach cells and hiding in a sense. Other times, the microbes actually don't survive, but their exotoxins (the things they secrete that make us sick or cause injury to our cells) are stable enough to survive their time in the stomach. They then pass through into the intestine where they can cause a range of diarrhoeal diseases. I can't think of any off the top of my head. But hopefully this is helpful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
