		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, reddit! I'm Alan Eustace and I'm here with Jerry Kolber. We're the subject and director, respectively, of the documentary <strong>14 MINUTES FROM EARTH</strong>, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in April of this year and was released On Demand this past Tuesday. Jerry's film documented the process by which I broke the world record for high-altitude jump in 2014 at the age of 57 when I dropped from a gas-powered balloon 135,000 feet above the earth. Check out the film's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNsWPWbFRo" target="_blank">trailer</a>!</p>
<p>The plan began as a scribble on a paper napkin and took three years of working in secrecy to come to fruition. In 2011 I began working with Taber MacCallum and Jane Poynter, co-founders of <a href="http://www.paragonsdc.com/" target="_blank">Paragon Space Development Corporation</a>, to bring the plan to life. Because a private citizen cannot simply purchase a space suit from NASA, we also worked with <a href="http://www.ilcdover.com/" target="_blank">ILC Dover</a>, outfitters of every United States astronaut in the Apollo program.</p>
<p>Jerry Kolber, the film's Executive Producer and Director, is the co-creator and show runner of the Emmy-nominated series &quot;Brain Games&quot; on National Geographic, and has created, produced, and served as showrunner on many other award-winning scripted and un-scripted series. <a href="http://thisisatomic.com/" target="_blank">Learn more about his work</a>.</p>
<p>Ask us anything about the jump or the film! We'll be online at 2:00pm EST to answer your questions.</p>
