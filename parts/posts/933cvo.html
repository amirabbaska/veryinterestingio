		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The notion of gravity attracting mass is itself faulty. Gravity doesn't attract mass, but indeed attracts energy and momentum which light certainly has (and regular matter too) </p>
<p>E=γmc²
p=γmv </p>
<p>where γ (Greek letter Gamma) is the Lorenz factor. It is the factor by which time, length, and relativistic mass change for an object while that object is moving.</p>
<p>So, not only does light gets bent passing by planet, star or a black hole, but light also attracts the star, planet or the black hole in return. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing about Newtonian gravity is that it is not really correct. What Einstein found was that gravity is better described by things trying to travel in straight lines and light is not an exception. The idea is that gravity changes the properties of spacetime so that what is a straight line to a light ray doesn't look straight for someone watching the light go by. The light appears to be bent by the gravitational field, so we say that light is affected by gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At its core, the gravitation felt by a body DOES NOT depend on its mass. </p>
<p>If you take <a href="https://youtu.be/5C5_dOEyAfk?t=2s" target="_blank">a feather or a hammer</a>, it will experience the same free fall in a gravitational field (in the absence of other effects such as air friction). Likewise, the orbital periods of planets around the sun only depend on the mass of the sun (and their distance to the sun) and absolutely not on their own mass : an asteroid at the same distance as Jupiter to the sun has the exact same orbital velocity, even though it is gazillion times lighter. The most extreme case would be Light, which is massless : since gravity does not depend on the mass of the body experiencing it, it is also felt by Light.</p>
<p>So what's wrong with you formula ? In dynamics (the science of bodies in motion), motion is modified in the following manner: </p>
<ul>
<li>positions are modified because a body has a non-zero velocity</li>
<li>velocities are modified because a body has a non-zero <strong>acceleration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Gravity generates an acceleration, independently of the mass of the body experiencing it. Usually, as Newton,  we interpret an acceleration as the result of a force, but in the case of Gravitation, we don't really need this intermediate, called 'Force', because we obtain directly this acceleration. The proper framework to compute this acceleration is through the mathematics and physics of curved space-time, also known as Einstein's Theory of General Relativity.  Newtonian gravity, the one you used here, is only an approximation of Einstein's theory, valid only in non-extreme regime of acceleration or densities for instance. </p>
<p>That being said, it's really close to be correct, but you have to switch to accelerations instead of sticking to forces. The Newtonian force, as you wrote, is given by:</p>
<p>GMm/(r^2) </p>
<p>but according to Newton the force felt by a body of mass m is simply related to the acceleration a via a simple coefficient m' :</p>
<p>GMm/(r^2) = m' a</p>
<p>This coefficient m' should also depend on the quantity of matter in the body that feels this force.</p>
<p>Newton had to postulate an 'equivalence principle', saying that this simple coefficient m' is EXACTLY equal to m. Admitting this equality we can write :</p>
<p>a= GM/(r^2)</p>
<p>As can be seen the acceleration does not depend anymore on the mass of our body that experiences gravity, because it has been factored out ! And at first sight it could be applied to a massless photon. Of course it's fishy because in the case of the photon, it is equivalent to a division by zero, which is forbidden. But somehow it captures the spirit of how gravity works. The keyword is acceleration and not force.</p>
<p>Finally, if we look at this equivalence principle, m=m', it tells us something fundamental, it tells us that gravitation is somehow aware of something deep about dynamics, because it uses the exact same coefficient as the one used by dynamics, even in a context where gravitation is absent.</p>
<p>Force=m' a</p>
<p>is always true, even if the force is electromagnetic, nuclear, a spring, etc. But if this force is gravity, because it contains the same factor intrinsically related to dynamics, this factor can be erased. It's one of the great mystery of gravity and one of the reason it has to be described using the geometry of space-time. </p>
<p>Gravitation is not a force like the others, because it understands dynamics in a more intimate manner than all the others.</p>
<p>EDIT : ok it's more like ELI25, but that's the best I could do !</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
