<p>If you recall the Circle of Fifths, it is based on the fact that going up 12 perfect fifths is the very nearly the same as 7 octaves.  But very nearly is not exactly.</p>
<p>When tuning an instrument, you have two choices, make all fifths a little off, or make some exact and some way off.  Many tuning strategies go for the second option, and music written for them simply avoids the using the bad fifths.  One, in particular, makes 11 of the 12 fifths good, and the 12th really bad.  That fifth is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mean5th_Wolf_5th.ogg" target="_blank">wolf fifth</a> because the binaural beats it produces warbles, to some people at least, like a howling wolf.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The intervals on a guitar are as follows</p>
<p>p4 p4 p4 M3 p4</p>
<p>p4 = Perfect 4th; M3 = Major 3rd</p>
<p>String instruments like Ukulele and Bouzouki often have the same top 4 strings (p4 M3 p4)</p>
<p>The upright bass is tuned similarly to the bottom strings (p4 p4 p4)</p>
<p>So the guitar, with its 6 strings, is kind of like a mashup of the tuning systems of these 4-stringed instruments. It's really good for playing bass notes on the low strings because each string has a different note. The high strings are good for playing melodies on because the intervals are close together, and varied. </p>
<p>There are other tunings that are good for this, like Orkney tuning, but Standard is probably more versatile for open and barre chords.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
