		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To show hostility toward the state-enforced atheist Soviet Union. Before that it did not say 'under God' and it's not an issue now because you can't be compelled to say the pledge, nor does it specify which god of which religion they're talking about. It's just that the majority of Americans are Christian so they default to that one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was added in the 1950s. Previously, it was not in there, and the pledge then was actually fairly new, arising in the 1890s. There had been some smaller changes since the pledge started, so changing stuff wasn't something particularly crazy or unique,</p>
<p>The idea was to make the pledge more against the atheist crazy commies, the cold war was real in the 1950s, and terrifying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All that has been said about how the pledge was amended decades after its composition in a reactionary response to the godless Soviets and their godless atheism ....yes. </p>
<p>And interpretations about what 'religious freedom' means, and how specific or general you take the term 'under god'... sure, ok, sure, whatever you think. </p>
<p>I just came to say that The Pledge of Allegiance is not a founding document, it was not conceived by the founding fathers. It was written over a hundred years after The Continental Congress, The Declaration of Independence, The Constitution, The Bill of Rights, etc. </p>
<p>The Pledge of Allegiance does not represent founding principles. It's an oath of loyalty to a post-civil war vision of America. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;under god&quot; part was not originally there. Nor was the &quot;In god we trust&quot; on currency. They were added during the Red Scare so that America could distance itself from those &quot;evil atheist communists&quot; as much as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was added during the cold war as part of the psychological combatting of communism. The Soviets were violently atheist and so supporting God was seen as a way of standing against communism. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
