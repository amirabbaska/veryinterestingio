		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finding all-cause mortality on populations of animals is difficult to find at best, so take this <a href="http://www.pgc.pa.gov/Wildlife/WildlifeSpecies/White-tailedDeer/Documents/Fawn_Survival.pdf" target="_blank">study i found</a> on white tailed deer with a grain of salt.    </p>
<p>In order of mortality causes (From the table on page 5);       </p>
<p>Natural causes: 38.3% (Includes deaths attributed to disease, malnutrition, flooding, fire, birthing issues and about 2 dozen other health defects that result in chronic illness or death)  </p>
<p>Predators: 17%   </p>
<p>vehicles: 14%      </p>
<p>Hunting: 10%          </p>
<p>Farm machinery: 6.4%     </p>
<p>Bizarre accidents: 4.3% (notably a deer that fell down a well and subsequently died)         </p>
<p>Poaching: 2.1%  </p>
<p>~19%: unknown as deer collars were removed or foul play/poaching was suspected.        </p>
<p>Granted this was over a period of just 34 weeks to the exact figures might change over a longer observation period.</p>
<p>From this you could infer that without human interaction most deaths would likely be natural causes from chronic health issues and predation, though i would not be confident enough to state the mortality rates would be similar between species and geographic locations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
