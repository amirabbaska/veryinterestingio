		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a mathematician I get this question a lot. One can say that there are two parts of mathematics. The first is applied mathematics, which is revolutionizing fields from biology to computer science to finance to social work. The second is pure mathematics, or the development of mathematical structure, theory, and proof. Why study pure mathematics? Consider that when Einstein wanted to describe general relativity he used Riemannian geometry from the 1800s. String theory? Uses functions studied by Euler in the 1700s. Mathematicians are developing the tools and knowledge upon which the discoveries of tomorrow are built.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>

<p>Heavens, no!</p>
<p>What you learn in school as mathematics is actually just a small <em>subset</em> (and many say a very <em>boring</em> subset) of what mathematics is generally.  There are branches of mathematics that deal with things like studying the properties of prime numbers (which is <em>one</em> element of a field called number theory, and is studied from a variety of different perspectives), or with understanding the behavior and structure of surfaces as you stretch or fold or manipulate them (part of topology), or with understanding how the solutions to certain polynomial equations can lead to beautiful links between geometry and algebra and even topology (one aspect of algebraic geometry), or with understanding arrangement of objects that meet certain requirements of symmetry (design theory, which is a subfield of combinatorics).</p>
<p>In each of these fields, there are plenty of open questions.  Some of them are technical and intricate-- you would need some serious background to understand the question itself.  But some of the questions are easy to understand, but still a real <em>bitch</em> to answer.</p>
<p>For instance, there's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture" target="_blank">Collatz Conjecture</a>, which is straightforward enough as a problem (do all positive integers eventually settle into the 4-2-1 pattern?).  We don't have a solution for the problem, and our toolkit for going after this sort of problem isn't very well-developed.  It's likely to remain an open problem for a while.</p>
<p>Trick is, mathematics is the study of relationships and interconnections of ideas.  Those ideas are often very carefully defined, but that care and precision allows mathematicians to bring a variety of tools to bear on those ideas.</p>
<p>And ideas are... well, ideas are everywhere.  Somebody wondered what would happen if you brought mathematical ideas to bear on the Rubik's cube.  Or Sudoku.  At a big math conference this year, somebody discussed what could happen if you put the game &quot;Flow Free&quot; onto a different shape, like a ball or a donut.  Mathematicians looking at quantum physics said, &quot;Hey, that looks like the symmetric group!&quot; and helped build models for the behavior of particles at a ridiculously small scale.  There have been mathematical tools developed to measure gerrymandering.  Somebody looked at data science and data analysis, and realized that some of the problems looked a lot like topological problems-- and so there is a field called &quot;topological data analysis&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is preventing this end point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would say the fact that mathematics has an infinite number of questions to ask, and at least SOME of those questions will always be interesting to SOMEBODY.  Fermat's Last Theorem captured the imaginations of mathematicians for CENTURIES-- which is all to the good, because many of the failed attempts led to interesting new tools, or to related questions.  Even in &quot;failure&quot;, mathematics often advances itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first question to ask is: what do any academics do, especially in STEM? What is left to discover? We can look at physics. If Newton's view of physics was right, research would largely have died out long ago. But the universe is much stranger than we thought. Relativity, Quantum Theory, Exotic Particles, etc. There's so much going on that we have open questions left for many future lifetimes. And how about biology? Well, if it was all about balancing the four humors, we wouldn't have quite so many people in labcoats. But even just human biology is a tremendous biochemical and genetic mess that we are just starting to de-tangle. So it probably doesn't seem too strange that professional biologists exist.</p>
<p>One reason you might think that all math has been discovered is that you haven't been acquainted with how large and strange the mathematical universe is. Mathematical models are, and have been, used to describe physical phenomenon from the complex rippling of waves to the folding of proteins and the stochastic behavior of the stock market. Deep mathematical ideas are needed to talk about relativity and quantum mechanics and string theory and to help find structure in the genetic code. Computer encryption uses mathematics, so there must be some part of mathematics that deals with how to conceal and recover information. Modern machine learning relies on increasingly sophisticated paradigms of statistical inference. In a certain sense (with some important caveats), mathematics needs to be at least as complicated as any of its applications.</p>
<p>Behind (beneath?) these applications is so-called pure mathematics. The distinction is fuzzy near the boundary but not entirely arbitrary. There are mathematicians that try to understand the nature of logical and mathematical systems: can everything proven be true? can our axioms describe everything of interest? There are mathematicians that try to understand how to compare and quantify knots. There are mathematicians that try to study how complex multi-dimensional signals can be decomposed into various sorts of basic waves. There are mathematicians trying to build a 'multiverse' of geometries in which different shapes can be compared and moved between. There are mathematicians who try to find fast algorithms to find routes on complex networks.</p>
<p>The key word in all these examples is &quot;trying&quot;. As mathematicians, we are foraying into the unknown. We don't know what will work and what will fail. We remain largely ignorant of the important questions to ask. It often turns out that we were studying something from the wrong perspective, making it unnecessarily difficult. And more often than not, every time we get an answer it gives us just enough insight to realize how peculiar and strange it all is, and sends us down yet another rabbit hole. We're currently far below the surface of the earth, moving between massive caverns by way of increasingly narrow tunnels. Please send help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is an example of what an applied mathematician might be doing:</p>
<p>A widely studied (yet still not completely understood) phenomenon is fluid turbulence.</p>
<p>When you look at the smoke coming from a fire, and you see all the swirls in the smoke, you are observing turbulence. When you are on an airplane, and suddenly the plane starts shaking, you are experiencing turbulence. Given how common fluids are in the world, understanding how turbulence behaves is super important.</p>
<p>We would like to be able to explain how turbulence behaves using mathematics. The reason we are using mathematics, is because mathematics is the tool that physicists and engineers use to do what they do. </p>
<p>Think about how you can use mathematics to calculate how long it takes for a ball to fall from a tall building. The same is true for using mathematics to explain how turbulence behaves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, trying to characterize turbulence, and trying to predict how it behaves using mathematics is very difficult to do.</p>
<p>It's so difficult, that there hundreds of mathematicians and scientists all over the world studying it, and working out the mathematics needed to fully describe turbulence.</p>
<p>You need complicated mathematics to be able to calculate things like how a fluid flows around objects, or how objects moving through fluids are affected. </p>
<p>At some point (not too far ahead though, unfortunately), the mathematics needed just hasn't been developed yet.</p>
<p>You need mathematicians to come up with ideas, and to work out these ideas, to make sure that these ideas are indeed correct. They spend a lot of time proving things, because they want to be sure that what they are discovering is correct.</p>
<p>This field has been around for a few hundred years now, and there is still a lot more to learn.</p>
<p>I hope that helped. Although my example was for applied mathematicians (mathematicians whose work directly relates to real world applications), pure mathematicians do a similar thing, except their work is more abstract.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
