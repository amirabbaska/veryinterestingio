		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kellyanne Conway is a counselor to the president, who recently in a speech mentioned an event called the bowling green massacre as evidence for the need for more strict immigration rules.</p>
<p>However, there was no such massacre. What <em>actually</em> happened is that in Bowling Green, Kentucky, an FBI agent posing as an Al Qaeda member approached two Iraqi refugees, asking if the two wanted to help him obtain and ship weapons to the extremists back in Iraq. The two men agreed, and obtained weapons illegally, at which point the FBI revealed itself. The two were arrested and the incident prompted a six-month rescreening of all incoming Iraqi refugees. However, it's important to note that at no point was there even a plan or effort to attack US citizens with the weapons, just ship them.</p>
<p>Upon further digging, it's become apparent that Kellyanne Conway has on two other ocassions also referred to this nonexistent massacre, causing people to suspect it was no slip of the tongue but an intentional false presentation of events in order to generate support for President Trump's immigration ban. This is also the same woman who gave us the &quot;altnerative facts&quot; quip, so a lot of the media already considered her a joke. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The Bowling Green massacre is a nonexistent incident referred to by U.S. Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway in an interview on the television news program Hardball with Chris Matthews on February 2, 2017. Conway cited the &quot;massacre&quot; as justification for a travel and immigration ban from seven Muslim-majority countries enacted by United States President Donald Trump. However, no such massacre ever occurred. The next day she said she had misspoken and had actually been talking about the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky, on terrorism charges.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Never happened. Kellyanne Conway, in her zeal to defend the travel ban and &quot;Muslim ban&quot;, said that legislation like this was necessary to prevent another &quot;Bowling Green Massacre&quot;. She's since tried to walk back this claim, stating that she misspoke and meant to say &quot;terrorists&quot;... but it's highly unlikely it was unintentional or just a mere slip of the tongue when you consider this is the same woman who brought us &quot;alternate facts&quot;. She's also made this same claim on at least 2 other occasions, and the word terrorists wouldn't have fit the context of the sentence she was using at the time in this instance. (As far back as 2011, she said in an interview about Obama:  “He did that because two Iraqi nationals came to this country, joined ISIS, traveled back to the Middle East to get trained and refine their terrorism skills and come back here, and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers' lives away.” She's also made similar statements on at least 2 other occasions, and has referred more than once to &quot;innocent soldiers&quot; in Bowling Green, KY being killed by terrorists.) </p>
<p>What actually happened was that two potential terrorists (mind you, they had not yet committed any acts of terror on US soil, but they did claim responsibility for attacks on US soldiers in Iraq and were attempting to send money and weapons to Iraq for what we can only presume are the same purposes (attacking US soldiers in Iraq). However, that does not serve to bolster her argument because the ban was purportedly intended to prevent <em>domestic</em> terrorism...so she offered an &quot;alternate facts&quot; version. Which is to say, she lied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
