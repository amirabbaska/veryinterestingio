		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is part of digital forensics and is kind of like asking 'how do you know that this person murdered this other person without actually witnessing it?'.</p>
<p>You can narrow hacking down to </p>
<p>1) Physical access - someone having access to the machine in order to clone the data to another device or crack it at the location</p>
<p>2) Remote access - someone able to crack into a device via logging in from another location.  The password can be cracked by acting as a man-in-the-middle (think wiretapping) or hash-cracking, exploits, 0-days (think lock picking)</p>
<p>3) Exploiting bad code - bad sanitization (<a href="https://xkcd.com/327/" target="_blank">https://xkcd.com/327/</a>)</p>
<p>The way to track these people is by taking advantage of how they use the exploits and either de-anonymizing them via some method (comparing ISP logs with VPNs / other servers) or traditional methods (looking for motives and narrowing people down).  If it is just one person this could be pretty hard to do, especially if there is no real motive except curiosity or mischief.  If it is something bigger, the more people are involved, then the greater the chance you find someone who made a mistake, and the greater chance you catch someone who will talk (for a deal). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So how do you know you were hacked. Well you can look for unexplained behavior, for example in an election certain voting machines could have vastly different results from the onces from a different vendor. Or you could look at the log files which track everything that happens to a machine and see if anything weird happen there, unfortunately often the log files can either be deleted or altered by a hacker*.</p>
<p>If you find something in a log file you can try to see if it has an IP address in it and if it does you can see if that is where the hacker is. If the hacker used a proxy though odds are you are going to have to hope that that proxy kept logs (many don't because it really damages the user's privacy) and if they did you can see if they used another proxy or if that connects with their computer.</p>
<p>If you can't follow that trail of breadcrumbs you can also look at the exploit used. Different individuals and organizations developed different methods of getting into systems. Certain exploits are not publicly known but if you know that the Russians and the NSA know about them than you can reasonably expect one of them to be behind it. This is however not foolproof as some third party can have discovered the same vulnerability. You can also look for other hints such as the time the hack occurred (during working hours in what country?) what did they change (supported a pro Russian candidate?) etc. </p>
<p>You can also keep an eye out on individuals with high levels of computer skill in various countries and try to spy on them. If you spot them talking with the Russian government about hacking the US election then you know what that means.</p>
<p>Lastly if something was stolen(money, information) you can see who now has that something and link them to the hack that way. </p>
<p>*If someone did delete his traces you can do forensics on the hard disks and hopefully recover parts of the logs but even that can be combated by using a secure erase program (which leaves it's own traces which can be erased ....).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many possible avenues, all of them hard :-)</p>
<ul>
<li>If you detect somebody malicious active in your network, you can try to track the source of the connections. If the attackers have poor operational security (&quot;opsec&quot;), you might be able to gleam something about their identity</li>
<li>If the attackers are active over a long period of time, you can try to correlate their active hours with working hours in a time zone</li>
<li>If the attackers use tools (and all sophisticated attackers do), you can analyze the tools, and correlate it with known uses of similar tools. Also, analyzing the tools gives you an idea how sophisticated the attackers are</li>
<li>If the tools use undisclosed security holes (&quot;zero-day exploits&quot;), you might be able to find (much later) later who found these holes, and who bought them.</li>
<li>If the attackers steal information, you might be able to track where this information surfaces</li>
<li>Sometimes, intelligence services have been able to hack security cameras of attackers, and have observed people doing the attacks life. Basically the only bullet-proof attribution. Same with moles in the attacking organizations.</li>
<li>Sometimes, you can make guesses based on who benefited from an attack</li>
<li>If the attackers left a message, you might get insights from linguistic analyses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these attribution techniques only give hints, and wouldn't for example hold up as evidence in courts. But at least for private attackers, some of that might be enough to get you a search warrant, and hope to find some incriminating evidence during a physical search.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons that every hacker seems to come from Russia is that Russian servers don't generally release user information, so the trail kind of dies there.  So the smart thing to do is proxy through a Russian server before proxying elsewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ITT people guessing and being full of shit. IMO /u/perlgeek has the most correct answer.</p>
<p>Two biggest giveaways is a tool may be used for many hacks. Once you figure out what the tool is/what it does, what hacks were executed by it and who may have owned the tool you'd have a pretty good idea who did what.</p>
<p>Another is information. If data/emails were stolen and some country sells/gives you a copy it isn't unreasonable to say that country or group was involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
