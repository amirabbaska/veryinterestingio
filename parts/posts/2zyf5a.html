What about the pasta I had for lunch, or the omelette I had for breakfast? Did they all came out without my body absorbing their nutrients?</p>
<p>Edit: Front page? Whoa. I guess diarrhea is more than meets the (butt) eye.</p>
<p>There seems to be two school of thoughts here: (1) the diarrhea is caused by the burrito, and (2) it is caused by something I ate the day before.</p></div></div>
