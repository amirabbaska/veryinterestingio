		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The testicles are formed in the abdomen where the ovaries are in a woman. They usually descend to where they normally are by the time an infant is 9 months old.</p>
<p>The testicles still have nerves that are linked to the abdomen where they were originally formed. Therefore, contact with them causes the feelings in your stomach.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another reason is that there are a large number of nociceptors, or pain receptors, in and around the testicles and when all of these send the message to the brain at once, a large of amount of pain is perceived. When large amounts of pain are perceived, the body thinks something is wrong and does everything it can to get rid of what's wrong. Nausea and vomit arise from the body thinking maybe you ingested something bad and that's what's causing the pain so it will empty your stomach just in case. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The abdominal pain, paired with possible nausea and dizziness, can sometimes cause vomiting. Increased heart rate, sweating, and higher body temperature are other common responses to this kind of injury. That's the &quot;what&quot;.</p>
<p>The &quot;why&quot; is because your body is going insane in an attempt to tell you to never get hurt like that again. From an evolutionary perspective our bodies are designed to react very intensely to any kind of trauma in that particular anatomy. Our goal is to reproduce, and getting your seed sack whacked isn't helpful. Over a million plus years, those mutations for a painful nut punch ensure that particular lineage would continue up until you get your dingleberries dung and put out of commission. But likely, because you know how much that hurts, you protected them, and still have to use a condom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The testes are one of the few internal organs that can also be external organs. Like your kidneys, they have an extensive array of nerve endings and pain receptors in order to discourage activities which could damage your ability to reproduce or to stay alive. </p>
<p>An analogy would be like the pain you would feel if your kidney or liver was poking out of your abdomen and it got smacked hard. Instant nausea and a desire to curl up into a fetal position. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
