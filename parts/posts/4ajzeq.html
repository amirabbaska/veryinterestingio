		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well you have to ask yourself how wood burns? Even very dry wood, is still considerably wet and full of water by weight. Water doesn't burn, it creates steam. There is also hydrocarbons that when heated make up something we call wood gas, which is usually the first thing that burns when you light wood on fire, along with the sap. Wood burns incompletely and inefficiently so it burns much slower. After all of the volatiles are used up, the real kcal value of wood comes from the carbon, which when combined with heat and oxygen gets you carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and even more heat. </p>
<p>When you make charcoal you are not just burning wood, you are heating it in the absence of oxygen so that it can't really burn. It drives out all of the moisture, sap, tar, and volatiles which contribute only a small amount of energy when burned, and what you are left with is mostly elemental carbon. Carbon is not ash though, it's fuel. </p>
<p>The higher carbon content of charcoal allows it to burn really hot, and it takes a flame really well. It has a higher kcal value by weight than wood does so it packs a lot of energy per kilo of fuel. It also burns very cleanly since the only real by products are ash, heat, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and whatever trace elements were left behind. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wood burns in two stages: the hydrogen stage and the carbon stage. In the hydrogen stage, hydrocarbon molecules are broken and oxidise. In the carbon stage, the carbon oxidises.</p>
<p>The carbon stage burning is a hotter and cleaner chemical reaction than hydrogen stage burning.</p>
<p>Charcoal is made by burning wood in the hydrogen stage (hence removing the hydrocarbons) but not allowing the carbon stage (by limiting the amount of oxygen).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best part of the fire to cook with is the bit at the end. The coals and embers make for a much better cooking heat than the beginning of the fire. People used to start a wood fire, then wait for hours and hours for it to die down and start cooking on it then. Then they realized that they could pre-burn the wood in large amounts, and have JUST that last part of the fire! That's what charcoal is, it is wood that is preburned so you ONLY have the good part of the fire. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's carbon, it can be burnt without emitting toxic fumes and glows red hot, emitting heat by radiation. You can't really cook over a flame, the flame is erratic.</p>
<p>Wood fires emit a mixture of flammable gases and condensible tars. A major component of the gas is toxic carbon monoxide. A lot of the flammable gases and tars don't get burnt because the air moves upwards by convection, carrying the unburnt  gases &amp; vapours away from the red hot fire bed at the base of the fire..  You really don't want tar vapours condensing on your food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
