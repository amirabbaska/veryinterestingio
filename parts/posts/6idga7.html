		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually when you talk about &quot;feeling&quot; hotter or colder, you aren't talking so much about Temperature as heat transfer rates and heat transfer amount.  The amount of heat you can transfer is limited by the volume of water in question, and the temperature of the water vs your body temperature.  </p>
<p>Since you can flow a whole lot more water over your hand than you can have in your mouth, there is a lot more capacity to move heat.  Also, the rate at which heat transfers partially depends on convection, and the faster the water moves past your hand the more convection you can have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The temperature of water relative to your body temperature vs the temperature of water relative to what you perceive as cold drinking water. Another example would be getting into a pool of &quot;cold&quot; water. The water may only be 60 degrees, which is cold when you submerge yourself into it, but you would not think it is cold if you drank water the same temperature. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Turbulence. Turbulent water coming from the tap will feel colder because turbulence increases the transfer of sensible heat from your hand thus making the water seem colder. The same thing can be observed when you shake a can of pop: The can feels colder when its contents are in motion, but its temperature is the same as when it is still.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm thinking it more has to do with the amount of temperature receptors in your hands vs the amount in your mouth. Also, your hands are typically dry, and so dunking them in water feels colder because water transfers heat away from them far better than air of the same temperature does. Your mouth doesn't get this effect because it's constantly wet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
