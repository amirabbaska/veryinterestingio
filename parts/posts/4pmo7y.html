		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hardness is a material property that's based on the crystalline structure of the specific material. Each of those elements that you listed has a different crystal structure, as well as packing factor (the density that the atoms can pack into space). The crystal structure is how the atoms of each element arrange to form the material (in this case, all metals). Aluminum is face-centered cubic (FCC), lead is FCC as well, tungsten is body-centered cubic (BCC), and titanium is hexagonal close-packed (HCP). A good visual and more information on crystal structure can be found here: <a href="https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Materials/Structure/metallic_structures.htm" target="_blank">https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Materials/Structure/metallic_structures.htm</a></p>
<p>Each of these crystalline structures is the ideal and preferred spacial arrangement of the atoms for each element based on their coordination number (number of other atoms each atom is &quot;touching&quot;) and the size of their atom. </p>
<p>These properties contribute to the overall hardness of a material, which is the material's resistance to deformation. FCC metals are typically the weakest because they are packed so closely together that they have a large number of slip systems, which are directions that slip dislocations (deformation) can occur. BCC has fewer slip systems, leading to harder materials. Lots of post-processing can be done on the materials as well to affect the hardness, such as cold-working and annealing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, an important concept here is the lattice structure. You can imagine this as just how the atoms are stacked, so, for example you could have a cubic lattice where every atom is located at the vertex of a cube. You could also have some sort of hexagonal structure (imagine stacking oranges). All sorts of structures are possible.</p>
<p>Now, the density is going to depend on how &quot;tight&quot; the packing is in the lattice structure and the atomic weight of the individual atoms.</p>
<p>Hardness / softness (I'm thinking malleability) is going to be a function of how strong the atomic bonds are, that is, how much energy do you need to dislocate an atom from the structure? If it's low, then your metal is soft, higher energies would be harder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets throw some useful terms at this first.  &quot;Density&quot; or &quot;how heavy a material is&quot; is the first thing to add to this discussion.  Materials tend to retain about the same density regardless of their form.  </p>
<p>titanium is not very light.  Titanium is about 2/3 the weight of steel.  And Aluminum is about 1/3 the weight of steel.  For a given volume.  Since we're on the fractions thing, Lead is about 1.5 times the weight of steel.  </p>
<p>There are are some standards for derivating how hard a material is.  Brinnel hardness testing is one of them, but is annoyingly destructive.  </p>
<p>That also doesn't quantify the other aspects of the material, such as fatigue life, ductility, plasticity, abrasion resistance, etc...  </p>
<p>For instance, lead is a good bearing, because it's soft.  Stuff embeds itself into it, and if the parts touch sometimes, it's also ductile, so moves out of the way.  </p>
<p>Titanium is strong, but not very wear resistant.  Instead of springing back when rubbed the wrong way, it tears off little bits.  Those fantastic sparks you see behind lowriders, come from blocks of titanium they bolt under the cars.  </p>
<p>Aluminum is &quot;soft-er&quot; but comes in many grades, or &quot;tempers&quot;.  And many alloys vary from nearly as soft as your finger nail, to as strong as mild steel!  (2024 aluminum is some really strong stuff...)  </p>
<p>Tugsten is very hard, and very dense.  I don't know enoguh to bring up a bunch of useful tugsten quips off the top of my head.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two buildings can be made of the same amount of the same material, but if one of them has support beams in the wrong places, it's more likely to be destroyed by an earthquake. Even if you add some kind of reinforcement (increasing density) in the wrong places, it won't make it that much sturdier.</p>
<p>Or to use a different construction example that my friend almost learned the hard way. He built a large desk about 7 feet long with four legs, and it bent like a playing card when he put his monitors on it. So he added one more leg in the middle and now it's fine at 5 legs per desk. If he added one more leg to each side <a href="http://i.imgur.com/xwdeSiR.png" target="_blank">(so 3 legs per side)</a>, he would have had more legs per square foot of desk, but it would still bend in the middle.</p>
<p>So think of lattice structure as how the legs of a desk might be arranged.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
