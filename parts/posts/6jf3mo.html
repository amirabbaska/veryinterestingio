		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Would you pay the same price for a car somebody just bought put 100 miles on it and then turned back in?</p>
<p>What what you're speaking about refers to a time decades ago when the profit margin on cars was up to an average of 17%.</p>
<p>Today most cars are sold at a loss brand new. Most dealerships do not make money on the cae,  they make money financing and fixing them. The average profit on a new car was actually negative from 2004 until 2012. Under Bush,  consumers were being squeezed and car sales slunk..plus there was a lot of shifts within the industry and competitive practices were ramping up. Then Along Comes Google and it's game over for profits in the new car business</p>
<p>In 2012 the average profit on a new car finally turned positive and it was a whopping 120 bucks.</p>
<p>From time to time you'll see people complaining about dealerships and saying if we got rid of them average car prices would drop by $2,000 this is based on that time. Decades ago. The internet has changed everything, leveling the playing field to the Buyers Advantage except when it comes to your trade-in but even then just be smart. Hate to say this but if you want a good deal on a car you got to go to a big city and you got to find the guy that sells the most cars he's the one who gets the best deals from the manufacturer and is willing to lose the most upfront. At the dealership I worked at for about 6 months, they had brand new focuses with an effective price cheaper than used ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine if somebody just bought a new computer and within a few days tried to pawn it off on you. Would you take this as a generous offer, or would you assume there's something wrong with it? </p>
<p>Cars might be made in factories, but there are a number of moving parts that can go wrong, or worse, it could be a lemon. Within those first moments of going off the lot, you can only have things go wrong. If you want to resell it, why? You obviously aren't going to get the same price you bought it for, so you aren't trying to flip it for profit. Statistically speaking, there is something wrong with that car. </p>
<p>Now lets say you waited a year. The new models of cars have come out and there could be dozens of reason one wants to sell last years car. Even if it was a lemon, the resale value is much higher than it was right off the lot if only because it's more reasonable for somebody to get rid of such a &quot;fine&quot; products. Unless the model in question had several recalls and/or a particularly bad reputation, you can expect a higher resale value than you would get had you sold it right out of the lot.</p>
<p>One last thing of note is, practically everything about selling cars is a headache of many people in the know selling to a customer they hope is ignorant. Sales people will try to mark up everything where they can, well past the actual value of the car, and sometimes up-sell things that are assumed standard in a resell market as &quot;features&quot; to wriggle even more money from customers. It is fairly rare that cars are actually sold at their proper value as even people who are good at negotiating a fair price get fatigued by tenacious sales practices. One of the reasons cars depreciate so quickly, is because they were never actually as valuable as the price they were bought for. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of comments on here just ragging on dealers. OP did not ask a question about a dealer at all.
The answer to this question is simple. </p>
<p>It was new, it is now used. Simple as that.
Would you pay more or less for a used car that has two owners as compared to one? No. Your previously brand new car has its warranty started, it has guarantee of the condition, nor is there a guarantee of the upkeep of a vehicle, and the carFax no has it listed as a one owner used car. A brand new car has no title issued to it, never sat under that tree dripping sap onto it. Never had a 16 year old kid bang it into the parking barrier at the mall. </p>
<p>You pay a premium to know this car is brand new and that no one has been stuffing their farts into the driver's seat for the time that they owned it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The depreciation is very simple.  Dealers sell cars with a margin to make a profit.  Let's say a dealer buys a new car from The factory for $20k.  They then sell it for $23k, netting a $3k profit.  Now, if the owner comes back the next week to sell it back to the dealer, the dealer might only offer them $19k for it.  Why?  Well it's intrinsic value was only $20k new and it now has to be sold as a used car, so they discount it $1k.  The dealer is no going to pay retail for the car because they need to make a profit on it.  So the buyer decides to sell it privately, but consumers don't want to pay retail prices for a used car.  Even if you mark it down to $22k, a private buyer says &quot;well, for only $1k more I can have a brand new car and know that there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.  So you may get more than the intrinsic value of $19k, but it will never be what you paid for it new.  You might only sell it for $20k.</p>
<p>Of course, the markup is different on different vehicles.  High end, low production, exclusive cars like a Ferrari have a much higher markup when sold, so the depreciation is much higher.  The markup is higher because fewer cars of that model will be sold, so the margins have to be higher to actually make a profit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is much more simple than folks realize and no one I've seen has touched on it yet.<br />
Some of the largest volume purchasers of cars are rental companies (Enterprise/National, Hertz, Budget, U-Haul).  Enterprise alone maintains a fleet of over 1-million vehicles which cycles regularly.  </p>
<p>All of these companies have business models that involve buying new cars at an extreme discount renting them out for 1-2 years (sometimes more, sometimes less) than reselling.  The resale happens sometimes through their own lots, but more often through wholesale options auctions.<br />
Wholesale auctions like <a href="www.manheim.com" target="_blank">Manheim</a> are the primary source of inventory for both used car lots and used cars new car dealerships (no dealer likes to admit this).<br />
So basically at any given time there is a flood of 1-2 year old cars available for resale at all time over-supplying and lowering price.  </p>
<p>You'll notice cars that don't often get used by rental industries (Exotics, High-option package vehicles, cars with manual transmissions, etc...)  tend to hold resale values better than say a Chevy Impala or Chrysler Sebring.       </p>
<p>Source:  I was an executive at Enterprise for 11 years     </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
