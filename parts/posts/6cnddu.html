		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mirrors reflect light out at the same angle it came in at. To trap light indefinitely, you'd need light coming in at one mirror at a perfectly straight angle wit h the two mirrors facing eachother perfectly - and then be able to remove the device fast enough (keep in mind we're talking about light) for the light to not hit the light emitting device after it bounces off the first mirror)</p>
<p>Everything else would bounce around a few times and eventually away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A mirror doesn't reflect 100% of the light that hits it. Some of it is absorbed as well, and becomes heat. If you set up opposing mirrors and step between them, you'll see that your reflections eventually begin to shift into a greenish blue colour, because the mirror is absorbing (and thus not reflecting) the opposite end of the colour spectrum, colouring the image. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lasers have something like that.</p>
<p>The laser has two mirrors facing at each other. The medium between them is active so that it will radiate light in random direction when you pump energy to it .</p>
<p>Since the directions are random some of the emitted light is emitted so that it is trapped between the two mirrors.</p>
<p>Now that you havelight bouncing in between the mirrors the lasing effect can happen. The light bouncing in the medium will stimulate the medium so that it emitts light that is identical to the light already bouncing in. You get more and more light bouncing between the mirrors.</p>
<p>To get the laser beam out one of the mirrors allows some light through.</p>
<p>Also high reflectance isn't enough. The mirrors must be placed so that the light bouncing in between them forms a standing wave. Otherwise light will leak out. Without forming standing wave light will leak out even if the mirrors have perfect 100% reflectance and they are in vacuum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no such thing as a perfect mirror.  In your scenario, the light energy dissipates quickly through:
1) Less than perfect angles of reflection.
2) Absorption of light by the less than perfect glass.
3) The mirror heats up slightly robbing the system of energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The light is absorbed by the mirrors a little every bounce, turning into heat. How many reflections can occur depends on the quality of the mirror and the threshold for detecting each bounce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
