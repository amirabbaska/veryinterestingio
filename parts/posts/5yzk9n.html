Though, I live in Amsterdam and I see a lot of (mostly Asian) people who are traveling wearing them too. Went to China a few years back and just came home from the Philippines where I saw this a lot as well. Insight is much appreciated! </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that in Japan, it's frowned upon to take sick days, but it's also frowned upon to hamper workplace productivity by getting sick. So people don the face masks when <em>they</em> are ill, to prevent the germs that are coming out from sneezing and coughing from entering the air. They are also effective for hay fever in the spring.</p>
<p>A younger generation in Japan started wearing the masks as a fashion statement and means of achieving some privacy in public as well, though. This trend was called da-te masuku. Some girls wear the masks so they don't have to put makeup on or if they have a blemish they don't want others to see. Some do it as a protection of their introversion, as it adds a physical barrier between themselves and others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my experience in China, most Chinese people wearing mask in public places are sick, they wear a mask to protect from air pollution mostly if they are riding a bike or on very polluted days. The mask is supposed to reduce the possibility of spreading the disease to other people.
As a lot of Eastern Asian country have a very high density of population it makes sense to wear a mask when you are sick to protect others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a politeness thing.  In many Asian cultures, particularly Japan, it's considered polite to wear a mask when you are feeling sick so you reduce the risk of infecting anyone around you.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Japan is a funny one in that regard because it is pretty much entirely a politeness thing. So a sick coworker will show up wearing a mask...but, get a phone call? Mask off. Eating lunch? Mask off. Speaking to a high-ranking superior? Mask off.</p>
<p>There are so many little customs-within-customs that wearing a mask doesn't really do anything. </p>
<p>It's the thought that counts, I suppose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just FYI, disposable face masks don't do a terribly good job in preventing common illnesses.  The effectiveness of the masks decreases as water vapor from your breath accumulates on the mask and the seal on such a mask will often not be tight.  In addition, many diseases spread through multiple methods, such as via touch.  I'm not saying the masks are useless, it's just that sick people wearing them and then going to work and into crowded areas is really unwise.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
