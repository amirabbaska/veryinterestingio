		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the olden days, credit cards were often not scanned with the mag strip, because the equipment was still too expensive for smaller retailers.</p>
<p>What they did instead was use a carbon paper and a roller machine to take an imprint of the front of the credit card with the numbers. This was commonly part of the receipt, and one copy would be torn off and given to the customer.</p>
<p>The problem with this, of course, is that now all these receipts you are just throwing away left and right have your whole card number on them. </p>
<p>This is where the extra numbers on the back to confirm an online(or at the time, over the phone) purchase can be used,  if you only had a receipt you found with the front of someone's card, you would not have all the numbers needed to complete a transaction. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They're in a different spot than the main credit card number, so if you get a picture of the credit card you still can't use it because you don't have the security code.</p>
</li>
<li>On systems that save your credit card number, they are not supposed to save your security code, which means you need to type it in in order to place an order. That means that if someone else gets access to my computer or login, they can't order stuff for themselves because they don't have my security code. The same goes if the seller's system gets compromised, enabling hackers to access our credit card numbers - but they can't use them without the security code.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to /u/Dacke comment... Android Pay is actually way more secure because when it transmits a credit card, it actually transmits a one-time credit card generated just for this transaction, so stealing it is pointless.</p>
<p>As with any security system any time you have <em>static</em> or non-changing information it is considered easy to individually compromise. </p>
<p>The new chip in new credit cards in america means that you never actually transmit the credit card number to the payment system. Instead you transmit an identifier and a rolling code. The code is verified by the server to verify legitimacy. Since reading the code is pointless since it changes by algorithm every few seconds you have a much more foolproof system. So <em>at least</em> the card readers in every store are no longer attack-vectors for credit card theft. Previously you hack a credit card reader provider and you get <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>edit: I'm sorry I think I mixed up android pay and the older Google wallet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just three extra digits, it's a separate code that is used very differently.  The credit card number identifies the card, can be read by card readers from the magnetic strip, and is stored by merchants' systems that store your card information.  Or, if they use the old machines that make an imprint of the card, that number is on the imprint (which means the full credit card number is on the receipt).</p>
<p>The CVV code (the three extra digits) is just written - on the back of the card, with no raised plastic, so it won't appear in imprints and won't be as easy for people to see or photograph.  It is <em>not</em> stored when your card number is stored, and PCI (the standard in the US that companies that take credit card numbers are required to abide by) places more restrictions on where you can keep that number.  It can only be temporarily kept for use during a single transaction, and that's it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a set of regulations that dictate the payment card industry called PCI.  if you want to do anything with payment cards you have to be PCI compliant.  One of the major things in PCI compliance is you cannot store the CVV (those digits).  You also cannot store the mag stripe data.</p>
<p>This makes it hard to copy a card from legitimate hardware.  It also allows companies to tell how you used your card.  Merchants are charged different rates for &quot;card present&quot; (you physically swiped your card) and &quot;card not present&quot; (you typed in your card number, like an online purchase).  There are other categories and large companies can negotiate rates.</p>
<p>The numbers are also present on the back of the card, which makes copying the numbers more difficult.  If I wanted to steal your credit card number with the CVV I'd have to see both sides of your card.  This means is most likely need physical possession of the card, I cannot sneak a picture.</p>
<p>When you combine these features it makes it more difficult to steal someone's card number.  It doesn't make it impossible but does out up enough barriers to stop a good amount of low-level thieves.  Furthermore the way the numbers are used with mandatory industry standards they serve a purchase for the men behind the curtains that run the show.</p>
<p>Lastly I've called the digits CVV but different companies and networks may have a different name for them.  They serve the same purpose though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
