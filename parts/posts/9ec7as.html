		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many insecticides contain pyrethrins which bind to the sodium channels responsible for nerve transmission. Application of insecticides containing pyrethrins results in initial hyperactivity of the nervous system (inducing the writhing you describe), then blockage of all nerve impulses resulting in death. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I sprayed a cockroach once and instead of running off or writhing around, it just turned around and stared at me. I sprayed it again and it didn’t move. Just kept staring at me. I had to smash the creepy fucker.</p>
<p>When I say it stared at me, I can’t possibly be sure but it turned and faced me, precisely in my direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The possibly super wrong explanation I got from a quick sidenote in a human anatomy class was this:</p>
<p>Basically insecticides contain a chemical that inhibits the enzyme that allows muscles to relax(acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) causing them to have uncontrollable seizures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so you know how drugs are bad? Well, bug spray is like really bad drugs for bugs. It causes their brains to go haywire, making them go into painful seizures and die. Sorry, kiddo, but them's the facts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
