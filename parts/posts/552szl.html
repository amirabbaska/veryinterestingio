		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For clarification, the name of the variable component is timbre, the first syllable of which rhymes with ham, not Jim. Tone can mean multiple things. The clearest breakdown of the sound produced by a singer would be pitch (frequency), volume, and timbre. </p>
<p>You have asked about tone, but it seems you mean pitch. The difference between a sound resonating in our head and in a room is not in the frequency, but rather in the timbre. Timbre is the quality of the sound that allows you to tell the difference between a trumpet and a flute. They could play the same frequency and volume, but you could still tell them apart. When a trumpet hears itself on your voicemail, it thinks it sounds like a flute.</p>
<p>Stage monitors, as have been mentioned in other posts, are not to correct this phenomenon, but rather to provide a way to hear yourself at all over loud concert crowds and bands. They are also used to combat phasing in large Opera houses where, even though singers are not amplified to the audience, the orchestra in the pit is played through monitors so that the singers are singing in time, rather than with the echo off the back wall of the opera house.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference between the voice we hear and the voice others hear isn't a difference in pitch as much as it is a difference in quality, some of what we hear travels through our jawbone etc and what others hear comes directly only from our mouths. The difference is nasal qualities and the way your mouth changes the sound. </p>
<p>Unless you are truly tonedeaf or playing music live on stage, you should be able to hear pitch by the sound that travels through your jaw to reach your ears. You can test this by plugging your ears and humming. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pitch (aka singing the correct tone) is not significantly altered by the way we hear our own voice, so it should be no problem to hit the correct tones, at least if you're capable of doing so in general.
Besides that, during live concerts with speakers, there are also speakers directed towards the singers to make them actually hear what the audience hears. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pitch isn't really affected by the difference we hear, only the tone and &quot;quality&quot; of the sound. More or less nasal, and more or less &quot;bass&quot; in the voice are usually the biggest differences. </p>
<p>It's more like a different equalizer preset than an auto-tune, if you recognize those effects. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our voices may sound different to us, due to the sound traveling from the vocal cord to your ear drums via mostly vibration through your head. </p>
<p>But the key/tone remains exactly the same. </p>
<p>Some acoustic guitars have built in tuners that read off the vibration from within the guitar. It's the same thing basically. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
