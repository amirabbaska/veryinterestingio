		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With two of four rotors spinning opposite directions, it eliminates the need for variable pitch blades and a rotor positioned vertically in order to counter the effects of rotation. That’s where a tail rotor on a helicopter comes in, as it keeps the body of the helicopter from rotating in the *opposite direction as the main rotor by “pushing” against that force.
Quad rotors have equal rotors spinning opposite directions, cancelling out rotation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've met people that do remote controlled helicopters.  They are much more complex, expensive and hard to control.</p>
<p>This raises the question of why it is that regular, people-carrying helicopters use such a huge rotor, if the quad is so much easier to control.  The answer is efficiency.  A long skinny blade has higher aerodynamic efficiency.  It also covers a far large area, moving more air.  When you have to carry a large amount of weight, the efficiency outweighs the complexity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The single rotor of a helicopter is a very complex piece of machinery.  It needs to be able to change the pitch (angle) of the blades as they rotate.  They're also fairly difficult to miniaturize.</p>
<p>Small quadcopters, OTOH, use fixed pitch blades &amp; because the electric motors they use can very quickly change speed.  When coupled with the microcontrollers &amp; sensors on the drone, this is more than enough to keep a small, lightweight craft in the air and under control.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't have to worry about collective and cyclic pitch. Just spin multiple motors (the net torque cancels out when simply hovering) harder or slower. Vary motor speeds to steer. Much less complex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>small electric motors are extremely compact and efficient, with minimal mechanical complexity. with 4 rotors, and sufficiently intelligent control software, a drone can maneuver in any way a conventional rotorcraft can through varying the output of its 4 rotors.</p>
<p>real helicopters are gas powered. the combustion engine and its support systems are powerful, but work better as large single units. having multiple engines would become wildly complex very quickly. electric doesn't scale well in vehicles because of batteries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
