		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carbonation is bubbles. Bubbles pop. That's why carbonated drinks feel tingly in your mouth. Have you ever blown bubbles outside, and had one pop close to you? Sometimes you get sprayed with the soapy water as the bubble pops. The same thing happens in your mouth. When the bubbles pop, the drink can spray the inside of your mouth.</p>
<p>So what happens when you eat spicy food? Well, spicy food has a chemical in it called capsaicin. It touches your taste buds and makes them feel hot. When you drink a carbonated drink and you have capsaicin in your mouth, the bubbles pop, and they spread that capsaicin around to more taste buds. Instead of cooling your mouth down, it makes it spicier! </p>
<p>Maybe that's what you are feeling. Not everyone feels the same thing. Some people don't mind the spicy flavor spreading. I like to drink beer with spicy food. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't carbonated drinks that are the issue as it is more that sugared carbonated drinks taste worse when combined with spicy foods. Beers which are often dry will pair well with spicier foods as will champagne.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be technical neither pepper spicyness nor carbonation are tastes.</p>
<p>As others have mentioned the the capsaicin in peppers are what causes the spicyness. This is actually the capsaicin agrivating and activating the pain/nerve receptors on your tounge. </p>
<p>The carbonation in sodas are not a taste either as others again have mentioned this sensation is caused by the popping of the bubbles on your tounge.</p>
<p>Most liquids tend to spread the capsaicin around your mouth and throat. (Milk being one of the exceptions.) A carbonated beverage would do the same while the bubbles pop in your mouth and throat.</p>
<p>Some people might find these sensations to be less pleasurable together. I personally am not bothered by drinking a carbonated beverage with spicy food. </p>
<p>Basically to some extent it is just your personal preference. </p>
<p>Although I would be interested to know whether and how much these sensations actually effect the fruity taste of the peppers and the sugary taste of the soda.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
