<p>Tl;dr: The immune system is different in different parts of the body, and &quot;suped up&quot; (highly paraphrasing) in areas like near the anus. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lymphoid tissue is like the Police Department for immune cells, so your body puts it in places that are prone to infection, so that if any germs come around, you've already got a butt ton of cops right there. Your tonsils are lymphoid tissue. Your intestines have a bunch of lymphoid tissue.</p>
<p>The area around your anus has a bunch of extra lymphoid tissue for exactly that reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're absolutely right that the bacteria that come from our gut have the potential to cause serious disease if they were to spread throughout our body. The colon and rectum together contain billions of bacterial cells (oft-quoted fact: there are more bacterial cells in your gut than there are human cells in your whole body). However, because of this, our gastrointestinal tract has evolved to have an immune system that can effectively and quickly deal with bacteria that make it across the cellular lining (called the epithelium). </p>
<p>Just underneath the epithelium, there's a huge amount of white-blood cell tissue. This includes cells that eat bacteria, cells that make antibodies to bind to bacteria, and cells that can recruit lots of other white blood cells to participate in the battle. There are also many proteins floating around that can kill any bacteria they come in contact with. This means that if there's a tiny tear in the epithelium, some bacteria may be able to enter, but they are quickly destroyed before they can cause very much trouble.</p>
<p>Similar tissue exists underneath your skin, which is why the vast majority of cuts and scrapes don't lead to a noticeable infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
