		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biologist here.  Some of the other answers hit around the reason, but none that I see yet tell the whole story.</p>
<p>First, you have to understand how traits arise.  Mutations happen in the DNA of animals.  If the mutation helps, it spreads.  If it hurts, it doesn't.  But the mutation has to actually <em>happen</em> in the first place.  A mutation to make slight changes is more likely than one that creates a whole new thing out of nothing.</p>
<p>So, early vertebrates breath using gills, getting oxygen from the water.  They also have nostrils, and these are used for smelling chemicals in the water.  In some fish, these nostrils connect to the roof of the mouth, so the fish can smell what it's eating.</p>
<p>Eventually, some fish move into shallow, stagnant waters. There's not a lot of oxygen there, so they start gulping air at the surface.  Goldfish do this today, even. It works a little bit even if all you have is gills.  Some fish progress to swallowing air down into the gut, which is highly vascularized and can take in oxygen even better.  Some then develop pouches off the gut...which wind up being lungs.  So eventually these fish are gulping down air to their lungs, but some also take air in through those nostrils, which remember connect to the roof of the mouth/throat.  That way they don't have to stick their whole head out of the water to take in air, just the tip of the snout.</p>
<p>Now some fish eventually wind up transitioning into tetrapods, aka land animals.  These just carry along the system that existed before, breathing through mouth and nostrils, but modifying it to be ever more efficient.  So why don't they sprout a bunch more holes all over their body to take air directly to the lungs?  They never have the chance, because a) mutations that cause holes all over the body leading to the lungs just aren't likely  b) they'd probably kill an animal outright if they <em>did</em> happen and c) even if they weren't deadly, it's unlikely they'd work better than the fine-tuned preexisting nose-and-mouth system. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question.  Openings to the body create other issues, one being the maintenance of a sterile environment inside the body.  All of them can be pathways for infection to enter the body.  The respiratory &quot;tree&quot; is lined with cilia that move mucus up to the throat, then it is swallowed into the stomach, where stomach acid kill any bacteria.</p>
<p>Also, having a single airway allows us to use the air for speech generation (larynx), which has been vital in the development of human culture, but also important for almost all chordates.  Having some dead space in the respiratory tree also allows for the air to be warmed as we inhale and for decreasing respiratory water losses due to evaporation.  Consider also that we use the same upper airway system (well, the oropharynx anyway) for eating and drinking, which minimizes the number of openings to the outside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, bear in mind that evolution almost <em>never</em> finds the optimal solution to a problem. It's a process of luck and survival, so a lot of &quot;good enough but not great&quot; features are present.</p>
<p>Second, consider the body shapes of ancestor species. Sometimes a feature earned its location in some older species where that location provided a huge advantage -- and then no mutation occurred to provide an updated, different location later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An essay question on the Final Exam for a Comparative Anatomy class I once took has the root of your answer in it: &quot;Diagram the vascular structure of the gill arches of a shark and then show transitional structures to arrive at the Aortic Arch in you own chest.&quot;</p>
<p>We have our respiratory system associated with our heads because our earliest chordate ancestors had their gills there. Evolution is a matter of adaptation of existing structures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well we need more airflow than insects. An ant the size of a horse would need hurricane-force winds to breathe enough. That's why we can't breathe like insects.</p>
<p>As for why our airholes are on our heads, that's because fish have to pull in water to breathe. They just used the hole they already had, which was their mouth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
