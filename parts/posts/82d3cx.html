<p>I think it’s called the bell’s reflex</p>
<p>The nerves that control eye closure are intrinsically linked to the nerves that control upward eye movement and hence produce this reflex</p>
<p>Purpose is obvious. To help protect your eyes when they’re not needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PRE-EDIT: posting here in direct response to the OP because someone said I should. </p>
<p>Your bottom eyelid moves up slightly when you blink, but it's range of upward movement is far smaller than your top eyelids range of downward movement. What this means is that when you close your eyes, your lids meet somewhere below the horizontal centerline of your eyes. </p>
<p>To keep them fully and completely closed (with no gap between them) it takes just a little bit of conscious effort. When sleeping, meditating, or otherwise resting your eyes, you relax control of that little bit of conscious effort. This means that there may be the smallest bit of a gap between your upper and lower lids, because this is the naturally relaxed state of your eye lids. </p>
<p>When you are trying to sleep, it's of pretty paramount importance to block incoming visual signals, so your eyes compensate for this little gap at the bottom by rolling up behind the upper eye lid. </p>
<p>This is why sometimes when drifting in and out of sleep you can see blurry and distorted shapes of people and things moving in your room (provided there are people moving about around you, for instance if you're taking a nap on the couch in a house full of family or something). Your eyes move during sleep, but also your upper eyelid can sometimes tend open a little bit more than expected. </p>
<p>At least, that's what I think is happening, based on several experiences I've had. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
