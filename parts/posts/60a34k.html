<p>We can't, really. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As the pre-poster wrote in space you have a barrage of &quot;small particles&quot; that might wear anything away. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have radiation that also wears material away, it is little, but it is there. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We do not know what exactly is out there at the fringe of the solar system, there's theories/observations that there's an area (large!) with solar winds, we have no idea what the effects/long-term effects of this are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, at the end of the solar system, is the Oort cloud. It is icy particles and... stuff? We don't know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We really do not know about our solar system and much, much less in specific about what is beyond. </p>
</li>
<li>A billion years is a very long time. A <em>very</em> long time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, we do assume that because the record is from gold there are not many chemical reactions happening. As we assume that there is not that much radiation out there and gold is pretty robust (the gold atoms are pretty heavy) we assume it cannot really wear it down. As it is pretty cold out there we assume there is not much happening inside the material (&quot;heat&quot; is basically just movement of atoms and as it gets cold, they move less). As we assume that, while it is &quot;stuff&quot; out there it is not &quot;dense&quot; in any way we use the term here on earth, there is not much physical interaction (note that even gas clouds and asteroid fields still constist of &quot;basically nothing&quot; if we use our earth-bound terms for &quot;a lot&quot; and &quot;basically nothing&quot;). Couple 1.-5. with 6. and... we can assume it will survive a very long time - but we really don't know. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well currently both Voyagers are in interstellar space, and in the start of the 2020s, Voyager 1 is going to lose signal, and power. The golden record is an interesting topic, and I read a cool <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/11/11/9702090/voyager-golden-record-pictures" target="_blank">article</a> about it recently. As far as it last a billion years, we would never really know. There is of course not that much to hit it, except of course some dust. In fact, the record actually contains a piece uranium that can be used to date it. For all we know, some other life form could find it before a billion years has actually passed. Could probably always get hit some rock anyways, although that chance is extremely small.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm amazing at spelling, and grammar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The elephant in the room is that the record may physically exist for hundreds/millions/billions of year, but it may not be able to be played down the road. As mentioned up thread, gold is a robust element on Earth and has a better chance of surviving long-term compared to iron. But will it still play if aliens figure out the instructions. We won't know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So it looks like that record will survive for a LONG time.  Much longer than modern man likely will. </p>
<p>Also the records are gold plated copper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Of course we won't last forever (let alone our recorded voices and data) and don't seem to be particularly important at all. But we can dream.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
