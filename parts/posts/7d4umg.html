		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially what it warns against is that in fighting something bad, you should be careful not to take actions that make you as bad as the thing you are fighting. It can be really easy to justify extreme measures to yourself if you are fighting something you believe is evil, but sometimes you need to step back and look at what you are doing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This quote tends to foster the idea that in becoming a 'monster hunter' one is exposed to darkness, and that exposure can allow darkness to spread in a 'hero' as a kind of infection.</p>
<p>One other view is that the very act of 'creating a monster' in the mind allows one justify taking monstrous acts against all perceived monsters (making the Monster Hunter simply a Monster).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe that in &quot;He who fights with monsters&quot; they are referring to other people as the &quot;monsters&quot;.</p>
<p>History has shown that while fighting these people/monsters you are likely to dehumanize them. You no longer see them as people, but as monsters. </p>
<p>Now that you no longer see them as people, you will do things you wouldn't have done before. Humane treatment is no longer a thing with these people, after all, they are not people, they are monsters. </p>
<p>So the more you see them as monsters and not people, the more you turn into a monster yourself. </p>
<p>&quot;And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee&quot;</p>
<p>This is along the same line. You spent too much time treating them as a monster, you became a monster. You spent too much time gazing into the abyss, the abyss gaze back at you. </p>
<p>You turned over, you went to the dark side. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
