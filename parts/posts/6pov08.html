		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same way you are able to tell what's in the box your grandmother sent you at Christmas.  When you shake it, a sweater sounds different from a PS4 controller.  Obviously scientists can't shake the earth, but the earth shakes itself sometimes, and scientists in different places are always listening (or rather their seismographs are listening).  By comparing what different locations record, they can make good guesses about what's inside, just like you may be able to do.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earthquakes produce and travel via both <strong>P</strong>ressure waves (bits of earth pushing on each other) ans <strong>S</strong>hear waves (bits of earth sliding past each other and dragging other bits).</p>
<p>If you imagine a solid, you can push on one bit and have another bit move, or you can drag one bit and have another bit move. Solids allow both P- and S- waves to propagate.</p>
<p>If you imagine a liquid, if you push on it another bit will move, but if you slide your finger over the surface, other bits won't move. Liquids propagate P-waves, but not S-waves.</p>
<p>Earthquakes are messy and produce both P and S waves. So when an Earthquake occurs on one side of the planet, you listen on the other side and you will detect P-waves quickly, and S waves much later (if at all). The reason for the difference is that pressure waves can travel through the middle of the earth, but shear waves can't - they either go the long way around the outside through the solid crust, or simply dissipate before making it, which suggests that the middle of the earth must be a liquid as something is blocking S-waves.</p>
<p>However, if you're not on the exact other side of the planet and maybe only a quarter of the way around, and you listen very carefully, you will actually detect <em>two</em> sets of Pressure waves, not one. What gives? Well, the second set of pressure waves is coming after the first set, so it must have traveled further and gone via a different path. The different path means the P-wave must have reflected of something, and we have deduced that this something must be a large solid within the liquid.</p>
<p>So the fact that in some places you get P- but not S- waves means there must be a liquid under the solid crust, and the fact that if you listen at the right spot you get a second P- wave means there must be another solid under the liquid</p>
<p>edit: (I didn't see you asked about the mantle) If you monitor the P-waves carefully, very near an Earthquake you will also get a second set, this time quite soon after the first. In fact, too soon for the second set to have reflected off the inner core. This is because the second set is both reflecting and refracting as it travels; the refraction means there must be a change in density and the reflection means it must be sudden (the mantle). There are a few refractions - one at the top of the mantle, another ~600km down - which means there are different density layers and that is why we divide into upper and lower mantle. It's thought that the difference in mantle is that at higher pressures, the rock crystals form into denser arrangements (hence lower mantle is denser). Beyond that, we don't know much about the lower mantle compared to the upper mantle (which is easy to measure refraction more accurately) and the core (easy to measure the sudden change in how P and S waves propagate)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding more detail to previous answers...</p>
<p>Shockwaves travel at a speed that is dependant on the material it is traveling through. The more dense a material is, the faster the shockwave travels.</p>
<p>Air: ~1131 feet/second</p>
<p>Water: ~4900 feet/second</p>
<p>Iron: ~16800 feet/second</p>
<p>If the earth were made of just one substance with the same density throughout, it would be easy to calculate the exact time a shockwave would arrive at any point around the globe. If it doesn't arrive at that exact time it means the earth is made of different materials and/or materials with different densities.</p>
<p>Scientists have measured the exact speed of shockwave propagation in pure elements, minerals, conglomerate materials (solid mixtures) and everything else they could test. Using some pretty complex math and the actual arrival times of shockwaves from various places on the planet, a very good idea can be formed of what our planet is made of and what it looks like inside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a scientist or anything but I work in seismic and we put listening devices in the ground and vibrate at a really low frequency with these trucks and it lets us see anything from fault lines to oil pits about 1000ft deep using the lowest setting. We can turn it up 3000% higher than what we do allowing us to see 20000 ft deep. When earthquakes happen and the devices are planted we can see about 50000 ft deep and this is with equipment a small company has so Im sure the government and larger companies have much stronger and better technology that could let them see far deeper allowing them to see much farther into the earth. Now I don't know how if this is something they actually use determine anything related to the post but to me it seems like it would be. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the correct answers already mentioned above, there are also very clear boundary effects at play in between the layers of different density. For example, a shock wave will not only change speed, but will change direction or even bounce off the interface between two layers depending on the angle of incidence and the densities involved (see Snell's law). These scientists can then extrapolate where these layers are delineated based on the places where the shock waves emerge on the surface of the Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
