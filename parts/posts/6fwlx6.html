<li>
<p>Your stomach has stretch receptors that tell your brain you are full. If you drink a lot of water, your stomach is streched out by a 0 calorie drink rather than a high calorie food. That's partly why eating a giant low calorie salad makes you feel as full as a small high calorie baked good. There are other things that contribute to fullness, but the stretch receptors are an important one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you drink cold water, your body has to burn calories to warm it up to body temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You drink water instead of other high calorie beverages. You will swap out water for soda, juice, etc. That keeps those empty calories off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your kidneys have to burn more calories to get rid of all the extra water you drank.</p>
</li>
<li>Water is an important part of many calorie burning chemical reactions in your body. If you don't have enough water, your body stops the less necessary reactions to conserve water.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water probably doesn't allow us to lose weight easily. </p>
<p>It keeps us from consuming unnecessary calories. Dehydration and sleep deprivation can both manifest as hunger. By drinking water, we provide the tools for the body to do all the biological things it's already doing (as stated elsewhere) more efficiently and potentially remove the urge to eat unnecessarily. </p>
<p>If you stay hydrated you don't get hungry as often. One of the many weight loss tips is to drink a glass of water if you're hungry. If you're still hungry in 20 minutes, it was hunger and you should eat. If you're not, it was dehydration and you would have consumed extra calories unnecessarily trying to get water. </p>
<p>Many people are chronically dehydrated. Excess consumption of water won't do anything extra besides making you pee more. The tip to drink water is to ensure you're getting adequate amounts, not excessive amounts, and remain hydrated. </p>
<p>TL;DR Thirst is mistaken for hunger. Drinking proper quantities of water helps to prevent unnecessary eating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drinking more water to hydrate means drinking less calorie-rich drinks like soda or juice.</p>
<p>Sometimes when we feel hungry, we may actually be dehydrated. Drinking water is a zero calorie option of making that feeling go away instead of eating more.</p>
<p>The water expands the stomach so we feel full sooner, reducing the amount that a person eats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

If you've recently lost a considerable amount of weight in a short period of time and attribute it to drinking large amounts of water ... make sure there isn't an underlying issue like ketoacidtosis or symptoms similar leading to a diabetes diagnosis type 1 or type 2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
