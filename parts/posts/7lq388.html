		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd argue that there are plenty of rational mathematical constants, but the only ones that we give names to are the irrational ones. Pi is the most famous irrational constant, and most people learn about it as the ratio of a circle's perimeter to <del>radius</del> diameter (whoops). We can also calculate the ratio of a square's perimeter to (inner) diameter, which is... 4. But nobody is going to start calling it /u/TheMadHaberdasher's constant because there's really no need to abbreviate 4.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's possible that you're asking why named constants like e, pi, and phi always seem to be irrational. In that case, the simplest answer is that we don't generally <em>need</em> a special name for rational numbers. It's usually simple enough to just write the number.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are plenty of rational mathematical constants but the only ones most people have usually heard of are the ones that are given special names.</p>
<p>It is because mathematical constants are only given special names, such as Ï€ because they possess a feature called transcendentality. This means that there is no way of expressing them using rational numbers and the operations of division, multiplication, addition, subtraction or exponents, which means, in order to use them, they must be given special symbols or names to identify them.</p>
<p>Since transcendentality implies irrationality, since by the definition you can't express transcendental numbers by the quotient of 2 other rational numbers making them also irrational, this means that most numbers the general public have heard of are irrational</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because almost every number is irrational. If you randomly choose a number, then there is a 100% chance that it will not be rational (doesn't mean that it can't happen, but you probably shouldn't bet on it). So unless there is a specific reason that would bias a number to being rational, then you can expect it to be irrational.</p>
<p>EDIT: This is a heuristic, which means that it broadly and inexactly explains a phenomena at an intuitive level. Generally, there is no all-encompassing reason for most constants to be irrational, each constant has its own reason to be irrational, but this gives us a good way to understand what is going on and to make predictions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The numbers you think of as &quot;constants&quot; are just as constant as all the integers.</p>
<p>We ascribe importance to pi because it's the solution to c/d for a circle, but shouldn't 3 have the same level of importance for being the fewest number of sides a polygon can have?</p>
<p>What about the smallest prime number being equal to 2?</p>
<p>You can come up with significance for any of the integers the same way we do for irrational numbers like e, pi, or root 2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
