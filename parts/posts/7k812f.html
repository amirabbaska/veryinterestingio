It doesn't tell us whether or not <em>some</em> of the cells may stay alive longer.  </p>
<p>Quote from the paper:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Animal models for human neurological and psychiatric diseases only partially mimic the underlying pathogenic processes. Therefore, we investigated the potential use of cultured postmortem brain tissue from adult neurological patients and controls. The present study shows that human brain tissue slices obtained by autopsy within 8 h after death can be maintained in vitro for extended periods (up to 78 days) and can be manipulated experimentally. We report for the first time that 1) neurons and glia in such cultures could be induced to express the reporter gene LacZ after transduction with adeno-associated viral vectors and 2) cytochrome oxidase activity could be enhanced by the addition of pyruvate to the medium. These slice cultures offer new opportunities to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurological and psychiatric diseases and new therapeutic strategies.</p>

Hard to say how long it would take for every cell to die - it depends on a large set of variables, including anatomical differences and environmental conditions.  On top of that, once the brain centres responsible for basic bodily functions are compromised, neuronal damage becomes an unpredictable vicious circle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a complicated question and an ongoing subject of intense research. There are a few definitions of cell death: when the cell membrane can no longer maintain an ionic gradient, when the calcium levels rise and an irreversible path to apoptosis occurs, etc.</p>
<p>In the setting of ischemic brain injury (stroke), the most useful clinical definition is the point at which the stroke is no longer reversible through the use of clot busting medication (TPA). This is around 3 hours in practice, with 4.5 hours in special circumstances. After that, some brain cells are still viable, but the risk of causing a brain bleed outweighs the benefit of reversing the stroke.</p>
<p>I'm personally involved in research that uses an advanced form of MRI imaging to measure exactly when brain cells stop being viable after a stroke. This involves imaging sodium (Na) instead of water like in typical MRIs. When cells die, they can no longer maintain ionic gradients, including the sodium-potassium-ATPase pump that keeps intracellular Na low. By measuring the ratio of intracellular to extracellular sodium, we can pinpoint within minutes exactly when brain tissue dies (in the clinical sense). Typical brain imaging (both MRI and CT) take about 24 hours to reliably delineate a stroke. </p>
<p>Using sodium imaging on a monkey model, we have detected viable brain tissue at up to 9 hours post stroke, twice as long as the current 4.5 hour window used today. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different types of brain cells.  Glial cells will survive longer than most neurons.  And there is great variation between species.  Lizard nerves and muscles will degrade much slower than mouse for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
