		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked for a circuit board manufacturer for a couple years and can think of a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As others have mentioned, <strong>electrolytic capacitors</strong> can wear out. They have an electrolytic acid in them that can break down and dry up. This would cause the capacitor to hold less of a charge, and the device to stop functioning. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Electro-static Discharge (ESD)</strong>. A buildup of static electricity discharged through a device can cause it to stop working. Most electronics have shielding (metal case) around them now to prevent most ESD, but touching the connector or a poorly designed electronic can still cause ESD. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mechanical failure</strong>. Some devices, specifically ones with hard drives, have mechanical parts. Most mechanical parts will wear down after a while. When this happens to a hard drive, the drive can no longer be read. This would cause the device or computer to stop functioning the way it was intended. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heat failure</strong>. Many devices have parts that get very hot. The constant heating and cooling of a device can make parts expand and contract. Sometimes, after a while, a trace or solder joint can crack from this, causing failure. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Counterfeit parts</strong>. Surprisingly, there are a large number of counterfeit electronic components in circulation. These counterfeit parts are often times relabeled genuine parts that have lower ratings. For example, if one part allows for 1 amp of current to flow through it and another allows 1.5 amps, but is more expensive, the counterfeiters might try to sell the 1 amp version as if it were the 1.5 amp version. A good quality control department can spot these, but sometimes they get through. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cold solder joints/Quality Control Failure</strong>. This would be a straight up quality control issue. If the components on a device are not properly soldered, they may work for a while, but fail when they are dropped or get hit. They may also fail due to heat failure. A good solder joint on every component is essential. A good quality control will spot a bad solder joint, but sometimes they get through. </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Bad circuit design</strong>. A poorly made product may function for a while, but fail due to many reasons. Maybe they didn't make a certain trace thick enough for the current it carries. Maybe they didn't design the product to be vibration-proof, even though it was intended to go in a vehicle. Maybe they ran the noisy motor power lines near the logic lines causing induction noise. A lot of poor circuit board designs could cause future issues, even if they work at the time of testing. </li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few of the reasons that an electronic device could fail after working for a while. I'm sure there are others out there as well. I've personally seen most of these failures happen, since I've had to fix most of them after they were returned to us. </p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As many users have pointed out, <strong>planned obsolescence</strong> can be a factor. The manufacturers plan for their devices to fail after the warranty period, so the user will have to buy another. This is less commonly actually planned, and more often a bad design, but it can happen. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As /u/Jer_061 pointed out, <strong>dirty power</strong> from your house mains can be an issue. Brown-outs (too low voltage) and surges (too much voltage) can happen causing damage to your electronics. These are usually caused by storms, but can happen because of failure of power delivery equipment on the electric company's end. You can prevent these with a good quality surge protector or uninterruptable power supply (UPS). </p>
</li>
<li>A few users pointed out <strong>tin whiskers</strong>. This is a phenomenon where the tin in lead-free solder will grow metal crystals. This can cause shorts on the circuit boards. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some electronics wear during use. For example, electrolytic capacitors have a limited life span - usually far beyond the expected use, but a capacitor which has been used longer than expected or is faulty can burst, which can cause damage to electronics since they are filled with a conductive liquid.</p>
<p>When the capacitors last, another potential weak point of electronics are the soldered connections between board and chips. Particularly CPUs require a ton of these contacts, some intel CPUs for example have more than 1000 of them on a tiny space. Since they get hot and have a rather high current flowing through them, they slowly degrade through an effect called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromigration" target="_blank">electromigration</a>&quot;, which thins them out more and more until they finally separate.</p>
<p>Just like with the caps, this effect should only lead to losses long after the expected use time, but can lead to an early death if there was a fault. For example, a few years ago a line of NVidia notebook GPUs had a tendency to die off far too soon due to this, which <del>lead</del> led to a costly recall of MacBooks and other Notebooks.</p>
<p>But with good enough parts, electronics can last ages. I just fixed my grandma's amplifier, which had been running for almost 40 years now - all I needed to do was to remove some dust from the volume knob.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The (by far) commonest reason for electronic to die is a faulty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor" target="_blank">Capacitor</a>.</p>
<p>These things have a specific lifetime, which strongly depends on temperature.<br />
Inside these little &quot;caps&quot;, chemical processes happen which are very similar to those in batteries. Actually, capacitors and batteries are very similar. But the capacitor is charging and discharging all the time, while in use, thus it will worn out faster.<br />
The &quot;charging&quot; process generates heat, just as in batteries.  </p>
<p>As warmer the cap get's, the more damage it takes from each unit of capacity running through.  </p>
<p>Eventually, if the chemical structure got bad, they will blow while under load. When this happens, the device won't work anymore.</p>
<p>Usually, these capacitors sit right aside to the power input or inside the power supply unit.</p>
<p>Capacitors are very cheap and relatively simple to replace. Everyone with decent soldering skills can replace them in many devices, like TVs.</p>
<p>Capacitors are the #1 topic in planned obsolescence. Allegedly producers intentionally use bad capacitors , even if they are more expensive than better ones, just so that the device will break soon after warranty is over.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What about corrosion from moisture? A friend moved from SoCal (dry) to Taiwan (humid) and they found many of their electronic things died much faster.</p>
<p>Same with my hearing aids. It seems that storing them at night in a dehumidifier of sorts prolongs the time between service.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electronics is generally regarded as a semiconductor thing. So transistors and microchips. (which are just transistors shrunk down really small). (ok, capacitors too, which are the flakiest part of most circuits)</p>
<p>There are lots of ways for individual transistors to fail, from overheating, solder flux creeping into the package, ambient conditions like steam or vibration, bad design of circuits leading to spikes of current or voltage above the component specification.and static electricity is infamous for destroying digital electronics because it degrades the semiconductor &quot;gates&quot;.</p>
<p>Thing is, components can fail without any noticeable impact on equipment. Amplifiers may become noiser, PSU's may get more ripple, or sometimes a switch or Led no longer works. Ram can occasionally glitch and give data errors or freezing computers.</p>
<p>Non digital equipment can be way out of spec and still be used daily. Old televisions with snowy pictures, that sort of thing. Unless something actually smokes, you may never realise a component has failed. </p>
<p>Computer equipment is generally less likely to degrade gracefully (unless it is designed to do so) so if a transistor or microchip develops a fault, it may stop the processor or motherboard from working properly as soon as that happens. </p>
<p>In digital systems components can be drifting toward failure, but while they remain in the spec of the system, you won't notice, which is why one day it works, the next day it doesn't, without any sign beforehand. </p>
<p>In the surface mount components I used to work on, the pcb was virtually never faulty, 1 in 10,000 faults maybe. It seems to be more of a problem of quality control these days, or just massively increased complexity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
