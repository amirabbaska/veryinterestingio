<p>No, it wouldn't melt as the aptly named /u/MoltenSlag has pointed out. It wouldn't burn in most lavas, either. What it <em>would</em> do which the others have failed to point out is shatter, gloriously. One thing people fail to think about with lava is that A: it's not uniform in how hot it is (the surface is usually solid, though not completely coherent and is churning chunks of solid rock) and B: it's <em>incredibly</em> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0377027384900726" target="_blank">viscous compared to what we often think of for liquids.</a></p>
<p>On a pāhoehoe flow it would possibly tumble around on the glassy surface and survive, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cFcJOr3BkQ" target="_blank">pāhoehoe moves in lobate toes</a> and if one of those toes overran a diamond the shear forces within the lava would shatter the diamond. ʻAʻā on the other hand <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyIV5fd1Aww" target="_blank">forms a solid clinkery surface</a>, and this would absolutely crush a diamond as basically lobes of solid basalt would shear it and crush it.</p>
<p>Remember, for all diamond's incredible heat resistance and high hardness, structurally it isn't invincible, and you can easily damage one by dropping it on the ground/slamming it into a table too hard/etc. Hardness is a measurements of resistance to abrasion, effectively, not of indestructibility. </p>
<p>For more felsic lavas (think Mt. St. Helens) which are very slow moving, I doubt much would happen. Unless it, you know, erupted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Now - they do that at \~763C.
They would turn liquid at 10GPa and &gt;4000C, which is quite rare on earth.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, Diamonds do not melt  in lava (magma) but they can transform to graphite.</p>
<p>Natural diamonds in the Earth's deep mantle and deep continental lithosphere are stable above a pressure of  \~5 gigapascals (&gt;150 km deep / 50,000 times atmospheric pressure) and \~1150 Celsius. At shallower depths and lower pressures, at the the temperatures experienced in magma and very high grade metamorphic rock, diamonds normally transform to graphite. The question is, therefore, why are diamonds sometimes found in volcanic and some metamorphic rocks?</p>
<p>The diamonds we mine from Kimberlite and Lamprophyre likely ascended to the surface very rapidly, with in about <del>24 hours</del> (it's now believed that Diamonds ascend at 30 to 50 meters per second, from 250km deep, and arrive at the Earth's surface in <strong><em>\~1 hour!</em></strong>). This rapid ascent prevented the diamonds from transforming to graphite; the rapid ascent was likely facilitated by the unusual chemistry of these magmas, very hot, low in silica and gas rich (abundant CO2).</p>
<p>Microscopic diamonds (up to 0.2 mm, but usually much smaller) are also sometimes found in Ultra High Pressure Metamorphic (UHP) rocks e.g eclogite, gneiss. These rare UHP metamorphic rocks ascended slowly to the surface, from &gt;120 km via tectonic deformation. These &quot;<em>superdeep&quot;</em> diamonds are not gem quality and usually exist as inclusions or flaws in other minerals, their entrapment appears to have protected them from transforming to graphite, however they usually transform the graphite...</p>
<p><em>A fine example of graphitized diamonds are found the Beni Bousera peridotites of Morocco, that contains up to 15% graphitized diamond!</em></p>
<p>If these diamonds did not transform to graphite, the Beni Bousera peridotites would be the world's richest diamond mine by far.</p>
