I dont hate the job at all. These kinda thoughts also come up in my everyday life, like pushing someone in front of a train. I would never, ever do such a thing, I am far from being a violent person. But why do these things sometimes pop up? Does someone else have those kinda thoughts?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These are called Intrusive Thoughts and are very common. I would say that most people think them from time to time. If they aren't otherwise interfering with your life then you can safely ignore them as just another part of the human experience. If they are causing you distress then you might want to see a professional about them.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP1xKbPcunc&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">I made a video to answer your question</a>. If you don't want to watch the video I will sum up what I cover here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These thoughts are called intrusive thoughts and pretty much everyone gets them!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are creep up on us, and are usually pretty horrible thoughts such as kicking an old lady into space, or slapping a child. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They aren't dangerous, just try not to push them out of your head as studies have shown that doing so will just cause you to think about them more.</p>
</li>
<li>Also, try not to monitor them it is said that if you do you can develop a form of OCD that ties in with these thoughts.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you enjoy the <strong>joke</strong> at the end of the video.</p>
<p>Have a great day!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I get these when I'm driving... mostly.</p>
<p>Usually it's along the lines of &quot;I wonder what it would be like to suddenly veer/wobble at 100kph from a straight?&quot; Or &quot;Let's turn into that tree.&quot; </p>
<p>Somtimes during conversations it can happen, &quot;what if I say this horrendous, nonsensical thing, how will they react?&quot; </p>
<p>It's bizarre, almost like I'm standing beside myself while I have the thoughts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I suffered with horrible intrusive thoughts about 4 months after having my baby.
Thoughts of her falling down the stairs while i was holding her, and other really awful stuff that consumed me from the inside out
.
I developed OCD, taking 4-5 showers a day along with other habbits that i would do to help &quot;control&quot; these thoughts
<em>spoiler alert</em> it did not help.
I was finally diagnosed with PPA/PPD after months of suffering alone and going absolutely crazy thinking i was going to accidentally hurt my child because the thoughts would eventually control me to do so. <em>spoiler alert part deux</em> i didnt, and they won't, CAN'T. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
