		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You pay that much because you'll pay that much. There does not need to be a link between raw materials and production cost versus retail rates.  It is market driven,  the consumer more or less sets the rate they are willing to pay.  If they push the price too high,  you'll start driving less or get a more efficient vehicle buying less.  If the price goes too low,  oil company profit drops.  If an oil company thought they could get away with charging you $6/gal they would.  However as soon as one tried,  another will go to $5.50.  It's a constant game of finding a balance between being lower than the competition,  high enough to make a good profit,  and low enough to keep consumers driving their SUVs by themselves.  Another interesting point about retail gas,  the price isn't set until it leaves the gas station tank and enters the consumer vehicle.  The gas in the underground tank isn't a fixed cost to the station.  Otherwise,  the price you pay wouldn't change as often as it does. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>The price of the oil is NOT the only factor, I would even bet that its not even the biggest part of it. The price actually are partly fixed costs (which are named that way because you can't alter them by the amount you produce, they guy operating a machine for 8 hours costs the same, doesn't matter if he produces 10 or 1000 things of something) the other part would be variable costs, higher or lower prices for the material would be one of them, and even here its only a fraction of it.  </li>
</ul>
<p>To sum this point up: When you are running a bakery, having flour prices drop by 50% won't make your cake-prices drop by 50%  </p>
<ul>
<li>You need gasoline. They know you need gasoline, you will buy it, even if its more expensive.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In California it stays high because the refineries are required to produce a different blend of gasoline than the rest of the country. Additionally our State taxes are some of the highest and are going up. Much of the crude supplied to the refineries is sourced from local production in Southern California which is declining which results in a $5 premium paid for California Oil over the Texas Brent Crude posting price. All this adds up for proportionately higher gasoline prices even taking into account the hopefully temporary drop in oil price (I'm in the Oil Biz).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>Because the cost of moving it from where it was pumped, to the gas station, didn't drop in half.</li>
<li>Because you don't put &quot;oil&quot; in your gas tank - it has to be changed into gasoline ... and the cost to change oil into gas did NOT drop in half.</li>
