		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Passenger aircraft are usually pressurized to about 8000' equivalent altitude. Three things can be happening here. The first is that the slightly reduced pressure causes your eardrums to flex outward, and if you have a blocked eustachian tube or otherwise do not fully equalize your middle ear space, the increased tension on the eardrum will reduce its sensitivity.  Secondly, sound attenuates with distance to a greater extent when the air pressure is lower. This is probably not an issue with headphones, but could be if you were trying to speak to someone at the far end of the cabin. Finally, the noise floor on a plane is significant, with engine, wind and cabin noises all contributing. As the apparent loudness of your program material is the difference between the signal level and the noise floor, it will seem less loud than if you were listening in a quiet room.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably ear damage. As previously mentioned, if your eardrums are pushed out due to the pressure, then hypothetically no. But you probably equalized the pressure without thinking about it, and your &quot;normal&quot; volume is relative to a quiet room, so there is a good chance you're just going louder. For me, I either use Etymotic MC5's or Shure 215's which both have amazing noise isolation so I don't have to crank up the volume. But if you use Apple earbuds that don't make a seal, normal volume relative to the plane is just extra loud.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When air pressure is reduced, sounds lose their intensity more quickly as they travel through air (this is due to the air molecules being further apart). The amount the volume is reduced by this effect depends on the distance between the source and your ear, as well as the pressure.</p>
<p>In your case of an airline passenger wearing headphones, the pressure difference is not extreme and the distance between your headphones and your ear drums is very small. The effect of the pressure difference is barely, if at all, noticeable. </p>
<p>The reason your music seems quieter is that the plane's engines are very loud. Turning up your music to be heard over the plane's engines is in fact likely to cause hearing damage, especially if you listen at that volume for extended periods of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As everybody is saying, there's a lot of reasons, and pressure is definitely huge- but it's more the pressure in your ear making your eardrums flex less. IDK if this is at all useful for me, but they make special earplugs you can wear during ascent that allows the air pressure inside your ear to change much more slowly, making it a lot easier to pop your ears. I've found it eliminates that pressure issue and I can listen to my earbuds at a more normal volume since the pressure isn't straining my eardrums. They're called earplanes or something- if you struggle with popping your ears, they've been a lifesaver for me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
