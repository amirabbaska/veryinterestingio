		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Sun heats the Earth as it rotates, but it heats different parts differently.  Some times of day the Sun is more directly over your head (like at noon rather than at sunset), and so you and the ground around you get heated up more than for someone standing somewhere else where the Sun is setting.  This can also happen because of the seasons -- imagine you are on a Caribbean Island in the winter and your friend is in Alaska.  You will feel more heat from the Sun.</p>
<p>Another important thing about how hot it is where you are standing is the stuff around you.  If you are standing in a puddle, your feet won't get as hot in the middle of the day as if you are standing on pavement or a piece of metal.</p>
<p>What does this heat have to do with wind though?  When the ground is hot, the air nearby gets hot.  And since the ground is different temperatures in different places, the air is different temperatures in different places too.  But what happens when air gets hot?  It expands, and just like in a hot air balloon, it wants to rise relative to colder air.  This is where movement in our atmosphere begins.  Air heats up, expands, and floats.  Other air moves in to fill its place, and this movement of air is <em>wind</em>.  </p>
<p>Since some big parts of the world get heated up a lot more than others, some of this wind is very strong.  If you live near the ocean, you might notice that during the day the winds often blow from the ocean onto the land.  This is because the land is heating up faster than the ocean, so the air over the land heats up more and rises. Then, the air from the ocean flows in at the surface to take its place.  Eventually this air is warmed up by the land too and floats upward, pulling in more cool air from the ocean.  This is called a sea breeze.  The opposite happens at night when the water is warmer than the land.</p>
<p>At even bigger scales, this happens too as the land around the equator heats up, rises, and brings in air from the tropics around it.  As the Earth spins, it makes the wind seem to move not just North and South, but also East and West.  If you live in New York and want to fly to San Francisco, it will usually take you about an hour longer to get there than to get back home again because the winds are almost always flowing from the West to the East there.  These winds are called the Westerlies, and they show up nicely in a picture that /u/Altaeon8 posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3fozfu/eli5what_causes_the_phenomenon_of_wind/ctqrouq" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The sun heats the Earth, but some parts of the Earth get hotter than other parts. Have you ever touched blacktop in the sun and noticed it's hotter than the grass around it? The blacktop is abosorbing more energy from the sunlight than the grass, so it is getting hotter. </p>
<p>This happens all over the Earth, some places absorb more sunlight than others for various reasons. As the ground gets hotter, the air above the ground also gets hotter. The air is a gas, and hot gasses expand, all the molecules of air get farther apart. In weather terms this is called a low pressure area. </p>
<p>So in the hotter area the molecules of air are far apart from one another and the colder area has air with molecules packed tightly together. Imagine there are 100 people in a room with a fence running down the middle, 90 people are on one side of the fence and 10 people are on the other. The side with 90 people is really crowded, this is like the air above the colder area of the Earth. If you were to suddenly remove the fence in the room, the crowded people would start to spread out into the other side of the room. The same thing happens with the molecules of air, they move from the crowded high pressure area toward the open low pressure area making wind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Anyway, as you may know, warm air rises because it is less dense. So when a pocket of air gets heated up, it rises higher up in the sky. </p>
<p>But as you also may know, nature doesn't like a vacuum (empty space), so something needs to fill in the empty space that the warm air left. What can fill it? A rush of cooler, denser air. That rush to fill in the gap is wind.</p>

<p>GET IT?!</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>

<p>There are three most common causes for your everyday puff of wind: convection, pressure gradients, and temperature gradients.</p>
<p>Convection is what happens when the sun heats up air near the surface, causing to it rise.  Surrounding air must rush in to fill its place.  If you could visualize it, it would look a lot like a lava lamp.  Convection is also what creates those white puffy clouds.  If the day gets warm enough, it'll lift that bubble of air high enough where the moisture inside of it gets cold enough to condense (like when you see your breath in winter).   </p>
<p>Pressure gradient is like visualizing the air as if it were a topographic map.  There are mountains (high pressure) and valleys (low pressure).  Air is a fluid that is subject to the force of gravity and will move from high to low.  Coriolis force will cause the wind to shift along the gradient lines.</p>
<p>Temperature gradient is similar to pressure gradient in that warmer air expands and cold air contracts.  If the warm center and cold center are far apart, there won't be much wind.  But if they are close (like during a cold front), it'll become very windy.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>BONUS MATHS:</p>
<p>I haven't yet seen anyone talk about the Hairy Ball Theorem (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem</a>).</p>
<p>This asks you to imagine a ball covered in fur, then try and comb all the fur in the same direction. You can't do it, there is always at least 2 'tufts' or 'crowns'.</p>
<p>Now imagine the (ball-shaped) earth. The movement of air can be thought of like a strand of hair, given it has a direction and a strength, which is the same as the direction and length of the hair. So a hairy ball is (mathematically) similar to a snap shot of the wind.</p>
<p>Now this doest tell us why we have wind, but it does show that at any one time there must be at least 2 storms. Because the storms are the swirling crowns or tufts of the hairy ball. Well either more than 2 storms or absoloutly no wind at all, which we would call the trivial case, and pretty much never happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
