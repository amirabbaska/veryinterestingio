		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Ionization. Think of your cells as a very carefully arranged Lego house, and the radiation as a 9mm bullet. </p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> The three classes of ionizing radiation are <a href="http://edtech2.boisestate.edu/lindabennett1/images/alpha%20beta%20gamma%20diagram.gif" target="_blank">alpha, beta, and gamma rays.</a> Alpha particles are helium-4 nuclei, spat out of other nuclei. Beta rays are electrons, spat out of neutrons when they turn into protons. Gamma rays are high energy photons. </p>
<p>These particles, when inside your body, have sufficient energy to disrupt other atomic bonds. They can remove electrons from other atoms, ionizing them and breaking up molecules. </p>
<p>Molecules broken down this way become free radicals - they're in an unstable state and want to find something new to bond with, which will in turn disrupt other chemical processes. </p>
<p>The most dangerous reactions occur when radiation directly damages DNA. If <a href="http://teachnuclear.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/direct214.gif" target="_blank">both strands are severed</a> and the cell repairs them incorrectly (i.e. they get rearranged) then this damage can be irreversible, and the cell can become cancerous. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key threat here comes from what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation" target="_blank">ionizing radiation</a>. This type or radiation consists of a number of particles that have enough energy to strip electrons from molecules. I think that this fact alone can already give you a hint about the biological mechanism of radioactivity: it is simply a mess. </p>
<p>The first step is that your body will be exposed to primary radiation in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray" target="_blank">gamma rays</a> (high energy photons), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle" target="_blank">alpha partices</a> (helium nuclei), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle" target="_blank">beta particles</a> (high energy electrons and positrons). Think of these particles as high speed bullets that are rifling through your body causing damage in the process. Such damage can include broken bonds, unwanted molecular changes, etc. However, the damage doesn't even end there. The initial radiation can also kick up a large number of high energy electrons (called secondary electrons) that will then create a second wave of destruction.</p>
<p>At the end of this process when the dust settles, depending on the dose you were exposed to, your body might have suffered serious damage at the tissue and cellular level, including <a href="http://www.radiation-scott.org/radsource/4341-3.gif" target="_blank">significant damage to your DNA</a>. Worst of all, this damage can also make it difficult for your cells to divide normally, so that this first wave of damage simply cannot be repaired. So now your body is riddled with damage, your cellular machinery has stopped working normally, and your cells cannot even replicate. With this picture in mind, I think it's easy to see how high doses of radiation damage can eventually lead to death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The many different isotypes/modalities of ionizing radiation damage DNA either directly, break strands/bounce off and around base pairs, or indirectly by generating reactive oxygen species that will damage DNA. Once DNA is damaged, the cell will die because it can no longer transcribe DNA to RNA and translate RNA to proteins needed to carry out cell functions and maintenance. Sometimes over doses of radiation are called radiation burns because of the similarities between heavy radiation exposure and a thermal burn.</p>
<p>If the damage to cells is repaired, great. If the damage is recognized as unrepairable, the cell should die either by inducing apoptosis as it should or necrosis followed up by the inflammatory response and that is the end of that.</p>
<p>If your are exposed to a lethal dose of radiation many cells will die quickly without any chances to repair, leading to death: you may suffer ataxia if muscle cells die, you will feel nauseous/dizzy and may suffer from seizures/tremors (CNS neurons die), you will be myelosuppressed and suffer severe anemia (hematopoietic cells die), suffer diarrhea become cachectic (GI cells die), and you will lose consciousness as your body completely shuts down for good. It's like your cells are slowly burning and falling apart. This can occur over varying lengths of time, usually weeks-months; some exposures have resulted in death in a small amount of time, like two days, and albeit pretty crazy, a large enough dose can be immediate.</p>
<p>Even when a few cells or no cells die, there's a good chance others were also damaged.
If the damage is sub-lethal, the cell may mutate genes of transcription factors like p53 or apoptosis regulators like bcl2 or inducers like bax/bad. Because the cell(s) never died and proliferated, they have a chance of being damaged again. Many mutations are required and this may cause protooncogenes to mutate into oncogenes. Once oncogenes are expressed more and more with each mutation and periodic damage, tumors may develop. Some tumors multiply over long periods of time, differentiate properly, and remain in their site of origin--which is by definition benign (adenoma, thymoma, fibroma, fibroadenoma, papilloma, leiomyoma to name some).</p>
<p>Malignancies or cancerous tumors (carcinomas, myelomas, leukemias, sarcomas like lymphoma, leiomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, etc.) by definition proliferate beyond their bounds (break through a basement membrane, immigrate to the lymphatics vessel and nodes or thin blood vessel and other organs). Sometimes a cancer cell will successfully implant elsewhere and continue to proliferate; this is metastasis. It can be treated with all kinds of alkylating agents, antitumor antibiotics, plant alkaloids, and even the newer, fiendishly expensive and not-as-effective monoclonal antibody drugs. Even radiation will treat cancer, despite the risk of developing a secondary tumor elsewhere.</p>
<p>However, if caught too late and the cells have already proliferated way way too much everywhere, the treatment may not target the cells anymore if they are no longer rapidly dividing and the metastases may not be removable via surgery.
Even if caught early, there is a chance some cells will have mutated to avoid being targeted and to be resistant to treatment. The cancer treatment may look effective, but once the all the targeted cells are no longer in the cancer population, the remaining resistant cells will proliferate in their place, as in small cell lung cancer.
The organs with the malignant cells will eventually lose the ability to function normally either because there are too many malignant cells making up the organ, or the remaining cells are impeded by the malignant cells. If the organs are essential to life, you will pass away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to answer in two parts.  Short term and long term.</p>
<p>Long term, exposure radiation (of all types, alpha, beta, and gamma) more or less translates into DNA damage.  DNA damage can sometimes be repaired, although generally the damage builds up over time.  Most cells are actually pretty resistant to radiation, but the build up of damage eventually causes the loss of function or viability from stem cells, or even cancer.</p>
<p>Short term:  Catastrophically high exposures to radiation can cause the immediate death of cells through DNA damage or through actual chemical damages to the cell membrane or organelles (like the mitochondria) inside of cells.  There are several actual mechanisms for this, be it oxidation damage from an increase of free radicals, to the actual chemical transmutation of elements that make up the cell.  The body is pretty good at replacing lost cells, so most exposures don't really hit this level of bad....generally the loss of viability of stem cell lines is what leads to the break down of bodily systems and death from radiation exposures.</p>
<p>edit: To add a little bit to the 'short term' category, radiation exposures of great intensity can also cause mass depolarization of the nervous system through chemical damage, which leads to death very quickly.  You probably wouldn't have time to realize what happened, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I looked forward to the weekends because it was only Monday through Friday.  And about a year later I needed a hip replacement because it fried the bone.  But the cancer hasn't come back.
