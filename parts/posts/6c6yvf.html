		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe what you are describing is a contraction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_tympani_muscle" target="_blank">tensor tympani muscle</a>. This is a muscle that actually functions to dampen sounds, particularly those produced by other functions of your head, such as chewing.</p>
<p>I am able to contract this muscle voluntarily and create the wind-rushing, or roaring type sound. This also happens when I yawn. When this occurs I generally cannot hear other external sounds, or they are dampened to the point that they are unintelligible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Congrats! You are an ear rumbler. </p>
<p>Short summary:
You have the ability to control your tensor tympani muscle, which is used to control your cochlea in response to loud sounds. This creates a rushing, rumbling sound in your ear.  Some people can only do it with eyes closed, some for only a limited time. Some people experience a clicking sound before rumbling. It varies from person to person. I can do it by closing my eyes, opening my mouth wide, or just normally, but for a short time. </p>
<p>It is a very rare trait. Other ear rumblers can be found at r/earrumblersassemble </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Holy crap I've been able to do this voluntarily for as long as I can remember, such a relief to know it's an actual thing! I can also do a similar thing where I sort of tense some area near my jaw connection and my ear, and it produces a ringing sound... same phenomenon? Reply if anyone knows... thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
