		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trains cause immense vibrations when they roll on track. A rigid substance would crack and break under the stress.</p>
<p>The gravel acts as a way to dissipate that energy into each tiny stone which just nestles further into the other stones around it. This allows the gravel bed to bend and flex as the train travels, both preserving the foundation and the track.</p>
<p>Despite its looks, the gravel is well compacted and has very little chance of washing away without significant outside force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Noone here mentioned the Geotechnical strength of the gravel used for railroad tracks and why it is incredibly stable.</p>
<p>Gravel at rock quarries is sold in sizes and mixes. Mixes include different quantities of different sizes of rock which display different qualities, such as stability, strength, filtration, and drainage.</p>
<p>Certain mixes are incredibly stable. With certain mixes you can fill a bucket with rocks and hold in place about 25% of the surface rocks with a flat plate or something and then tip the bucket upside down and none of the rocks will fall out.</p>
<p>A mix like above is very easy to achieve and rock quarries are able to easily create these mixes in large quantities. In many cases it might not require any mixing at all. The natural creation of the gravel from rock may provide the correct size and shape ratios to meet the requirements for this strength. </p>
<p>Soil and rock mechanics (Geotechnical Engineering) is one sub-field of civil engineering.</p>
<p>Another one that wasnt mentioned is post construction compaction. Gravel and the ground beneath the gravel dissipates the load over a larger area at about a 2:1 ratio of spread to depth. The gravel won't be compacted and the ground won't be compacted any further because the weight is dissipated. </p>
<p>There are many many reasons for using gravel mentioned by others such as moisture/water flow problems such as erosion, freeze/thaw, expansion and compaction from wet and dry conditions. Different soils have different properties depending on differences in chemical content that would have to be tested for quality control which would not be good enough. If a train derails it could easily cause a disaster. </p>
<p>Why not other materials? Price and environmental damage from those materials. </p>
<p>Certain types of dirt such as Montmorillonite Clay can cause huge amounts of expansion/contraction to occur while wet or dry and have enough strength to move huge buildings up and down several inches to a foot or two. That would be a disaster for a train and it would be hard to prevent and test for those types of clays, organic soils, and such from being used by mistake. Gravel several orders of magnitude more safe than compacted dirt. </p>
<p>There are even more reasons than this why Gravel is vastly superior to existing ground or other materials.</p>
<p>Source: Im a civil engineer and the above information is accurate and should contain all the most relevant reasons why gravel is used instead of other options.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I work in the signaling department for KCS, and I'm currently getting trained on designing crossing locations for the road.  </p>
<p>The first day of training we discussed the ballast (rock) and why it is used.  The manual we are learning from briefly discusses ballast as &quot;stone chips that are packed underneath and around the ties (wooden planks) to hold them steady and keep them in place&quot;.  It also provides a way to keep water away and vegetation away.  </p>
<p>But most importantly, at least for my department, there is an electrical current running along most tracks to form a circuit to provide an indication that a train is coming to the crossing.  To briefly explain how these work, we use a bungalow that house a GCP 3000 or 4000, or if it's recent enough an XP4, a frequency of current is selected that runs along the track to a shunt.  This shunt ends the circuit and whenever anything comes between the two on the track it begins to shunt the circuit.  This is detected in the bungalow and the computer calculates an estimation of how long he train will take to get there.  </p>
<p>This In turn starts the flashers and bells, if there is a gate arm, it will descend after a 3 second delay to allow traffic to clear from the crossing and then block the crossing from automotive traffic.  </p>
<p>So why rocks? Well with all of this incredibly important electrical work on the lines, it is incredibly important that we protect this circuit from shorting on its own (there are fail-safes that can eventually figure out what it's sensing is not a train) and causing a false crossing activation.  It was already there to keep ties in place, and it doubles up effectiveness for insulation on the track circuits themselves.  </p>
<p>Tl;dr rocks are used as ballast to keep the ties in place, which keep the rails in place.  They also help provide insulation from outside things to keep the track circuit in working order.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gravel layer is known as the ballast. The sharp edges of the stone create friction to lock the ties (wooden planks perpendicular to the line of travel). Alternatively, the gravel layer keeps vegetation and moisture away from the structure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
