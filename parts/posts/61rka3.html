		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a couple of different reasons but I'll try to separate them.</p>
<p>Chemically, there's 3 different 'types' of tears; Basal, Reflex, and Emotional. The other two tears are a result of irritants or just general lubricant for the eye in the form of mucus, but emotional tears are made up of stress hormones such as cortisol (which will relieve tension in your body which is argued for why you feel better after crying) and leucine enkephalin, a natural painkiller and endorphin (stuff you get while doing exercise) which also uses up cortisol in the body and makes you feel better.</p>
<p>Psychologically, everyone cries because it's a form of non-verbal communication that you are feeling sad or might be injured, or anything that means you might need help, despite you not being consciously aware of it. You can't make yourself cry unless you think of something emotional. </p>
<p>You cry when you're emotional because your body treats an emotional stressor as if you have been physically injured. You might be in relatively low physical danger when told that a family member has passed away, but the overwhelming stress and emotion causes such a build up of stress hormones from the sympathetic nervous system (increases heart rate, respiration, supresses digestion, etc) that you will most likely cry or feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>When something makes you extremely happy, you remove a lot of distress from your life (if not momentarily). Looking at the GAS (Hans Selye's General Adaption Syndrome) model for stress, most people are subconsciously in the 'resistance' stage; meaning they have increased their resistance to stressors to get through their lives. When something extremely great happens to you, say a partner proposes or you win the lottery, that stress resistance level is no longer needed, so excess stress hormones that were activated to keep you resistant are released in Emotional tears.</p>
