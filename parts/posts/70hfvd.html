		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First you must understand that AI in gaming is used in the loosest sense possible.  The AI is typically a term just applied to specific NPC actors within the game.  It's simply a series of commands an actor follows in accordance with their surroundings.</p>
<p>For every interval of time (cycles, ticks, etc), the actor will check what is around it in the game world.  They might have a hearing range that is 2 meters, so instead of asking the game engine where the player is, they'll check if they hear a player within 2 meters of their position.  They might have an invisible sight cone(really just a visualization of a geometric function that the actor runs) that projects 10 meters in front of them at 45 degrees, so they'll check if the player falls within that cone.</p>
<p>Basically, the data is there and the actors could immediately access the player's location if that was the game designer's intent, but it's not as sporting or immersive as the actor seeking more conventional means to find you, like a clear line of sight or close proximity.</p>
<p>Oh, or like a DM and a group of Dungeons &amp; Dragons players.  The game engine is like the DM; It knows all the stats, all the player's positions, and determines all the rules governing them, but the players still have to run Search checks and such by the DM.  Sometimes a player will just give a DM numbers and the DM will translate that into &quot;You see a Dwarf&quot; or &quot;Hit&quot; or &quot;You step in a pile of horse dung.&quot;  I guess you could scratch it up to compartmentalization of information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The game knows where you are, but the AI doesn't. The AI has some information about its surroundings, but the game engine does not tell the AI where you are (unless it is cheating to make it more difficult). </p>
<p>so the AI actually has to look and try and find you normally, using the information it actually gets from the game engine. </p>
<p>Not all parts of a video game (or any program) has access to all other parts. The part that handles the AI is distinct from the part that handles the graphics which is distinct from the part that handles player controls. The AI part can't access information it does not own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're playing hide and seek with your 3-year-old sister. Your sister is loud and terrible at hiding, so you know where she is every time without having to look. But she likes the game, so you want to play along and not find her immediately. You come up with a simple routine that you can follow every time, which will eventually find her:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a random room in the house.</li>
<li>Look under every table and chair.</li>
<li>Look behind big objects.</li>
<li>Open closets and cabinets and big containers.</li>
<li>Go back to step 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes you'll find her quickly, sometimes you won't, because your routine has nothing to do with where she actually is. You just follow the steps until you happen to find her.</p>
<p>Your routine is a simple algorithm. Video games follow much more complicated algorithms, but the principle is the same. They aren't really &quot;trying&quot; to find you, they're trying to follow the steps of their algorithms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've gotten some answers but none that are very &quot;ELI5&quot;.</p>
<p>You seem to be confusing the game itself with the enemies in the game.</p>
<p>Of course the game itself knows where you are, but it's not against you.</p>
<p>It wants you to play and sets challenges for you to overcome.</p>
<p>The enemies in the game are the challenges but are bound by rules.</p>
<p>As an analogy, the game itself is like a dungeon master in a tabletop RPG.</p>
<p>He knows everything about your character and, if he liked, could just bring in an invulnerable dragon who kills you no matter what you do.</p>
<p>But there's no fun in that.</p>
<p>So the dragon has weaknesses.</p>
<p>But just because the dungeon master put the dragon in front of you doesn't mean that the dragon can use all of the dungeon master's power at will.</p>
<p>In the same vein, an enemy in a video game can't just access the knowledge of the game at large and know your every move.</p>
<p>It's a slave to the game and can only work with what it's given.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They explained this for alien isolation. There is one &quot;brain&quot; that knows everything and sees where you are, and a second &quot;brain&quot; that actually controls the alien.  The first brain sends HINTS about where you are without telling the alien too much information. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
