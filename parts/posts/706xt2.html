		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in dentistry, and did some work on a 12 year old. I know this child personally, and know he is a loud chewer despite lips being closed. What I  recently found with his mixed dentition is a deep anterior bite, and heavy heavy occlusal wear resulting in short flat adult and baby teeth. And after some thought, I concluded he can't chew quietly because his flat teeth are literally clanking together instead of moving in a circular chewing motion. Also, his only teeth available to contact are his front teeth (which are technically tearing teeth) and his first molars. So most food is not being grinded between teeth to absorb some of the sound. Just clank clank clank. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another side to the story is what the listener hears, rather than just the sounds the eater makes (or doesn't make). Misophonia and hyperacusis are conditions whose definitions seem to overlap somewhat. For people with these, various sounds can be intolerable; eating sounds being a major problem for many. Frequency/pitch seems to play a part in how noticeable (or specifically, irritating) a sound is, so different eaters could be producing different quality sounds that are more or less noticeable than others.</p>
<p>I, for one, can be <em>incredibly</em> irritated by noisy eaters, to the extent that it's a real struggle to remain civil to the eater. Thankfully, through sheer bloody mindedness and effort, the issue is not as bad as it once was, though there are still times when I could cheerfully choke someone with the remains of whatever it is they're shovelling into their gaping maw.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are more than a few reasons but I am also sensitive to this issue and tried to pinpoint it so my SO can work on it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some people just seem to have cavernous mouths and just echos more even if they are chewing with their mouth closed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issues with breathing through the nose often has them open their mouth randomly to pull in air.</p>
</li>
<li>Slowing down (or sometimes speeding up) can reduce irritation caused by chewing in a irregular pattern.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general and as someone else mentioned, if you care and try to chew quietly in time you sort of just figure it out. Most of the people I know who make a lot of noise/chew with mouth open have parents who do the same. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For me, i opted to let my wisdom teeth stay dispite them not being able to come in all the way, what this caused is a psychological need to put those teeth together when I chew even tho they don't touch or only on the corners. This results in me trying to mash my wisdom teeth together causing a fairly loud outward sound. If I try not to make the sound it makes it harder to chew food. So I mash thru food like a big dumb fuck lumbering thru a forest drunk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
