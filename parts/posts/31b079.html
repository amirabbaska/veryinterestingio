		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> For a physically realistic impactor, the speeds are much too small to make temperatures high enough for any nuclear reactions to take place. For an imaginary impactor made of enriched Uranium, you can set off a blast. </p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> I like the Chixulub impactor. There is a crater 100 miles across in the Yucatan, formed when a 6 mile long asteroid struck the earth about 65 million years ago. There's a really good chance this thing killed the dinosaurs. </p>
<p>Anyway, a lot of work has been done to study this event, and one of my <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X98002635" target="_blank">favorite papers of all time simulates the impact and ejecta</a> (Free version <a href="https://www.psi.edu/about/memorial/betty/chicx3d.html" target="_blank">here</a>). The thing to look at is those ejecta profiles- on the free version click on a picture and it will show you an extra figure which has temperature data. They show the maximum temperature achieved in the ejected material is only about 10^(4) K, which is not as abusrdly hot as it sounds. For reference, you'd want it to be pushing 10^6 or 10^7 Kelvin for any nuclear reactions to take place. </p>
<p>But those are the just temperatures that a <em>rock</em> meteor reaches when it hits other rock. What if it was made of <em>the right stuff</em>?</p>
<p>Suppose there was a small asteroid made of enriched uranium. And suppose we had a planet with a little target of enriched uranium, and suppose it struck just right. In this case, you might be able to produce a nuclear explosion. In fact, this is the mechanism behind some nuclear bombs - <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Fission_bomb_assembly_methods.svg" target="_blank">shoot two subcritical pieces of uranium at each other to produce a critical piece that explodes.</a></p>
<p>How likely is it that we'll find an asteroid made of enriched uranium - isotopically pure U235? It's not likely, considering most uranium is the isotope U238, which is not fissile. Additionally, most heavy metals aren't found in nature in anything resembling a pure form. They're usually mixed with a bunch of other stuff, like oxides and rusts and rock. Uranium, for example, is generally found in a rock called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uraninite#/media/File:Pitchblende_schlema-alberoda.JPG" target="_blank">pitchblende or uraninite</a> which is just oxidized uranium. This wouldn't be good for a bomb; it takes a lot of processing and refinement to make it into something that goes boom. </p>
<p>This nuclear asteroid also can't be too big, because then it will be above the critical mass limit for fission chain reactions, and the energy released from the fission chain reaction will either cause the asteroid to fragment into smaller noncritical pieces, or the reaction will consume too much of the uranium and it will no longer be good for fuel. For reference, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun-type_fission_weapon#Little_Boy" target="_blank">the &quot;gun type&quot; assembly of the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima</a> was made of two cylinders of uranium, about 30 kg each, that were about 7 inches long. Separately, these pieces were subcritical, but when the bomb was detonated, <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Gun-type_fission_weapon_en-labels_thin_lines.svg" target="_blank">one cylinder would inserted into the other</a>, which with the addition of some neutron reflectors, would produce a critical assembly. Getting one of these guys to fall from space, not burn up on re-entry, and collide just right with something on the ground would be quite the feat. </p>
<p>So in <em>theory</em> - and I mean 'theory' in an imaginary playtime physics universe - it's possible. In reality, not so much. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, no.</p>
<p>Nuclear explosive devices, even 'gun-type' ones that might approximate your hypothetical meteor impact, rely on a lot more than just slamming a pair of subcritical masses together to form a super-critical mass.</p>
<p>As other posters have mentioned, if either mass of fissile material is too big, it'll go critical and you won't have enough left over when they combine to get the reaction you're looking for. </p>
<p>However, you actually need multiple critical masses of fissile material, so either your impactor, target, or both need to have enough mass to go critical, but be precisely shaped to prevent criticality until the two are combined. This arrangement is unlikely to occur in nature to say the least.</p>
<p>Another factor to consider is that the two masses are going to start reacting with each other before they combine fully, this causes a 'pre-detonation' or fizzle where a reduced reaction blows your masses apart without fully achieving supercriticality.</p>
<p>To prevent this occurrence, you need shielding (to prevent the masses from interacting to soon) a tamper (to confine the material and prevent it from blowing apart too quickly once the reaction begins) and a neutron reflector (this reduces the mass needed to achieve supercriticality and enhances the chain reaction when both masses are fully enclosed in the reflector, further reducing the risk of a fizzle)
These are usually combined in various ways, but must be carefully arranged as mis-positioning them could either prevent a detonation altogether, or cause either mass to achieve premature criticality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any sub critical mass of a fissile material would likely be too small to survive entering an atmosphere. Anything large enough to survive entering the atmosphere would have a good chance of already undergone fission. </p>
<p>I guess if we're talking about a hypothetical situation where you have a planet with no atmosphere, doted with nodes of sub critical fissile material and a meteorite made of the same material hit it right on one of those nodes, could it cause a nuclear explosion? I guess.</p>
<p>Practically your odds of finding the right planet of this to happen and have a meteorite of the right stuff hit the right spot... are probably worse than you winning every major lottery, every drawing, from now until the end of time. </p>
<p>Natural fission reactors exist; </p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor</a></p>
<p>So it comes down to the question that will a sub critical mass react when it comes into contact with another sub critical mass which causes them to form a critical mass? Yes, obviously. But the scenario postulated is exceedingly unlikely. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that stars are fusion reactors that are formed by gravity alone...... </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
