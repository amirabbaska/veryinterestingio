		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, some studies that helped me with my reasoning: A study has shown that people who are imagining visual stimuli (as opposed to actually seeing it) still show activation in their visual cortex. A different study that looked at the <a href="https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1426245/rubins-vase.jpg" target="_blank">vase-face illusion</a> found that people's brain activity differed depending on which part of the illusion they were perceiving - if they reported perceiving faces, their fusiform gyrus (the brain's face area) was stimulated, but if they were perceiving a vase, the same area was not lit up. There didn't seem to ever be a time where brain activation showed both patterns indicating perception of both the vase and the faces simultaneously, which suggests that your brain can only perceive one thing or the other. </p>
<p>So my guess at what is happening, in the visual aspect at least, is that your visual cortex would be stimulated, but the stimulation in your visual cortex when you're &quot;seeing&quot; your thought would be different from the pattern of stimulation when you're consciously perceiving what is in front of you. </p>
<p>So for example: you're sitting in front of a striped black and white wall, but you're imaging or &quot;seeing&quot; a solid red coloured wall. When you're focusing on (i.e. consciously perceiving) the striped wall, the visual neurons that respond to contrast would be stimulated, but the neurons responsible for colour perception would not. When you switch your focus so that you are consciously perceiving the imagined red wall, your colour neurons would be stimulated, but your contrast neurons would not. </p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex - the part of the brain responsible for stuff like reasoning, cognition, and other executive functions - probably also plays a role in the thoughts that you &quot;see&quot;, because it's implicated to be heavily involved in consciousness. </p>
<p>As for people who can't &quot;see&quot; things in their minds, you're not alone. There's a condition called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia" target="_blank">aphantasia</a> where people don't see pictures in their head. If I asked the average person how many windows they had in their home, they would probably do a mental walkthrough of their home and count the windows. For somebody with aphantasia, they'll know, but they might not know how they know. </p>
<p>TL;DR: activation in the visual cortex for the &quot;seeing&quot; part, and likely activation in the prefrontal cortex for the &quot;thought&quot; part. Also, not being able to &quot;see&quot; things in your mind is actually a thing - aphantasia. </p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811902912437" target="_blank">vase-face study</a></p>
<p>EDIT2: <a href="http://psylux.psych.tu-dresden.de/i1/kaw/diverses%20Material/www.illusionworks.com/assets/images/vase.jpg" target="_blank">cool example</a> of the vase-face illusion, of faces of two real people - who are they? :D </p>
<p>EDIT3: fixed the study link so that you don't need a school log in, but it only shows you the abstract (the summary) for free. </p>
<p>EDIT4, <strong>attempting to ELI5 even more</strong>: the part of your brain that you use when you see is turning on both when you're looking at a thing, and thinking about &quot;seeing&quot; a thing. there's a different pattern when each of those happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer this on a deeply neurological level, but I can on a cognitive-psychological one. The short answer is that while visualizing something in your head, you're not <em>fully</em> processing what's in front of you, at least not to the same extent.</p>
<p>Think of your brain like a computer, i.e. an information-processing machine. All of your senses are essentially &quot;input&quot; sources for information;
your eyes are getting visual info, your ears are picking up sound, your skin is picking up pressure and temperature (and possibly pain), etc. There are actually <em>way</em> more than 5 senses, but the point is that at any given time, there is a <em>lot</em> of sensory information that is flowing into your brain at any given time.</p>
<p>Then you have <em>internal</em> information, which you pull from your stores of memory or your thoughts. This would be the origin of something that you're &quot;picturing&quot; in your head, without seeing it in front of you. Your brain includes what effectively amounts to a biological graphics card, so when you're picturing something in your mind, you're essentially running a kind of simulation.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the main point: even though all of this sensory and internal info is <em>presented</em> to your brain, your brain isn't necessarily <em>doing anything</em> with it. It's not all being automatically processed. To use vision as an example, your eyes are basically giving the rest of your brain a video feed, but <em>that's all that your eyes do</em>. In order for you to do even basic things like recognize objects or faces, tell the shape of an object, etc, your brain needs to do further processing on this visual feed, and here's where the bottleneck is.</p>
<p>As powerful and complex as it is, the brain has a <em>limited amount</em> of computing power. It simply <em>can't handle</em> everything at once, especially when two different tasks are competing for use of the same parts of the brain. The brain has to choose which information it <em>attends</em> to (&quot;attend&quot; = the root of &quot;attention&quot;) and which information it just lets drop and be overwritten.</p>
<p>In the case that OP cited, the visual feed from the eyes is usually handled by the same neurological hardware that also performs the &quot;picture in your mind&quot; bit, so they're directly competing for cognitive resources. When you're picturing something intensely, your attention is mostly on the simulation that your brain is running. Meanwhile, the info coming from the optic nerve is being stored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_memory" target="_blank">sensory memory,</a> which is sort of like a temporary cache for sensory information that hasn't yet been processed further. Your brain is still paying a <em>little</em> bit of attention to this sensory memory, but not as much it normally would, because your attention is being diverted towards another task. </p>
<p>The reasons I listed above are also why visualizing something is often easier with your eyes closed. Similarly, for an auditory equivalent, reading comprehension is typically impaired while listening to music with lyrics, but it is <em>not</em> as affected by music <em>without</em> lyrics; language is processed by the same parts of the brain whether read or heard, so presenting both at once essentially creates competition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Add to what others are saying:  There was an experiment started by nasa a long time ago where they were having people wear glasses that inverted the vision.  The reasoning had to do with the lack of orientation in space.  They had to wear this 24/7.  It was discovered at about the 3 week mark that all test subjects actually became accustomed to this flip, and they were able to go about their day as if it were normal.  What was discovered was that the &quot;mind's eye&quot; was able to overcome this change and see things normally again, despite the inverted vision.  It was also later discovered that the mind's eye actually flips what images go into the retina naturally.</p>
<p>In other words, the mind's eye is more powerful than you can take at face value.  The brain just interprets the data as it needs, regardless of what it actually sees.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's evidence</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that imagery and perception share common processing mechanisms, and demonstrate that the specific brain regions activated during mental imagery depend on the content of the visual image.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/media/pdfs/OCravenKanwisherJOCN00.pdf" target="_blank">this fMRI study</a>, but there are many more.</p>
<p>One of the things you learn in a cognition &amp; perception class is that there's not really such a thing as &quot;multitasking.&quot; The best we can do is shift our attention between multiple things quickly. So if you're imagining visual imagery, you're attending to that and not really processing—or we should say, <em>perceiving</em>—what your eyes are sensing at all. If I understand it correctly, studies like these suggest that the brain uses the same areas to perceive both imagined imagery and real imagery coming through your optic system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>'Fun' fact... Some of us can't. I'm one of a small % of people who see nada in their 'minds eye'. Nothing is a bit of an overstatement, but if you ask me to shut my eyes and picture a green triangle, it's just not there. I know what a green triangle IS, 3 sides and green. Can't picture one though for love nor money. </p>
<p>I don't think it's a coincidence that my drawing skills are non-existent, very talented musically but my visualisation ability is awful. Is it just genetics? Can this be improved? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
