<p>I understand that the colors of the planets do change sometimes. Jupiter can become yellower, for example. But it never becomes blue. I did some searching, both around the internet at large and this subreddit in particular, and couldn't find anything commenting on this phenomenon. I hope this question hasn't been asked before.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! </p>
<p>Your question actually has a very complex answer. There are a few reasons for the colours of the gas giants, in order of importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the planets' distance from the sun, and hence the <a href="https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/ideas/Insolation.html" target="_blank">insolation</a> received by the planets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the planets' atmospheric compositions;</p>
</li>
<li>the planets' surface temperatures.</li>
</ol>
<p>You mentioned that Jupiter is reddish—it's actually white, with <em>bands</em> of darker colours like red, orange, yellow, brown, etc. Jupiter's atmosphere is primarily composed of <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/be28/a0e626de6fbc68553b7a9f82f20f527940c5.pdf" target="_blank">hydrogen (83.6%), helium (16%), with trace volatiles like water, ammonia and methane (the three compounds that arise when oxygen, nitrogen and carbon are introduced into a hydrogen-rich environment)</a>. It also contains trace amounts of other elements and compounds like sulfur (again in the form of hydrogen sulfide) and phosphine. The reddish bands are mainly due to complex hydrocarbons that arise due to methane reacting with itself to form ever-longer chains of carbon and hydrogen. These reactions <em>can</em> occur because firstly, Jupiter is near enough to the Sun that high up in its atmosphere, UV energy from the Sun can break carbon-hydrogen bonds in methane molecules, and the resulting radicals can react with each other. Secondly, lightning in Jupiter's atmosphere can also produce this reaction too—something like this:</p>
<p>CH₄ + <em>hν</em> —&gt; CH₃• + H•</p>
<p>2 CH₃• —&gt; H₃C—CH₃</p>
<p>Repeat ad infinitum until you get something like H₃C(CH₂)₁₀CH₃ (dodecane). This need not be (and probably <em>isn't</em>) the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Dodecane-3D-balls.png/800px-Dodecane-3D-balls.png" target="_blank">straight-chain form</a>; it is likely much more complex, like <a href="http://www.stenutz.eu/chem/solv6.php?name=2%2C6-dimethyl-3-isopropylheptane" target="_blank">this, perhaps</a>. The chains get longer and longer, and also more complex, and these long-chain hydrocarbons look reddish-brown—the same colour as urban smog. These are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochemistry" target="_blank">photochemical</a> reactions—light energy is used to power chemical reactions. As mentioned earlier, presence of sulfur compounds also contribute to the red colouration. Saturn is less intensely and more uniformly coloured, because the hydrocarbons in its atmosphere aren't as long. The longer and more complex the hydrocarbon, the more intense the colouration—think natural gas vs petrol vs diesel oil vs bitumen. The hydrocarbons in Saturn aren't as long because of reason 1 above: the insolation at Saturn's orbit is considerably less than at Jupiter's, so the reactions are less vigorous, and take longer to occur simply because there's less energy.</p>
<p>Uranus and Neptune, on the other hand are blue because they <em>also</em> have methane in their atmosphere, but this methane is unreacted and the insolation at such great distances from the Sun is hardly sufficient to power any sort of photochemical reaction (all probes ever sent out beyond Jupiter don't use solar panels for power, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank">RTGs</a>). <a href="http://lasp.colorado.edu/~bagenal/1010/graphics/methane_abs_outplanets.gif" target="_blank">Methane is strongly absorbent in the red and near-infrared spectrum</a>, so it looks bluish, and hence Uranus and Neptune also look blue. They have white streaks, which are clouds of water ice, ammonia and, yep—methane. It is as yet unknown why Neptune is a deeper ultramarine rather than Uranus' cyan, and this is a topic of active investigation, since only one space probe has ever visited Neptune: Voyager 2. </p>
<p>It is appropriate to note that the internal compositions of the latter two planets also matter: Uranus and Neptune are called 'ice giants', because they are primarily composed of what astrophysicists call 'ices', i.e. the three common hydrogen compounds: water, ammonia and methane, rather than the hydrogen and helium of Jupiter and Saturn. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The colours are more related to the mass than anything else. The colours come from abundances of metals in the planet (metal in astrophysics is anything that is not Hydrogen or Helium). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lets first compare Jupiter and Saturn as they are similar colours. Jupiter is &lt;1% metals while Saturn is ~1%. This leads to Jupiter being more &quot;pure&quot; than Saturn and we can consider Saturn as polluted. Now in terms of methane they have 0.3% and 0.45% of their mass as methane respectively. Compare this with Uranus and Neptune which have 2.3% and 1.5% and we see that the blue planets are more polluted. Methane absorbs red light and this is why they appear blue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is about the best we can do for colour as trying to differentiate between tones becomes complicated. To highlight this problem we can look at Uranus and Neptune and notice that although Neptune is a deeper blue its composition has less methane than Uranus. It is unknown what causes this (I am guessing that for Saturn and Jupiter this is the same but am not sure since we know considerably more about them than the ice giants) but there must be some subtle difference in the composition of the atmospheres.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So with this we can consider the relationship of mass and colour by looking at the method of planetary formation in the solar system (which is most likely to be core accretion). In the core accretion model we have that (skipping the early details and issues) at some point we get a core of large enough mass to begin runaway gas accretion. We know Jupiter has a 10 Earth mass core but despite being unconfirmed we expect Saturn to also have a core of some kind but it would be smaller than Jupiter. Neptune and Uranus would have smaller cores. This then becomes a competition of which core can suck up the most hydrogen and helium and clearly the bigger cores win. By element abundances the bigger you are the more of your mass should be hydrogen then helium (roughly speaking as this depends on element distribution is disks). So we have that the larger the planet the more orange/yellow is should be as it will be &quot;less polluted&quot; while the the Neptune sized planets are likely to be more polluted and tend to be blue (perhaps other colours too but I am not sure as I am no expert on element light absorption). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short.... colour depends (roughly) on how &quot;polluted&quot; the planet is and that depends roughly on mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

It predicts the likely appearance of a gas giant based on its temperature, which determines what kind of clouds are likely to exist at its visible &quot;surface&quot;. There are other factors affecting the color/appearance, but distance from the sun (temperature) is an important one. Both of our gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) are class I as they are in the outer solar system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
