		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>85% Poor maintenance with people cluttering their laptops up with junk and never clearing it. In my experience the older generation does this more, my dad literally had 3 different full install programs to &quot;test his internet speed&quot; running all the time.</p>
<p>The last 15% is a mix of websites/programs getting updated and modernised and using more resources, with a tiny bit of hardware and software wear and tear depending on useage amounts. </p>
<p>Personally I am typing this on an inherited 2011 macbook air that still runs as fast as the day I got it. Open the laptop to typing in 2-3 seconds, full restart in under 60 seconds etc. Never had any issues with it beyond some of my top line keys randomly not working sometimes. Compare that to my mothers macbook from the same period...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You probably are doing something wrong tbh. You probably accumulated a lot of crap from internet that slow your computer down. You should reformat your computer and reinstall windows. Then protect your computer better, anti-virus, scan, firewall, etc. Maybe you are going on unsafe websites and should limit that.</p>
<p>It's normal to reformat your computer from time to time to clean all the stuff that accumulate. It's also normal for computer to slow down over time because new program and operating system need more resources than old ones. But if it become unusable after 3 years either you bought a crap computer, or you don't protect your computer much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So many answers but nobody mentioned overheating.</p>
<p>Yes, bloated Windows (or other OSes) will get slowed down, but even if you format your computer, it might still be slow. That's because of two reasons. The first is, your hard drive will get slower. Buy an SSD, should be good for the next 5 years. The second, more common one (since as seen in this thread, nobody cares about it) is the fact that your processor starts overheating after years of use.</p>
<p>That's not because the processor gets bad or anything, it's because the thermal paste on the processor is old, it dries up, cracks, fills with air bubbles which overheat. If you change the thermal paste on your processor (and graphics unit) your computer should be as good as new. </p>
<p>You won't even necessarily notice your computer is overheating. That's because most laptops opt to slow down the processor instead of letting it overheat too much, but in some extreme cases your computer might end up turning off whenever you put too much strain on it. I've seen a case of a core2duo that should be running at 3GHz running at 600 MHz. Change your thermal pastes people!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also consider the increased RAM requirement of your web browser as computing power increases. </p>
<p>I'm picking on RAM because I've personally noticed my web browsers eating all of mine on occasion.</p>
<p>Two factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>updates to the software make it less efficient by adding more resource-hungry features</li>
<li>as compute and network grows, &quot;web applications&quot; grow their resource requirements as well</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, the developers don't notice the relatively minor increase in resource use, and by the time it's added up to affect you, they've upgraded their computers.</p>
<p>So ideally you'd notice this at 5 rather than 3 years,  and you'd not notice it if your &quot;internet use&quot; involves one window with one tab on one page at a time.</p>
<p>I notice it because I leave my browser open 24/7 with 10-50 tabs, 3 of which are pinned web apps like Gmail and Facebook.</p>
<p>So many fucking memory leaks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After three years time, there's only a few reasonable causes I can think of for a severe loss of usability in a computer.</p>
<p>1) The computer is cheap, and is using hardware that is already several years out of date at the time of purchase (I'm looking at you, Intel Celeron and Pentium).</p>
<p>As far as a solution, well, don't buy dirt cheap laptops. The &quot;Diminishing Returns Curve of Computer Hardware&quot; is a term I like to throw around. Basically, it's a graph of dollars spent v. performance yield of the computer. Despite somewhat popular belief, it is curved on both ends. Spend more than, say, $800, you will start to see less performance gain per dollar, and the strength of this effect gets stronger and stronger as you keep spending more money. Spend less than, say, $300, you will start to see <em>more performance loss</em> per dollar taken off. Those dollar amounts are rough and not true values to live by, but the point is there is a middle ground.</p>
<p>2) Very poor treatment of the operating system, be it Windows, OSX or a Linux distribution. This kind of piggy backs on #1, as newer hardware can better cope with the abuse, but if you have a ton of junky programs on your computer, you will find it is going to run quite poorly.</p>
<p>If this is the case, some single use programs (for Windows systems) I like are [Junkware Removal Tool] (<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/junkwareremovaltool/" target="_blank">https://www.malwarebytes.com/junkwareremovaltool/</a>) and [adwcleaner] (<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank">https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/</a>).</p>
<p>I hesitate to say antivirus will help, because those are targeting malicious software that is actually trying to steal your information or damage your system, and junkware isn't always malicious. That said, antivirus is always a good idea because malware can end up causing system slowdowns. Some antivirus names I am familiar with and haven't had a bad time with are Malwarebytes, Kaspersky, Avast and Sophos.</p>
<p>3) A bit of a stretch, but a failing storage device in a computer is extremely disruptive to system performance. Not to mention, your data will be in danger if you don't back it up to another device before it fully fails.</p>
<p>There are tools, such as [Piriform's Speccy] (<a href="https://www.piriform.com/speccy" target="_blank">https://www.piriform.com/speccy</a>) that can tell you what is called the &quot;SMART status&quot; of your storage devices. Basically, SMART is a system that makes your storage device self aware of it's own health. If it's not &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Verified&quot; or some other synonym of the word &quot;Good&quot;, then something is wrong with the device and you should back up your data before it inevitably fails.</p>
