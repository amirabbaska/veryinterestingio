When you clip it on your finger, it shines both red visible light and infrared light through you finger and it hits the detector. oxygenated blood and deoxygenated blood absorb different amounts of infrared and visible light, so by comparing the amounts that the sensor detects to the amount that was emitted, it can tell how much of your blood is oxygenated and how much isn't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I am an anaesthetist. I am very happy to see a question I am qualified to answer.
The principles behind pulse oximetry are some of the required knowledge for basic anaesthetic trainees.
As has been outlined, the pulse oximeter uses two wavelengths of light: 660nm (red light) and 940nm (infrared light). These lights correspond to the maximum absorption by deoxygenated haemoglobin and oxygenated haemoglobin respectively. This light shines through a finger, toe, lip, ear (and sometimes hands and feet for neonates) and is picked up by a detector on the contralateral side of the probe. The ratio between the two wavelengths that is transmitted gives an R value (Red/Infared) which corresponds to an oxygen saturation. An R value of 1 is equal to roughly 80% SpO2. Oxygenated blood absorbs more infrared light and deoxygenated blood absorbs more red light.
I hope that explanation helps a bit. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095461111300053X" target="_blank">Here</a> and <a href="http://www.frca.co.uk/article.aspx?articleid=332" target="_blank">Here</a> are a couple of articles that explains the science and limitations of oximetry in more detail. Thanks for letting me answer.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The instrument that reads the oxygen levels of your blood (referred to as SpO2) is called a pulse oximeter. It shines different wavelengths of light (usually IR and red) through your finger to find how oxygenated your blood is. How does it do this? Hemaglobin, which is the protein in your red blood cells that binds oxygen and takes it to your cells, can absorb light (like most materials). How much light it can absorb depends on the wavelength of light shining on it and whether the hemaglobin is holding oxygen or not. A sensor on the other side of your finger (a fancy lil thing called a photodiode) will detect how much light makes it through your finger. Plug these absorption values into an equation and you can figure out how much of your hemaglobin has oxygen in it. Hopefully if you're healthy it will be between 95-100%, although 100% SpO2 is not that common. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biomedical engineer. Everyone correctly describes that light of 2 specific wavelengths is shone through the finger. The amount of light absorbed by deoxy and oxygenated blood is different. The relationship between the amount of absorbance is measured and this provides the oxygen saturation levels.</p>
<p>However, the amount of light absorbance isn't directly related to the O2 level. Instead, there have been data tables created that relate the O2 levels to the light absorbance... this was done EMPIRICALLY, i.e. by experiment, and not by theory. So the device is just correlating the light information to pre-programmed data table relationships. The relationship breaks down somewhere around 80% and below, and thus the pulse oximeter can no longer properly measure oxygen levels below this percentage. Regardless, the device would have started beeping an alert by then anyway. </p>
<p>This is as I recall, please add any detAils if I missed any...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
