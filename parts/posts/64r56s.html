		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it only reacts to light, if it is visible, which can be dangerous to your eyes, if you are exposed to strong UV or infrared light sources.
E.g. people who blow hot glass without protection often get eye problems later in life, due to the infrared exposure. Their pupils don't contract, because in the visible light, the hot glass only has a faint orange glow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes- the photopigments in your eyes only exhibit receptor potentials when struck by visible light (or mechanical stimulation to some degree; this is why rubbing your eyes hard can make you see flashes or spots). These receptor potentials are relayed to bipolar cells which further enhance it for contrast (off-center and on-center cells do this). Then the bipolar cells synapse with ganglion cells, where the graded potentials finally become action potentials. They are sent to your thalamus first, then divided into optic radiations to the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe. </p>
<p>The pupillary contraction and dilation is an autonomic function: it is triggered by efferent neurons going to the eye muscles. That is why we use pupillary responses- direct and indirect- to gauge certain types of neurological problems. The action is a function of your autonomic nervous system, in other words, not a local response to light from the muscles themselves. Your central nervous system only receives the same information you do. You cannot see UV light, even subconsciously, so the pupils would not respond to it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Will a 100w 820nm IR LED floodlight damage your eyes? We use these a lot in security and I know a 100w visible light equivalent LED is like staring at the friggin sun. I do make an effort to not look at the LED when its powered but it happens. It has a dim red glow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope! There's lots of reasons the eye constricts and dilates. The most obvious reasons are light, but accommodation influences this response as well. </p>
<p>When we are reading a book, we are focusing on fine detail so our pupil constricts to filter out the unnecessary surrounding information. When we take in a scene, we want more information so our pupils dilate.</p>
<p>There are lots of arousal/cognitive effort reasons for pupil dilation as well (hard math problem, attractive person etc.). Pupil constriction has been shown for the perception of coherent motion as well.</p>
<p>These effects on the pupil are much much smaller than the pupillary light reflex (PLR), but they can be tested under controlled settings and reveal interesting things about how our vision isn't just a passive input, but affected by higher-order cognition and prior knowledge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lower spectrum light causes minimal pupil constriction. The main reason I used to keep a red light in the bathroom for those night time wakeups to urinate, the red light is easy on the eyes and the lack of pupil dilation also keeps your melatonin levels up making it easier to go back to bed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
