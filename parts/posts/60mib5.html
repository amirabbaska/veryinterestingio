It's all about them being able to ask you questions and observe your responses.  If you're awake with your eyes open they can tell if your pupils dilate properly or if your speech is slurred or if you're even aware of your surroundings.  These are all important tests to see how severe your concussion is.  Without that, the only option is a brainscan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Emergency doctor here (work in ED / A&amp;E /  ER depending on your locality). Just to add on a little to the previous answers which are mostly correct that, in short, it's not  actually important to keep someone awake after a head injury.</p>
<p>Everyone, especially children, can become quite sleepy after a good enough blow to the head. That, in itself, isn't a cause for concern. But we are looking at how rousable you are from that sleepiness amongst a list of other &quot;red flag&quot; symptoms and signs (such as vomiting or the more obviously neurological signs such as weakness or seizures).</p>
<p>If, after a couple of hours, your natural state is still to drift off to sleep shortly after being roused - you've just earned yourself a CT head to look for signs of a significant head injury (e.g., bleeds). But if you were so sleepy that it took a reasonable amount of painful stimulus to wake you up then there would be no waiting and you'd be getting scanned straight away.</p>
<p>So, again in summary, there's no benefit to remaining awake after a head injury - you won't suddenly drift in a coma because you wanted to rest your eyes for a moment... Instead, it's how easily you're woken or how long that sleepiness lasts for after the head injury that matters.</p>
<p>Edit: I need to address one of my bugbears (... where on earth does that phrase come from?) which is in the current top answer: Pupil reflexes. If you have uneven pupils due to the effects of a head injury <strong>you will not be conscious!</strong> The cause of unilateral dilated pupils, in the context of head injury, is due to there being a significant enough rise in intracranial pressure - due to the presence of blood within the head - that it causes a 3rd nerve palsy. The other softer signs of significant head injury will already be present long before you blow a pupil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From an EMS standpoint, we don't want you napping on us because we want to be able to monitor your mental state. If your mental state becomes altered (you have trouble speaking, you think you're the President, etc), it gives us an indication that something likely isn't okay in your noggin. When a patient's mental state changes in a bad way, that upgrades your transport to high priority (if it isn't already high). Since EMTs have a limited scope of practice (we don't really have many tools available due to our level of training/certification), and we often don't have the manpower to accurately monitor your vital signs while we're packaging and moving you, keeping you awake and talking allows us to maintain a general idea of how things are doing in your body until we can get you to definitive care (a hospital). It's just one of the tools that we have in our pretty tiny toolbox. Realize that this isn't specific to head injuries---I prefer all of my patients to stay awake for the whole transport. </p>
<p>As for what the doctors prefer in the ER, that's well outside of my swim lane.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Emergency medicine resident: most good points have been made, but there are some floridly incorrect points being spread here.</p>
<p>Immediately after the injury, I care if you passed out when you hit your head or have amnesia for the 30 minutes prior to the event. This helps me risk stratify who needs a CT scan and who doesn't. This isn't us being frugal; if you CT scan every comer who has minor head trauma, you will eventually cause a tumor.</p>
<p>En route, its good to keep assessing you to make sure your status hasn't changed. The classic presentation for an epidural hematoma (blood between the dura, a tight layer against the skull, and the skull) is a &quot;talk-die&quot; lesion; i.e. the patient briefly loses conciousnes, rouses and speaks, and then dies of rapid expansion.</p>
<p>Once you've been assessed and observed and diagnosed with a concussion (i.e. too low risk to need a CT scan) and sent home, there is no need at all to be woken up. I do not advise my patients to have someone wake them when they are sleeping. </p>
<p>I personally use the Canadian CT Head rule to stratify who needs a CT scan. Its been validated to rule out those scary bleeds, described above.</p>
<p>You should be given &quot;return to the ED&quot; instructions on discharge that cover red flag symptoms. These are usually vomiting more than 2 times, severe pain despite NSAID's, or confusion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical resident here: the major concern regarding head injuries is the potential presence for an epidural or subdural hematoma (a bleed above or under the dura mater that surrounds the brain). As we prefer not to perform a CT scan on every person who bumps his head, many people are sent home from the emergency department with instructions to have a family member wake the person every 1-4 hours to check his alertness and ability to orient to name, where he/she is, and what month it is. Any new confusion or increased difficulty waking a person up fully can indicate the presence of brain swelling or intracranial bleeds that may require neurosurgical intervention. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
