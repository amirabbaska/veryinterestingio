		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most outlets reporting news can't afford to have a presense around the world. So they have to get a lot of their coverage of global news from a few companies that have extensive global networks of reporters, such as Reuters and Associated Press.</p>
<p>As an example, for most of the year, your average newspaper doesn't need to have a reporter in Ethiopia or Tajikistan. But if something newsworthy happens there, they want to report it. So they'll get the story from Reuters reporter who's there and go from that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Note: I worked at AP.</p>
<p>As many people here posted, AP and Reuters are wire services, which distribute news stories for other people to publish (wire is the term for the distribution method). They've got a full staff of reporters in various locations around the world doing investigative journalism, but there's more to it than that.</p>
<p>One important thing to note is that the AP, as its name implies, is an association of press. It's not a for profit company, but actually a non profit collective owned by its member newspapers.</p>
<p>To be an AP member, there are different levels of involvement depending on your level of usage and the type of organization you are.</p>
<p>But, the most important kind of membership are with local news organizations. To be a member, you pay a significant fee (often in the millions of dollars). In exchange, you get access to all of the news reporting that the AP generates itself, but also access to the wire, or all of the local reporting provided by its member papers.</p>
<p>You, in turn, are expected to provide your own local coverage for distribution on the wire.</p>
<p>For example, if there's a bombing in Boston, a small town paper in Cleveland might not have a reporter in Boston, but they'll be able to pick up the coverage that the Boston Globe created without having to send a reporter of their own.</p>
<p>Then if something were to happen in Cleveland, for example a high school basketball player is getting attention from the NBA and is being talked about as a first round pick, that Cleveland paper would send its coverage of that on the wire so the other papers could use it.</p>
<p>Because the AP is a non profit focused on journalism, they don't have to worry about being motivated by money or only covering things that are profitable.</p>
<p>Happy to answer other questions if anyone has them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've already got enough basic information from others here, so I'll add to that.  This might be longer than you're after, but hopefully you'll find some of it useful.</p>
<p>For a more in-depth explanation, a good book to read about how news works today is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flat-Earth-News-Award-Winning-Distortion/dp/0099512688/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1441628575&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=flat+earth+news&amp;pebp=1441628580979&amp;perid=1CXBV0FJN33HY54D93YC" target="_blank">The Flat Earth News</a>.  I can't recommend this highly enough.  It speaks specifically of the context of journalism in the UK, but its lessons translate perfectly to what's happened in the US, and the book's aged well - it's only become more important since 2009.</p>
<p>Ultimately, many news outlets in the past relied on AP and Reuters because it was a great source of reportage for those parts of the world where it might not make sense to have your own reporters.</p>
<p>In the era when every almost major city had two or three major daily newspapers papers, and the US had three television networks, for these outlets (and many magazines) international news was often a &quot;prestige&quot; expense; it might not be a money maker for every newspaper, news magazine, and television network, but if you didn't have it, it would make your operation seem less serious to the public, and make your entire news operation seem less credible.</p>
<p>Today, AP and Reuters serve a different function.  Faced with competition from low-expense outlets on the web, and the diminishing power of the big three US television networks, running an international news department is just another expense in an industry which is suffering loss after loss.  Many cities are down to one daily paper, and some even less, with their newspaper of record not appearing every day.  Smaller towns which were served by multiple newspapers in the past are even more likely to see contraction.  Many of the US's major news magazines have long since ceased publication.</p>
<p>Many news outlets don't just source their international news from AP and Reuters, they source as much news as they can from any source they can get.  CGP Grey, someone best known for funny, brief explanatory YouTube videos, noted something I found very true in my own experience:  the closer you are to a particular subject of interest, the more you notice that news reportage on it is incredibly wrong.  This isn't limited to areas where one has a subjective opinion, such as politics, where if one is an extreme partisan for one major US party, everything someone of the other party says is automatically &quot;wrong&quot; or at least suspect.  This includes just basic day-to-day science, technology, human interest, current events, and gossip stories.  The basic facts are often wrong, the conclusions are often not sufficiently supported by the evidence, and they simply don't match what an &quot;insider&quot; to a particular field would agree properly describes the truth, even about non-controversial issues.</p>
<p>This is because most news outlets simply don't spend as much time and money on real investigative journalism as they used to.  Companies and lobby organizations are notorious for sending &quot;pre-written&quot; news stories and videos about products and issues to various outlets, who will cover them with no further investigation, and will sometimes re-write them so superficially that they'd fail a plagiarism review for a high school paper.  As far as the original authors of the pieces are concerned, this is fine, because they're not interested in getting credit for the piece, they're interested in getting information - usually quite biased - out there to the public.</p>
<p>Here's an example of someone debunking the sort of corporate press release disguised as news:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iEshd6izgk" target="_blank">EEVblog #751 - How To Debunk A Product (The Batteriser)</a>.  Admittedly, this guy knows his electronics, and he's not afraid of technical terminology, but the basic point stands is that most of the basic claims made by the makers of this product were easily testable by anyone with a modest budget to grab two identical battery-dependent gadgets and a handful of batteries.  They didn't, because outlets like PC World and others who carried this glorified advertisement need content, not a research project which requires time, editors, and a modest amount of money.</p>
<p>So, AP and Reuters benefit from the same sort of pressures that corporate press release distributors and lobbyist groups benefit from:</p>
<ul>
<li>shortened news cycle</li>
<li>reduced news budget</li>
<li>significantly reduced news budget for international news</li>
<li>less &quot;home competition&quot; (newspapers in the same city, news magazines, and TV channels by people with limited options) driving prestige expenses</li>
<li>drastically more outside competition (internet, internet, internet, people with many, many more TV and VOD options than ever before)</li>
<li>more of a focus on amount of content rather than quality</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't to say AP and Reuters aren't good news services; they're certainly better than the barrage of advertisement-as-copy I've referenced.  In a world where AP and Reuters are doing more and more of the international reportage for an increasing amount of English-speaking news outlets, however, this is problematic.  It limits the amount of opinions we hear.  Further, both Reuters and AP are largely defined by their desire to be as objective as possible, sticking only to facts.  They're never perfect at it, being fallible organizations run by fallible humans, but you often need in-depth reporting by people with an opinion and experience, and who can contextualize a situation in another country for a domestic audience who may not fully appreciate it.  AP and Reuters are also noted for their brevity, they were not traditionally intended for the job of replacing international news outlets' foreign correspondence, but rather supplementing them for more out of the way places (a polite way of saying &quot;less newsworthy to the US and the UK&quot;), or giving a gloss of international news to more local organizations which weren't equipped to provide it at all themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, journalist here!</p>
<p>Reuters is not a newspaper like CNN or the BBC. There are groups that we call various things. At my old papers we called them &quot;wire agencies&quot;. </p>
<p>Reuters hires mostly photographers, business experts, journalists, ect., but the real beauty is that they, along with other wire agencies like the Canadian Press and Associated Press, have a global dedicated network of freelancers that will buy anything newsworthy, if there's a demand for it. </p>
<p>The way Reuters works is that they constantly have a stream of incoming material through what we call the wire, really whenever I used the Canadian Press it was just a website. You can get photos, press releases, anything you want through them. If something important is happening and there's a demand for certain information, they'll let the people in their mailing list know: &quot;Reuters is looking for this&quot;. </p>
<p>Media outlets like CNN/BBC/CBC whatever can then access this information and &quot;borrow&quot; it (not free, of course). Reuters, in the eyes of the people who use it, sort of works like a really efficient freelancer. </p>
<p>Now, why use them? Because of their connections, networking prowess, and speed. And because it's cheaper to pay Reuters then it is to fly one of your own guys out to the middle of nowhere. </p>
<p>And the final reason is because Reuters has created a standard of quality for themselves that cannot be beaten. Reuters, especially their business and foreign politics side, are the absolute best in the business. </p>
<p>These Wire Agencies also don't actually cost that much to operate, since they use so many free-lancers. In fact, I can't speak for Reuters, but the Canadian Press headquarters is a 1-floor office with a staff of less than 30 people. At least, that's about how many I saw when I toured there a few years ago. </p>
<p>EDIT: Sorry, I forgot to mention, the language barrier is one of the best reasons why Reuters, the CP and the AP are so often cited. You see, your news paper may have a staff of 100 people but if some shit happens in Taiwan and nobody speaks Taiwanese, your paper will be screwed out of that story; unless someone who works for Reuters in Taiwan writes the story and translates it to English for you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every newspaper/radio- or TV-station uses the service of press agencies like Reuters, AP and a couple of others (AFP is based in France, dpa in Germany, etc...) and you pay a certain fee to use their reports for your stories.
Then you usually rewrite the thing/throw in a few of your own sources/ do some more research / mix the information from several press agencies.</p>
<p>The reason the media does that is that your local newspaper can't afford a huge network of correspondents around the world (especially in more remote places) but they still want to inform you about the stuff that happens there.</p>
<p>And there's nothing super special about Reuters - there are just one of the big players in the press agency game and have a network of reporters around the whole world, so they can cover almost everything.</p>
<p>(My workplace has decided recently to Reuters because my boss thinks they are not fast enough compared to the others...I kinda miss Reuters - especially their pictures are usually good and they really cover almost everything)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
