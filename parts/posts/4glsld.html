People get very deep wounds sometimes, but they eventually heal almost completely (you regain most of the functionality, but may loose you chance for the olympics), yet when you lose, say, the tip of your finger, you know it won't grow back.<br />
Is there a point between losing something for good and it regenerating where you can draw the line?  </p>
