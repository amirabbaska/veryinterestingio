People get very deep wounds sometimes, but they eventually heal almost completely (you regain most of the functionality, but may loose you chance for the olympics), yet when you lose, say, the tip of your finger, you know it won't grow back.<br />
Is there a point between losing something for good and it regenerating where you can draw the line?  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The line is how much (edit: <em>fresh, nutrient-filled</em>) blood can get to the injured area.</p>
<p>When you experience an injury, your body does everything it can to close the hole -- including replace functional tissue with scar tissue (this is called fibrosis). A small cut can be healed easily since both halves generally stick back together and there's plenty of vasculature (blood vessels) to supply nutrients and other important building blocks. A large  or deep cut, however, often repairs with scar tissue since blood can't quickly start to work on the fully damaged space. Special cells in your blood start to fill the space with collagen fibers, which don't support vasculature very well (but can be bridged across gaps in tissue to make it whole again).</p>
<p>Also, the human body can't regenerate lost tissue. If you section your kidney, half of it won't grow back. When we take out veins from the leg for CABGs (edit: coronary artery bypass graft; thanks for pointing out my fallback to work language /u/turbohonky), the vein is gone from the leg forever. The only exception is the liver, which experiences extremely limited regeneration.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I simplified my explanation a little bit; allow me to elaborate a little.</p>
<p>Each discrete section of the body arises developmentally from its own section of stem cell tissue while you're an embryo. Without those stem cells, you can't regenerate an entire organ or limb. The nail bed has special cells responsible for inhibiting fibrosis, as well as a surprising concentration of stem cells, so fingertips can regenerate. The liver is also capable of producing its own stem cells necessary for regeneration of lost liver tissue. (THIS IS ALSO AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION, WHICH ONLY INCLUDES THE SPECIAL CASE OF REGENERATION AND NOT THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENTAL CYCLE OF ORGAN GROWTH.)</p>
<p>Outside that, human body parts can't really regenerate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a first joint almost full amputation of my middle digit finger (basically cut off my finger to right below the cuticle). I had to have a snip of finger bone trimmed that was approximately 1/8th inch long. </p>
<p>The surgeon I had to repair it was fresh out of medical school, and told me the tip of my finger had the potential to regrow due to recent studies of cuticle tissue. </p>
<p>It's been 4 years and although my finger doesn't look perfectly normal, I have gained at least a 1/4 inch and re-grew a fingernail.</p>
<p>The body regenerates some, atleast on your fingertips! </p>

<p>This only talks about children, but I was 24 when I slammed my finger in a truck door. I don't believe it's limited by age. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I smooshed my finger two years ago. Just the tip</p>
<p>Entire nail bed ripped out. Glued back on as a bio bandage.
Grew back.</p>
<p>Bone intact until halfway between knuckle and finger tip, from there to the tip it shattered into about 40 pieces, most of which were flushed out of the wound . it appears to have grown back.</p>
<p>Skin was split like a peeled banana 3 ways. Stitched back together but they had to layer the seams. Super sensitive for a year. Was like having another penis. Got circumcised, now cant feel the love. </p>
<p>Looks normal functions fine</p>
<p>Edit: it is not as ugly as I remember. But nsfts</p>

<p>In the top one you can see the whole nail is removed from the nail bed. </p>
<p>Bottom pic is post stitching but before gluing the nail on.</p>

<p>I couldn't take bandage off for a month ? Maybe, so the best shots never got taken.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can field a small part of this question from experience! Just had a skin graft on the inner calf of my leg, taken from a split-thickness graft from my outer thigh. I was in the burn ward for a month.</p>
<p>so basically i had pretty substantial damage, but none of it got to the bone, so they put a wound vac on it, which is literally an airtight seal with a vacuum tube applied to it to apply constant negative pressure to the area and suck out any fluids or gross stuff at the same time- this increases blood flow to the area to allow for a certain &quot;type&quot; of tissue called &quot;granulation tissue&quot; to grow. think of granulation tissue as sort of like good soil for planting a crop. if you don't have good soil, the crops will fail. likewise if you don't have a good tissue &quot;bed&quot; to graft on a skin graft, the graft will fail (as in not adhere and heal correctly, rot and fall off, etc). so basically they slapped me with a wound vac for a weekish and then did the graft, then applied the wound vac for another weekish and i was good to go after that. honestly what hurt the most was the split-thickness graft donor area post-surgery, man that hurt like fuckin' crazy, they couldn't GIVE me enough dilaudid through the little button-pressy thing to stave that pain off. i was worried at first that i'd have to uncomfortably use the bed pan to take a dump because i was positive i wasn't going to be able to get out of bed.</p>
<p>anyways the main concern was there was an area that was very close to the bone, and basically in that area it was deemed likely that the graft would fail there. and it basically did, it didn't heal right and is very thin compared to the rest of the graft which is pretty healthy looking now. so once it gets to the bone, it doesn't like growing back. if you let a wound become chronic (ie open all the time and not healing due to size, health, mistreatment of area, etc) oftentimes it does not regenerate correctly either, hence the need for grafts and whatnot.</p>
<p>so that's my non-scientific but known-from-recent experience thoughts on the matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
