		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several possible reasons combine. One way is to think of it as inertia - it's harder to fall asleep and to wake up than it is to maintain the status quo. Similarly it's harder for your body to modulate the energy flow appropriately than to just expend the excess energy with fidgets.</p>
<p>Plus, if you've ever sat still for so long that your butt falls asleep you know that being sedimentary for too long can have negative consequences - if your body is in motion just slightly you avoid such distractions. This would be why we even roll around and adjust our positions while asleep.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many people have ADHD tendencies* where the brain demands quick and dumb stimulation constantly. Fidget toys were originally aimed at giving people some stimulation of this type so that their brains wouldn't get bored of pursuing the long-term investment of deep concentration. And it works - your brain thinks it's being entertained by the thing you're concentrating on while some of the satisfaction is secretly coming from the fidgeting your body is doing in parallel.</p>
<p>*^(not to be confused with an actual ADHD diagnosis, just lesser traits which if taken to the extreme would qualify for ADHD, such as restlessness.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The back integrative cortex ( the reflection part of your brain, ) Is really close (in location) to your sensory cortex (eyes, body, ears) , and when you're in &quot;deep concentration&quot; your brain is communicating back and forth between the front and back integrative cortex. Fun fact: these are really slow processes- (they're not mylanated and there's literally more neurons//  it can take a long time to contemplate and think compared to how long it takes you to say something/do something) Some people pace back and forth, tap their foot, chew their tongue/Mumble- other sensory/motor functions- super common.</p>
<p>Tldr : you're accessing more of your brain's &quot;think-power&quot; lol</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A major chemical in the focus circuit is dopamine. Dopamine is released for two competing reasons (to simplify): looking forward to things, and experiencing new things. The first part motivates action and thought to chase the objects or our dreams, the second leads to learning new information which improves the quality of our dreams. </p>
<p>One perspective is that if you are understimulated in one area, the other area will compensate. Bored at work? Start daydreaming about exciting things. Doing a repetitive activity? Start focusing on little unexpected things around you (think ADHD). Point is, one way we can we can work around this is to do a mildly stimulating activity, which can paradoxically allow us to focus by keeping our mind from subconsciously seeking out the simulation it's missing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could remember back to basic human development! </p>
<p>Remember when you were an infant and you spent the first year testing and experiencing new things by chewing on them? </p>
<p>Your first thoughts are while chewing on things or holding them in your hand.</p>
<p>Human development tells us that the first senses children learn to deal with are sight and hearing. This is to create a sense of belonging in the world and anchor the mind to society. It also allows the infant/child to differentiate danger from safe.</p>
<p>Then Freud says there is an oral stage where children begin to experience the world through biting, chewing, tasting. </p>
<p>The next is motor-sensory mastery where you begin to learn to use your extremities: legs/arms and hands/feet. Watch an 18 month-24 month toddler bustle around and grab things. They'll then put them in their mouth. </p>
<p>And whenever you later as an adult are trying to &quot;understand&quot; something, you are actually recalling behavior from infancy where you would &quot;chew&quot; or &quot;grab&quot; something to understand it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
