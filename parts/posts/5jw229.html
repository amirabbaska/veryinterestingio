		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human eye response is most sensitive in the green, peaking around 555nm.  If these hypothetical colored dots were all of the same intensity, a green dot would appear the brightest. Not sure how perceived brightness affects tracking, hopefully somebody with knowledge in that area can weigh in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>a dark dot on a bright background or a bright dot on a dark background; the part of the visual system that senses achromatic contrasts is faster than the part that senses chromatic contrasts.</p>
<p>ultimately the bright dot would be easier to follow if you wanted to go to the limit of &quot;dot&quot; - an infinitesimally small black dot on a bright background would be invisible while an infinitesimally small bright dot on a dark background would still be visible (if bright enough - think stars).</p>
<p><em>edit since</em></p>
<p>To get a little more specific since people are reading this: what i was referring to in this comment (&quot;sensing achromatic contrasts is faster&quot;) is the general distinction in the early visual system between the <em>magnocellular</em> and <em>parvocellular</em> pathways. The magnocellular pathway mainly transmits information about brightness contrast and motion, while the parvocellular pathway mainly transmits information about color contrast and spatial pattern. Of course nothing is <em>really</em> that simple in the visual system, but it's a useful way of talking about certain functional/physiological distinctions in the brain.</p>
<p>The root of the magno system is in retinal cells that pool inputs over all types of cones (mostly L+M cones); the root of the parvo system is in retinal cells that pool over specific types of cones antagonistically (e.g. L vs M or [L+M] vs S). Because the former (magno cells) are pooling broadly they are very sensitive to slight changes in stimulus (i.e. motion cues), but they are not great at picking up fine detail or distinguishing one type of cone from another.</p>
<p>So, motion perception relies mostly on brightness contrast, i.e. edges or features that are distinguished by variance in their luminance intensity across space and time. <em>Chromatic contrast</em> ('color' contrast) is a very very poor input to the motion perception system - if you remove all brightness cues from a video, you will have enormous difficulty making sense of what little motion you can see.</p>
<p>Usually, in nature, chromatic and brightness contrasts are strongly correlated, i.e. where you find one you find the other, but with unnatural stimuli (i.e. experimental conditions) these powerful differences can be brought out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human eye has best dynamic range in green wavelengths. However the eye is best able to track colors that has lots of contrast. So whatever color your environment will be, say green the best color that will standout is magenta. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I went through art school we had an exercise where when looking  at a particular art work we would blur our vision while looking at the piece. This helps enable you to pick out the most prominent color/feature on the work. It's an easy experiment to determine the focus of the the work in question. Not sure if this helps but it is useful while breaking down things like works of art, advertisements, and things of that nature. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
