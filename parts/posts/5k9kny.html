		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the conceptual models that adequately explains a fair few things about our brains' behaviours is the linked data model.</p>
<p>Each piece of data is linked to other pieces of data, like sights, or smells, or people you were with, or things you were also thinking about when you learned that thing, or previous times thinking about the thing.</p>
<p>And links degrade and become overwritten with time. More like a half-life thing than a 'in precisely 3 years and 47 seconds I will forget this thing'. </p>
<p>If <em>every</em> piece of data can form links like that, then so can meta-thoughts. Like, &quot;the plot of this movie is linked to the title of this movie&quot;. And perhaps, at one point, it was. You know a link was there. You know that if you hear the title, it'll feel right in an inexplicable way. But damnit <em>what was the name of it</em>?</p>
<p>Conceptually, this model also explains why we can sometimes remember stuff like this by looking for more related information. Lead actors names? Director? Where you first saw it? All things that also might have links to the movie title, and the links might still exist. </p>
<p>Some people express that they remember looking at the book cover, or title screen, or cd case or whatever, but not being able to remember what it said. </p>
<p>But that's just a conceptual model, and was not constructed with any physical properties of the brain in mind. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the brain as a computer's hard drive, only a little bit more chaotic. When you try to remember something, you give your brain search parameters and returns the closest matches, then you figure out which one it is that you're looking for manually.</p>
<p>When something is on the tip of your tongue, it's either because the search parameters were too broad, because what you're trying to find is more difficult to access than usual and the search results are all of the more easily accessible files that fit the parameters given, or because the data are corrupted.</p>
<p>This is my understanding of it as a layman. I do not have any expertise or formal education in the field, so take it with a grain of salt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The problem is you are struggling to retrieve this information thats why if someones offers you a retrieval cue it will be easy to remember what was on the tip of your tongue</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
