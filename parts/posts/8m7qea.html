		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laser printers and photocopiers don't work under the same principle as an inkjet printer. When you make a photocopy, the first step is to give an electrostatic charge to a special cylinder. That cylinder is coated with a material that becomes conductive when exposed to light. When the document is being scanned, a strong source of light shines on the paper and reflects on the rotating cylinder. The parts being hit by light (i.e. what is aligned with white on the original document) become conductive and allows the electrostatic charge to be grounded and discharge. What you are left with at the end of this process is a cylinder with an electrostatic charge only on areas that correspond to the dark areas on the document. The charge then picks up toner and rolls on a blank piece of paper with a heating element, which essentially melts the toner and makes it adhere to the paper. The paper then comes out of the photocopier with an approximate copy of the original document.</p>
<p>Of course, modern photocopiers and laser printers will digitize the original document and then use that digitized copy as the master to apply the charge on the cylinder and make a better copy with a single scan instead of having to pass on the original for each copy, but the core principle remains the same.</p>
<p>Long story short, the paper coming out is warm because a heating element is required to make the toner stick to the paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photocopiers and laser printers work by applying a layer of dry toner to the page which is held in place by a static charge. The toner is then cooked onto the page using a heated roller (around 220c from memory). This is why the page is hot.</p>
<p>Inkjet printers just spray wet ink onto the page which dries naturally. No heat required.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, a laser printer or copier is heat-setting the ink on to the page.  It's literally baking the sheet before it spits it out.</p>
<p>The laser part of laser printing isn't actually the source of the heat, though.  The laser is used to electrostatically charge the areas to be printed, then finely powdered ink (toner) is attracted to those areas.  It's the next step - the finisher - where the sheet is put under intense heat to fuse the toner permanently to the paper.</p>
<p>Inkjet printers are pretty much exactly what it says on the tin.  Extremely tiny droplets of ink are sprayed out of the print head, on to the sheet.  Think the world's smallest, most precise spray paint.</p>
<p>Some types of inkjets do use tiny heaters as part of the process, but they're only there to spray the ink and aren't nearly powerful enough to heat things up like a laser printer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Copiers and laser printers both use the same technology to print.  Both use toner which is basically powdered plastic that is melted onto the page.  Whereas, inkjet printers use liquid ink that is sprayed onto the page... no melting required.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laser printers use “dry” Xerographic process originally invented by Chester Carlson in the 1930’s. Haloid/Xerox commercialized it in the early 60’s but it used light and analog optics. Gary Starkweather of Xerox developed the laser printer in late 60’s. </p>
<p>All I know about ink jets is how to change the cartridges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
