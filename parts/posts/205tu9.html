Top box is the starting number, circle is the arc on the numberline, bottom box the sum.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Woah woah, guys, calm down! This is a number line! Replace 13 with x, &quot;02&quot; with x, &quot;03&quot; and &quot;05&quot; with y and z, and you have a super simple algebra problem. Sorta.</p>
<p><strong>Now, why do this, you're probably wondering!</strong> <strong>That's a good question and I <em>think</em> I may have a good answer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This <em>might</em> be trying to teach kids how to think with algebra earlier than they would previously</strong>, which would be pretty awesome to accomplish! Preschoolers can do algebra, after all! <a href="http://esciencenews.com/articles/2014/03/08/are.you.smarter.a.5.year.old.preschoolers.can.do.algebra" target="_blank">Seriously, they can.</a></p>
<p>Well, they can if you present the problem in a way they can understand.</p>
<p>That's the issue, here: presentation. The core idea (if my guess is right) is actually very clever! If you teach first graders the idea that &quot;x&quot; can &quot;hide&quot; a number, they'll probably have an easier time understanding algebra! </p>
<p>However, the problem is being presented in a way which could be extremely confusing. &quot;Hiding&quot; a number with another number is a tricky idea to get used to. Well, it could be for us, anyway. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that the same could be said for &quot;hiding&quot; numbers with letters. Imagine if you've never seen a letter used with math before. It would seem so out of place, and so confusing, and why would there be a letter for math, when letters are for spelling and words? Why is there a letter with numbers?</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be easier to understand the idea of hiding numbers without having to overcome this hurdle as well? </p>
<p>Well, that's where using something like &quot;01&quot; starts to make sense. &quot;01&quot; is easily differentiated from being the same as &quot;1&quot;; there's a zero in front of it! When I, as a first-grader, see &quot;01&quot;, I can think to myself, &quot;That's where the first number is hiding!&quot;. </p>
<p>Honestly, if they didn't further complicate things by referring to 13 as &quot;02&quot;, this seems like it would be a really solid way to introduce the idea of representing an unknown number with a variable. </p>
<p>Anyways, I hope that the logic behind this representation starts to make a bit more sense! I'm not sure why the flying fuck they took the idea one step further, but if they didn't, <em>then</em> there's a good deal of logic behind it. The entire representation seems confusing to us, but don't assume that your thought process and understanding of the world (and maths) is the same as a first-grader. :)</p>
<p>Oh, and also don't assume that the students were thrown into this homework kicking and screaming. If the teacher isn't a complete asshat, he/she probably is giving this homework in relation to what the kids are actually on track for being taught. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
