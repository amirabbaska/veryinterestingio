		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there are cells called melanocytes that provide pigment/coloration to our skin and hair in the upper layer of our skin. A mole (or nevus, if we’re getting fancy) is actually considered a “benign tumor” of those melanocytes. ‘Tumor’ just means an abnormal, excessive growth of cells (not cancer!), so essentially, some of your melanocytes had some funky things happen with their DNA (damage, random mutation, etc) that caused them to grow more in clusters as opposed to spread out across your skin. The reason that you’re told to check the size, borders, color, etc of moles is because benign moles and potential melanomas can look very different!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So to understand this, it's best to understand skin pigmentation a little. Your skin is colored by special cells called melanocytes (derived from the neural crest in embryos) that are distributed in the basal layer of the epidermis (the bottom portion in the top-most layer of skin). </p>
<p>These cells are distributed throughout that layer and secrete melanin pigment in little bubbles called melanosomes, that are then passed to keratinocytes (the cells that make up your skin). Keratinocytes take it up and that's what gives people a nice smooth distribution of skin tone in most cases. Think of it as little brown umbrella factories every other block that makes boxes of brown umbrellas and sends them to every person who lives on each block. When it rains and everyone opens their umbrella, the whole city looks brown from above. </p>
<p>A mole is basically a group of melanocytes that have started to replicate and divide rapidly and thus they are considered a &quot;neoplasm&quot;, but they're not cancerous as the growth isn't out of control. Think of having 5 umbrella factories on a single street. A freckle on the other hand is simply a group of melanosomes (that pigment bubble I was talking about earlier) concentrating together in a specific location. Lets say a bunch of packages get rerouted and all end up at the same house. </p>
<p>Interestingly although melanoma can develop from existing moles, it rarely does. Most melanoma actually arises de novo, or spontaneously on normal appearing skin. It's important if you are concerned about a mole or any skin lesion, to go to a properly certified dermatologist or dermatological surgeon, as they're trained to look for many aspects of  moles that go beyond what we've mentioned, such as layer of the skin it's in, how it's growing, what to look for in metastatic (cancerous) change, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's suggested that many proteins that are commonly known to promote cancer, such as BRAF, HRAS, etc. can become overly activated in melanocytes. However, the moles are kept in check by tumor suppressor proteins such as p15 or p16 (CDKN2a or b), so the moles stay benign. However, DNA damage that mutates or deletes these tumor suppressors could result in a benign growth becoming malignant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have had moles since before teens. I am nearly 50 now and have had about 20 removed. One was Melanoma. The others mostly carcinoma.
It is important to get regular checks done, preferably by a different doctor each 6 months.
I have bought a cheap-ish USB microscope and have been taking photos of my moles since 2000-ish. ( with a digital camera before I had the microscope ) and the doctors can compare them over the years for change. This is what picked up the melanoma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cells that are genetically mutated in a way that causes them to no longer die off and be replaced. they are immortal. They refuse to die. They are vampire cells. I don't know why this causes them to be colored differently than other cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
