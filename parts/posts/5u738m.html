They will also leave the battery with a very small amount of charge when the phone dies to prolong the battery life and keep the internal clock going too.</p>
<p>Basically, lithium batteries would overheat when left plugged in, which would cause damage to the battery over time.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You charge a battery by forcing electricity through it backwards. So if you have a 12-volt car battery the alternater and charger and such can put up to 18 volts across the terminals. That extra 6 volts forces the electrons to go in the &quot;electrons come out here&quot; side of the battery.</p>
<p>Batteries work through chemistry. You take some stuff (usually metal) and make a sandwich of the stuff around some other stuff (usually some acid or alkali). The middle stuff dissolves the metals releasing electrons and pushing them one way or another.</p>
<p>So your car battery is a lead-acid battery, and your flashlight takes D-cells that used to be carbon/acid, but are now (something I don't remember)/alkaline. So that's what an &quot;alkaline battery&quot; is.</p>
<p>So some batteries, like lead-acid, are easy to charge because the chemestry is really easy to reverse. Other batteries are just about impossible to charge because it's like trying to un-burn a log. This second type is the normal batteries and alkaline batteries you buy from the store. They just aren't <em>safely</em> rechargeable.</p>
<p>Why? They tend to catch fire and explode, or when you run the electricity through them backwards they don't produce the same chemicals they were built with.</p>
<p>So we've always had the big rechargable lead/acid batteries. But making little ones has required a lot of development.</p>
<p>There are different bad things things that can happen when you recharge a battery...</p>
<p>For example the metal in the metal sandwich can fall apart from being repeatedly changed and changed back. This is why car batteries go bad. The lead flakes off and eventually the flakes form a conductor from the two sides of the sandwich and that fraction of the battery becomes useless. The typical 12 volt car battery has six sandwiches so when you lose a cell it's now a 10 volt battery. Lose another and it's an 8 volt battery and that's not enough to do the job.</p>
<p>The battery can get hot and literally &quot;cook&quot;. So the modern lithium-ion batteries have little thermostats in them and as you charge them they get warm, and the warmer they get the less electricity they can stand to take, so the thermostat slows down the charging by slowing down the current. That's part of why your &quot;quick charger&quot; for your phone will, on an empty battery, charge to 80% real fast and then take longer and longer to get to 100%. It got warm as fast as it got charged and so it can't charge to full without slowing down.</p>
<p>Finally there's that whole thing where batteries &quot;get memory&quot;. This is not what's happening. As you charge and discharge some kinds of batteries they get pits and cook into new chemicals &quot;fractionally&quot; So every time you recharged the old batteries you &quot;used up&quot; a little of teh metal or the acid/alkali. With some of the material used up, the total amount of available stuff to make electriciy was reduced and the batteries lost their &quot;capacity to hold a charge.&quot; People called this &quot;memory&quot; because it was easier. But in truth you were more likely to ruin a battery by &quot;topping it off&quot; than you were likely to ruin it by charging a nearly dead battery. So it <em>seemed</em> like frequent short charges were &quot;remembered&quot;. But, no..</p>
<p>So finally, what is over charging.</p>
<p>Each sandwich inside any battery has a limit to how much electricity it can store. If you reach that limit and <em>persist</em> in forcing electricity through it backwards then it <em>can't</em> save any of that electricity as chemicals. So it <em>cooks</em>. Heat is generated and the good chemicals may bake or burn.</p>
<p>For instance, as your car battery dies the headlights visibly dim. This is because the 12 volts becomes 11, then 10, then 9 (and so on) as you use up the stored energy. And as you charge the 9 become 10 then 11 and 12. (the actual peak number is something like 13 volts for a car battery, but let's stick with 12.)</p>
<p>The charge/voltage regulator in your car stops charging the battery when the target 12 volts is reached because after that it's just doing damage. But if you've ever had a junker car that &quot;Eats Batteries&quot; you know it was really that your voltage regulator went bad. It wen't bad by being unable to stop the &quot;overcharging&quot;.</p>
<p>Now over time, because of different battery materials <em>and</em> by the proliferation of <em>better</em> electronics, the whole &quot;overcharging&quot; thing has largely gone away. We simply got better at the whole task from every angle.</p>
<p>But we still hear of whole phones (by part number) that are &quot;prone to explode&quot;. This happens when the phone in question, or the battery pack itself, has a design fault or was built with inferior parts. The bad design, or bad parts, lets the battery take in, or give out, too much electricity too fast. It gets hot. It get's unstable. And then it goes &quot;boom&quot;.</p>
<p>That's overcharging in a nutshell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern device batteries have their own internal logic to control the input and the output of power. They come programmed with a safe range of charge and would not let you charge beyond an upper limit or discharge below a lower limit.</p>
<p>Therefore you cannot overcharge your battery unless you're using a device from the 90's with those ancient nickel-cadmium chemistry.</p>
<p>The worst enemy of your battery is heat. This is what slowly chips away its efficiency. Unfortunately heat is a byproduct of both charging and discharging process, therefore there isn't much you can do to improve your battery life (apart from not using it, that is).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What batteries are you talking about? Phones nowadays are generally smart enough to disconnect the charger voltage from the battery when the battery is charged.</p>
<p>Rechargeable batteries generally convert electrical energy to chemical energy and back again, as needed. They do this best under specific conditions, over a limited range of temperature, for example. Li-ion batteries like in our phones are most efficient when charged between 50% and 80%. They do this through reversible electrochemical reactions. If you discharge them to 0% and charge them back to 100%, often some measure of irreversible chemical reaction occurs.</p>
<p>If you want a specific explanation of the irreversible chemical reaction, can you provide a specific battery or application for the inquiry?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have pointed out on this thread, you can't actually overcharge the battery above 100% with a modern device by leaving it plugged in. Leaving it plugged in does, however, have the potential to wear the battery. The reason for this is that the phone is still running on the battery, and basically topping itself off every few min. Since the most destructive parts of the charge cycle are the very bottom (20%-0%) and the very top (80%+) you are cycling the battery at the worst part over and over. If you got an app that let you limit the max charge to 60%, the effect would be negligible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
