		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. It does dilute the acid a bit, but your stomach recognizes that the pH went up and produces more gastric acid. See <a href="https://www.scienceabc.com/humans/is-your-stomach-acid-gastric-acid-diluted-when-you-drink-water.html" target="_blank">https://www.scienceabc.com/humans/is-your-stomach-acid-gastric-acid-diluted-when-you-drink-water.html</a> for a good simple example. </p>
<p>Also, while the acidic environment is helpful for digestion, a lot more is accomplished by the mechanical action of the stomach (basically it squished the food) and the action of pepsin, an enzyme that breaks down proteins.  Pepsin needs an acidic environment to be produced. </p>
<p>The vagus nerve (also one of the hiccup-related nerves, if youâ€™ve heard of it there) stimulates pepsin (precursor) and HCl production.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you drink too much for the meal you'll just wind up with the water exiting your stomach with a bit of stomach acid early, it'll have a short term effect, but it won't affect your meal considerably.</p>
<p>Your stomach knows how much you ate(because it swell according to it's contents) and the rough acidity of it's contents(how fast the food is breaking down) and as a result produces as much acid as it needs.<br />
If the food is breaking down because the acid is diluted you'll just wind up with more acid produced to counter act the diluting effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do not know this for sure, but I do know that very strong acids and bases can have very high buffering capacity, such that it would take A LOT of water to change the pH even a little bit. </p>
<p>My guess is that stomach acid would require more water than you can fit in your stomach to change the pH enough to affect function. </p>
<p>Let's see what others say. I'm answering based on my knowledge of what it takes to dilute industrial chemicals from concentrate to use strength. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
