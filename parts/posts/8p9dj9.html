		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Forget about temperature for the first part.
Water is made of molecules. Molecules in liquid water are relatively free to move, but they are still slightly attached to other molecules, so they don't &quot;escape&quot;. When water becomes a gas, the molecules escape.</p>
<p>If we increase pressure, we constrain the motion of these molecules. Water at higher pressure needs more temperature to boil, because we don't let the molecules escape freely.</p>
<p>The second part, temperature. Pressure alone does not increase temperature. It's necessary to compress something (change its volume) to introduce energy (which, in part, increases temperature). Liquids have a hard time changing its volume, so it's very difficult to change their temperature by compressing them.</p>
<p>Finally, water at the bottom of the ocean is cold not because of the pressure, but because cold water is denser than hot water, so it sinks. In equilibrium, water at the bottom is colder than water at the top.</p>
<p>Edit: Remember, PV=nRT only works for ideal gases. Water is not an ideal gas, especially liquid water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two problems here: </p>
<p>1) high pressure makes water boil at a <em>higher</em> temperature, so it would need to be heated even more than usual to boil.</p>
<p>2) Static high pressure doesn't to heat up (compressing a low pressure liquid of gas to higher pressure will heat it up though), the water deep down very cold! And even if it did heat up, the warm water would rise and be replaced by cold heavy water, it would not remain there until it heated up enough to boil.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Like high pressure areas on land equals higher temperatures) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>High pressure areas on land are caused by the sun heating it up, so it requires more volume, pressure is increased while it's expanding to more volume. So you have reversed the cause and effect in your reasoning. The high pressure is caused by the heat, not the heat caused by the high pressure</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The premise to the question is wrong, extreme pressure pushes things together gases turn into liquids (inside of aerosol can) and liquids turn into solids.</p>
<p>You get the impression that the pressure makes thing boil but it is actually the heat that makes things boil and creates pressure.</p>
<p>That being said, the real question is why doesn't water at the bottom of the ocean compresses so much that it freezes. That is one of the many things that makes water so special. Ever notice how ice floats on top of water, that is because water is one of the verry few things that exist that are denser as a liquid (because of the shape of the molecule). So, under extreme pressure water compresses to its maximum which, uniquely for water, puts it at around 4C which is just above freezing. </p>
<p>You can also observe this when you put water in the freezer and it expands, if you had a verry tight and verry strong container that didn't allow the water to expand in the freezer, it would never freeze. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
