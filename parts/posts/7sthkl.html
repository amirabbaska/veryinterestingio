		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Edited to correct stuff.</strong></p>
<p>Many trees can live for an exceptionally long time. The oldest known trees are over 5,000 years old. </p>
<p>Trees are an interesting case because, as they grow older, they also grow <em>faster</em>. This basically means that the older they get, they’re simply more and more likely to die of a disease or other event. Also, when a tree gets old, it has trouble protecting most of its inner heartwood and/or exterior. This means it cannot fight damage as well as when it was younger. </p>
<p>The most common way a tree would die of “old age” would be through this process: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Woody plants heal through by compartmentalizing the damage, sealing it off from the rest of the plant. This is called CODIT. This process happens in four steps, called “walls“. The process happens like this:</p>
<p>Wall 1: The tree blocks the transport tubes surrounding the wound, thereby preventing the wound/infection from spreading further.</p>
<p>Wall 2: The tree then builds a ring around the wound or infection to prevent it from spreading inward. This acts as a barrier providing further protection.</p>
<p>Wall 3: The tree then sections the wound laterally. This prevents the infection or wound from spreading circularly, keeping it from spreading left or right.</p>
<p>Wall 4: As the trunk grows, the tree’s new growth rings seal off the infection or wound. This prevents it from spreading outward into the new growth.</p>
<p>When a tree gets extremely old, it begins to lose this ability to compartmentalize and eventually causes the tree to die. Trees that still have leaves on them but their trunks are completely hollow is an example of wall 4 beginning to fail. Unless the wall 4 step has succeeded just in the nick of time, the tree will soon die. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully this makes sense? It might not be exactly what you were hoping for. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trees are kind of special in that the living portion of the tree is a thin layer between the wood and the bark. As with all living things, cell damage can be mitigated by reproducing faster than the damage occurs; this thin layer keeps reproducing and so doesn't age. That said, eventually rot sets in and the tree is attacked from the inside by disease and insects; the tree itself ages.</p>
<p>Some of the longest living trees are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_longaeva" target="_blank">bristlecone pines</a>, with one specimen over 5000 years old. They grow in an arid wind-blasted place, not a nice environment but it does minimize some of the age-related problems. There's also a much older tree, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_(tree\)" target="_blank">colony of clones of a quaking aspen</a>, that is about 80,000 years old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That depends on the species. The fast-growing trees that first grow after a flood tore the riverbank off or a mudslide cleared a hillside of vegetation aren't very sturdy. Poplar or alder live at the most 200 years before they break apart under their own weight. Untended willows collapse like that too (pruning them helps). </p>
<p>The pioneer trees all easily grow out again from bits of root, fallen trunks, and even just branches on the ground, so in theory you could keep on cultivating the same genetic composition of an individual tree eternally. In practice once the trees fall, they've prepared the ground for other, more durable species that overgrow the area. </p>
<p>It gets interesting when you try to define what the &quot;tree&quot; is. There are root systems that have survived millennia. The trunks die off, rot, but from the same, vast root system grow young ones again. While some trees actually survive trunk and all for millennia, but won't survive if chopped down. Two very different forms of resilience.</p>
<p>In the end, life is never &quot;perfect&quot;. Even the oldest tree clinging to a cliff side will die when the cliff erodes around it, or it gets hit by lightning, or the weather changes enough that its adaptations no longer fit, or wildfire, or some idiot human kills it... There's always something that makes an end to theoretical immortality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trees, like everything else, have a lifespan called telomeres. These are small parts of ’useless’ DNA in the end of chromosomes, and they get smaller every time a cell divides. When the telomere ends, cell divisions will start shortening the chromosomes themselves, which will inevitably cause apoptosis and cell death. </p>
<p>However, there is an enzyme called telomerase, which builds new telomeres. This enzyme is present in animal somatic cells (everything except sex related stuff) in such little quantities that it doesn’t actually do anything. However, flowering plants (like trees) activate big quantities of telomerase during their flowering. This will help build new telomeres to cells near the flowers. </p>
<p>This is why some trees can get really big and old, up to thousands of years. Eventually the telomeres in some parts of the tree end, resulting in gene mutations and malfunctions. Usually a malfunction in a gene that’s responsible for disease control will kill the tree. Not a single living entity has ever died simply of ’age’.</p>
<p>Do keep in mind that 99.99% of trees die faster than in my example, due to wildfires, draughts, floods, earthquakes, storms, diseases, HUMANS etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
