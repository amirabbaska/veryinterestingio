		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>edit: sry if this is a little full of jargon, might have got carried away. </p>
<p><strong>tl,dr: when you sleep, you cycle between periods of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, where your brain is super active and uses a lot of energy, and periods of slow wave sleep (SWS), where your brain clears out the by-products of its energy metabolism from the past day. the longer you sleep, REM cycles get longer and longer, and the SWS cycles shorten and disappear. i speculate that the accumulated by-products of energy consumed in the long REM cycles reverse the refreshing brain wash from your SWS, and make it feel like your sleep wasn't refreshing.</strong></p>
<p>note: this is probably not the only reason, and is somewhat speculative that it causes &quot;grogginess&quot;, but it was something i hadn't seen mentioned by anyone else. i wish i knew more about hormones.</p>
<p>when you sleep, your body cycles between stages of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and NREM sleep. REM sleep is when most of your complicated dreams occur, and your brain is quite active. brain energy usage in REM sleep can exceed the usage during waking hours. it is sometimes described as &quot;hallucinating brain, paralyzed body.&quot; your body is paralyzed so you don't try to act out your dreams when your motor cortex fires signals that typically elicit movement.</p>
<p>NREM sleep has various stages itself, ranging from light sleep to deep sleep. the brain uses much less energy during NREM sleep. you can still dream during NREM, but the dreams tend to not be that interesting. during the deeper stages of NREM sleep, the patterns of brain activity exhibit synchronized oscillations, and this is also known as <em>slow wave sleep</em>, or SWS. during SWS, your brain cells (glia) actually shrink, and metabolic toxins from the brain using so much energy (glucose metabolism) that have accumulated in the extracellular space are able to be cleared out. kind of like a brain rinse with cerebral spinal fluid.</p>
<p>the first few cycles of sleep consist of mostly deep sleep, with no REM, or periods of REM that can be as short as 5 or 20 minutes. your brain gets rinsed off pretty well. as you sleep longer, your periods of REM sleep also increase in duration, and can get as long as 1.5 to 2 hours. (your entire sleep cycle also takes longer, they aren't always 90 minutes, as often repeated.) during these cycles with longer periods of REM, there is little or no deep SWS, and the shorter NREM portions are mostly light sleep. with the high brain activity in REM sleep, your brain once again accumulates metabolic byproducts, and doesn't have the periods of deep SWS to clear them out.</p>
<p>this last part is a bit speculative, but a highly educated guess: the accumulated toxins in your brain from extra long periods of REM sleep make you feel more tired and groggy.</p>
<p>people also generally feel groggier when woken directly from REM sleep, which is more likely to happen as the REM periods get longer and they dominate the sleep cycle.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howsleepworks.com/images/hypnogram.jpg" target="_blank">here's</a> an image showing the increased duration of REM cycles, and decreased SWS sleep (NREM stages 3 and 4).</p>
<p>let me know if that is too technical, or if you want anything broken down further!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Another edit: This is just one possible explanation.  Sleep cycles and patterns are pretty complex</em></p>
<p>Sleep hormones mostly.</p>
<p>Melatonin is one of the hormones that make you tired and regulates sleeps. The body usually starts producing it at about 8 or 9 pm. Before you wake melatonin production slows and stops. About 4 am in most people if I recall.</p>
<p>How ever if you wake early and go back to sleep your body can go back in to &quot;it's night I must sleep&quot; mode and start producing melatonin again.</p>
<p>The problem now is that you have to get up soon but you're full of sleep hormones again so your body fights being awake. You feel rough basically.</p>
<p>In this case it's not really how much sleep you had but at what point in your sleep hormone cycle did you wake up.</p>
<p>Generally, if you wake early and don't feel tired it's better just to get up then, than to try and go back to sleep.</p>
<p>Edited to make it more general for a person with a &quot;normal&quot; sleep pattern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A perspective that people haven't really commented on yet is the computational one.</p>
<p>Neurons have connections between each other, and these connections have &quot;strengths&quot; that determine how likely the receiving neuron is to activate (fire) if the transmitting neuron activates. These strengths change over time through a variety of mechanisms, but the largest player in the short term is this thing called Hebbian plasticity. It essentially says that 'neurons that fire together, wire together' (e.g. if two neurons with a connecttion activate close to eachother in time, their strength increases). The opposite also happens: neurons that don't fire together often have the strength of their connection weakened over time (we'll call this one negative Hebbian plasticity).</p>
<p>If you averaged the strengths of every connection in your brain when you woke up and again at the end of the day, you'd notice that the average at the end of the day is greater. This is from a combination of positive Hebbian plasticity and the fact that are brains are very active during the day (lots of activations!). If you measured the average again after you sleep, you'd notice it went down again. This is due to a combination of negative Hebbian plasticity and the fact that are brains are not as active when we sleep (less activations on average).</p>
<p>Hence, it has been proposed that one of the primary mechanisms we need sleep is for homeostasis (balance) in this average amount of connectivity strength to keep it in the ideal window for information processing. When we oversleep, we cause this average to dip too far below the optimal window, and we can't process information as efficiently until we raise it back to optimal levels by being awake for a while.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The average person cycles in and out of REM sleep in about 90 minutes. We go thru this cycle multiple times in the course of a night and depending on what stage you are in at the time you wake up you could feel more tired regardless of how many total hours you got. This is why many try to set their sleep schedule for 7.5 or 9 hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
