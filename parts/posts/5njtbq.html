		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two-time Chernobyl visitor here (proof-photo from inside the turbine hall: <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/O1zqy" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/gallery/O1zqy</a>). While my group tried to get access to to the foot, we were not successful. However, we spoke to dosimetrists who had access to the area. According to them, the gamma exposure rate on contact with the foot was ~600-1000R/hr depending on the spot. These measurements were taken in the last couple of years, so little has changed. </p>
<p>If you were to run into the room, touch it just long enough to get a selfie and then leave, you'd get somewhere under 10 Rad (if you assume a mean gamma energy of 1MeV ). This is a dose that would faintly show up in bloodwork, but would not cause noticeable acute effects. </p>
<p>Based on the linear-no-threshold model using data from BEIR VII (ERR=~.6/Sv), this experience would raise your lifetime fatal cancer risk from ~22% (male, US) to ~23.3%. So yeah, I'd totally do it.</p>
<p>Edited to change &quot;lifetime cancer risk&quot; to &quot;lifetime fatal cancer risk&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you increased the radiation you poisoned someone with, does there come a point where they would stay conscious for only a minute or two and then eventually die? What would the symptoms of that look like?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just watched a 2 hour show on PBS called &quot;Uranium&quot;. It's all about radioactivity. Covers naturally occuring uranium, it's history, the bomb, Chernobyl and everything in between. They even talk about radiation and photographs...you couldn't take a selfie with film. It's quite good. Everyone should watch it right through the end.</p>
<p>They go inside the Priypat Hospital near Chernobyl where the 1st responders where taken (to die). Radiation level varies completely throughout the facility. The firemen's boot and clothing are still very hot.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends how long you were exposed to it. I found an article that summarized it like this: &quot;After just 30 seconds of exposure, dizziness and fatigue will find you a week later. Two minutes of exposure and your cells will soon begin to hemorrhage; four minutes: vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. 300 seconds and you have two days to live.&quot;</p>
