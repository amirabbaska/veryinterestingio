		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of misinformation in this thread and people citing websites that don't seem to lead to actual scientific studies. The comment from /u/Yare_Owns is interesting in that it's certainly possible to create intense enough pressure waves that can cause bodily harm, but your hearing is probably the least of your concerns in these situations.</p>
<p>The real question is whether there are non-audible sounds that can cause hearing loss and <em>only</em> hearing loss, i.e. non-syndromic. <a href="http://westminsterresearch.wmin.ac.uk/4141/1/Benton_2003.pdf" target="_blank">This report</a> has a review of some literature on low-frequency noise exposure. The short section on hearing loss is somewhat inconclusive. It seems possible to cause TTS, or temporary threshold shifts, with very intense low-frequency sounds (around 120-140 dB SPL). It also cites one study that managed to cause PTS, or permanent threshold shifts, in chinchillas after exposing them to low-frequency sounds for 3 days. However, there are no citations in that review of reports of permanent threshold shifts caused in humans. Nevertheless, it seems to indicate that its possible to cause permanent hearing loss by exposure to intense low-frequency noise for long periods of time. </p>
<p>That conclusion seems to be supported by <a href="http://waubrafoundation.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Broner-The-effects-of-low-frequency-noise-on-people.pdf" target="_blank">this much older review</a> from 1978. It talks about the perceived annoyance of low-frequency sounds and temporary threshold shifts, but not permanent damage. Maybe other people can find other sources, but the literature seems inconclusive.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could someone familiar with sound transduction mechanisms in the ear comment on this? I thought hearing loss due to loud sound exposure was due to what is essentially excitotoxicity in the frequency-tuned transducer cells. That is to say, while ultrasound could still damage hearing via cavitation-related cytotoxicity, it would occur by a different mechanism than would normally operate for loud-noise induced hearing damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
