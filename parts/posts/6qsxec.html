		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a neuroscientist, and someone who likes beer probably more than he should, so I think I'm in a perfect position to answer this.</p>
<p>Your question is perfect. What it demonstrates is that a hangover cannot <em>just</em> be dehydration and lack of sleep (let's forget &quot;mild alcohol poisoning&quot; because that doesn't make much sense for a bunch of reasons).</p>
<p>Let me take this in what seems like a different direction: Did you know that people with epilepsy can often suffer from seizures the morning after heavy drinking? Why might that be? Also, very heavy drinkers often have seizures when they stop drinking. Why might that be?</p>
<p>The answer to both of these questions comes down to one fact, and one general principle of biology. First: Alcohol makes the main &quot;inhibitory&quot; neurotransmitter in your brain more effective. What does that mean? A neurotransmitter is a chemical that is released from one brain cell to talk to another. Generally speaking, neurotransmitters make the cell that receives the neurotransmitter either MORE likely to release neurotransmitter themselves, or LESS likely to release neurotransmitter themselves. A inhibitory neurotransmitter is the last one. An alcohol makes it work better.. making it even more potent at telling brain cells stop releasing neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>The general principle in biology I was talking about is called &quot;homeostasis&quot; and it means that if you exert some change on the body, the body tries to reverse it. While it doesn't always happen, in this case it does: alcohol makes the inhibitory neurotransmitter more effective, so the brain does a variety of things to reduce the effectiveness of the inhibition.</p>
<p>The problem then comes when the alcohol is removed from your body. Your brain has turned down the level of inhibition, and with no alcohol floating around, this lowered level of inhibition does not make you feel great. In people prone to seizures already (i.e. epileptics) it can be enough to trigger a seizure. In non-epileptic people, it just makes you feel gross (and is why, I guess, that sometimes after drinking, you end up waking up earlier than normal, and can't sleep, even though you feel terrible).</p>
<p>By resupplying a little bit of alcohol, you are turning the level of inhibition back up a bit, giving your brain time to readjust it's inhibition back to normal levels.</p>
<p>I know I've gone a bit above ELI5 levels. Sorry about that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because alcohol fucks with your GABA receptors.</p>
<p>High GAGA = You feel awesome, don't care about anything</p>
<p>Low GABA = You feel like absolute shit and can't sleep</p>
<p>If you drink in excess, your GABA is depleted the next day and you are basically suffering from alcohol withdrawal. By drinking two beers in the morning, you increase your GABA (again), feeling ok temporality until you come down again. </p>
<p>Extreme GABA depletion can cause seizures and even death. This is why alcoholics often die when they quit cold-turkey (I think this is why Amy Winehouse died). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To simplify, a hangover is alcohol withdrawal. More alcohol will make the withdrawal go away. Additional nutrients, like the carbs and micronutrients in beer helps your body recover faster. A Bloody Mary is the drink of choice for people with a serious hangover because of the nutritious tomato juice and bland veggies that usually come inside it</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
