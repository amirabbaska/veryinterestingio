<p>I've always wondered stuff like that. Is laughing just some sort of reflex? What causes it?</p>
<p>EDIT: Every single day I have ever made any reddit post I always wake up to a bunch of dislikes, no replies, etc. But this... My god, I opened reddit up after just a few hours and it's filled to the brim with replies and likes and everything. Thank you guys so much for all the wonderful answers :D</p></div></div>
