<p>I've always wondered stuff like that. Is laughing just some sort of reflex? What causes it?</p>
<p>EDIT: Every single day I have ever made any reddit post I always wake up to a bunch of dislikes, no replies, etc. But this... My god, I opened reddit up after just a few hours and it's filled to the brim with replies and likes and everything. Thank you guys so much for all the wonderful answers :D</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The TL;DR is that there are a lot of ideas about why humans laugh, but so far there is no final scientific consensus that we can say for sure is true.</p>
<p>I hope it's okay to mention that <a href="http://davegutteridge.com/ymiaft" target="_blank">I wrote a book about why people laugh</a>, and I tried to base it on the best available scientific research. But, ultimately, my proposal is just one of many that remain unproven.</p>
<p>My central premise is that laughter arises from relationships, in that it is a preverbal way that humans communicate a kind of solidarity to each other. But, its use, purpose, and meaning have been greatly distorted in modern civilization. What we evolved for and what we do now are often very different things. As is the case not just with humour, but many aspects of our lives.</p>
<p>If you want a good overview of other theories, I recommend <a href="http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/whats-so-funny-about-that/" target="_blank">this episode of the podcast <em>Stuff You Should Know</em></a>.</p>
<p>While we can't say for sure why exactly humans laugh, there are some things we do know that might be of interest to you. For instance, research has shown that other animals besides humans seem to have something like a laughter response to tickling, and also that laughter is universal in all humans. Both those points indicate laughter is something that has been with us since long before human civilization started, so any theory that says laughter is based on anything cultural is probably wrong. We also know that how close people are and their expectation of how well they know each other affects how likely they are to laugh at the things they say, which indicates relationships matter more than content. We also know that the one thing that is most likely to get people to laugh is hearing other people laughing, which indicates it has a social function.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you'd like to know specifics, please feel free to ask. Or... you know... maybe check <a href="http://davegutteridge.com/ymiaft" target="_blank">my book</a> out, if I can be forgiven for shameless self promotion.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> This kind of turned into an impromptu mini-AMA, which is really awesome, and thank you everyone for all the interesting comments and questions. <del>I'm bummed I have to tear myself away to do some work. I'll get back later to catch up and respond more</del>. So long as people want to post things, I'm happy to engage in the discussion.</p>
<p>Also, yes, I'm aware my book cover sucks. You've convinced me to change it and I will. Thank you for the feedback.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer: I'm a useless dumbass with no reputable knowledge on this question.</p>
<p>However, I've always figured that laughing was an evolutionary 'False Alarm'. Back when we was swinging around trees and fighting off the Drop Bears, we didn't communicate with words. We did it with sounds, yes, but not words. So, what would happen if Primitive You saw a Drop Bear? You'd warn the others, probably via hooting. This alerted everyone in the area that danger was present. However, what happens when Primitive You is wrong? Suddenly, your whole family is on High Alert, because you THOUGHT you saw Danger? </p>
<p>So, what I pieced together is that those who had a form of 'False Alarm' call would have a better chance of surviving. This False Alarm was laughter.</p>
<p>What if Dumb Ass Greg fell out of his tree? Obviously, this is a serious event for Primitive You, so you go on alert, realizing that a Family Kin is harmed. However, when you found out that Greg did it himself, and he's actually okay, you laugh, loudly, to let everyone know that there is no actual danger, and it was just Greg again.</p>
<p>Eventually, this became a reflex for anything that surprises us, but we subconsciously recognize as Harmless. The main point in comedy is the Unexpected Punchline. Here, you're on alert, because you're listening to the Joke. Your subconscious is hard at work trying to predict the outcome of this Joke you're putting all your attention in, and then, BAM, out comes the Punchline. 'WHAT?!' your Primitive Brain goes. &quot;I was NOT expecting that!&quot; So, you're on alert, and something unexpected comes by. Normally, that's like a snake, or something, so you'd Hoot. But it's not a snake. In fact, it's not dangerous at all. So, instead, you give the False Alarm call.</p>
<p>Over time, the relief you get from realizing you're not about to be eaten becomes a Dopamine Drip. Every time you're not eaten by something unexpected, you feel better about the event that did not kill you. This made us relate the False Alarm call (laughter) with pleasure. If I'm laughing, I'm not dead! Hooray! </p>
<p>So, because laughter makes us feel good, we realised, hell, we can FARM this good feeling, by making more unexpected consequences occur that isn't harmful. And so, Comedy was born.</p>
<p>I think this fits the best. I mean, think about it. Why do we laugh when someone we don't know gets hurt? Because it is INITIALLY Concerning. If something is hurt, it's probably hurt for a reason. But then we find out it was their own stupidity. That poses no harm for us, so we Laugh. Greg just got a broken leg? No cause for worry, it was NOT a tiger. It was just Greg being Greg. Ha ha ha.</p>
<p>And that, as they say, is that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I've learned from taking psychology. We laugh from random/unexpected stimuli and this is our way of handling it. Usually when someone tells a joke we don't usually know the outcome. </p>
<p>There's also something called anti-jokes, where the joke is nowhere near what you think and usually not even funny or clever but still can make you laugh because it was totally unexpected. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, laughing comes from unexpected learning through (most of the time) particularly humorous events. Say your friend is telling a good joke, your brain the whole time throughout the joke is trying to make certain 'paths' to come up with the conclusion to the joke before it is even stated. If it is a good joke, the conclusion will be somewhat unpredictable and the paths that your brain concluded are completely irrelevant, causing you to feel like an idiot which forces a good laugh.</p>
