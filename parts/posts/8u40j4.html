		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are, or at least they are where I work. </p>
<p>I've worked at a Children's Hospital in Canada for around 5 years now. We have three main kinds of anaesthetics that we use for things like this: tetracaine and lidocaine, chemicals that cool when decompressed, and vibration.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tetracaine and Lidocaine are in the form of an ointment that's put over the shot site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A spray in a compressed can that gets super cold when sprayed. The name is escaping me though since it's not considered a drug, so I don't deal with it directly (I work in the Pharmacy). It comes in a white can with a green lid. I must have seen it a thousand times :/ (Edit: It's Pain-Ease that we use. Thanks for the comments pointing that out) </p>
</li>
<li>Something called a &quot;buzzy bee&quot; which is basically just a bee shaped blob of plastic that vibrates. Apparently constant vibration numbs the area under it, and doesn't require drugs, which is nice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, it should be noted that in neonates, glucose can be used as a pain reliever, and we use it in the form of &quot;Toot-sweet&quot; nebules. I'm not sure of the science exactly, but I seem to recall it involving the opioid receptors. It should be easy to find information on it. (Edit: I remember reading a posting on a wall in a med room that talked about the association with opioid receptors. I can't find anything definitive on Google Scholarly though.)</p>
<p>I should note that my experience is in Canada. I have no idea what happens in the states or elsewhere. I'll also note that I'm not a nurse; I'm a Pharmacy Assistant that stocks medication. The information I posted here is from years of reading postings and newsletters on the walls in med rooms intended for nursing. When it's your job to count a few hundred tablets and vials of medication, your brain tends to wander to the stuff on the walls. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In dentistry, we often use topical anesthetic, but as someone else mentioned, studies on their perceived effectiveness haven’t shown them to be that great.  Furthermore, most can only numb the top few millimeters of the skin/mucosa, but the needle needs to travel much further than that to reach the targeted nerve.  I usually apply topical as a nicety, but I’ve been on both ends of that injection and know it’s really hard to make sticking a needle 20-25 mm into someone’s face pleasant.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it would slow down the process significantly, as well as adding cost and more time for the kid to think about how he/she is totally about to get a shot, instead of just getting it over with. Since the areas we get shots are typically not especially sensitive to the pain, it is a very minor inconvenience and much of the discomfort is psychological rather than physical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
