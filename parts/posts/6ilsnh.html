		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, not all chemically identical. Yes spiders create different chemical structures for their silk depending on what it is used for. I worked in a laboratory where we studied spider silk. Basically in order to understand the differences in the different types of silk, and between species. We would feed the spiders food that had carbon 13 instead of carbon 12 that way we could track how they turned their food into the silk. After doing this we would use NMR spectroscopy to examine the structure. Ultimately our goal was to better understand spider silk and see if we could copy how it was made and scale it up to human sizes due to the insane tensile strength of certain spider silk, ie dragline silk. It was a lot of fun and very interesting research, the only issue was constantly being surrounded by many spiders, often very large or dangerous if improperly handled (so many black widows)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certainly different species of spiders have slightly different silk compositions.</p>
<p>Within a single spider they will use chemically different silk for different uses (as /u/Alif3 mentioned).</p>
<p>For example: When building a web, many spiders will spin a scaffold web first which is from a strong and more rigid silk. They then fill in the scaffold with sticky web for trapping prey that isn't as strong. Afterward they will eat the scaffold to reuse the nutrients.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_web" target="_blank">wiki</a> for spider webs is interesting and a good start. They reference this <a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.37.091305.110221" target="_blank">review article</a> which is also nice. I didn't read any further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
