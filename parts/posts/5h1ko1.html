<p>Technical Speak coming up, TL;DR and ELI5 at the bottom of the answer.</p>
<p>Pain is a subjective sensation that has an effect on emotion, mood, thoughts and the physical status of a person. It is subject to individual perception, and the intensity of pain varies from one individual to another based on their emotional state, individual pain threshold, health conditions and a few other things. </p>
<p>Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. It is needed in order to ensure that the organism takes steps to minimise or avoid bodily harm. There are a lot of different ways in which pain is perceived, and some of these ways have been correlated to actual pathology in the body.</p>
<p>For example, the pain of a heart attack is very distinctive, and is typically described as feeling as if there is &quot;a tight vice around your chest&quot;. This is in contrast to the pain from pneumonia, which is a sudden, abrupt and temporary sensation, often described as sharp or stabbing, and typically increases everytime you breathe or cough.</p>
<p>Other types of pain can be muscle aches or bowel pain such as cramps or bloating, which are more diffuse, harder to point out and generally feel like a tube is twisting or stretching inside.</p>
<p>Again, these are all subjective sensations, which require the person suffering from it to articulate it properly. Vague complaints would be &quot;just pain&quot;, which is very unhelpful, so doctors use words such as sharp, burning, twisting, stabbing and so on to try and narrow down the kind of pain, to more accurately diagnose the problem you come with. You could look it up, there are about 50 different attributes to describe &quot;just pain&quot;, and each one is indicative of some disease or the other. </p>
<p>All pain is in your head. Technically, it's perceived in several parts of the brain, with the final say coming in from the wrinkly portion of the old noodle, which points out where in the body the pain is being felt. Because your skin, muscles and bones tend to come in contact with the outer world more often than your spleen or intestines, the skin tends to have a very rich supply of receptors in order to detect pain. This sort of pain is very well represented in the brain, and is easy to localize and point out. Typically, injured cells release a lot of stuff, which triggers the body's clean up crew to come in. The chemical triggers that call for help, also stimulate nerves to create the sensation of pain, in order to warn the organism on a conscious level. This sort of pain is what we call, in doctorspeak, as somatic pain.</p>
<p>In contrast, visceral pain comes from the internal organs. This pain is not very well localized, and tends to be extremely vague, partly because the area of representation allocated in the brain is much smaller compared to the sheer surface area of organs inside the body. These sort of pain fibers are also stimulated by the same chemical triggers as somatic nerves as well as other things like stretch, inflammation and so on, but the pain perceived in these areas is felt as different. As /u/bezoarboy rightly pointed out.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>Pain perception on a conscious level is complicated and incompletely understood, simply because the answer to it lies in the mechanism of consciousness. On a physiological level however, pain transmission has been mapped out fairly well, and the knowledge and understanding of the cause of different sensations of pain aids doctors into narrowing down the patient's actual problem.</p>
<p><strong>ELI5</strong></p>
<p>Pain feels different depending on where in the body it is coming from. <strong>Doctors ask people who suffer from pain to describe it, because they have learnt about what can cause such pain from studying and treating people who have complained of the same kind of pain before.</strong> There are a lot of different ways pain can be felt, and the reason for this is because of the way the nerves carry pain from different areas. Some pain such as pain from a heart that's not getting enough blood, feels like your chest is being crushed. Why ? Because a lot of people who had heart attacks said they felt that way. There are other kinds of pain too, and the way this sort of pain can be felt and understood by you depends on how much attention your brain is giving it. </p>
<p>Edit : Added a brief bit on pain perception. ELI5'ed at the end.</p>
<p>Thanks to /u/fragilespleen for the accepted definition of pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctors ask questions to try to get from a general complaint like &quot;It hurts&quot; to the very specific &quot;It hurts because there's a dissecting aortic aneurysm and I need to get you into an operating room right now.&quot;</p>
<p>The best doctors know the universe of possibilities they're trying to rule-in or rule-out. Each question should be helping to shape a list of possible diagnosis, and the relative ranking of them, from most to least likely (the &quot;differential diagnosis&quot;), or else the diagnoses that are unlikely, but would be devastating if missed.</p>
<p>Pain receptors in different parts of the body are perceived differently. If you have a cut on your skin, it's more likely to feel sharp. If you have an obstruction in your intestines, it's more likely to feel dull / achy.</p>
<p>Obviously, &quot;sharp&quot; and &quot;blunt&quot; doesn't get you enough information to figure out what's going on. So, doctors often have mnemonics to help them remember to ask more questions. One example is &quot;FAR COLDER&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequency (how often)</li>
<li>Associated symptoms (what else happens)</li>
<li>Radiation (whether it spreads from one spot to another)</li>
<li>Character (sharp, dull)</li>
<li>Onset (when did it start)</li>
<li>Location (where)</li>
<li>Duration (how long)</li>
<li>Exacerbating factors (what makes it worse)</li>
<li>Relieving Factors (what makes it better)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>LPT: if you are going to a doctor and you can describe you problem in one long sentence including all the parts of FARCOLDER, your doctor will be amazed, and you'll be much more likely to get your issue figured out quickly</em></p>
<p>If after asking the right questions, the story is &quot;Patient has dull pain in the chest, radiating to the neck, worsened by climbing stairs, improved after resting&quot;, they would probably be thinking &quot;heart attack.&quot;</p>
<p>If, instead, it where &quot;Loss of appetite, and then dull pain around the belly button that becomes sharp as it moves to the lower right abdomen, associated with nausea and vomiting, and low-grade temperatures&quot;, it's time to look for appendicitis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Different types of pain relate to the types of underlying innervation</p>
<p>So skin and other tissues closer to the surface are good at conveying 'sharp' 'hot' cold' type sensations. They are mapped fairly accurately in your brain to the area of skin they come from which is good for avoiding specific injuries </p>
<p>Deeper nerves are classed as 'visceral' and aren't mapped as well. These give different types of pain, but are more generalised over larger body areas and tend to feel like 'aches' and 'pressure' </p>
<p>Bit of your body that have muscles in them like your intestine tend to be painful in a visceral sense when the muscles contract, so comes in waves as 'colicky or 'crampy' pain</p>
<p>We ask these questions to try and broadly distinguish between the different parts of body that can cause pain and what might be affected. Obviously this is a sweeping generalisation as alot of pain is affected by your brain via emotion, situation etc etc which we don't fully understand but it's a useful basis for diagnosis!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The different kinds of pain can tell us a lot about where it may be coming from.</p>
<p>Sharp pain usually comes from skin, bones and sometimes directly from damaged nerves. Generally speaking, from the &quot;outer&quot; parts of the body.</p>
<p>The inner organs like stomach, intestine or heart usually cause a blunt, diffuse kind of pain.</p>
<p>A pulsating/throbbing pain can be sign of a local infection/inflammation.</p>
<p>Pain that is coming and going in waves usually comes from organs that have smooth muscle tissue which contracts periodically. Typical examples are the ureters (=kidney stones), gall bladder (gall stones) or uterus (childbirth).</p>
<p>If someone tells me that they have a pain in their chest, it can be sign of a heart attack or similar conditions. But if they can point their finger at the exact spot where the pain is coming from and describe it as a sharp pain, it's most likely coming from the ribs or the nerves between the ribs. The pain from a heart attack would be more diffuse, often spreading to other areas like the left arm, jaw or stomach. Patients will typically use their whole hand to show you the general area, instead of pointing somewhere with their finger.</p>
<p>A patient with an appendicitis will typically first describe a blunt, diffuse pain somewhere in their stomach, without being able to point to a certain spot. This is the pain that is coming from the Appendix itself. When the infection spreads to the abdominal wall, they will start feeling a different kind of pain. Much sharper and more localized, usually in the lower right abdomen.</p>
<p>Children usually aren't that familiar with their body yet, so any kind of pain is &quot;stomach pain&quot;. They just can't really connect the pain to a certain part of their body yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
