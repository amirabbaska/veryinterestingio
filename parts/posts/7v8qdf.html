<p>It's truly amazing the difference skilled labour makes. My friend who was an experienced fish filleter, she did a salmon every 30 seconds or so (for 8+ hours!). I have some experience as a fishmonger in a supermarket, I did a yellow eye cod every minute or so. </p>
<p>Everyone else had no experience and were much slower, but we were all a replacement shift for the regular workers, a team of 8, as experienced as my friend was, I find it hard to imagine a filleting machine that could do it better with less waste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a small plant when I was 17/18 (part time work...), they fillet it by hand. </p>
<p>It's pretty terrible work TBH. You're standing straight up for hours, only using your hands. It's cold, noisy, etc. Some people (tend to be women) do this for decades...my mom worked as a fillet worker until her arms were shot. Lots of repetitive (stress) injuries in that industry. Back then people were paid by how much they produced, so the faster you worked = better pay. </p>
<p>But with that said, there are machines too, and they've come a long way since then. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
