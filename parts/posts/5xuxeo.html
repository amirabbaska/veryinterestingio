		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Putin invades his neighboring countries. He imprisons his political opponents. He has robbed his country enough to become one of the richest men in the world. He is dangerous, he has dissenters and opponents murdered pretty much with impunity. The people of Russia are fine but Putin is not someone we want to be friends with. Trump's borderline praise and support of him is,â€¦ very odd.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK, so in ELI5 terms: you're in first grade.  A bully is going around shoving people, putting his fist in their face, demanding they be friends with him. </p>
<p>Now, if you turn around and befriend him, start giving him some of your lunch money, hanging out with him, <em>it only validates that his actions of bullying were effective to get people on his side</em>.  And it makes all the victims of their bullying even MORE fearful, because now the bully is gaining allies from doing very bad things. </p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with peace.  But Russia has not been content with peace since the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Many people in Russia who are still in a seat of power feel embarassed that the West basically pushed them into economic collapse.  They're angry and they want their seat at the table.  They want world power. </p>
<p>Now, while all nations participate in a lot of shady shit, on a regular basis, Russia has <em>a lot</em> of really disturbing problems.  For one, under Putin, they're a dictatorship.  His political opponents regularly &quot;get sick and die,&quot; the government blackmails and bullies and bribes people regularly. </p>
<p>We sanctioned Russia economically because they <em>invaded</em> the Ukraine militarily.  Remember, this is exactly the way that Hitler began his rise to power.  Autocrats seek to expand their territory.  Crimea, which was a part of Ukraine previously, had access to a powerful strategic sea port, and a lot of resources.  They made a power grab.  They bullied a weaker nation. </p>
<p>Befriending them now sends a statement around the world: &quot;we are OK with this behavior.&quot;  We would be endorsing territorial expansion into sovereign nations. </p>
<p>Importantly, though, none of this is new.  Russia has almost <em>always</em> behaved like this post-WWII.  The stereotype of the Russian spy goes back many decades.  This is how they've set up their government and intelligence agencies, and in many ways, Putin, who was raised by the Russian Intelligence community, is a consolidation of all of Russia's worst attributes.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  I see a lot of people comparing Russia's invasion of Crimea to the US invasion of Iraq.  </p>
<p>Firstly, yes, invading Iraq was wrong.  We did so based on faulty intel and questionable reasoning, we destabilized the region and people died.  What we did was bad.  As a nation of voters, we were largely manipulated based on powerful sentiment after 9/11 by a deceptive government.  Whether Bush was tricked into endorsing it by more savvy operators like Cheyney and Rumsfeld, we may never know. </p>
<p><em>HOWEVER</em>, there are major differences that we need to draw between the two actions: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Russia lied about even BEING in Crimea</strong>.  For months they perpetuated a charade where their military wasn't involved in Crimea, and that this was just a rebellious faction seeking to rejoin Russia.  But this is a lie.  What they did was a military invasion.  With genuine Russian military.  That level of deception on the global stage is deeply, deeply concerning.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Russia ANNEXED Crimea</strong>.  They absorbed the territory into themself.  When we invaded Iraq, we eventually turned the government back over to them, for better or worse (and it turned out worse, of course).  But Russia <em>stole</em> territory from a sovereign nation.  This is a HUGE red flag that perhaps you can't understand if you don't follow politics.  It is very bad to invade a sovereign nation under nearly any circumstance; but it is <em>much more concerning</em> to annex their territory.  Because ultimately, politics is a land game.  Like Risk.  You expand your territory, you expand your power.  That is why Hitler began his push.  This is the biggest red flag. </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Americans justifiably turned AGAINST the Iraq War</strong>.  We have, still to this day, miraculously, a free press.  And that free press slammed the Bush administration for their actions.  People were allowed to speak out against it.  Politicians ran campaigns where anti-war was a major political point.  The people in power made a bad decision - and we had an internal debate about it, one we still have to this day.  <em>We are capable of change.  We are capable of course correction</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p>That doesn't exist in Russia.  There is no media that isn't a surrogate for Putin.  Opposition parties opposed to their actions are arrested.  Their leaders are disappeared or wind up dead.  There is <em>no dissent in Russia</em>. </p>
<p><strong>EDIT #2</strong>:  I see many people here, as they do in the real world, conflating a country's people with its government, and a nation's past with its present. </p>
<p>Russia isn't evil.  Russia is an enormous land mass with a hugely diverse group of people and a thousands-of-years-old history.  There are evil people there, and evil people in power, as there are anywhere.  The Russian people are a great people.  They have made incredible contributions to philosophy, literature, mathematics, and science.  </p>
<p>The last 100 years has not been kind to Russia.  Where the US has been relatively stable, they went through three <em>major and total uphevals</em>, the wake of which left them disorganized and destabilized. </p>
<p>This isn't the fault of the Russians.  If the US experienced similar turmoil, we would be similarly destabilized.  People like Putin rise to power easily in chaos.  Because he imposes order - even if he does so through condemnable means.  The powerful like order, and so Putin gains favor with oligarchs and the old guard. </p>
<p>The Russian people deserve freedom.  As do all people.  Putin is deceptive, autocratic, manipulative, abusive to his people.  He is against the free press (they have state-run media), and he's also vindictive.  He is following, publicly, a text called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics" target="_blank">The Foundations of Geopolitics</a>, written by Russian political thinkers.  He doesn't even make much of a secret about following this agenda.  And this text lays our <em>very specific</em> mechanisms for returning Russia to power through extremely subversive means.  Rather than looking internally, FoG looks to destabilize and worsen other regions, to allow Russia to thrive through more corrupt means. </p>
<p>I'm not a big nationalist.  I want global peace and stability.  People like Putin reject this mandate.  They want to consolidate national power, and by extension, their own.  America has had presidents like this - and I reject them, too. </p>
<p>When we speak about &quot;Russia&quot;, occasionally we are doing so as shorthand to mean &quot;the Russian government in power&quot;.  I want nothing more than for Russians to have a free nation.  But they don't get that <em>by appeasing Putin and his tactics</em>.  That will only empower Putin and make life much worse for his domestic opposition. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's nothing per se wrong with having good relations with Russia. What's curious is why Trump has refused to say <em>a single negative thing</em> about Putin or Russia, while he gone around insulting everyone else, including our closest allies. Then you combined that will all of the other shady shit going on, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Russia actively interfering in our election to help Trump</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flynn having secret discussions with the Russians, then lying about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sessions having secret discussions with the Russians, then lying about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carter Page having secret discussions with the Russians, then lying about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JD Gordon having secret discussions with the Russians, then lying about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kushner having secret discussions with the Russians last year <em>at Trump Tower</em>, which was not disclosed until a couple of days ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, having very extensive ties with Russia and Ukraine's former president that was Putin's puppet, including receiving off-the-books payments from them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removing Russia/Ukraine from the GOP platform right after Manafort came on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Christopher Steele, a retired MI6 spy who spent 20 years spying on Russia, put together a dossier that claims, among other things, that the Russians have compromising information on Trump.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Russian oligarch paid Trump $95 million to buy a mansion in Palm Beach that Trump had bought a few years earlier for $40 million, and this was done in 2008 when the housing market was shit.</p>
</li>
<li>Trump's refusal to release his tax returns, which might shed light on his Russia connections (or lack thereof).</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be nice if we had good relations with China too. It would be nice if we had good relations with many countries. Why is Trump only behaving this way with respect to Russia?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You watch the little boy in the playground steal toys, punch other kids, lie to his mom, and then threaten to hurt you if you tell. He thanks you for the sweet GI Joe you gave him, you know the one you left in the sand when your mother called you over? When you ask for it back he says he has no idea where it went, while he plays with it in the sand in front of you. When you protest he starts to cry and the parents come over and chastise you for bullying him.</p>
<p>Want to be his friend?</p>
<p>Now replace kids with adults and toys with large amounts of weapons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read a lot of comments, and I, as a Russian, want to express my opinion.
I dont like Putun, neither I like his politics. But actions of your government harms us, russian people, not Putin. He only exploits these actions to show that you are our enemy and to unite the majority against common enemy (it's not that bad actually, just most people don't like your government). For example, Putin's rating  increased to about 90% after Eu and Us sanctions. On other hand, prices increased significantly, and the quality of products dropped(russian cheese, for example, is just garbage). So I was really happy to hear that our relationship may stabilize, because I don't think that you can help us to get rid of him. It's our problem and it's up to us to help ourselves. I think we both can benefit from cooperation and it's better for the world.</p>
