<p>What's in talc powder that could be risky? Are the same risks concerning men who use the powder to dry their groin area? </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientist here. The science behind this talc powder cancer claim is somewhat nebulous. </p>
<p>A long time ago, talc contained some asbestos. Asbestos is bad because it causes cancer. If talc is highly refined in modern facilities, it <em>should</em> contain no asbestos.</p>
<p>There have been a few articles that show a minimal correlation but essentially the numbers simply don't really show much either way.</p>
<p>IIRC, one of the claims is that J&amp;J did not mark their product &quot;For External Use Only&quot;. Talc is fine for external use, but you should not inhale, eat, breathe, or insert it. Some people use talc too much, and put it too close to their body openings where it could potentially go inside. It's bad to put anything inside your body that doesn't really belong.</p>
<p>Even if the talc powder used is pure talc and doesn't have any asbestos, it could be an irritant to the special skin inside your body (epithelium). That's because under a microscope, talc is made of very sharp crystals of rock. The jury is still out if this causes cancer or not. That said, it's probably best to avoid it and not put it inside your body.</p>
<p>Talc has been used for such a long time that it is not considered a drug by the US government - it's a cosmetic. Cosmetics do not need to be tested and approved by the FDA the same way that drugs are.</p>
<p>So anyhow, whether you are a lady or a guy or someone in between, you can use talc on your outside parts but don't put it inside you.</p>
<p>Edit 1: Typo correction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Talc hasn't contained asbestos since 1970.  There are a number of larger, newer studies that have come out since the WHO-sponsored report issued in 2010 (with older data) that suggested it is possible that talc is carcinogenic.  It isn't.  The largest study in over 60K subjects found the following:</p>
<p>J Natl Cancer Inst. 2014 Sep 10;106(9). pii: dju208. doi: 10.1093/jnci/dju208. Print 2014 Sep.</p>
<p>&quot;Conclusions: Among 61576 postmenopausal women, followed for a mean of 12.4 years without a history of cancer or bilateral oophorectomy, 52.6% reported ever using perineal powder. Ever use of perineal powder (hazard ratio [HR]adj = 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.87 to 1.28) was not associated with risk of ovarian cancer compared with never use. Individually, ever use of powder on the genitals (HRadj = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.36), sanitary napkins (HRadj = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.76 to 1.20), or diaphragms (HRadj = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.68 to 1.23) was not associated with risk of ovarian cancer compared with never use, nor were there associations with increasing durations of use. Estimates did not differ when stratified by age or tubal ligation status. </p>
<p>Based on our results, perineal powder use does not appear to influence ovarian cancer risk.&quot;</p>
<p>FOR the ELI5 version just read the last sentence. Note that there were also no associations with increasing duration of use.  </p>
<p>Numerous other recent studies have reached the same conclusion.  This trial was based upon flawed data and analysis.  </p>
<p>To answer the original question is the following, which concludes that there isn't even a mechanism by which talc might cause cancer. </p>
<p>Eur J Cancer Prev. 2008 Apr;17(2):139-46. doi: 10.1097/CEJ.0b013e32811080ef.
Conclusions: &quot;... In this review article, we discuss the chemical and morphological features of talc and asbestos, and explain why despite their similar chemical classification talc does not possess asbestos-like carcinogenic properties ... In addition, the therapeutic use of high dose cosmetic grade talc for pleurodesis has not been shown to cause cancer in patients receiving these treatment modalities. Talc is not genotoxic. Mechanistic, pathology and animal model studies have not found evidence for a carcinogenic effect. In summary, these data collectively do not indicate that cosmetic talc causes ovarian cancer.&quot;</p>
<p>I am no fan of big pharma, but this case is marginal.  When large penalties are assessed based upon old incorrect science it does everyone a disservice because it now sets up the &quot;slippery slope&quot; argument for the quality of evidence to be used in a court. This is doubly true in jury trials where a glib, articulate lawyer can convince scientifically illiterate juries that there is more certainty than not.  Large penalties should be reserved for cases where there is very strong science like with cigarettes and lung cancer or asbestos and lung cancer.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Civil cases are decided by the jury or the judge based on the arguments they hear in the courtroom, which can result in ridiculous conclusions.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just want to point out: the payment is for a civil suit filed by just one person. Not a class action suit. There is no way J&amp;J will not appeal this judgment down to a more reasonable amount. Most likely they will appeal endlessly and finally settle for an undisclosed amount out-of-court. Otherwise they will face endless new lawsuits, and class action suits, at which point they might as well just spin off the talc division and declare bankruptcy. They are not going to pay nearly half a billion for one person maybe getting cancer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, prolonged use of Talcum powder in confined spaces can cause a condition called pulmonary talcosis.  It's related to silicoss in which finely ground pieces of rock get into your lungs and cause inflammation. My mom used to use a lot of talc powder until my aunt (is an MD) told her about this.  Lifted from Wikipedia</p>
<p>Chronic simple silicosis</p>
<p>Usually resulting from long-term exposure (10 years or more) to relatively low concentrations of silica dust and usually appearing 10â€“30 years after first exposure.[8] This is the most common type of silicosis. Patients with this type of silicosis, especially early on, may not have obvious signs or symptoms of disease, but abnormalities may be detected by x-ray. Chronic cough and exertional dyspnea (shortness of breath) are common findings. Radiographically, chronic simple silicosis reveals a profusion of small (&lt;10 mm in diameter) opacities, typically rounded, and predominating in the upper lung zones.</p>
<p>Accelerated silicosis</p>
<p>Silicosis that develops 5â€“10 years after first exposure to higher concentrations of silica dust. Symptoms and x-ray findings are similar to chronic simple silicosis, but occur earlier and tend to progress more rapidly. Patients with accelerated silicosis are at greater risk for complicated disease, including progressive massive fibrosis (PMF).</p>
<p>Complicated silicosis</p>
<p>Silicosis can become &quot;complicated&quot; by the development of severe scarring (progressive massive fibrosis, or also known as conglomerate silicosis), where the small nodules gradually become confluent, reaching a size of 1 cm or greater. PMF is associated with more severe symptoms and respiratory impairment than simple disease. Silicosis can also be complicated by other lung disease, such as tuberculosis, non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection, and fungal infection, certain autoimmune diseases, and lung cancer. Complicated silicosis is more common with accelerated silicosis than with the chronic variety.</p>
<p>Acute silicosis</p>
<p>Silicosis that develops a few weeks to 5 years after exposure to high concentrations of respirable silica dust. This is also known as silicoproteinosis. Symptoms of acute silicosis include more rapid onset of severe disabling shortness of breath, cough, weakness, and weight loss, often leading to death. The x-ray usually reveals a diffuse alveolar filling with air bronchograms, described as a ground-glass appearance, and similar to pneumonia, pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, and alveolar cell lung cancer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
