<p>At that height it only takes a couple of minutes for the hailstones to fall to the ground.  It takes far longer than that for the hailstones to completely melt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a few reasons that all probably have something to do with it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Solid blocks of ice don't melt all that fast (relatively speaking). <a href="http://blogs.goaj.org/amoore/2014/01/25/how-long-does-it-take-for-an-ice-cube-to-melt/" target="_blank">This class did an experiment</a> and found that even under a heat lamp it took more than an hour for an ice cube to fully melt! If a storm is strong enough, hail can start at the size of ice cubes or even larger. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The temperature decreases pretty fast as you go up in the atmosphere. In the desert, it is usually close to 5F per 1000 feet, the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapse_rate#Dry_adiabatic_lapse_rate" target="_blank">dry adiabatic lapse rate</a>. Today in Las Vegas, the freezing level is <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5nClWyR.png" target="_blank">pretty close to 15000 feet</a> (3 miles, 4.5 km) above the ground.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fall speed of hail is not all that slow. A hailstone <a href="https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/hail/" target="_blank">only 1 cm (0.4 inches) across</a> falls at around 9 m/s (20 mph). At this speed it would only take 9 minutes to  fall from the freezing level. Large hail will fall even faster.</p>
</li>
<li>Hail falling all together will tend to cool the air around it, especially as it melts. It may have started at well over 100 degrees F near the ground, but I am sure the temperature of the air around the hail began cooling off quickly in just a few minutes.</li>
