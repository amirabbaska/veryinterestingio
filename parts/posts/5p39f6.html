		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Russian ex-opposition, now work for putin's political party is here to answer. </p>
<p>Here are pillars on which he stands: </p>
<p>1 Voters on the payroll. </p>
<p>A lot of people in Russia work for government in one way or another: mail service, police, schools etc. All these men and women are obligated to vote for him. Their job depends on their vote.</p>
<p>2 Media controll.</p>
<p>Opposition news sites are forced from the country and from russian internet(that means they must operate from other countries like Latvia etc.). Every major tv channel is in gov. control and broadcasting propaganda pretty much 24/7</p>
<p>3 Old people, raised in USSR vote for him. </p>
<p>They find powerfull-looking person as a great leader by default. They were raised during cold war and do not know any better. Democratic revolution of 90s made them think that democracy equals hunger. They live in phantasy, thinking that this capitalistic period will end and USSR 2 will be erected.  </p>
<p>4 Heavy phisical opression of opposition</p>
<p>A lot of people today are in jail because of whst they wrote in facebook about crimea. Stating thst crimea is not russian is a crime and punished by jail</p>
<p>Could list more if you are interested, but these are most important. </p>
<p>Also, as it is obvious, english is not my first language, so sorry for mistakes and criticism is welcome.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whilst it is true that the Russian political system is very corrupt, it is also worth making the point that even with all that put aside Putin is very popular in Russia. In the last year or two he's been able to preserve the elite (oligarch) support whilst at least preserving, if not growing, his popular support. There is very little in the way of credible opposition in Russia, the vast majority either support Putin or acquiesce without so much as a murmur. The votes might be rigged, but it appears likely that he would win a 'free and fair' election if it were held now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, actually, everything is clear legaly (on the surfase).
He was elected as the president for 4 years, then got reelected (you can be reelected once), then another person (Medvedev from same EDRO party - substitute) came in, increased the length of the presedency to 6 years each. Then Putin got elected again, and still serving his first 6 years. He still can go with the second reelection legaly.</p>
<p>The corruption and &quot;random&quot; deaths and threats is the other side of the coin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am from Russia and me, and practically everybody I know voted for Putin. Let me tell you why, please :) sorry for my english</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no really good candidates for president at all in Russia. There are 4-5 people in opposition, that tries to become a president from 1991, I think :) but their political view is blurry or outdated. There is no another really strong leader, only Putin. I think USA have the same problem - no good candidates at all. Or I am wrong?</li>
<li>Putin have a higher legal education and 40 years of working experience in government. I think it matters. Very seriously. I don't want oligarch, doctor or football player to rule my country.</li>
<li>He never said anything I am not supporting (as I can remember), I share his vision on solving country problems.</li>
<li>Maybe it's strange, but for me and for many other people he is a part of every family. Why? Because we know him for many years :)</li>
<li>My life is good, really good. Though, I am invalid (Haemophilia A). I receive all needed medicines for free every month (in pharmacy they costs 8000 dollars every month). I have my own apartments, small business and lovely family. In February I will become a father :) Why I should want to change my president? Government supports me, not preventing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, we have problems, but every country has them and I don't know anybody better, who can solve it. Only Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich :)</p>
<p>Maybe it is hard to understand, until you become living here in Russia, but it is so. No authoritarianism, real support of president.</p>
<p>TY for you attention</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why are people in here so unwilling to accept that he wins elections because people like him? People are saying a lot of the votes he gets are not legitimate or are due to manipulating the populace. What if the people just like him and his values? Very often people will vote in an authoritative leader.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
