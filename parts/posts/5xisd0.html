		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because usually when you use a service or purchase a product, you agree to their terms of service on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. If you could get them to sign a terms of service to sell their product to you, you could easily charge them late fees. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, since they've got more leverage than you(a product you want), it's easier for them to get you to sign a service agreement than the other way around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can short-pay a company.  I worked for a firm that installed, tested and serviced security systems, fire alarm systems, fire sprinkler systems, etc.  We regularly had some of our regular customers contest bills and simply not pay if they weren't satisfied with the service, install or testing... and because they were regular customers who otherwise had contracts for testing and installs... we let them short-change certain things at their discretion because it meant keeping them for other projects in the long term. </p>
<p>We could have taken them to small claims court and gotten our money... we could have reclaimed our installed items... we could have put a lien on their property... but in the long run we made more by letting some things slide, giving discounts, and keeping them happy - because we got to keep their other projects and contracts.</p>
<p>This was also terribly frustrating because the most ignorant, assholish, objectively douche-baggiest people in the tri-state area got five fingered discounts on tons of stuff while good customers paid their bills in full. </p>
<p>So you, as a consumer, could short change your service providers  so long as they don't have the balls to call you out on it and so long as they value your long-term patronage more-so than your short-term short-changing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of course it works the other way around!  The only difference is that a business' ability to charge you late fees is governed by the terms of service you agree to, and your ability to charge them &quot;late fees&quot; is governed by contract law.  </p>
<p>I had UPS automatically charge me a brokerage fee of about $1500 on an item I self-cleared and picked up the depot.  </p>
<p>It took them 6 months to return the money to me.  After the first month of getting no where by calling and escalating, I served them with a notice of claim for the $1500 plus interest at 1.5% monthly after the first 30 days (industry standard).  </p>
<p>3 days before the small claims trial date I got a call from someone at UPS offering me the $1500.  I told them I want interest and my filing fee, or we go to court.  They put me on hold for about 5 minutes, and then came back asked me where I wanted the settlement agreement and cheque couriered to.  </p>
<p>Usually businesses can get away with not paying late fees on their mistakes because customers don't take a business like approach to keeping records.<br />
If a business kept their credit ledger on post-it notes by the phone, they wouldn't be collecting much interest on their overdue accounts either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Used to run a computer repair company. If this was a thing it would have killed us. Repair were often late because of unforeseen circumstances. Best possible intentions, skilled staff, great suppliers. Airtight workflow. Even with all that in place shit happens that you have no control over. That's why t&amp;c is a must. The way it works from a business perspective is, if you have to spend more time on a repair, you are losing money anyway. The reason is because your labour resource is tied up on costs that can't be recouped by the charges and that resource then is not available to work on something that would earn. It's just the cost of doing business, and is factored in. However, if you put additional 'fines' on this systemically, one of two things would have to happen. 1 the business would not be profitable any longer and have to close. Or, 2, the business would have to raise their charges on all services to cover the shortfall, and I'm talking by a lot. In the first instance, everyone loses, because no service. In the second instance, consumers lose because it costs them a fuck ton more money for the same thing UNLESS there is a problem. So if you see where this is going, in the problem scenario the customer might end up only having to pay what they would have paid anyway in the system where the fines didn't exist, while all the other customers are paying via additional fees for getting work done on time. Either way you look at it it's unsustainable because the money has to come from somewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
