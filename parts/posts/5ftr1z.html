		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question is still being researched today because there isn't a clear understanding of why we have an itchy response. But most believe the itchiness of a scab or cut is from the body releasing histamines as part of the healing process. Histamines cause mild allergic reactions, but signal to other cells to divide to fill the wound.<br />
The pleasure part could just be from satisfying the itch, just like any other itch on your body, but in this case involves removing of a scab as collateral.<br />
Some people who habitually scrape at wounds and scratches are thought to have a form of OCD, but that is for extreme cases, and they may get pleasure from fulfilling their compulsion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For me it's partly the tightness a scab can cause. Idk if I imagine it but sometimes you feel like the scab is pulling a bit so ripping it off is wonderful because it's a release. The other part is it's annoying to have a raised hard bump on your skin. You're hyper aware of it and keep running your hand over it and get a huge urge to take it off and be 'smooth' again. At least I do haha</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is almost certainly to call attention to the area so that you can evaluate a wound, sore, pustule, etc. The wound may be infected and in need of picking (draining), or it could be harboring parasites, or debris such as splinters or ingrown hairs. Since your body doesn't have a lot of sensory signaling mechanisms, itching/tickling serves as a universal, &quot;hey, check this out&quot; for a variety of potential issues.</p>
<p>When a wound heals, itching usually comes later during the healing process when you are less likely to cause yourself an infection, and removing (debriding) scabs and dead tissue can help wounds heal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm no entirely sure if this is what you're asking about, but I'll answer it as easily and simply as I can.</p>
<p>There is a known phenomenon where scratching around a wound can dull the pain or irritation felt. To understand why this effect is real, you have to look at the specific interactions at a nervous level. Pain goes through multiple pathways, two of which are the fast pain pathway (which tells your body the location of the pain) and the slow pain pathway (which communicates the typical discomfort associated with pain).</p>
<p><a href="http://dealpain.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gatecontroltheory.png" target="_blank">This image</a> gives a very simple to understand example of Gate Control theory, which is responsible for the effect. Pain and touch go through separate pathways. In this case, the red line represents the pain pathway. As you can see, the touch pathway in blue can actually excite an interneuron, which in turn inhibits the pain pathway by releasing endorphins to effectively blunt the perception of pain. </p>
<p>I hope this somewhat explains the idea that touching the area around a wound is pleasurable, or at the very least alleviates some the pain or irritation in an understandable and fairly simplistic manner.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
