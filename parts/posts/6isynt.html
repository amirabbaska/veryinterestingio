		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think your point is absolutely correct about the definition of as $i^2 = -1$, the other definition also is flawed.  Sqrt(n) (usually) means that nonnegative real number x such that x^2 = n.  This definition of Sqrt doesn't work here.</p>
<p>I think it is better to first define the complex numbers as ordered pairs of real numbers, then define multiplication / addition on those numbers.</p>
<p>(a,b) * (c,d) = (ac-bd, a d+ b c)
(a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c, b+d);</p>
<p>Then you can define i as the ordered pair (0,1), then show that (0,1)^2 = (1,0).  I think this building the complex numbers avoid the sort of problems you mentioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>-1 has two square roots (i.e. the two roots of z^2 = -1, i and -i)
But by convention, sqrt(-1)=√-1=i is named principal square root. Note the difference between the <em>concept</em> &quot;square root&quot; and the <em>symbol</em> sqrt=√. </p>
<p>You can define the principal square root of any complex number.</p>
<p>I am sure some books define i as i^2 = -1 and others as sqrt(-1). In the first case, i^2 = -1, acknowledging tacitly or explicitly that by that it is meant i and not -i. So defining i as i^2 = -1 and not mentioning anything else is less accurate, as you noticed.
The second case, however requires to define what the symbol (function) sqrt=√ means, i.e. to repeat the first paragraph above, which is wordier. Now, many are more comfortable with the square root (maybe because it appears in calculators), so for them sqrt is more intuitive. But by not mentioning what the symbol √-1 is you don't tell all the story. It is like saying what e^2.5 is without defining e and the power function. Also,applying √ is often tricky and some are cautious about it . Example x^2 =4 implies √x^2 = √4, so x=2 False.  √(x^2 ) = √4 implies |x|=2, ao x=-2 or x=2. Note that the √(x^2 ) =|x|, the principal root.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i^2 = -1 <em>is</em> the definition for i. While it is true that this permits 2 solutions for i this actually doesn't matter in practice. You could take any equation or expression involving i and flip the sign of every imaginary component (which is the equivalent of taking the 'other' solution for i) and you'll find that nothing has changed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a definition of complex number, i^2 = 1 is in fact mathematically quite lacking. What is i supposed to be i in this definition? A real number? There are no real number r such that r^2 = -1. Thus i must be something else. A real mathematical definition would precise what this something else is supposed to be.</p>
<p>For instance,  one can define i as the 2-by-2 matrix</p>
<pre><code>i=    │ 0 1   │
       │-1 0   │</code></pre>
<p>then indeed i^2 = - 1 where 1 is the identity matrix.</p>
<p>Complex number can also be defined as dimension-2 ℝ-vector space with a
multiplication defined as
(x,y)  (x',y') = (x x' - y' y, x x' + y y)</p>
<p>Another way to define the complex numbers is to define them as a quotient ring of real polynoms: ℝ[X]/(X^2 + 1).</p>
<p>The common point of these definitions is that they first define a mathematical object, and then one has to prove that the defined mathematical object is a field (aka a set of numbers).</p>
<p>The usual definition i^2=-1 sweep sidesteps these questions of definition, and implicitely assume that i is just an number and that the set of numbers was
the set of complex number ℂ all along. These work because addition and multiplication works the same way for complex numbers and real numbers, thus students can fill the gap using the intuition they have acquired on real numbers.</p>
<p>However, logarithms and radicals does not generalize well for complex number. In particular, it is not possible to define √ in a way that verifies that for any complex number x, y: √(xy) = √x √y</p>
<p>Indeed, consider this counter-example:</p>
<p>— First, we start from:</p>
<pre><code>   √(-1 -1) = √1 = 1</code></pre>
<p>— Then we split the radical</p>
<pre><code> √-1 √-1  = i^2 = -1</code></pre>
<p>So if √(ab)= √a √b then 1 = -1, which is obviously false.</p>
<p>Consequently defining i using radical is dangerous since square root of complex number does not follow the rule for the square root of real numbers and this could lead student to be blocked by paradoxical situation (that could not arise with a proper definition).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
