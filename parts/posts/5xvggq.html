		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well in 7 states the Attorney General is appointed, not elected. And there isn't such a thing as Secretary of State in a state government. </p>
<p>Edit : There is a secretary of states in state government but it's not the same role as the Federal one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The federal government was designed to primarily be a representative of the States, while the States would represent the People.</p>
<p>This is apparent in how the Federal Senate was initially chosen by the state legislatures (prior to a constitutional ammendment), and the Electoral College was initially also selected independent of the popular vote (that's screwy ATM because of state-level laws). Indeed, the House of Representatives still gets 0 say in federal nominations, appointments, or treaties.</p>
<p>As the State governments were viewed to be much closer and more relevant to the People, their state constitutions generally reflected this in directly voting in many more positions.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There really isn't supposed to be one system for everything. The Constitution determines how the Federal government is made up, and nothing else. The states are free to manage their affairs and their governments how they see fit. Some do elections, some do appointments. </p>
<p>Consider that the United States was founded to be a union of semi-autonomous nations. State after all means nation. That's why they're called states and not provinces or something else. The Federal government is designed to represent the will of each state as a unit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In state government, you can have significant gridlock within the Executive branch if the heads of various agencies come from different parties and have different political agendas (even if they are from the same party).  This can be good or bad depending on your perspective, but it's rarely efficient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Presidential Cabinet, and positions that make up the executive branch, were not specified in the Constitution.</p>
<p>They were originally made up as needed by George Washington, as a group of four advisors, and all of the additional positions were since created similarly.</p>
<p>The only foresight in the Constitution was to give power to the President to appoint such positions, but to require the approval of The Senate for them.</p>
<p>Basically the President has the power to create a Court Jester cabinet position, and with the approval of the Senate, it would become a real thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
