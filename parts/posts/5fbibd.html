		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are nowhere near peak battery capacity.</p>
<p>There are multiple battery chemistries we have yet to figure out how to reasonably manufacture a battery out of but we know that they will work better.  </p>
<p>There are also new technologies in nanostructure manufacturing. The energy density of a battery is directly related to the surface area of the materials it's made from.  But with increased surface area usually comes larger size or less durability, which we are working on solving using gel substrates instead of fluid.</p>
<p>There are also multiple chemistry batteries and other hybrid styles of energy storage being worked on.</p>
<p>There are still quite a few amazing developments in batteries being made.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The capacity is still increasing. Other parameters are also relevant: charging speed, cycles before the battery degrades notably, safety, cost, ...</p>
<p>Technology usually follows a single common trend: something new is introduced at a bad quality, then makes rapid initial improvements until the technology is mature enough to be used, over time improvements get smaller as the performance approaches its maximum. Meanwhile, new approaches are developed that lead to a higher performance later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert but i had batteries and secondary batteries in chemestrie last semester. Also english isnt my 1st lang. </p>
<p>So the main thing you should know about batteries is that they work with to components. Like the Li-Ion batterie in your phone, one component ist lithium and there is an array of elements you can compine it with.
Than there is the &quot;charge&quot; of an element with is important for the whole thing to work. Li, just saying a random number for example, got a charge of +1 and the other element got aomething like +0.2. Now you got a 0.8 differents can be used to calculate the electrons (moving electrona are considert voltage) the batterie can move within a certain time.
The higher the differents the better for voltage.</p>
<p>(I may be completly worng about the next part)
But for an accu you need do consider that it needs to be reset able, commonly called charged. Which just means the electrons with moved from A to B need to move back to B to A. There are 2 big points to consider when talking about charging.
1st the speed with which you can charge it and 2nd the range wich can be used. For example there may be a fast charging combination which cant go to 100% of its start value or just takes very long for the last part.</p>
<p>So and to get better batteries for phones for example you need a good compination of capacity, loading speed and &quot;recharge ability&quot;.</p>
<p>Well thats what i could remember form my last semster in chemestrie.</p>
<p>I hope the text is understandable enough and not too false.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
