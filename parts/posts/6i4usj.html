		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you understand how air conditioners work, based off the nature of your question. Coolant doesn't supply coolness like gasoline supplies energy.</p>
<p>Air conditioning works by compressing the coolant gas until it becomes a liquid. This compression creates heat which is radiated away into the outside air by the fan blowing outside air over the coil. The compressed liquid is then pumped &quot;inside&quot; the house into an evaporator coil. This allows the liquid refrigerant to convert back to a gas. As this phase change occurs, heat is absorbed from the surrounding air, which is usually inside air circulated over the evaporating coil. This cools down the air being passed over the coil. That cool air is then blown into the inside of the house as air conditioning. The refrigerant is then pumped into the outside portion of the air conditioner to be compressed.</p>
<p>In essence, heat is created by compression and dissipated with outside air. When the refrigerant evaporates, it absorbs a similar amount of heat, which cools the inside air that is circulated through the house.  The only thing that gets consumed is energy that drives the compressor and the fans that circulate air. Since the coolant travels in a closed loop, there is no need to refill unless there is a leak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, let's get rid of a common misconception. 'Cold' cannot be made, there is no such thing as 'cold'; there are only amounts of heat. 'Cold' is simply a state of less heat.</p>
<p>One of the first things humans figured out was how make heat; more recently, we figured out how to move it from a place where we want less to heat to a place where we don't care about the heat level.</p>
<p>To move heat, we exploit the properties of gas. Namely, the fact that when a gas expands, it absorbs heat. To maximize this, we compress the gas until it forms a liquid, then pass it through a tiny orifice into an area of low pressure where it can evaporate and soak up the maximum amount of heat. This happens in a closed loop, so the heated gas returns to the compressor and is re-compressed into a liquid.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the compressor cannot compress the gas into a liquid, it simply increases the pressure of the gas. The gas exiting the compressor is too hot to condense (and liquids don't compress much, so liquid in the compressor would break it) - it still contains all the heat it absorbed, but now takes up much less space, so it's temperature goes way up. </p>
<p>This is actually a good thing, because it raises the temperature of the gas to a point that is well above the outside temperature, allowing the air surrounding the condensing coil to absorb the heat carried outside, cooling the gas and allowing it to condense back into a liquid which makes it ready to evaporate again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To explain like you're 5:</p>
<p>Air conditioners work by moving heat to the outside of the room. The special conveyor belt that moves the heat is the coolant, but like a conveyor belt, it doesn't get thrown out or used up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The coolant in an air conditioner is like a sponge. It removes heat from your house the same way you would remove water from a bucket with a sponge. The air conditioner in this analogy works like your hand squeezing the sponge. It exposes the coolant to your hot house which sucks up heat like a sponge would suck up water. It then exposes the coolant to the outside and squeezes it like you would a sponge to get the heat out.</p>
<p>The difference between a sponge and the coolant is that the coolant is a gas so the air conditioner can't let the gas actually touch the air.</p>
<p>When an air conditioner needs more coolant, it is because it has a leak and the coolant escaped. This happens more often in home systems because there is a long line from the outside actually unit to your inside unit and it's much easier to get a hole.  The window AC units are compact and self contained so it's much less likely that they'll get a leak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are constantly refilled with electricity and will stop giving coolness the second they get no electricity.</p>
<p>It's also wrong that they &quot;give coolness&quot;. What they do is move heat from inside the room to outside (and actually add some additional heat in the process).</p>
<p>Think of them like a pump - and in fact that kind of mechanism is called a &quot;heat pump&quot;. The same mechanism is used by refrigerators, or in reverse by some heating systems (which move heat from the ground into your house even though the house is already warmer than the ground).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
