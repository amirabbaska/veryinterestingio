		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/Nygmus has the cause very solidly explained, but the reason why goes a little deeper.</p>
<p>When you purchase a pre-order, you're giving the game developer money for a promise of delivered content.  Many times, pre-order sales are driven by trailers and E3 presentations that create a certain set of expectations for the consumer.  However, the developer is under no obligation to meet those expectations when they deliver the final product.  Watch_Dogs is an excellent example of showing customers one thing to convince them to purchase pre-orders, and then ultimately delivering something that is less than what was shown.  They can do this without consequence, because they already secured pre-order sales.  By the time the game launched and people started complaining about the graphics being lower quality than what was shown at E3, and the gameplay being rather generic instead of the groundbreaking experience that was promised, Ubisoft had already secured a heavy influx of sales revenue...from pre-orders.</p>
<p>The push to stop people from pre-ordering is to force developers to actually face the consequences of launching under-developed games.  Assassin's Creed Unity was a disaster at launch, but Ubisoft didn't face any real consequences for such a terrible release...they already profited from the pre-order sales. Before pre-orders were so common, a game studio that attempted to launch a game infested with so many bugs would have suffered immeasurable losses, and either gone under or emerged from the experience with a powerful lesson learned.</p>
<p>As /u/Nygmus mentioned in the case of Assassin's Creed Unity, the blackout for reviews allowed Ubisoft to sell a broken game to a large number of people.  But let's ignore reviewers as they get early-access copies regardless of whether pre-ordering is a thing.  If no one pre-orders a new game, that game's sales figures will rely entirely on the game's merit.  If the game is good, you'll hear about it and can go pick it up.  If its bad, you'll hear about that, and can save your money for something else.  And that's the core of it.</p>
<p>By not pre-ordering, we are removing the cushion of revenue protection from developers.  Without that cushion, they cannot risk releasing a game that under performs.  This will encourage some developers to exercise more quality control before releasing a game.  It will also have the side-effect of causing some developers to just cancel projects that seem too risky.  As a whole, its still a net benefit for the consumer.  2014 was a year where a lot of people gave up a lot of money and ended up being given an unsatisfying experience in return.  The only way that consumers can influence developers is through their pocketbooks.  And the only way this kind of behavior from developers will end, is if they can't financially get away with it.  Hence, no more pre-orders.</p>
<p>EDIT:  I should clarify that in my train of thought above, I use the term developers as a rather loose blanket encapsulation for both developers and publishers.  Publishers are usually the ones guilty of the above practices I mention, but developers can still be held responsible, and in some cases are even the ones driving the pre-order trend forward.  I think both should be held equally accountable.  And for what its worth, Indie developers aren't exempt...early-access could have been a great tool for indie's to polish and shape their creations into a profitable consumer-oriented product.  But 2014 was determine to make early-access as nasty and filthy a word in this community as DRM and Day 1 DLC.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Oh wow, this frickin' exploded completely unexpectedly!  I'll do my best to respond to each of you as I can through the day, and thank you kind stranger for the Gold!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I hire you to clean my house.  You do a fantastic job so I give you $60.</p>
<p>A few weeks later I hire you again based on my previous experience, and this time I pay you $60 in advance to guarantee you will book me.</p>
<p>You do a great job on everything except the bathtub.  I write it off as you missed it because everything else was great.
'
I hire you again, paying you $60 dollars in advance again.  You realize you already got paid and are getting booked like crazy.  So you get a little sloppy trying to get every house you can.  You start missing things trying to make as much money as possible by booking many houses.</p>
<p>I hire you again for $60, knowing that you missed the whole bathroom last time, but a few months ago was so good I'm still hoping you return to form and impress me again.  You show up, but this time you clean the everything but the bathroom and tell me it will be another $20 to clean the bathroom.  AND I pay the extra 20.  Even paying the extra 20 you don't get the bathroom anywhere near clean.</p>
<p>Yet I hire you again, paying $60 upfront, and each time you ask for more once you are there to do little tasks that used to just be included, and you've started to be lazy and not complete the job, AND I KEEP PAYING YOU TO CLEAN MY HOUSE.</p>
<p>You are going to call me an idiot and keep milking me for money, because clearly I don't understand that I'm getting scammed.</p>
<p>That's the gaming industry right now.  Half finished, bug filled games are being released for full price, and people are preordering them without ever having a proper review cycle based on previous reputation, only to be disappointed that the game is bad and incomplete, with game companies asking for more money for DLC to finish the game.</p>
<p>Yet gamers seem to have the memory of a fish because AAA titles keep coming out and keep getting preordered and the publishers are laughing all the way to the bank because they are making tons of money on crappy games.</p>
<p>Just like you have no incentive to get better at your job of cleaning my house because I keep paying you upfront for progressively worse work, game companies have no incentive to have games work on day one because gamers keep paying upfront for incomplete and bad games.  Why spend more money making a complete, good and functional game when people will throw $60 a pop to basically be beta testers?</p>
<p>Don't preorder, read reviews, then vote with you wallet.  It is the only way games (or any industry for that matter) will be better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well you have to understand that the only reason pre orders exist is because of a problem that no longer exists. In the 90's and maybe early 2000's the game industry wasn't nearly as big as it is today and when a hot game dropped there was a very real chance that it would sell out every where like immediately unless you were camped out at a midnight release or something. So stores starting doing pre orders. It amde a lot of sense then.</p>
<p>Later though this became a non issue the industry became big enough and the means of production robust enough that selling out of copies really isn't a thing anymore for the most part. So then the question becomes why do pre orders still exist? You mention bonus content but is it really?</p>
<p>Maybe once upon a time there was real &quot;bonus content&quot; but now what generally happens is instead of adding actual extra content to a game a developer generally slices something out of what would be the main game and is just giving it back to you as a pre order bonus so that bonus content is well artificial simply there to entice you into pre ordering not an actual bonus. </p>
<p>Actually these days if you don't pre order than you get a gimped product. That you will likely have to wait and pay extra(for DLC) later if you want the complete experience. So once again you have to ask why is pre ordering still around? Simply for the benefit of game companies really.</p>
<p>few other industries have set up such a sweet system that gets consumers to give you money months and months in advance for a product that well for one isn't finished and no insurance of quality. Obviously such a system is just ripe for exploitation and the game industry has been taking advantage for sure.</p>
<p>Game companies build up crazy pre order hype trains on purpose just to release bad and or broken games some are literally unfinished some even if finished would never be good. Game companies have also corrupted professional game reviews by forcing sites to depend on them if for their survival. Review embargoes are yet again something that orginally started with good intentions.</p>
<p>First used to keep things fair between the many different competing game sites it's now pretty much used to put a gag order on bad games to keep people from cancelling their pre orders as a result. Essentially what happens is this, To be competitive in game reviews you have to have day 1 (or earlier reviews or asap) reviews. Only way to get that is by getting an early copy of a game.</p>
<p>So unless you have some sort of probably illegal operation the main legit way to get pre release copies of a game is from the publishers themselves which they will only do if you agree to respect the review embargos. The problem comes in when these companies set the review embargoes after the release of the game in order to suppress bad scores something Ubisoft has been doing recently with some of their games and same with activision and destiny.</p>
<p>If youre a reviewer and you ignore the embargo by releasing a review earlier guess what? the publisher cuts you off forever which means you can no longer compete with other sites when it comes to day 1 (day zero is more accurate these days)  reviews which pretty much kills your site. So the industry basically has the people who are supposed to critically reviewing their products by the ballz and boom goes the dynamite.</p>
<p>Pre ordering right now in is current for is pretty much only there to screw consumers which is why people are anti pre ordering but honeslty ist's way too beneficial for the game companies and there are far too many people willing to do it. Not doing pre orders basically means less money for them which is a capitalistic world means there's no chance in hell they are gonna stop unless they are somehow forced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf5Uj4XIT1Y" target="_blank">This is a good video</a> that offers some compelling reasons.</p>
<p>Beyond that, \u\Nygmus has IMO the best response. But in simpler terms, it moves the financial risk from the game publisher to the consumer and, more often than not, results in poor(er) quality and mostly unoriginal and uninspired games, while simultaneously nickel-and-diming the consumer for DLC.</p>
<p>The way things used to be is, a game developer would pitch a game idea to a publisher (or a publisher would approach a developer based on a demo or something). If they came to an agreement, the publisher would front a certain amount of cash to the developer to get the game done, typically by a stipulated deadline. Once the game was complete it would be packaged and sold to the public where it would hopefully gain various degrees of success, in which case the publisher would make their money back and both publisher and developer would make money. If the game was successful enough it may spawn a sequel or maybe even an entire franchise. But if the game <em>wasn't</em> reasonably financially successful then the game would die and that'd be the end of it. Simple business, right?</p>
<p>In this new preorder paradigm, games aren't financed by the publisher, they're financed by the consumer. A developer and a publisher might collaborate on a kick-ass game idea, like Bungie's Destiny or Ubisoft's Watch Dogs. Then, instead of fronting the developer a bunch of cash to develop the game, they'll provide them with just enough money to make a few kick-ass demos or sample reels which are often incredibly detailed and exciting to watch. The publisher will float these things around the internet to gauge interest and build hype. They'll get a bunch of PR people to start talking about things that'll be in the game — hyperintelligent AI, lifelike modeling, deformable landscapes, real-time multiplayer action, 4K video, etc — and build that hype to a fever pitch. Once they've determined that there's enough hype, they start accepting preorders. That preorder money goes almost entirely to the development process to build the game.</p>
<p>Now, here's the trick: The developers and publishers are under <em>no obligation whatsoever</em> to deliver what they hyped up. All they need to do is deliver a game that's called the same thing as what you preordered, which bears at least a passing resemblance to what they demo'd and hyped up, and their obligation is done. It doesn't matter if the game is shitty or not, it doesn't matter that the content you saw in the demos is missing; you've already paid for it. If everyone who preordered the game hates it, tough shit. The preorder money went to developing the game so it's already spent, and probably some profit was made through initial sales as well. Since preordered games are rarely reviewed before the launch window, it's completely feasible that overhyped but shitty games make it to the shelves where people buy them en masse. Halo 2 is probably amongst the most notorious examples of this. Microsoft and Bungie made <em>amazing</em> presentations about what Halo 2 would be capable of, and in the end very little of it actually made it to the final product for various reasons (many of which being that they were technologically impossible at the time).</p>
<p>Oh, and that missing content? Yeah, that's DLC. Often with a price tag attached, and <em>sometimes</em> even <em>bundled on the game disc already</em>. Think about that last part for a moment. They developed extra-cost DLC and put it on the same disc as the game, and are charging you only for the ability to unlock it.</p>
<p>And if you don't like it, tough. You paid for it already. And because you've done that, it encourages the publishers and developers to do the same thing over and over and over again, releasing shitty sequel after shitty sequel, piling on the DLC for content that should have been part of the original game to begin with, and taking gaming into exactly zero new places. All of which spells LOSER to the consumer who is more than happy to dig deeper to pay for more of the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's what I posted in another thread earlier today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason you buy a preorder is so you can play the game immediately upon release, either so that you are guaranteed a physical copy or so that you can download the game and be ready to play it as soon as the release window opens.</p>
<p>The gaming industry at large (with a few large culprits in particular being standouts) has become worse and worse over time about releasing games which were categorically not ready for release. These games are generally buggy, often badly broken or even borderline unplayable on release until a patch comes out.</p>
<p>There have also been issues recently where publishers have actively gamed the review system in order to suppress news about their games. Ubisoft was caught red-handed with this, as they specifically set a blackout date for reviews that didn't end until after the game had already launched.</p>
<p>Publishers stipulate blackout dates for media about their games, and in exchange provide pre-release copies of those games to media outlets; by extending blackout until after Assassin's Creed: Unity had already released, they were able to effectively suppress reviews of the game (which would have been categorically negative and would have exposed the badly glitched and broken status of the game) until after they got their launch-day sales. It's sleazy, bad business, and exists entirely to take advantage of the consumer, and the anti-preorder movement represents people who're tired of it.</p>
