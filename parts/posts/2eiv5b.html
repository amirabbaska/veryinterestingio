		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a biochemistry student I did a presentation on ALS.</p>
<p>There are multiple kinds of ALS. The two kinds we know most about are the familial ALS (officially abbreviated fALS), which is inheritable, and the juvenile ALS (let's call it jALS), where no clear inheritable pattern has been discovered (yet).
fALS mostly shows up around peoples mid-30's and this is the kind where (so far) nobody managed to pass 5 years after the initial diagnoses.
The juvenile ALS is the one that started to develope in mister Hawking's early 20's. The juvenile kind has generally been accepted as a slower kind, which means that it takes more time for the disease to reach vital organs (mr. Hawking managed so far for 40-years).</p>
<p>I'd like to take this opportunity to explain what is (after much research) <strong>very likely</strong> happening on a genetic level with those who deal with fALS.
The first thing to understand is that we make proteins based on our genetic code. There are soo many different kinds of proteins and each and everyone has a specific function. You could consider the genetic code as a finger print for the protein. In the case of familial ALS, there is a protein called Superoxide Dismutase (SOD1) which functions as a converter of highly-damaging oxygen radicals (O2-). By converting O2- to another molecule, the radical is neutralized and loses its damaging effect. Research discovered that the DNA-region that represents SOD1 has a specific mutation in many cases of fALS. This mutation might cause the structure of the protein to change in such a way that it is less able to convert radicals (imagine a pen without its spring, it still works but is less workable). This scenario means that the O2- concentration is increasing and thus the damaging consequence...</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In medical school I worked for a month in an ALS clinic. This topic came up once or twice. The attending (a pretty big deal in the ALS world) said that while ALS that progresses and stops is not totally unheard of, it was quite unusual. He actually thought that Hawking was mis-diagnosed and what he actually had was Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type IV (adult onset SMA). It's been years since that experinece, but if I remember correctly, the difference between the two at presentation would be if there were signs of hypertonia or hypotonia, that is if the knee-jerk went up too much or didn't go up enough. SMA IV can progress for a while and then stop, leading to a clinical picture identical to Dr Hawking's.</p>
<p>In some ALS, with variable presentation, the hypertonia (knees up too much) is pretty mild, so the distinction can be difficult, especially without nerve or muscle tissue and special stains. I think the SMA IV entity was only first recognized as different from ALS relatively recently, so he may actually predate that, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ALS has a 4% survival rate beyond 10 years, so yeah, insane amounts of luck that he's inside that 4%. Also to answer other questions I saw below, the disease is degenerative, which means he wasn't born with it (in fact he was only diagnosed at age 21, so in 1963). At the time of diagnosis he was only expected to live a few years at most. His kids were born in 1967, 1970 and 1979. In the late 60s he was still able to move around on his own with the use of crutches. In the late 70s (so around the birth of his third child) he could still even speak (albeit it was very deteriorated). So it's not too much of a stretch to think he could get other things working as well.</p>
<p>EDIT: I also read that his motor neuron disease is a relative of ALS, not sure what that distinction means but might also contribute to the longer lifespan.</p>
<p>2nd EDIT: As /u/amyleeishungry and /u/mareenah point out, it doesn't directly impact sexual function, source: <a href="http://www.als.ca/sites/default/files/files/Sexuality,%2520Intimacy%2520And%2520Chronic%2520Illness.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.als.ca/sites/default/files/files/Sexuality,%2520Intimacy%2520And%2520Chronic%2520Illness.pdf</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>He may not have typical ALS.  His rate of progression has been remarkably slow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He lives in Cambridge.  Addenbrookes hospital in Cambridge is not only home to world class intensive care (where he always goes) but is at the forefront of ALS treatment... and respiratory disease treatment*.</p>
</li>
<li>He receives round the clock care from a team of carers.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Think about what normally kills people with ALS - failure of the muscles in the larynx to stop food material passing down into the lungs instead of the stomach and consequent pneumonia.  2 and 3 allow preventative measures and prompt, effective treatment of the above.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Death in ALS is mostly caused by suffocation or respiratory infection due to the failure of respiratory or swallowing muscles. He is a lucky outlier who does not have weakness in those muscles.</p>
<p>Here's an article in Scientific American examining his case:
<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stephen-hawking-als/" target="_blank">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stephen-hawking-als/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life expectancy turns on two things: the motor neurons running the diaphragm—the breathing muscles. So the common way people die is of respiratory failure. And the other thing is the deterioration of swallowing muscles, and that can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. If you don't have these two things, you could potentially live for a long time—even though you're getting worse. What's happened to him is just astounding. He's certainly an outlier.</p>
