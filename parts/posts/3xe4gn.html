		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In water, the speed of light is about 75% that of the speed of light in a vaccum. If we get a particle to go faster than this in water(which we can), then a phenomenon known as Cherenkov radiation occurs. This is effectively a &quot;photonic&quot; boom, and it emits a bluish-white light containing a wide, nearly flat continuous spectrum of emitted photons. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a question about light.</p>
<p>Is all light we see on Earth actually slower than it is in space? I remember the bending of light in refraction in science classes in school, which is light slowing down. Our atmosphere is full of particles which will slow light to some extent. So is all light we see actually slower than normal?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people in the thread correctly talked about Cherenkov radiation and how it's as close to a &quot;light boom&quot; as you're going to get.</p>
<p>There's also the hypothertical &quot;Tachyon&quot; particles that have <del>negative</del>&quot;imaginary&quot; (as in <em>i</em>, from math) mass and therefore must always move at the speed of light or faster.  </p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Tachyon04s.gif" target="_blank">Here's an animated GIF of what it's thought a tachyon passing-by would look like.  Notice how it sort of splits into two as it passes you by and you see it in the past and the present and the future at the same time.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
