		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on why they dislike it. Sometimes its through associated memories; if you get sick shortly after eatting a food, your body has a tendency to treat that food as potentially toxic and react to future thoughts of eatting it with disgust. Unless another person has a similar memory, such as a food poisoning outbreak, its unlikely they'll share the dislike for the food.</p>
<p>For other foods there are particularly strong genetic elements related to taste and smell that can make food undesirable. A classic example is cilantro, which for a handful of people tastes like lye soap, where for many it has a spicy, refreshing taste. Carbonated drinks or foods with high acid can also have a genetic element in sensitivity; some people think sodas have a physically prickly texture that feels like stabbing pain on the tongue.</p>
<p>Another common food reaction is based on age. Your body actually ages out of and into certain foods based on nutritional requirements of that stage of body growth. Children are commonly and particularly sensitive to iron rich foods, which they perceive as bitter due to increased risk of iron poisoning from consuming the food. Another example is sugary foods; children require more energy to support growth, and highly favor sweet things that historically contained lots of easily accessible carbs, where adults are more insensitive to sugars but enjoy umami foods more.</p>
<p>So depending on the food and the people, there is a strong overlap on tastes amongst humans. Shared traits like age or genetics can be predictors across food groups.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably, since genetics alone can drastically affect how people taste different things.  Phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) for example is reaalllly bitter to some people and not for others because of a genetic trait.  So when two people hate, say, cilantro because of PTC’s taste, they’ll likely hate other similar foods that have high PTC like Brussels sprouts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a college student currently majoring in Psychology with a large interest in biology, so don’t take what I say as fact or as professional opinion.</p>
<p>As I currently find it, biologically, we are predisposed to tastes as soon as we’re born, a main reason behind why babies will eat certain mixes of food while they’ll completely avoid ones that don’t taste “right” to them. This is found to relate to the point in time where we, as a human race, depended solely on hunting and gathering, if something tasted bitter, it was probably bad for you.</p>
<p>As we evolved, it lessened in severity, but still affects us. I personally don’t like broccoli just because of the way it tastes, but there are foods that I don’t like because of different things. Cauliflower for example is similar in taste to broccoli, but the taste isn’t what bothers me, it’s the texture. It doesn’t feel right in my mouth, and I mentally don’t know how to handle it, so I shy away from it. This is also the reason I don’t eat Rice Pudding or Bologna.</p>
<p>So whether or not two people dislike the same food item doesn’t mean that it’s for the same reason. But if it is, then there is a slightly higher chance that there might be a similarity in distastes for foods of a certain variety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
