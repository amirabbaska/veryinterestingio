<p>You can find records or accounts of punishiments being carried out against non-believers in most ancient societies.</p>
<p>Not to mention people didn't create complex rituals off of fictional characters until Star Trek conventions were a thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Writing began 5-6 thousand years ago but discernible texts weren't noted until about 4500 yrs ago.  I'm not sure exactly when civilizations emerged but it was also around this time.  The Egyptians weren't writing for entertainment considering they did mummification.  The Greeks had Homer which was entertaining but was also interpreted as religion.  Considering that humans tend to be very superstitious, I'm sure that we all had some sort of metaphysical orientation to the universe.  It seems the thought technology of the scientific method is necessary to push us out of majical thinking.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
