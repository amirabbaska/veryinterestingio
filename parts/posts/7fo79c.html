		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EMP and solar flares affect different things.</p>
<p>Solar flares affect very long cables (more than a few hundred miles) and cause DC voltage to appear on these wires. These very long wires tend to be things like power grids or telephone lines. </p>
<p>The DC voltage is a major problem for power grid transformers which require pure AC power. These can malfunction if exposed to DC voltage from a solar flare. The power grid operator can install DC voltage detectors and shut down the power line when DC voltage is detected. Alternatively, they can use &quot;series compensation&quot; of the power line which stops the DC voltage completely and can also boost the power line's AC efficiency (but is very expensive). </p>
<p>EMP affects shorter cables from about 1-2 feet up to a few hundred feet. Very small electronic device like phones, watches, laptops should be OK unless connected to external wires. </p>
<p>For things with longer wires or bigger systems, industrial machines, cars, etc. Then these could be sensitive. </p>
<p>Protection can be internal: adding ultrafast trainsient suppressor diodes at both ends of any wires. </p>
<p>Or external: use of a Faraday cage. Don't forget that deep bunkers can use the ground as a Faraday cage and large heavy buildings with lots of concrete and rebar also axt like Faraday cages. So, in general something like a nuclear plant is immune because there is so much concrete surrounding anything electrical and the uncovered bits are already very high voltage, which is much stronger than  an EMP so aren't at risk. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
