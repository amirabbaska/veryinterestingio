		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In low-Reynolds number flow (slow or constricted flow), fluid circuits can be treated the same way as basic electrical circuits, with pressure instead of voltage, flow rate instead of electrical current, and a fluidic resistance that is analogous to electrical resistance except depends differently on geometry. The analogies generally break down if you move away from this regime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost. The incompressible, Newtonian Navier-Stokes equations for fluid momentum are very similar to the drift-diffusion equations that govern the electron/hole density in materials. One major difference is that the drift-diffusion equations also require solving the Poisson equation for the electric field inside the material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly what plasma physics does by applying fluid dynamics to charged particles, but spoiler alert it sucks.  Very few of these equations can be solved exactly and the math gets pretty hairy at points but things you wouldn't expect can be modeled as plasma.  Electrons in room temperature metals are often modeled as plasma because they behave like fluids.  If you're interested in thiskind if modeling I'd suggest chen's introduction to plasma physics.  You can find a pdf online for free pretty easily and it's pretty interesting even though it's pretty dense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A different way of looking at this than the answer already given (which is correct), transport of any quantity are generally modeled  by:</p>
<ul>
<li>local time variation + transport by bulk motion = external source + internal source + dissipation</li>
</ul>
<p>with the necessary closure equations. You can use this frame work to describe any conserved quantity (mass, momentum, angular momentum, energy, charge, etc.). Anyways, if there are results from fluid mechanics that are similar to your system you can just map one set of solutions to the other. This often works because the dissipation and bulk transport are similar for different phenomena but can fall apart because the external and internal sources are qualitatively different.</p>
<p>More generally (and more usefully) you can also map solution <em>methods</em> from one domain to the other. For example, your particular transport equation has bulk transport by fluid motion and dissipation, you can use models from CFD or integral methods etc. to find an approximate solution. Or maybe your problem is closer to a stress-strain problem so you can use methods from FEA to approximate a solution. It all depends on the system you are studying.</p>
<p>Note the method I laid out had continuum mechanics in mind. For something more akin to particle dynamics the approach would be different (solving the Boltzmann equation for example).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, except that you need to also take into account that electrons are charged. When your fluid is charged we call fluid dynamics &quot;Magnetohydrodynamics&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics</a>).</p>
<p>This is important when you want to model plasmas, for example in fusion reactors or in stars.</p>
<p>A few responses so far are addressing the question of whether notions useful for studying simple circuits are useful for studying certain fluid dynamics problems. There will be a certain regime where this can be useful, because of the underlying fact that electrons in a wire are a fluid. The problem is that the fluid of electrons is not like the usual fluids we have in pipes. In particular, it is more like a gas (low number density compared to self interactions). The technical name for the model used to describe electrons in a metal is as a &quot;Fermi gas&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
