		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is only somewhat related but there's an interesting thing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uhthoff%27s_phenomenon" target="_blank">Uhthoff's phenomenon</a> that happens to people with MS.</p>
<p>The basic way MS affects the body is parts of the brain are damaged due to the immune system attacking it. These localized areas are sometimes damaged beyond repair which can cause permanent dysfunction in any number of regular functions (leg movement, eye sight, memory, anything the brain does). When the damage is not too severe, though, the brain can rewire using the surrounding brain tissue (think of it like taking the back roads when the highway is closed).</p>
<p>This is all well and good during normal conditions. The dysfunction is fixed and the MS patient is not affected during their daily activities. Until their body temperature rises due to outside temperatures, exercise, hot tubs, whatever. This causes the nerve impulses in the brain to slow down, and suddenly the old symptoms return because the new pathway isn't actually as fast/efficient as the original one that was damaged.</p>
<p>So yes, body temperature has a significant affect on cognitive performance. Optimal is &quot;body temperature&quot; which is around 37C/98F.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit: That's room temperature of course, not body temperature.</p>
<p>Edit2: 22C is 71F as pointed out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I told you I would get back to you.  This is what Dr David Strayer responded back to me from your question.</p>
<p>I’ve attached a paper that reviews the literature on temperature and cognitive function.  Short answer is extreme heat, cold, and altitude degrade cognitive function— and more complex tasks are more impaired by extremes.</p>
