		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much on every planet or moon it is possible to define North, South, East and West based on the body's rotation. Alternatively, they can be defined based on the Solar System's North and South (as the IAU did with Uranus, whose extreme axial tilt makes the rotational North opposite to the Solar System's North, but for all the other planets it's the same).</p>
<p>However this isn't very precise to plan spacecraft trajectories. There are more precise reference frames based on longitude and latitude, so a prime meridian is defined pretty much arbitrarily as they did on Earth. It's also quite common to use Cartesian reference frames centered on a planet but with the axes based on far away celestial objects because they don't rotate with the planet, so you have an inertial reference frame.</p>
<p>In deep space, far away from any planet, we use a reference frame centered on the Sun, with the X axis pointing along the ecliptic plane parallel to the vernal equinox (the intersection between Earth's equatorial plane and the ecliptic plane), the Z axis pointing North from the Sun, and the Y axis pointing 90Â° ahead of the X axis following the right hand rule.</p>
<p>It is possible to define others, it depends on each particular trajectory. Basically you need a center (a planet, the Sun, etc), a fundamental plane (the ecliptic plane, the planet's equatorial plane, etc) and a direction for the X axis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Im a 6-DOF simulation engineer at NASA, so this is right up my alley. There are tons of different coordinate frames one can use to navigate 3D space, the key is know what kind of rotation matrix/quaternion you need to navigate from frame to frame. To name a few, there's topodetic, topocentric, PCI, PCR, J2K, M50, NED, DSL...the list goes on and on. I can give you more info tomorrow when I'm back at my desk if anyone is interested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While in orbit, you (usually) use prograde/retrograde, normal/antinormal, radial in and radial out.</p>
<p>Prograde is the direction in which you travel in your orbital plane. Firing your engine while pointed prograde results in increasing altitude. Retrograde is opposite of that, and firing engines in this direction will decrease altitude.</p>
<p>Normal-antinormal is the direction perpendicular to the plane of your orbit (prograde/retrograde), facing &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;. Firing in this direction will change the inclination of your orbit.</p>
<p>Radial in faces directly down to the body you're orbiting, i.e. directly below to Earth. Radial out, conversely, away from the Earth.</p>
<p>Maneuvers are a vector on which you fire the engines, and that vector is calculated via those three directions. Most of the time the major component is prograde/retrograde, and then normal/antinormal when needed to adjsut inclination (most of the work setting up the ballpark inclination is done during the initial rocket ascent). Radial in/out is very inefficient and as such its component is negligible, if present at all (&lt;20 m/s dV usually).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Around the Earth, we use a coordinate system called the Geocentric Equatorial Coordinate system. It's a bit complex to wrap your head around, but essentially instead of using the XYZ axes, we use the IJK axes. </p>
<p>The I axis points to the vernal equinox. The vernal equinox is the direction from the center of the Earth to the center of the sun on the first day of spring (hence the term <em>vernal</em>). This axis always points in the same direction, no matter where the Earth is relative to the sun, to simplify calculations, predictions, etc. </p>
<p>The K axis runs through the center of the earth up through the North Pole. Pretty simple.</p>
<p>Finally, the J axis is the cross product of the I and K axes. If you're not familiar with the cross product, it's basically a vector that is perpendicular to two other vectors. Imagine the XYZ axes. The Z axis would be a cross product of the X and Y axes.</p>
<p>So, using the position and velocity of a spacecraft in this coordinate system, we are able to calculate a bunch of cool characteristics regarding the orbit of a spacecraft, such as inclination, eccentricity (how circular an orbit is), or the amount of time it takes to complete one orbit. </p>
<p>Of course, this is only for a satellite in orbit around the Earth. They use different coordinate systems for interplanetary travel or for launching a rocket into orbit. I'd need to dig my old notes out for those :P</p>
<p>Lemme know if anything didn't make sense! It is, in fact, rocket science!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the FASA Star Trek RPG they use a very simple system for objective cardinal directions on a galactic scale, and I'm not certain why it hasn't caught on elsewhere.</p>
<p>Each cardinal directions is given as a pair of opposites.</p>
<p><strong>Coreward</strong> and <strong>Edgeward</strong> for the direction towards the core of the Galaxy, and towards the edge of the Galaxy, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Spinwise</strong> and <strong>Counter Spinwise</strong> for the direction of the Galaxy's spin, and the opposite, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Galactic North</strong> and <strong>Galactic South</strong> for the two ends of the Galaxy's axis, which are assigned arbitrarily by Humans based on the orientation of the Earth's axis.</p>
<p>Because these are completely objective and measurable, it becomes very useful for generalization about trajectories, although arbitrary standards would need to be enumerated in order to get specific enough to describe anything in detail or to provide meaningful coordinates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
