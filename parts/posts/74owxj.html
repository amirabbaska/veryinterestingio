		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a physician completing my residency in internal medicine. The answers here miss the mark in that infections kill you from hypotension (low blood pressure) because of fluid loss and shift. The components of this process are:
-poor intake: people lose their appetite while sick
-gastrointestinal losses: vomiting, diarrhea
-insensible losses: sweating which is typical in febrile illnesses </p>
<p>But the primary reason infections kills you is septic shock: dysregulation of your immune system leading to inappropriate dilation of your arteries/veins, thereby dropping blood pressure. Additionally, your vessels become 'leaky' and you get distribution of fluid from your intravascular spaces (i.e. in the arteries and veins) into your extravascular spaces which include interstitial tissue that make up your organs.</p>
<p>So when you come to hospital with a serious infection, the most important components of what we do are 1) intravenous fluid, typically 30ml/kg right off the bat intravenously and 2) antibiotics, in that order. The sicker someone is, the more important that order is because what'll kill you is the low blood pressure. </p>
<p>In most cases, you'll be fine, but influenza kills something like 30k people in the US every year. Malaria has killed more people than anything in human history. </p>
<p>So drink up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These comments about how dehydration and low blood pressure will kill you and everything are right, but for a normal healthy person that's not the concern. I recommend drinking lots of water for respiratory sickness because it can help you get healthy faster and with less complications.</p>
<p>When you're sick you have mucous and nasty gunk pouring out of your nose and draining all day long. When this mucous is thick it will sit in your nose and slowly drain into your throat or lungs. Thick mucous is harder to cough up, which causes more irritation and stress to your lungs. The longer your lungs have this mucous in them, the more likely an infection in the lungs will occur, which is more serious and will cause you to be sick for much longer. </p>
<p>Staying really hydrated caused the mucous that is secreted to be more watery and thinner. Thinner mucous is easier to cough up and you're more likely to get better without further complications or infections. </p>
<p>But it also makes you pee every half hour so it's totally up to you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, not many of the top comments here make sense based on physiology. Generally, drinking fluids and electrolytes (ideally something like dilute gatorade) is good when you are sick with something that is making you lose fluids, such as a diarrheal or vomiting illness. </p>
<p>When you have watery diarrhea, the bug making you sick is tricking your intestines into secreting lots of electrolytes into the lumen of the intestines, and water follows salt. So you end up losing large volumes of water and electrolytes, which may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance (which can be life threatening). In order to replace those, you want to give your body water, electrolytes, and glucose to power the electrolyte-absorbing pumps in your gut... in other words dilute gatorade.</p>
<p>For upper respiratory colds, water or soup may be helpful for relieving the uncomfortable symptoms of dry throat and thick mucousy cough, but physiologically it won't make much difference.</p>

<p>Edit: Didnt realize this blew up. I encourage everyone to read the comment replies, as several physicians have responded with further explanation. Additional fluids are necessary to compensate for the increased metabolic demand, as well as losses through mucous, sweating, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your immune response to a viral infection is more demanding on your body than if you weren't actively fighting an infection.  Simply put, you need more fluids and electrolytes to build the things to fight the injection.  </p>
<p>It's also easier to not want to eat or drink while you're sick adding to the lack of proper hydration.</p>
<p>Fever, chills, hell even just the increased mucus production are draining your fluids quicker than normal.</p>
<p>Edit: TIL you can't mention electrolytes on reddit without at least a handful of idiocracy references being thrown at you.  Nice.</p>
<p>Edit again: &quot;Fight the Injection&quot; is my new band name.  Don't hate.  And thanks for gold ? Not sure what it does but thanks</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
