They aren't allowed on the property they are on, and the owner did not let them in. Why should the owner be responsible for something they have no control over and didn't want in the first place?   </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My father was in a situation sort of like this once.  He new a local man was breaking into cars at night and stealing their radios.  (this was over 40 years ago at this point)  The guy would gain access to the car, go under the dash and pretty much rip the unit downwards and be out of there in no time.  My father was fed up with him never being caught.</p>
<p>He made a stronger bracket for his radio - and welded it in place... oh and he also welded a ton of treble hooks from fishing lures onto the case around the radio.</p>
<p>He comes out in the morning to go to work and there are legs hanging out the driver side door with a semi-bloody radio theif inside who has both hand caught on all the fishhooks under the dash.  </p>
<p>The police were called - and the police told my father that they were not going to press charges on the thief, in return for the thief agreeing not to press charges on my father - bottom line is - no more radios were stolen from that neighborhood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, this is actually very rare. It is extremely uncommon that a burglar is actually able to sue for injuries they suffer. (partly because of the law, and partly because juries aren't especially sympathetic to burglars) </p>
<p>No &quot;unknown and unforeseen.&quot; trespasser can ever sue for damages based on some accident on the property. So, if someone really does break in and is there in a way that would not be anticipated or expected, they definitely can't sue. (EDIT: and, IIRC, burglar's in most places are by definition not foreseeable)</p>
<p>Even if the robber is &quot;foreseeable&quot; they can only, generally speaking, sue for two things: 1.) injuries that they suffer from hazards that the owner created, and that were likely to cause serious damage to a person, and that did cause damage, and that they had no warning of (warning alone is enough). 2.) some action the homeowner takes that harms the burglar that isn't actually self-defense.  </p>
<p>That's a very small universe of things. And, it's not like being a burglar means that you are no longer a human in the eyes of the law. If a homeowner actually uses way too much force, or really does have extremely hazardous stuff on the property that could have snarled anyone but happen to catch the burglar, why shouldn't they bear some responsibility to compensate for injuries?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kotka v Briney is probably what you're referring to. In that case it was because the home in question was not occupied and the would be burglar was attacked by a booby trap. The use of booby traps are illegal because they attack people indiscriminately and do not use force to protect human life rather only property.</p>
<p>Life, even a burglar's life, is more valuable than a vacated property according to law. This case is famous because the press misrepresented the facts and a lot of people were upset by the non-factual scenario.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different places have different laws about this. It's a controversial issue that highlights the issue of freedom over security.</p>
<p>Here are two extremes: A person should have the right to do whatever they want to defend their self or property, and a person should have <em>no</em> right to defend their self or property. Both are undesirable; society generally likes letting people defend themselves, but also doesn't want people making explosives that could level their neighborhood just to deter criminals.</p>
<p>How laws have balanced these two extremes varies, with sometimes hard to stomach results. In one case in Iowa, a man put a shot-gun trap in an empty house he owned. It injured a burglar, but the burglar successfully sued for his injuries. The reasoning is that the trap was set up in an empty house, and that people don't have the right to kill or maim like that when there is no risk to someone's life. You aren't supposed to kill people steeling your stuff when this is no risk to you.</p>
<p>Booby-traps in general are outlawed because regardless if they might save a person's life, they can be a danger to the public. Explosives, for instance. But also, for instance, if someone with a booby trap in their front door had a house fire. Firemen are supposed to rush in to save a life, and don't want to have to worry about getting injured or killed doing so. On top of this, people who deal with abandoned or foreclosed houses have to worry about angry former tenants who leave traps. You might legally own the house, but the former owner's trap gets you when you first take a look at it. Wouldn't that suck?</p>
<p>What I think is an opposing case that kind of highlights going too far the other way happened in either the UK or Ireland. A man was home when two young men broke into it to rob him. He shot at them in the night and killed one. But, he was found guilty of the intruder's murder. He got his sentenced reduced to 2 years, but could have been in prison for like 20.</p>
<p>Aside from the fact he didn't legally own the gun he used, it was determined his response was &quot;unreasonable&quot; given what risk it was assumed the burglar's posed. The court found that the two young men were just interested in stealing things, and not in hurting the homeowner, so he had other options like making his presence known to scare them away. They believed he was lying in wait, and interested in revenge since this was not the first time he was burgled.</p>
<p>But, I don't personally like the idea that people held this much responsible for making decision in times of a crisis. Even if he was lying in wait, he didn't invite the men in. They broke in, and I don't know how a court could determine without reading the homeowner's mind that he wanted them to break in so he could kill them. You also can't know for certain what a criminal's limits are. how do you know they aren't planning to hurt you? Why do you need to take that risk when they've already shown the willingness to break into your house where you live and sleep?</p>
<p>Then there are places like Texas, where I think it's still legal (or at least it used to be) to kill people who break into <em>other</em> people's houses. Meaning, if someone breaks into a house there, even if it's empty, they are basically dead-to-rights by anyone who wants to take advantage. it's due to old statutes I think from the frontier times when law enforcement was scarce, and communities wanted the right to defend their homes, and their neighbor's homes, from criminals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They usually can't, stories about them doing that are usually turn out to be urban legends.</p>
<p>The only time the homeowner is responsible is if there is some extreme hazard in their house, like a trap designed to maim a burglar.</p>
<p>If a burglar trips over a roller skate and falls down a flight of stairs, they are out of luck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
