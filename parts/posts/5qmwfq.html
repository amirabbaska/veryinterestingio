		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some children actually possess the ability to see underwater relatively clearly, as their lenses are more flexible and can adjust to the difference between seeing in air and water.  Scientists studied this in <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160229-the-sea-nomad-children-who-see-like-dolphins" target="_blank">Thailand's Moken tribe's children</a> and also found it was still somewhat possible in European children, just with more eye irritation and less clarity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's due to the refractive index between the air and your eye vs between water and your eye. When light goes from one medium to another its path gets bent. You can see this when looking into a glass of water with a spoon in it, the spoon doesn't line up. So when you open your eyes in the water, the light gets bent in a way your eyes haven't adapted to deal with and still focus.
I think I read that pearl divers have adapted to be able to focus under water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because your eyes need air directly in front of them to be able to focus properly (its to do with the way that your cornea bends the light as it enters your eye; when touching water, nowhere near as much of this bending is possible).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TIL That other people can see clearly underwater with goggles on. As someone who has needed glasses most of my life, and sees equally blurry with or without goggles on, I just thought goggles were to keep irritants in the water out of your eyes. And water always got inside my goggles anyway. In short, for me, the goggles do nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you recall some of your teenage year science lessons on optics you may remember something called 'refraction'. This is to do with how light changes direction slightly when it switches from one medium to another I.e glass to air.</p>
<p>We evolved to use our eyes in the air, so our vision is reliant on light bending in a specific angle as it transitions from the air to our eye.</p>
<p>When you are underwater, there is no air in front of your eye, so the light transitions directly from the water to your eye, which causes it to shift by a slightly different angle, messing up the focusing inside the eye resulting in slightly blurry vision.</p>
<p>When you put goggles on, this restores the air to eye transition for the light so your vision returns to normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
