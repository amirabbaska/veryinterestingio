		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what everyone else said there is one point that no one brought up: The shape of a human nose helps infants breathe while suckling. Other primates have protruding jaws that allow them to breathe while suckling. If we didn't have our noses we could be more prone to smothering. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nose is actually an organ that performs many functions aside from just being a conduit to the respiratory and olfactory system.  The nose warms up and moistens  air before it enters the trachea in the winter and has an air conditioning effect in the summer.  The nose is the first line of defense before foreign particles can be inhaled into the respiratory tract â€“ large particles are captured by hairs and smaller ones get caught in mucus.  In that way, it can be thought of as an organ of the immune system, since it is responsible for draining the sinuses.  The endings of the olfactory nerves go through the roof of the nasal cavity; if there was no protection and just open orifices on the front of the face, you would basically have very little between raw exposed cranial nerve endings and the outside world.  Lastly, the shape of the nose changes vocal resonance and affects your voice.</p>
<p>Edit:  Wow, leaving for a few hours, you wouldn't expect a little comment about the nose to blow up like this, or else I would've elaborated more.  I did a little lower down, going into more detail on theories of racial/climate-related differences in nose shape and comparative anatomy of other animal noses (carotid rete).  I also agree that noses are not usually classified as immune system organs, but I just meant that it has functions with innate immunity.  And good point on helping to keep liquids out of the respiratory tract!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Locals have told scientists the monkeys are easy to find because, owing to their upturned noses, water gets into their nostrils when it rains and they start sneezing. On rainy days, they sit with their heads tucked between their legs to stop the water getting up their noses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I get that it humidifies air for us and all that, but is there not at least something to the fact that we can go underwater while other primates can't?</p>
<p>Other primates have open noses, and I don't know if they live with constant respiratory issues, but I know they aren't into swimming like humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

We can smell our food better with the nostrils right above our mouth and better detect potentially harmful (rotting or poisonous) food. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
