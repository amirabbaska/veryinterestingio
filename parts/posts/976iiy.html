<p>Another question I had, if you read this far, is: is down syndrome exclusive to the Caucasian race, as I don't think I've ever seen people of different races with Down syndrome? </p>
<p>Thanks! </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any race can have Down Syndrome, and itâ€™s prevalent all over the world, occurring in somewhere between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 700 babies or so. It is more likely to occur with older parents, however.</p>
<p>So the explanations for your observations?</p>
<p>1) Mental and physical disability is often a lot more stigmatized in the developing world, causing families to hide their children or even abandon/kill them at birth.</p>
<p>2) Developed countries have much better healthcare and education surrounding disability, ensuring persons with these conditions are able to survive longer and be better absorbed into and therefore visible in society. Disabled persons in the developing world do not often survive as long as they could with adequate care, or receive substandard care solely because they are disabled.</p>
<p>3) Depending on where you live, it is likely that Caucasians are in the majority. As Down Syndrome is pretty rare, you are loads more likely to encounter Caucasian persons with the Syndrome, solely because there are more Caucasians.</p>
<p>4) This one is speculation, but parents in developed countries are often older. Given the known positive association between age at parent hood and likelihood for chromosomal/genetic disorders there may be some slight increase in prevalence in the developed world. This would be nowhere near the extent to which you seem to have observed though, so the first three explanations are likely the best.</p>
<p>Edit: added reason no. 3</p>
<p>Edit: Formatting (I hope)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Until the 1960s, the life expectancy for a child with Down Syndrome was 2 years. The reason for this was that Down Syndrome is often accompanied with other health issues, most notably heart problems. Some of these problems can be managed with complex and expensive western medicine, like open heart surgery, among other methods. Nowadays, with these medical techniques, children with Down Syndrome can live to old age. But if people are poor and/or unable to access expensive, complex medicine, those children may very well not live that long. Especially in situations where infant mortality is high anyway. Such conditions are prevalent in the third world. </p>
<p>This could also be an issue of you spending a lot less time in non-Western nations than in the Western nation that you are presumably from. If you spent more time in non-western nations, and spent more time in non-public places, you might end up seeing a different side to things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, Down Syndrome occurs in all races more or less equally. The cause of Down Syndrome is unknown, but has not been found to have any link to race, socioeconomic status, health of the parents, etc.</p>
<p>As to why there appear to be less in other countries,  this may be social in nature. Most Western countries such as the UK, USA, Canada, Europe have tolerant attitudes towards including people with disabilities in mainstream society. This may not be the case in other areas of the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
