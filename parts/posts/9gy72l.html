		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A number of people have mentioned various ways that wind cools your body. I'll point out that there is a point at which a hot wind no longer removes heat from our bodies on balance. Think about standing in front of a fan blowing cool air vs standing in front of a heater blowing hot air.</p>
<p>If you visit a very hot location such as Los Vegas, try rolling the window down and putting your hand in the air. If you're not expecting it, it can be mildly surprising to realize that the wind is heating your hand rather than cooling it off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It causes evaporation of sweat on your skin. The phase change from a liquid to a gas absorbs energy in the form of heat (from your skin) so it cools you off.</p>
<p>It's why you sweat, and also why very high humidity makes you feel so much hotter (less water evaporates off your skin when the air is saturated with moisture).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because what your body feels isn't directly temperature, it's how much heat it loses in a given amount of time. If there is no wind, this is directly correlated to temperature: the cooler it is, the more heat your body loses. Now, if there is wind, the air is taking heat away from your body, you're constantly in contact with new air that hasn't been heated by you (close to your skin), so you lose heat faster and feel cooler.</p>
<p>The effect is even stronger when you're wet. You know when it's 40Â°C in the summer and you have no AC and can't sleep? Instead of taking a cold shower, just take a normal one, then stay in front of a fan while you're wet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of great answers if you are sweating, but in reality it's a heat transfer problem. Increasing wind speed changes something called the heat transfer coefficient. This coefficient is changed by the material (in this case air) and the &quot;thickness&quot; of the convection layer. Wind causes turbulance in the convection layer around your skin which effectively reduces the &quot;thickness&quot;. This will increase the heat transfer coefficient and cause you to loose heat from your skin at a faster rate than in static air. </p>
<p>This is the same reason a heat sink on a computer has a fan attached to it. The more turbulant the air near the hot surface, the faster it will loose heat due to convection. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
