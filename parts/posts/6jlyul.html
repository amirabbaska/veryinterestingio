		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Haematology scientist here. Your body responds to growth hormones which are produced in response to a lack of something. For example with your red blood cells, your kidneys realise &quot;oh man we don't have enough RBCs here and we are hypoxic, I'm going to make some erythropoietin (growth hormone to stimulate RBC generation)&quot;.
So it's not like training biceps for a bench press. This is simple provision and providing, replacing what was taken. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I tried searching for proof and articles in various databases but it's very hard to find. Very interesting question. From what I know from basic anatomy/physiology ( Im going to source wiki ) I'm going to give you my hypothesis. </p>
<p>We first have to understand what triggers RBC creation; The body doesnt really sense that we have less RBC, the body senses that our body is hypoxic due to a lower amount of RBC carrying around oxygen. This happens most frequently in the kidneys. When the body sensis this hypoxia it will reactively stimulate EPO production which signals the bone marrow to heighten the production of RBC.</p>
<p>So to summarize; our body makes just enough blood so we don't go into hypoxia.</p>
<p>So when you intermittently lose blood the body will just react with an increase EPO production.
Theoretically it is possible to speed up the process of making blood by having more red bone marrow. ( obese people have more red bone marrow cause they need more RBC to supply all their cells, fat cells, with oxygen. ). However I'm not sure if regularly donating blood will increase your red bone marrow because you are only intermittently going into hypoxia, if you were permanently attached to a device that leaches blood I do hypothesize that you will increase your red bone marrow and thus increase maximum output capacity of red bone marrow at specific epo levels ( we dont actually know the maximum red bone marrow production rate of RBC ) . So basicly you speed up the process by increasing quantity. </p>
<p>Increase of quality/efficiency of production is not attainable. Your body wont be able to more efficiently make blood cells because that would require some special pathway to be enabled. Atleast not during a long period of time. When you have acute bloodloss you will &quot;more efficiently&quot; ( not sure if this is the right phrasing ), produce RBC during a short period of time. RBC have to mature in the bone marrow, but in acute traumatic cases with heavy blood loss the body can trigger the bone marrow to release young blood cells thus increasing the efficiency of the proces, more RBC in the same timespan.</p>

<p>happy to answer any questions you guys might have</p>
<p>edit: OP talks about blood components but I only talk about RBC because I think that's the most interesting/important part. WBC could be debated too but thats even more complex. The other blood components are only limited by bodily intake and reserves -&gt; electrolytes, water, proteins etc etc</p>
<p>edit 2: interesting fact. Athletes sometimes go to train at high altitudes, with lox oxygen concentrattion, to induce heightened RBC production so they can perform better when they get back to low altitudes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_training" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_training</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are health benefits to donating blood (especially as a male). I don't know the exact optimal rate but there are numerous studies correlating blood donation to things like reducing the chance of various heart diseases. Females don't benefit as much since they already lose blood during the menstruation cycle.</p>
<p>I don't have time to find all the personal health benefits of donating blood from respectable sites but here's just one example:
