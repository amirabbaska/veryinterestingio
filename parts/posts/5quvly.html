Drink lots of water (with electrolytes added) and try something like Drinkwel. Works wonders for me. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are worse for me because I cant sleep it off anymore. When I was young, up drinking till 2am, I could sleep in till noon.. 10 hrs of sleep.</p>
<p>Now, up at 6am with the kids. 4 hours of sleep. The lack of sleep magnifies the hang over because theres less time to sleep it off, plus lack of sleep in general makes you feel shitty.</p>
<p>I drink a lot less than i used to because of this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beyond aging. I would expect there is a lifestyle component to it.</p>
<p>1) older people generally have more stress and things to juggle. In the west at least, most adult are chronically sleep deprived. So the body is more vulnerable in general to alcohol's assault on its system.</p>
<p>2) older people often have commitments that prevent 'sleeping it off'. Personally, it's been more than a decade since I've slept past 8am...much less sleeping til noon. So even if you feel bad, you're getting up anyway. </p>
<p>3) the downside of routine: many older people often have set routines. That's normally good. But once the body is acclimated to a certain routine, deviation is more difficult to take. Talk to anyone who is a frequent flyer across large time zones. They don't get hit as hard by jet lag as infrequent fliers. Why? Their body is accustomed to regular and bizarre changes to sleep patterns and they've just learned to deal. Just like a college kid that parties and pulls all nighter study sessions. The very lack of routine is helpful. On the flip side, anyone who has cared for a baby with routine nap times knows how bad things can get when you miss nap time altogether.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
