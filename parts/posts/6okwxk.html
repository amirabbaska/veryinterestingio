		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, I was a grill cook in everything from pub to steak house and even a Grillardin in a fine dining restaurant.</p>
<p>Steak grills are sloped and higher at the top, lower at the bottom (this is adjustable). Then the cook adjusts the level of heat for each burner (anywhere from 2 to 6) so he has a range of heat levels, usually from right to left. They usually make the lower right corner the hottest and the upper left the coolest on average. There is some variation due to size of the gas outlets and how clean they are.</p>
<p>All steaks start on the right side for their initial sear then moved to an appropriate area when they get their first turn (what makes the diamond pattern) The more well done the steak the <strong><em>slower</em></strong> you cook it or <strong><em>it drys out</em></strong> (so many people and cooks don't know this). So well done are moved towards the left upper corner and are started soonest. Then you use the most well done steak of the order to take your timing for starting the other steaks from. </p>
<p>Most steaks (not blue rare) are turned when you first see the fluid start to appear on the surface. Let too much of it appear and it burns up when you flip the steak and you again end up with a dry steak. You can tell when a steak is done by pressing on it and <strong><em>should never cut it</em></strong> to check because it lets out the liquid. Cooking tightens the fibers so a well done has more resistance than a rare when you press on it. <a href="http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/the_finger_test_to_check_the_doneness_of_meat/" target="_blank">This is how you learn how it feels like.</a> </p>
<p>After your second turn on the other side you keep checking its state and moving it on the grill so that all the steaks on the order start reaching the level you want together. Meat also needs a resting state to allow juices to redistribute and the longer it's been cooking the longer this needs to be. So well done often go to a warming rack or what I did, put it on top of a rarer cooking steak. When this is done the steak is pretty much no longer cooking and will stay at it's level from that point on unless it receives too much heat again (why most cooks <strong><em>hate</em></strong> heat lamps)</p>
<p>After that it's all about timing. Knowing how fast your grill is running because the more or less you have on the grill the more this changes. Noting which steak is which and sometimes substituting one steak for an order for anothers if necessary (no steak has a customer's name on it till it's plated). Knowing what else is with the order, and most importantly communicating with all the other cooks. Because depending on volume the grill cooks responsibility can range a lot. After that it's pure hustle and memory.</p>
<p>Most people don't know how hard being a good restaurant cook is. It's pretty much not worth what you make, that and the stress (has one of the highest incidents of substance abuse of any career) is why I quit doing it.</p>
<p>Edited to add: To give you an idea how much resting a steak helps with timing, there's been times, rare, but still times where I would have two steaks on top of a steak of the same order. Only ever did three a couple of times when I was swamped or had a big table.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Please bear in mind one fact: If I'm your grill cook, cooking 15 steaks (on average) to medium rare or medium, then I have a little give, don't I? Behold:</p>
<p>1.) 3 orders come in for medium well, 5 for medium, and 7 for medium rare. </p>
<p>2.) Grill 'em all.</p>
<p>3.) REST ALL THE STEAKS. See, this is where the wiggle room comes in. When you order your steak, a ticket rings into the kitchen telling me to start cooking the steak. Even with a well-done steak, if you have a salad or an appetizer, I've bought myself about 30 minutes to get that steak cooked and then rested (vital for proper cooking of meat). </p>
<p>4.) Oops. This one I THOUGHT was a medium was a little over (by &quot;poke testing&quot; it or using a cake tester - more info available upon request). I'll move that over to the &quot;medium well&quot; pile, and this one over here... well, I can use that as medium. Perfect! </p>
<p>5.) When it's time to bring your entrees to the table, the grill cook will flash the meat on a grill (getting the surface ripping hot - the meat inside should not have cooled terribly).</p>
<p>6.) Slice (possibly) and serve!</p>
<p>So in other words, what /u/gearhed said is totally spot on. But to add to his/her point, I get a little insurance, because I don't take the meat directly off the grill and put it on your plate, or else when the plate comes to your table, it is just a puddle of meat juice with a steak on top. Resting is key! And during that resting period, I can quality check and correct if needed.</p>
<p>Also, I can't emphasize this enough, cake testers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back when I was doing it, organization, practice and minithins (pseudoephedrine). Different areas of the grill run different temps, and different doneness needs different heat and cook times. Well done goes on first at medium heat, everything down to medium is the same but timed out accordingly. Medium rare needs a good sear but not a lot of cooking and rare even more so, so you put those on late on hotter parts of the grill. You also keep a warming section just in case you mess up the timing a little bit and need to slow something down so the others can catch up. It's remarkably stressful during a rush, especially considering the $5.20/hr I was being paid to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was a cook, I had to get to know the grill. There are different hot-spots and cooler spots on most grills. I would have 10-15 cuts of meat during busy periods. You really just have to keep track of each one. There are no shortcuts in this tbh. A few tricks I learned while managing everything..If blood is sweating from the top-uncooked side, its ready to flip for medium/well to well. In the trash for a rare/medium rare if that happened. For medium/rare use the hot spot of the grill to sear then move to a cooler section to cook a little more. Also, with a knife, cut a tiny slit in the thickest part an pry the meat open to check before plating. It really is a skill (I have mostly lost) that you acquire. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although I've not cooked in a steak house, I've managed a few, 2 large corporations, actually. Both these gentlemen are correct. The surface area of the grill has a variation of heat ranges, and the Grill Cook will continually rearrange the cuts depending upon: volume/size/mass, the type of cut ( leaner cooks faster, like a piece of shit filet vs a deliciously marbled Kansas City Strip), whether the cut has a bone in it or not, and the serving temperature, or doneness, requested by the guest.
In Chicago, I once had the pleasure of working with a gentleman who, on a busy Friday night, grilled over 500 different cuts, without a Single re-fire...( meaning: every steak, chop or filet he grilled, was served at the desired temperature to the guest that ordered it, no one said that their steak was over or under-cooked)
And, if you really value a correctly grilled cut of meat: give some Fucking Respect to the Cooks!! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
