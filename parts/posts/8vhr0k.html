		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, my name's Kevin Esvelt and I'm a scientist working on molecular, evolutionary, and ecological engineering. I played a very minor role in developing CRISPR genome editing and was evidently the first to realize it could be used to build gene drive systems capable of engineering populations of wild organisms.</p>
<p>If you haven't read about gene drive - and even if you have - I highly recommend reading this <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/5/31/17344406/crispr-mosquito-malaria-gene-drive-editing-target-africa-regulation-gmo" target="_blank">hugely informative essay</a> by Dylan Matthews of Vox.</p>
<p>Relatedly, I'm a strong advocate of more open science, beginning with <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/gene-editing-can-drive-science-to-openness-1.20043" target="_blank">using gene drive research</a> as a small and high-profile field trial of pre-registration in tech development.</p>
<p>Finally, we in <a href="http://www.sculptingevolution.org/" target="_blank">Sculpting Evolution</a> try to carefully consider our <a href="https://leapsmag.com/when-are-we-obligated-to-edit-wild-creatures/" target="_blank">moral obligations</a> and publicly <a href="https://www.responsivescience.org/pub/aotearoa-amends" target="_blank">admit mistakes</a>. We'll be on at 2pm eastern (19 UT) - AMA!</p>
<p>EDIT: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJm8PeWkiEU&amp;t=13m40s" target="_blank">segment</a> about this just last night!</p>
<p>EDIT #2: Our guest needs to take a break, but will be back later tonight to answer many more questions.</p></div></div>

<p>When we modify a gene and insert it into a multicellular host, how does that gene propagate? Since there are a vast number of non-modified cells why don't their descendants (as it were) overwhelm the cells with the new gene through sheer weight of numbers?</p>
<p>Or in other words, how does CRISPR cause system-wide changes without modifying the majority of cells?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
