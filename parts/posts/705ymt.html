		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the result of the act is what people will consider the most.</p>
<p>It's kind of like this:</p>
<p>Do you see a difference between me swinging a bat in your general direction, in a threatening manner, and me swinging a bat to hit your body?  Sure you do.  And on average, the reaction to the first example is liable to be more measured and proportionate, compared to the second.</p>
<p>Declaring war is a very serious move, and one would hope world leaders would try to exhaust all avenues of remedy before taking that step.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It could certainly be provocation for a war that other states see as reasonable. What matters isn't the act itself, it is how others respond to it. If nobody wants to make war over it, then it doesn't matter what some legalistic definition might say.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Since the Korean War never ended, North Korea is officially at war with the US, and is threatening Japan because it hosts US military bases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is an act of war... but consider The Cold War.    In this case, Japan, South Korea, the West, even Russia and China on the other side don't want this Cold War with North Korea to turn 'hot'.</p>
<p>If it turns hot, it's not going to end well.   So everyone except North Korea is reluctant to hit back with more than economic sanctions.    North Korea is taking the opportunity to see how far it can push the boundary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It certainly is a provocation, but by analyzing the speed and trajectory of the missile, The U.S and Japan can rule out a serious threat from the missile very quickly (even if it is flying over Japan)
