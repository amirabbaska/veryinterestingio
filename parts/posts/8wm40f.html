		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to this, as far as I know, is still not really known. One of the purposes of the Juno probe was actually to answer this exact question. Since Jupiter is so huge, that means that the pressure at the core would be enough to solidify certain elements (for example, the core of Jupiter might be a chunk of solid, metallic hydrogen) but these effects also have to compete with other effects such as heat and chemical composition. So it is possible that these planets have solid surfaces, but they would be so deep down, it becomes very hard to study.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. It's difficult to know, but they likely aren't entirely gaseous. In the case of Jupiter and Saturn, they're hypothesized to have a dense core made or rock and/or ice. This is surrounded by a mantle of metallic hydrogen. That's hydrogen that has been compressed so much that it takes on properties similar to a liquid metal. These are estimated to be about 78% of the planet's radius. Helium and neon fall as rain in these regions. The atmosphere above these layers is mostly hydrogen and helium, with small amounts of other common compounds like methane and ammonia.</p>
<p>Uranus and Neptune are a bit different, as they're smaller. They too have rocky cores, but with a mantel made of ammonia, water, and methane ices instead of metallic hydrogen. Their upper atmospheres are made of hydrogen, helium, and methane. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they have metallic cores and liquid mantles.</p>
<p>The &quot;liquids&quot; inside gas giants are exotic supercritical fluids compressed by the immense heat and pressure, and at the center there are relatively small (earth sized) cores of rock and metal.</p>
<p>Whether the core forms first, simultaneously, or is gathered from impacts later isn't really known.  The formation process of gas giants is a bit of a mystery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
