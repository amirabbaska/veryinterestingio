		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They use alternating current to magnetize the sorting magnet. If you use permanent magnet then aluminium will not be attracted to it, but if you put aluminium in magnetic field that constantly changes direction this magnetic field will generate electric curent inside the aluminium. When electric curent flows trough metal it generates magnetic field and the aluminium becomes small magnet with opposite poles as the magnetic field that generated the current in the aluminium. But the current inside the aluminium is not permanent, it's only short spike of current so if the outside field stayed the same the aluminium would stob being magnetic after a split second. But the outside field keeps changing back and forth that means the spike of current in aluminium keeps occuring and the aluminium is attracted to the magnet.</p>
<p>Edit 1: It was pointed out to me that I got the directions wrong. The aluminium would be pushed away from the magnet. Writing it here so I won't confuse people.</p>
<p>u/intjengineer linked a video of this in action. Linking it here in case it gets burried in the replies. If you can find his comment uvote it so it can be visible for others. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wUYDfvxlZ8&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">video</a></p>
<p>Edit 2: OMG I am internet famous now! What will I do with all this sweet karma?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So everyone here is talking about how eddy currents and magnets are used, but that's just the automated part of the process. I worked at a scrap yard for a while, I'll tell you what I and a dozen other people did every day. After going through the shredder, all the material is sorted into 2 conveyor belts. Belt #1 extends upward at a 45 degree angle, to about 30 feet off the ground where it dumps it's material over a wall and straight into train cars. Belt #2 does not move at a very slight downward incline and snakes around to dump it's material in a dumpster. </p>
<p>Belt #1 moves at 35mph, and carries everything that the sorter deemed as nonferrous metal (aluminum) straight into a train car.</p>
<p>Belt #2 moves at about 1mph and vibrates, rumbling all the non metallic waste to the dumpster. </p>
<p>So after the machine does it's sorting, the rest of us go to work. Line #1 has 8-10 people on it because mixed in with the aluminum are things that have copper, brass, or are actually waste, which need to be sorted (copper and brass are worth more, aluminum load is worth less when it has too much chaff mixed in). So you have these guys standing in the air, rapidly sticking their hands in a stream of fast moving sharp metal obejcts and tossing motors and random brass/copper items over their shoulders into bins on the ground, plucking loose wires (copper) and stuffing them in 5gallon buckets, and tossing garbage onto tje ground. This process entails 15 pound motors slipping from someone's hands on the top and tumbling backwars down the belt in a clang-spinning death roll that everyone clears their hands from the path until the crazy guy (me) lets their hand get smashed when they grab it and toss it in the bin. It also entails thousands of sharp metal bits slicing your forearms and puncturing your gloves as it races past whatever item you're plucking from the line. This is not a job for hand models.</p>
<p>Belt #2 moves much slower, and is much safer. 1 person works this belt, and it is full of the trash. Most of the stuff that went through the shredder was cars. So belt #2 is full of cushion material, plastic, seatbelts, steering wheels, and whatever people left in their car/trunk. Easily 95% of what gets plucked out of this line is just wire. It's slow, boring, and the entire line smells like a twice steamed chili fart, but you don't risk losing any fingers or hands to a rogue motor.</p>
<p>Here is a neat anecdote. I mentioned we shred cars, the teeth of the shredder are each 2 ton titanium hammers, there is about a 1/16th inch gap between them. This machine reduces cars to tiny tiny bits. One day I was working the #2 belt and saw a piece of leather sticking out. I grabbed it and to my shock it was a completely in tact Bible. If I were to take a page from the bible and put it in the next car, the page would be unidentifiable as something from a boom when it came out the other end, either tiny shreds or pulp. Yet somehow this bible survived the entire process completely unscathed. It's now the only bible I own.</p>
<p>Tl:dr After a machine sorts the metal, human beings risk losing their fingers, hands, and sense of smell, to manually sort what the machine missed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a word, electromagnetism.  </p>
<p>You're probably familiar with electromagnetism, it's creating a magnetic field by running current (in other words, moving electric charge) through a conductor. You can make <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Homemade_Electromagnet.jpg" target="_blank">a simple electromagnet at home</a> to show that this works.</p>
<p>The opposite also happens, when you move a magnetic field across a conductor it will induce current. This is how we generate most electricity: steam from burning coal, water from a dam, or wind is used to rotate magnets past coiled wires.</p>
<p>So, now, what happens when you  try and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWhxDqY45YI" target="_blank">move a magnet across a piece of aluminum</a>, which is conductive. As the magnet – and its magnetic field – move, it creates electricity (specifically called eddy currents) inside the aluminum. These currents, in turn, create a magnetic field, and this magnetic field opposes the motion of the magnet. </p>
<p>This can be used then, to separate metal from non-metals. By rapidly moving magnets (or using a quickly changing electromagnet), conductive materials are induced to move, and a setup is made where metal objects will be thrown forward, and non-metals fall from gravity. This, then, is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_38kiL3cR6w" target="_blank">eddy current separator</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, aluminum is one of the only cost effective things to recycle. Things like paper, glass, and plastic are all cheaper to produce from scratch than recycle. Extracting aluminum from bauxite is more expensive than getting it from the recycling process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
