		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drones in a honeybee colony do not do any work for the colony. They do not gather pollen and nectar, do not feed brood, do not care for the hive in any way. Their only function is to consume resources, then fly out and attempt to mate with a queen from another colony. </p>
<p>They are not bringing any resources or genetic diversity into the colony they live in, and therefore may be &quot;freeloaders&quot; by definition. However, they are providing genetic diversity to other colonies by passing on the DNA of their queen to other colonies.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Amazon ants have lost the ability to feed themselves or look after thier brood so they must attack other ant colonies and kidnap ants to do it for them. Polyergus is just one of 14 species of slave raiding ants.</p>
<p>an excellent example of the master-slave relationship in nature</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, Im not sure whether freeloading can be unintentional but consistently In ant colonies, there is a large body of ants in reserve, these dont adopt the role of gatherer, soldier, nanny etc they are just sitting there idle in a shallow chamber waiting to be called up. Im not sure ants are driven by logic, which would somewhat encompass lazyness and lethargy, they are driven (to a greater extent anyway) by chemical signals, therefore ants always diligently do whats best for the colony, even if that does mean to chill out in case a flood wipes out all your homies.</p>
