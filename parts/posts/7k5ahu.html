		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are generally 2 main methods of drug discovery.   In the first, you figure out a way to test new chemicals in a chemical method (like does compound X kill bacteria at very loe concentrations and not kill human cells at all).  There is a large amount of testing done, and then it is moved to an animal model (usually mice).  Tons more testing in several different animals and lots of human cell lines.  Much later it will be tested on super low doses in humans and follow the rest of the FDA drug approval process. </p>
<p>The other takes a slightly more informed view.  If we know that a disease is caused by some sort of chemical marker or protein in the body, we can use computers to calculate if the chemical will affect that chemistry in the body.   If it passes the computer test, it can move on the the chemical tests and then through the rest of the cycle.  </p>
<p>Basically, yes, we throw a bunch of chemicals at a problem until one looks good, but we do a lot of testing before we ever move to animal studies.  A drug discovery person could (theoretically) work their entire life and never have a compound move from chemical tests (assay) to animal model.  This is why it is so expensive.....IT IS FREAKING DIFFICULT!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes already made drugs can be found to have more purposes than originally thought, too. An anti-seizure drug being used specifically for the mood stabilizing properties it also has would be an example of this. If you’ve heard the term of a medicine being used “off-label” that’s what it’s referring to. </p>
<p>Or, an already made drug could be found to have somewhat of an unexpected effect, and then research takes place for a way to take advantage of that effect. I’m sure there’s more examples but the one that’s coming to my mind right now is Botox. It works cosmetically by relaxing the muscle which in turn smooths the skin above it. Some patients reported that afterwards, they got fewer migraines. So of course this was studied, and now if you suffer from chronic migraine and fit some certain criteria a treatment option is Botox all over your head and neck, though admittedly at a much higher dose than used cosmetically. Nobody is completely sure how migraines work, but tight muscles apparently play a part.   </p>
<p>Anyway sorry, my point is that I thought you may have been interested in how medicine can continue to evolve after they’ve left the pharmacy too.  If I have made any mistakes in this comment, someone please correct me. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many drugs start with a known 'skeleton'. Take the classic opioids/opiates as an example (morphine, heroin, codeine, thebaine, etc). They all have a core structure that is the same. </p>
<p>So you take that structure and 'join things' to it (or maybe remove things). A methyl group here, a hydroxyl group, there (aka - functional groups). Now you have something that is likely to behave in a similar fashion, but you don't know how strong/effective/toxic it may be. So you do a huge amount of testing to find out, well before you ever give it to a human.</p>
<p>That's a really simplistic explanation, but you get the idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SO</p>
<p>I KNOW THIS ONE</p>
<p>...SORT OF</p>
<p>First, you have a disease or condition you are trying to find a drug for. Take.... for example, non-small cell lung carcinoma. After a lot of wet lab analysis and genomic analysis, it's found that certain receptors in a cell that control certain functions (for example, something called epidermal growth factor) has a lot of mutations in it for people who have NSCLC. </p>
<p>Some dudes in a lab will then test to see what kind of compounds will block the receptor for epidermal growth factor, to stop the overproduction of it, because that is what mutations typically do. Either too much stuff is made by these cell receptors or too little is made. In the case of NSCLC, too much is made. So a compound that can lessen the amount of epidermal growth factor being made by the cell is called an inhibitor. </p>
<p>So they run some structures of the part of the epidermal growth factor receptor that controls switching it &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; through a database, usually the Protein Database (which also happens to be housed at my alma mater, heyo, go Rutgers University-New Brunswick!), and find compounds that are similar in structure to the receptor, but will turn it &quot;off.&quot; Then they try to find analogous structures in drugbank which is another database. </p>
<p>Then they do a lot of in-silico analysis (on the computer) through simulations and programs like Chimera, or Argus Lab, to isolate what kind of compound is needed. It's kind of complicated, so I won't go into all of that. </p>
<p>Then they have to create the drug, and put it through pre-clinical trials, so on mice, typically. So the toxicity is measured in mice, and the efficacy of the drug (does it help turn this receptor thingy off or nah??). After it's safe and effective in mice, we crank it up to phase I clinical trials, so that's usually just testing the half life of the drug and most importantly, the safety of it in humans, but in small doses. Then there's a few more phases to see what the safest-highest dose can be. And then extensive testing in what we call PK/PD or, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics -how a drug affects an organism, and how an organism affects the drug- (I should add, this is also done in the mice model testing too). And then, if a lot of people can tolerate this drug and benefit from it, it has to go through an FDA approval (lots of paperwork... and time), and then it needs to go through a lot of marketing stuff to get it into the global market. </p>
<p>It can take up to 12 years for a drug to be taken from discovery all the way to development, and finally to marketing. It's a process. But a necessary one, I guess. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
