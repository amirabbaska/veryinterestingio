		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I want to preface this by stating that Wakefield's 1998 Lancet paper contained (essentially) fabricated data, and was probably influenced by unreported financial conflicts of interest, i.e. the paper is bunk.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, claiming that the paper is obviously flawed, as far as I am aware, is not accurate. It is my understanding that in reading the paper, which is essence is a series of case reports of so called &quot;autistic enterocolitis&quot;, there is nothing to suggest that there is anything wrong with the paper (unless you want to argue that 'how come the link was never noted before', to which I would say, rare events <em>can</em> be missed in underpowered clinical trials, i.e. just because a side effect has not previously been noted does not mean that the side effect does not exist). </p>
<p>A lot of people misunderstand how peer review occurs, i.e. the process by which peers of the author, and editors of the journal, make comments on the manuscript, and decide whether it is published. In the vast majority of cases, peer reviewers and editors simple get the text and figures of the paper. The do not look at raw data, or collected samples, or equipment, or anything outside of what is presented in the manuscript. The whole process relies on good faith (which in part is why scientific fraud is far more common that a lot of people would like to admit). Hence, when the editors and peer reviewers saw Wakefield's manuscript, they saw something very interesting and potentially very concerning.</p>
<p>The cynical reader might have a slightly different thing to add. The owners of journals want their journals to have a high impact factor (basically a measure of how often the papers in the journal are read). Editors of journals can lose their job if the impact factor of a journal goes down. The journals that already have a high impact factor (like the Lancet) instead like it when their articles are in the news. One might wonder if the editors of The Lancet also considered how much press coverage this article would generate.</p>
<p>However, perhaps there is a specific &quot;obvious&quot; flaw that you know about, that I am unaware of. If so, the answer is that peer review isn't perfect. One of the many reasons why science relies on replication.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a big problem with peer-review, or rather the perception of it. There is this fiction, that a lot of people subscribe to, that once something is peer-reviewed, it becomes gospel. But peer-review is just two or three (busy) scientists reading the paper to assess its quality. They don't really have access to more information than a regular reader (except that they can ask questions to which the authors have to respond, and most journals don't publish this exchange along with the final paper). Importantly, reviewers don't usually go through the data, or the code that was used to analyze it, to check that everything is correct. And even if they did, that doesn't necessarily mean they could detect deliberate fraud. A fraudulent data point doesn't look inherently different from a real one. So in the absence of anomalous patterns in the data, a reviewer will have a very hard time spotting this. </p>
<p>High-ranked journals don't use a fundamentally different peer-review procedure than less reputable ones. They often ask more senior, experienced people to review their manuscripts. But while these people have more extensive knowledge of the subject, they also have less time to examine the paper in detail, so any subtle methodological flaws may actually be more likely to slip through. Reviewers for these journals are also typically expected to hold the work to a higher standard (e.g. more control analyses, larger data sets, or convergent evidence from different experiments), but again, that doesn't really prevent deliberate deception (although it does make it a bit harder to fake the data consistently). But it's still up to the reviewer how they interpret that standard.</p>
<p>And that's really the main issue: it's just a few individuals shining their particular light on the work. So there is quite a bit of luck and subjectivity involved. The same paper may be accepted or rejected to the same journal, depending on who ends up reviewing it (or how well these reviewers slept the night before). It's an imperfect, subjective process, and not the rigorous, objective standard that it is often made out to be. And most importantly: it should never be the final arbiter. In the scientific community, the discussion doesn't end with peer-review - it would be more accurate to say that it begins with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, standards for publication in medical journals just seem to be very low. I assume this has something to do with the difficulty in performing more controlled studies, but it's really notable as someone from another field who occasionally reads medical papers.</p>
<p>The Wakefield et al. 1998 paper had a sample size of 12 and much of the data even as reported came from the anecdotal memory of those children's parents. These are issues that would have prevented the research being published in almost any other field and they're obvious just from reading the original paper itself, unlike the human subjects review violations and data fabrication that came out later. In my field (evolutionary biology and ecology) a paper like this <em>might</em> slip by in a very low-tier journal, but would get a near instant rejection at any high impact journal like anything equivalent to <em>The Lancet</em>. You honestly just wouldn't even try submitting it.</p>
<p>It's possible that these low standards are counter-balanced by greater skepticism among the target audience of medical papers. You could even make the argument that getting extremely uncertain information out early is necessary in medicine based on the precautionary principle. The problem is that the target audience is not the only audience of these papers any more and Wakefield et al. is hardly the only example of low quality medical research that ended up becoming a major problem once the public got wind of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tbh, they also published that absurd paper about using exercise to treat CFS/ME (can't remember which exactly) so I do wonder about their peer review standards. If you get someone too far outside the specific area, they're simply not going to pick up small things in methodology, and then add that to not having a statistician conduct review (I don't know about Lancet but this is something Nature mentioned as a common issue).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
