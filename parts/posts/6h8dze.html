		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question. It's such a natural thing we all know happens, I assumed the answer would be easy to find. Actually, it looks like we don't really know- although studies have confirmed what we all feel intuitively to be true, and performance at short-lasting exercises (sprints, cycle sprints, strength tests) are poorer in the morning than afternoon or evening. From <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/46030736/The_effect_of_training_at_a_specific_tim20160528-24442-e21gke.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1497471290&amp;Signature=3eaYmOqIfSxibG75j02YB2DcZks%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_Effect_of_Training_at_a_Specific_Tim.pdf" target="_blank">this review</a> here are some of the possible reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Body temperature: our core body temperature goes down when we sleep and goes up gradually when we wake up. It's possible that when we are warmer, our muscles do better because connective tissues move more freely, metabolic reactions occur more efficiently/quickly at their optimal temperature, muscles move more freely, and nerve impulses are even conducted slightly faster. This is supported by the fact that warming people up does seem to reduce the negative effect of morning, but warming up doesn't get rid of the effect completely, so it can't be the only problem. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes in the way the nervous system works overnight vs during the day: commands from the brain travel down nerves in the spine to nerves further out that tell the muscles to move. It looks like the &quot;command centre&quot; in the brain/spine is less active early in the morning <em>and</em> the peripheral nerves are not transmitting with the same effectiveness early in the morning as later on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using muscles and connective tissue over the day makes them work better: this one is the most obvious one- by evening, we have used our muscles more than early in the morning. All that movement likely stretches out muscles and connective tissue, increasing range of movement (just like warming up did in point 1, but this part is independent of temperature) and therefore reducing the effort needed to perform tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>Maybe complicated metabolic stuff: it looks like muscle work has more aerobic (oxygen + food -&gt; energy + carbon dioxide) vs anaerobic (food -&gt; much less energy + lactic acid) contribution in the afternoon/evening than the morning. Why? I don't know.</li>
</ol>
<p>So yeah. Complicated and interesting!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a doctor.  I seem to recall it has to do with your body preventing you from moving as you sleep to help you rest and relax - you don't want to thrash around and punch yourself in the face as you dream, so your body basically paralyzes you while you sleep.</p>
<p>This can take awhile to wear off, which is why you're weaker in the morning (after deep sleep).  This may also be the cause of sleep paralysis - you wake but your body is still in paralyzed mode, so you can't move.</p>
<p>I've been looking for references for this and can't find any; hopefully someone else can disprove / back this up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's not totally known why, but it's possibly to prevent your body from responding to your dream content either by direct cause or byproduct of something way back in the evolutionary process. When you wake up, it still takes some time for your brain to restore the chemical balance for being awake which means your muscles will still feel weak for a bit. This is similar to when you find it very difficult to wake up after a long night's rest; &quot;sleep inertia.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
