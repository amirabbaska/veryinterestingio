		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a scientist! So let me try to offer my insight:</p>
<p>So first of all, like every other job in the world, scientists need money in order to work on their projects/research. Unlike &quot;regular&quot; companies though, scientists don't really <em>sell</em> anything, so it's going to be hard to go to Wells Fargo and ask for money without being able to show them how you plan on paying them back.</p>
<p>Enter organizations like the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), NASA, the European Commission, and the list goes on. These organizations have many purposes, and one of them is to allocate researching funding to promising projects. What they'll do is, for example, put out a &quot;call for proposals&quot; and then allow scientists to apply for funding. For example, the NSF might put out a call for proposal on the subject of say &quot;childhood education.&quot;</p>
<p>So you're a scientist doing research in &quot;teenage education.&quot; You have a lot of experience on research in education in teenagers, and you think that you might be able to apply your work to education in children as well. You just don't have the time, or money, or staff, to actually do it. But now that there's this call for proposal, it's your chance! So you write a grant proposal which basically outlines what you are going to do, how you are going to do it, why you are going to do it, and a lot of other things are involved. Will your project involve any ethical considerations? You'll need to include documentation showing how you will follow ethical approvals, for example. You'll also need to submit some kind of budget guidelines. If you are requesting $500,000, how will this be used? $500,000 sounds like a lot, but in terms of research it's not really. The NSF might award you the grant for $500,000, but you need to keep in mind that this money is for the duration of the project. Do you need equipment (you will)? Do you need lab space (you do)? Do you need to hire new staff (you might)? New staff could be other researchers or grad students to help you. They need to get paid, after all, and so do you.</p>
<p>In the end: my point is: we <strong>need</strong> money just like everybody else. But unlike Boeing, and unlike Intel, and unlike Apple, or Google, etc... the money that I am asking for to do my project, actually has no promise of monetary return to my investors.</p>
<p>What I promise to return to the NSF, or to NASA, etc, is the promise of advancement in research. I do this by using the money to conduct experiments, and then publishing papers about it or giving talks at conferences. From the journal articles, other scientists will be able to follow my findings and either use it or try to test it etc and build upon their own research. From the conferences, I show things that are essentially &quot;works in progress&quot; but hey, maybe my idea is exactly what someone else was missing, and if they see me talk about it, they might come find me later on (or email) asking to collaborate. These are things that we <em>all</em> benefit from (we as in scientists), and these are essentially the &quot;returns&quot; that I promise to the NSF when I write my proposals.</p>
<p>When I publish or talk at conferences, I am talking to my peers. I am talking to colleagues. I am talking to scientists. When I talk to my peers, I would never make claims like &quot;this line of research can, <strong>will</strong>, definitely improve childhood education by 500%!&quot;</p>
<p>When I talk to my peers I am trying to discuss my work.</p>
<p>But when I am talking to media (be it the press, a TV program/interview, Twitter, my personal website/blog, message boards, or my university's press office, or hell, even my own non-scientist friends and family), I am not trying to discuss my work. <strong>I am trying to sell my work.</strong> I want to sell my work because, like I said, my work is entirely based on receiving money. Without money, there is no research, period. So I might exaggerate a tiny bit, or trump up all the benefits of what I'm doing and then throw in a very minute detail about how those gains are the theoretical maximum assuming that all the planets are aligned. I'm not really lying about anything, I'm just giving a, perhaps very, optimistic view of my research.</p>
<p>(After that, the journalists usually run off with it, and replace words like &quot;could maybe&quot; or &quot;might possibly&quot; into &quot;will definitely&quot; and so on.)</p>
<p>When I apply for funding, I like to think that the system is merit based, as in they'll review my track record and past research and so on. In general this is more or less true. So I'm not actually trying to sell my work to these agencies like NSF etc. Who I'm trying to sell to is to both the tax paying public and to the politicians in charge of appropriating money to the NSF. Since I am not making anything, or selling anything, I need to convince the public that their tax dollars are being used in a productive and/or beneficial manner. I need to convince the politicians not to defund the NSF, because I need that money to do my research. I need to convince the public that my work is crucial, vital even, so that they might complain loudly when a politician decides that they want to cut funding to the NSF.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beyond what people are writing about the huge investment these things take, the truth is often that these &quot;discoveries&quot; are nonsense.</p>
<p>For example, often you will hear a story about a &quot;miracle cure&quot; for such and such. But if you look deeper, the story is reporting on a lab experiment testing the drug in cells in vitro which may have a novel or promising mechanism of action...but that's a far cry from repeating its success in other studies, much less animals and much less demonstrating effectiveness in treating human diseases. While that does take years and some of these drugs are ultimately successful, the vast majority are abandoned down the pipeline because they aren't as effective as was hoped.</p>
<p>You see another version of this with claims about &quot;new drug treats so and so with virtually no side effects.&quot; That may be true in clinical trials when its given to a limited number of people...but once the drug hits the market, who gets it? Many many more people. Elderly. Children. Pregnant women. People of various ethnicities, not to mention just many more people with varying genetics. Everything has side effects and some of them are pretty darned serious.</p>
<p>You'll see articles about cures for cancer that are developed. But the stories are misleading because they are really talking about preliminary success in developing a new strategy to target one specific type of cancer. Even if it passes muster throughout its years of development its impact is going to be pretty limited. You'll probably never know of its usage unless you or someone you know eventually comes down with that specific disease.</p>
<p>For example, researchers in Glasgow and Hong Kong last year discovered that injecting a protein into mice brains could reduce amyloid plaques. That's important work. It's all well and good. But doctors aren't sure that amyloid plaques cause Alzheimer's or are just another symptom of the disease. In the unlikely event we find a way to increase the expression of this protein in human brains and in the unlikely event it removes 100% of amyloid plaques, it might turn out to have 0% effect on curing Alzheimer's...and it will be years before we find that out.</p>
<p>These stories are amazing because the media wants you to read their website so they publish interesting yet mundane stories in an overly sensational way.</p>
<p>EDIT: I did not mean the discoveries themselves were nonsense. I meant the media is overdrawing the conclusions of preliminary evidence to nonsensical levels. Should have phrased more carefully.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was a 'journo' I'd use sources like <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/" target="_blank">http://www.eurekalert.org/</a> to find nice stories that I could rewrite so they were unique and then promote them on social media sites.</p>
<p>Eurekalert is already Buzzfeedy in its headlines, and you can tell when you read a little deeper into the article that the research was not as groundbreaking as the headline makes it appear. It might be a mouse model, it might be just a survey of 2000 people, it might be a study involving 20 people. </p>
<p>Then when I wrote it up, I would purposefully try to avoid anything that highlighted how meaningless the study was, and I'd try to write something even more Buzzfeedy than the actual article. AIDS cure 'around the corner', 'Study: AIDS can be cured by bananas'. If I put some of the headline in 'snatch quotes', i.e. apostrophes, or put a colon indicating that someone had said something, i.e. 'Cameron: Fuck Daesh', then I would have covered my ass from misrepresenting the topic, provided I didn't totally misrepresent it.</p>
<p>And I was churning out 5,000 words a day, often researching and spinning a 200-word article in 20 minutes. I would honestly just skimread the original source, I'd only actually read it to fully understand it if I was personally interested in the research. Furthermore, my understanding of complicated science is nowhere near good enough to be able to criticise a scientific study, all I'd do is 'spin' it. Churnalism, it's called.</p>
<p>Shockingly, one of my skills is being able to push things to the top of Google search results. Quite often, when writing something more meaty, my research would be reading whatever was at the top of Google search results, which I know full well is written by someone who's just as big a moron as me and who's just as pressed for time as me.</p>
<p>tldr, the internet is a tapestry of bullshit.</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>Here's an example, in fact if I was spending 20 minutes on 200 words I would've spent 5 of them on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-11/aafc-hnc111615.php" target="_blank">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-11/aafc-hnc111615.php</a></p>
<p>See it's all full of confusing stuff but I might think 'this is the kind of thing people will read'. This doesn't comply with all the rules of news writing but it's pretty close:</p>
<p>Could e-cigarette users face a higher cancer risk than smokers?</p>
<p>Alternatives to tobacco, such as e-cigarettes, have become increasingly popular in recent years, and are much-touted for their health benefits.</p>
<p>However, a new study, which found that smokeless tobacco users have higher levels of carcinogens than smokers, could end any claims that alternatives to cigarettes are better for you than cigarettes themselves.</p>
<p>The research, which was published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, found people who use smokeless tobacco have higher levels of tobacco constituents cotinine, NNAL and other deadly toxins than people who exclusively smoked cigarettes.</p>
<p>Brian Rostron, PhD, an epidemiologist in the Center for Tobacco Products at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said that these biomarkers show that smokeless tobacco users face &quot;adverse health effects, including cancer&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Our findings demonstrate the need for continuing study of the toxic constituents of smokeless tobacco as well as their health effects on the individuals who use them,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>As well as e-cigarettes, other popular nicotine-replacement devices include snus, snuff and chewing tobacco.</p>
<p>PS it's all bullshit man, the study's about smokeless tobacco products, and I strongly assume that this means snuff and snus and chewing tobacco and that ecigs don't even count. But nobody's gonna sue me and it's the kinda thing people would share.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is huge amounts of misreporting in the media of scientific results. Media outlets are interested in sensation and views - actual medical research is incredibly dense, technical and therefore boring to many people. </p>
<p>For example, you often hear about cures for cancer. The problem is that cancers are incredibly complex with a vast variety among them. There maybe thousands of tiny molecules, each with a name and chemical formula, that researchers are studying. The 'breakthrough' may be showing that one of those compounds is elevated in x disease. What actually needs to occur for a real life change? They need to then figure out the causal relationships - I.e. Is the compound elevated as a cause of the disease? Or is it as a result of the disease? If we lower it, does the disease get better? Or is it useful as a marker of disease? If so, how can we measure it in people? Can we use a medicine to improve it?
Once there's finally a possible therapy, it's tested in animals and people and that takes forever. You also often hear about the successes but not the scientific failures (there are more failures than successes).</p>
<p>Other researchers then painstakingly research other compounds, using different methodologies, all in hope of very very slowly piecing together a coherent picture in order to achieve therapy. So basically, medical and scientific research more generally, is akin to carving away a wall with a spoon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacist-in-training here. </p>
<p>At least in the field of medicine, all new methods of treatment must be &quot;evidence based&quot; meaning someone has to take that new thing and compare it to the one currently available. As an example, comparing the how well the $5 epipen works against a typical $30 one. </p>
<p>For this reply, let's ASSUME the $5 epipen actually works and isn't a sham.</p>
<p>This process is called a &quot;Clinical Trial&quot; and often costs millions of dollars because you need to recruit hundreds, if not thousands, of people to use your $5 epipen or the $30 epipen and check back for results and such. This often requires hundreds of staff members, facilities, tools, and even the pens themselves, and if I'm not wrong, not many high-school students or even adults have millions of dollars they can invest into this process.</p>
<p>It's the same for the new omega antibiotic, cure for cancer, or protein to cure Alzheimer's Disease. Regardless of whether it works or not, in order for it to be regularly used, it takes years of work and lots of money, which is why these &quot;amazing discoveries&quot; are rarely followed-up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
