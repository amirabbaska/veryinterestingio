I've dived before a decent amount of time but never worked with rebreathers, how are they able to stay under for so long without adverse effects?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're suffocated by being locked in a small box, it's not actually the lack of oxygen which is the problem.</p>
<p>Normally the cycle is 20.9% oxygen, 0.04% CO2 in, then 16% oxygen 4% CO2 is exhaled.  </p>
<p>Inhaling 1% is very uncomfortable, &quot;stuffy&quot; air.  7%-10% CO2 is toxic and will lead to suffocation <em>even if there's sufficient oxygen</em>.   Excess CO2 will change blood pH and the body can't handle that.</p>
<p>So if you exhaled into a bag along with a tank of pure O2, well you could add the equivalent of +4% pure O2 on one side and vent out 4% of the volume of gas on the other side, but the CO2 mixed into the air so you don't remove the 4% CO2.  No, the new CO2 level after partial venting is 3.84%, still toxic.</p>
<p>So we're got 3 problems here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We can't maintain breathable air by just adding O2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can't breathe pure O2 when diving either, O2 is toxic at the increased pressures experienced while diving.  We can't dilute it with CO2 either, it can ONLY be diluted with nitrogen or (rarely) with helium.</p>
</li>
<li>We don't want to waste any volume of air here other than the CO2, but we can't just vent CO2 selectively.  Not only would we waste the remaining 16% O2, but a larger volume of inert nitrogen too, and we don't want to carry a huge volume of nitrogen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Same's true for spacecraft.  Spacecraft can't tolerate high O2 either because it makes everything super-flammable.</p>
<p>What we have is a CO2 scrubber of lithium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide.  These adsorb ONLY CO2 from the air and form a carbonate, this does reduce the volume of air and and equivalent volume of O2 can be added.  The nitrogen (78% on Earth, varies in diving and space ships) is not consumed nor regenerated.  The CO2 is literally &quot;scrubbed&quot; out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a certified rebreather diver. I dive the Poseidon MKVI and 7.</p>
<p>The rebreather machine is basically a Nitrox mixing machine on my back. One of the small bottles is 100% O2. The other is regular air. On the surface it feeds me the pure O2. As I dive it blends more and more air into the system to keep the gas safe to breath. </p>
<p>The breathing system is a closed loop. Bubbles only exit the system when I use the gas for buoyancy purposes. The O2 will get used up by my body to survive so there is a sensor that automatically replaces the O2 as my body metabolizes it.</p>
<p>The CO2 my body produces is deadly so there is a chemical in the system that absorbs that CO2. That's called the scrubber. Mine is a prepackaged sodalime chemical that I can buy at any rebreather specific dive shop.</p>
<p>That's about it. Rebreathers are great. They are totally silent. Fish don't run away when they see you. They seem to think you are just another fish instead of a bubble spewing monster. One very small 2L tank of O2 can last me three - four hours of diving. If you dive with regular divers that ends up being an entire weekend of 2 tank diving. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans don't exhale solely waste gasses - in reality, there is still some oxygen in the gas mix that you breath out. Rebreathers function by allowing this gas to be recycled, adding appropriate amounts of oxygen from the tank to the recycled air, and by filtering out gasses such as CO2 (IIRC). I can't give you any exact numbers, but this is my understanding from reading the Wikipedia page a while back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very simplified : </p>
<ul>
<li>breathing consume only a small part of the dioxygen in the inspired gasses, &quot;replacing&quot; it by CO2</li>
<li>So you still have O2 in the expired gasses, and it is mainly the CO2 which could become toxic when re-inspiring expired waste gasses.</li>
<li>Rebreather work by removing this CO2 from the expiring gasses, keeping them breathable</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the details are a lot more complicated than that (what is used for removing CO2, how to keep partial pressure of O2 high enough and so on), but the barebone principes are these.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
