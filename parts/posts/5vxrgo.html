		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Endocrine system generally, but it's also important connective tissue. Fat cells derive embryologically from mesoderm (there are three basic embryologic tissues). Also, you may be interested to know that there are two types of fat (let's call it adipose)-- white adipose and brown adipose. White adipose is typically what you think of when you consider fat. It's the stuff that's under your skin, in your belly, thighs, around your heart, kidneys, and etc. Brown adipose on the other hand tends to be around only when you are an infant, and it actually actively burns carbs and fat to create heat. It's brown because they contain iron rich mitochondria, which are the cellular machinery for burning through chemical energy. People have tried to harness / reactivate this stuff over time, and it's a pretty interesting research field in itself.</p>
<p>If you're interested in some peer reviewed lit on the subject, see: doi:10.1038/nm.3361 &quot;Brown and beige fat: development, function and therapeutic potential&quot;</p>
<p>As to your question about tissues not being strictly &quot;monogamous,&quot; there are tons of examples!-- blood, blood vessels, nerves, muscles all comprise important parts of various organs. Generally, various tissues compose an organ, and organs work together in organ systems to carry out a specific function. For example, renal tubules are a tissue but they work along side smooth muscle, blood vessels, neurons, and endocrine tissue in the kidneys (an organ), which are an important part of the renal or excretory system. The human body is a wonderful thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the body there are four types of tissues: connective, epithelial, nervous and muscle. Fat, otherwise known as adipose, is a loose connective tissue used to store fat cells. The purpose of fat is insulation, nutrient storage and cushioning. For example, there is a pad of fat that helps hold your eyes in place!
Recently, adipose has also been considered an endocrine organ! This means some people consider it an organ that releases hormones into our body!
I hope this helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Even this might be up for debate, as bone and cartilage play important roles in auditory transduction and sound localization (inner ear and pinna, respectively).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer is fat is important to several systems; endocrine, musculoskeletal, digestive to name a few.</p>
<p>Another example of a tissue that isnt just for one system is epithelia.  Epithelia makes up a lot of our integumentary system (so does subcutaneous fat) but it also lones our visceral organs so it is represented in respiratory, digestive, urogenital to name a few.</p>
<p>Just remember the heirarchy. multiple cells make up a tissue, multiple tissues make up an organ, multiple organs make up a system.  It also depends on what you mean when you say fat.  We have fat cells that make up our energy stores but we also have lipids that are made of fatty acids attached to a polar group, e.g. our cells have a outer membranes made up of a double layer of phospholipids.  Lipids also serve as various signaling molecules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fatty tissue consists of a delicate tangle of crystalline orbs of trigyceride suspended by a network of collagen fibers. It may be metabolically active, absorbing glucose and fatty acids from the blood stream and making TG as a calorie-dense storage. This activity is under endocrine control through membrane-bound receptors mostly. These cells do not divide but get larger and smaller as they store and release TG. In some cases fatty organs surround other organs for mechanical protection and are free of receptors and don't do much but sit there absorbing life's blow. A rare form of adipocytes, brown fat, makes heat by short circuiting oxphos in mitochondria. Little mammal use it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
