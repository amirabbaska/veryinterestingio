		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our stress response is usually the old fight or flight, we face a threat,e.g a bear, adrenaline gets released, hearts beat faster, lots of other stress hormones like cortisol get released, blood is diverted from your gut to your muscles, which is where the digestive issues come from, cortisol also raises your blood sugar so that you have the energy to run or fight. In todays world we don't face many bears, deadlines, annoying bosses, traffic all cause us stress, But there is no physical threat to deal with but all these hormones are still there, almost like revving up the engine with the brakes on, over time this upsets your digestive system, effects blood sugar levels, blood pressure and heart. If you exercise, especially when stressed, you are putting these systems to their original use, and use up the hormones, sugar etc, and exercise your cardiovascular system and muscles, adrenaline and cortisol levels drop and you are less stressed,  I like to imagine that the endorphin high after exercise is knowing that you escaped that bear!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're mentioning two different kinds of stress.</p>
<p>The feeling of stress is our &quot;fight or flight&quot; response. Our ancestors developed this response to get rid of or run away from what is causing stress (like a sabertooth tiger chasing us) so we can stay alive. </p>
<p>However, our stress nowadays usually comes from more abstract things. Am I what I wanted to be? Am I making enough money? What do people think of me? All these stressors activate our sense of fight or flight but this response often does not fit the situation. Except in certain sports, you can't fight others to get more money and running away from problems means they usually become worse.</p>
<p>The other type of stress is physical stress. This is studied in material science and mechanical engineering. It measures how much bending/stretching/twisting something can take before it loses its shape, becomes damaged, or breaks. Our bodies are physically stressed when we exercise. Muscle cells get small tears with use but our bodies will repair them to be stronger.</p>
<p>The feeling of stress and physical stress on our muscles are tied together. When we feel the fight or flight response, our bodies go into a high alert state. By using our muscles during this state, the physical stress will cause some tears to our muscles. This action releases endorphins, chemicals that make us feel relaxed to cancel out our alerted state. Combined, our bodies are essentially telling us &quot;Do something physical to escape! Once you do so, you'll feel better!&quot;</p>
<p>That is why when we are feeling stressed, physical stressing of our bodies can make us feel more relaxed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Idk if it's been mentioned, but you are right that there should be a term other than &quot;stress&quot; and luckily, it's been done!</p>
<p>The words <em>eustress</em> and <em>distress</em> are used to denote stress that is good for you and stress that is bad for you, and while not perfect, it basically sorts things into stresses that you choose, have control over and lead to growth or increased health.</p>
<p>physical eustress could be running or playing a sport, while mental eustress is could be things like reading, playing chess, redecorating</p>
<p>Distress is a lot easier for most people to identify, as that's our colloquial understanding of stress</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's mental stress and there's physiological stress (your cells are freaking out). Exercise creates physiological stress, because you have to produce more energy to do it. It's typically at pretty low levels, unless you're super intense, which is why it leads to beneficial recovery instead of just trashing you. This type of physical stress leads to the endorphin release other commenters have mentioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
