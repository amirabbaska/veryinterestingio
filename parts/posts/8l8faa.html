		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are number systems which do just as you describe. Here are two (I don't know of others) such examples of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectively_extended_real_line" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectively_extended_real_line</a></p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is the extension by defining z/0 in the complex plane.</p>
<p>A lot of the math rules are the same as you're used to, but there are important differences. For example in the projectively extended reals statements such as</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a &gt; b</p>
</li>
<li>a set of all numbers between -4 and 7 is [-4...-1...0...7]</li>
</ul>
<p>are no longer meaningful without extra context. I can always pass through infinity to just as easily write</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a &lt; b</p>
</li>
<li>a set of all numbers between -4 and 7 is [-4...-10...infinity...7]</li>
</ul>
<p>With some added assumptions of what &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are and where infinity is on your interval if it's included, you can restore the idea of order and intervals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many good answers already, but I think there's a simpler one that has to do with inverses.</p>
<p>An inverse is a sort of mathematical undo, it reverses the action of some function.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking of division and subtraction as operations, think of them as inverse multiplication and addition.</p>
<p>When you see <code>5 + x = 7</code> we can solve this using an inverse: <code>x = 5 + x + (-5) = 7 + (-5) = 2</code>. We can construct the integers from the naturals by <em>closing</em> the addition operation through the extension of negative numbers.</p>
<p>When we try the same thing with multiplication, we get the rational numbers. Given <code>x * 3 = 6</code> we can use the multiplicative inverse of 3, one third, to solve the equation: <code>x * 3 * (1/3) = x = 6 * (1/3) = 2</code>.</p>
<p>We cannot actually close the rationals under multiplication, because of zero. The closest thing to do is take the set of rational numbers except for zero and treat this as a multiplicative group.</p>
<p>Since zero times anything is zero, we have <code>0*x = 0</code>. Since <code>x = 5</code> is just as valid a solution as <code>x = -1</code>. Since no unique solution for <code>x</code> gets determined by the equation, there's no way to assign a consistent value to the multiplicative inverse of zero.</p>
<p>TL;DR: zero times anything is zero, so it's impossible to undo that multiplication and figure out what you started with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you define i such as iÂ²=-1, you can just use it the same way as any real constant, and keep doing math.</p>
<p>If you define a constant to be equal to 1/0 and try to keep doing math with it, you will find contradictions at every corner. First quick example to come in mind: if we call it b (why not), then 1/b is, obviously 0, but what is 1/(b+1)? If it is zero, then b+1=b so 1=0. If it is not, then you just found a finite value for b.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that x*0=0 for all x so if you invert multiplication then x=0/0 also for all x. This contains no information. If you allow this you can &quot;prove&quot; things like 1=2 (All those wrong proofs contain a hidden division by zero)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Try it.  Let's say any number divided by 0 is some constant, c:</p>
<p>1 / 0 = c</p>
<p>now let's multiply both sides by some number, say 5...</p>
<p>5 <em> (1/0) = 5 </em> c
5 / 0 = 5 * c</p>
<p>since any number divided by zero = c, we have:</p>
<p>c = 5 * c</p>
<p>So c must equal zero.</p>
<p>But if we regard dividing by zero as a valid operation, we end up with things like this:</p>
<p>3 &lt; 5
3/0 &lt; 5/0
0 &lt; 0</p>
<p>Basically it breaks all the other rules that we have declared and derived that form algebra as we know it, so we must specifically disallow it to make everything else work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
