<p>But, the same way any person not familiar with one language becomes familiar with that language - trial, error, and guidance by someone fluent in said language. Every one of us as a child learned to understand and speak a language they weren't born with the knowledge of. As with children, things like the names for objects are the easiest as you can just point at an object and say the name. Eventually concepts get much more advanced, but learning doesn't happen overnight and it's built off of previous lessons learned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin</a></p>
<p>They usually start when a trader moving along the coast stops to trade with locals and there's no common tongue. You point to your mouth, then hold up some fancy thing you want to trade. Eventually a few words will become obvious, then an ad hoc grammar can develop.</p>
<p>A couple dozen return trips from the traders, and since neither group has been practicing each other's language the pidgin you've developed and used becomes more and more structured, eventually becoming a blend of the original two that's a little easier to pick up on. </p>
<p>No one's writing poetry or telling stories in these improvised tongues, just as long as it's good enough to trade this gunpowder for that silk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm willing to bet that if you take 2-10 people than don't share a common language and put them together in an isolated place. Given time, be it 1 week or 1 month, they will eventually be able to community. It's about establishing common words.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
