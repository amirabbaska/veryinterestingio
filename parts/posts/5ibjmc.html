<p>First, the &quot;signal strength&quot; bar on your phone is entirely the receiving signal from the tower to your phone.</p>
<p>Second, sending data from your phone to the cell tower is one of the most power intensive things that your phone does. Simply being closer to the tower and being able to use a lower transmission power will greatly increase your phone's battery life.</p>
<p>Third, the cell phone tower has the advantage of being in an ideal location, high up with good line-of-sight to a large area. Plus, they have much better antennas than your phone so they can pick out much weaker signals than your phone can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Cell towers require the same amount of power to send a radio signal to your phone that your phone needs to send the radio signal to the tower. However the difference is the phone mast may have to talk to hundreds if not thousands (In some urban areas it can be tens of thousands) of mobile phones, so it needs a lot of power to talk to them all.</p>
<p>Think of it as a crowded room where every person in the room is trying to speak to this one guy, and this one guy is trying to speak back to everyone. You get the idea of how much busier that one guy is as he's having a one to many conversation whereas everyone else is having a one to one conversation.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, your little phone that fits in your pocket can broadcast a radio signal the <strong>exact</strong> same distance that a phone mast can, the range of which varies wildely depending on the frequency and modulation of the signal which could be a whole other ELI5 in itself.</p>
<p>The tower might have a slight advantage as they are often put in high locations to avoid intereference from other objects, whereas your phone has to go through buildings and whatnot. However given a completely level playing field, your phone will broadcast a signal the exact same distance the cell-tower will.</p>
<p>This is important that it works like this because unlike a radio broadcasting station, a cellular phone call requires two way interactivity. It's no good if the mast transmits a signal further than the phone can transmit because in laymans terms, it means you will be able to receive data or voice to the phone, but you won't be able to send any voice or data back because the phone can't transmit that far!!!! Also, there are laws regarding transmission power it has to respect.</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/8X0dM" target="_blank">I made this graphic quickly so it gives a visual idea of why both the phone and the cell tower have to be able to transmit at the same amount of power.</a></p>
<p>To avoid this scenario, mobile phone masts are often located close enough to each other that they are well inside the broadcast range of your mobile device.</p>
<p>Interestingly, though this is becoming less and less valid with the onset of certain technologies, your phone generally does not alter the strength of its signal no matter how close you are to the tower. Because of this, the tower is able to make a very close guess as to your exact location which is actually recorded and can be accessed by the authorities if need be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Cell towers can have larger, more sensitive antennas and so accommodate the lower-power transmitter in a cell phone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>hello, i'm a telecom engineer and this is my forte.</p>
<p>there is 2 play of marvelous engineering here.</p>
<p>1) being that transmission of radio frequency that have been onto a carrier can travel very far with little power. this is enough for the antenna in your phone to reach the radio tower, telecom is such that at all times(i'm speaking as per regulatory requirements.. some telco do not follow it...) there much be a triangulation toward a user. this mean that, right now, there are 3 radio tower near you, they form a triangle around you. you are closest with 1 of that tower and is using it's resource. this in telelcom is call cell planning. which later you learn of how to do a cell sectorization for a better planning. </p>
<p>2) telecom also make use of physical properties of radio bands. have you wonder why a hgher megahertz is always cater for downlink to phone and a lower megahertz is cater for phone to do uplink? </p>
<p>downlink require highpower which the base station and radio tower will do their job since they are connected to electricity port. so they are catered with higher band for example (935.0 – 960.0mhz) and on the phone since we are using battery and we only need to tell network what we want and other signals like ack,nack,re-transmit etc, the uplink frequency from phone is (890.0 – 915.0mhz).</p>
<p>for this if you want me to explain further, radio frequency goes by cycle per second, so 1 hertz = 1 cycle. </p>
<p>now 1 cycle can contain 1 bit of data, hence 8 cycle = 1byte worth of data.</p>
<p>it also mean that it have to produce 8 action in 1 seconds! this would require a higher power to produce at that instance!. so now look at a GSM 900MHZ spectrum, the differences in megahertz is at least a 60mhz, that is like 60million cycle of power to save!</p>
<p>ALSO, that the higher the frequency is, the easier it will be attenuated. so having the higher band with radio tower is the best combination since power can overcome this problem.</p>
<p>so you have it. it is a combination of how the radio tower is located, and how standards from GSM/3GPP were planned out to give such good results!</p>
<p>to add on... the lower the frequency is, the longer the coverage is. example were like ground wave, skywave etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In radio communication, channel capacity (i.e., how fast the connection is) is a function of bandwidth and signal to noise ratio. So you can increase channel capacity by either increasing the amount of bandwidth you allocate to the channel, or by increasing the amount of power you broadcast at (increasing the signal to noise ratio).</p>
<p>To allocate more bandwidth, you need to license more spectrum per user, which is expensive. But, there's a maximum amount of power you can use in your transmissions: there's limits on battery life to consider, as well as legal limits on how much power a handset is allowed to radiate into a user's body. There are also limits on how much power a base station is allowed to transmit at (a lot less than you probably expect), but they aren't anywhere nearly as restricted as handsets.</p>
<p>As an engineer designing the system, your company has bought a fixed amount of spectrum to work with. You need to allocate some bandwidth for use by the base station to communicate with phones, and some bandwidth for use by phones to communicate with the base station. To maximize overall channel capacity you give most of the spectrum to the phones, and make up for it in the base station by running it at higher power.</p>
<p>A final point is that a base station, having more power and being physically much larger than a handset, can use better amplifiers and signal processing on the signal it receives from a handset. So it can &quot;do more with less&quot; so to speak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
