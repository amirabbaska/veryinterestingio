		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit! We are some of the many organizers for <a href="http://einstein.wvu.edu" target="_blank">Celebrating Einstein</a>, a month-long, interdisciplinary outreach event that includes spoken lectures, danced lectures, readings, interviews with physcists, symphony performance, field trips for West Virginia schools, artistic interpretations of Einstein's theories, and more. Over 100 years ago, Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves, and we are just beginning to detect them now. Our goal is to communicate the beauty and significance of Einstein's theory of General Relativity, its predictions, and the recent detection of gravitational waves announced only last year with the public. Check out our <a href="http://einstein.wvu.edu/" target="_blank">website</a> for a full list of the events we've organized, and we'd love to talk about the science, the outreach, the organization, or anything!</p>
<p>We have four organizers from the physicist/astronomer side joining us today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sarah Burke-Spolaor is a professor of astronomy at WVU. She was a postdoctoral researcher in Socorro, NM, working with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory Very Large Array. She works on electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave sources and fast radio bursts.</li>
<li>Kristina Islo is a graduate student in the Leonard Parker Center for Gravitation, Cosmology, and Astrophysics at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. As a member of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves, she studies the gravitational wave astrophysics possible with pulsar timing array experiments as well as the statistical methods used to detect signals from supermassive binary black holes.  </li>
<li>Michael Lam is a postdoctoral researcher in the WVU Physics and Astronomy Department and a member of the Center for Gravitational Waves and Cosmology. He is currently working with the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) collaboration. His current area of research is on characterization of NANOGrav's gravitational wave detector, an array of pulsars distributed throughout the galaxy. He received his Ph.D. from Cornell University in 2016.</li>
<li>Laura Sampson is a postdoctoral researcher at Penn State University. She received her doctorate at Montana State University and worked previously at the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA) at Northwestern University. She is one of only five nationwide recipients of the 2015 L'Oreal USA &quot;For Women in Science&quot; Fellows. </li>
</ul>
<p>We'll be on starting at 12 PM ET (17 UT), so ask us anything! </p>
<p><a href="http://celebratingeinstein.org/" target="_blank">Celebrating Einstein</a> was originally produced by Montana State University and the eXtreme Gravity Institute. The West Virginia Celebrating Einstein event is sponsored through NSF award number 1458952, the WVU Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy, the WVU School of Theatre &amp; Dance, the West Virginia Space Grant Consortium, and the WVU Eberly College of Arts &amp; Sciences.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Will you be focusing exclusively on the professional side of Einstein's life and his scientific acconplishments, or reaching out wider to educate people about his personal and political life? Most school kids can at least connect the name Einstein to relatovity and e=mc^2, as reductuonist as that is of his lifetime of breakthroughs, but far fewer people know some of the extremely interesting stories from the other side of his life. From marshalling the scientific community to support the Manhattan project despite his deep reservations about war, to penning <a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/" target="_blank">a brilliant defense of Socialism</a>, to declining the offer to be the first president of Israel due to his pacifism and devotion to human rights, Einstein lived a complete life in every sense of the word. He has been one of my biggest heroes since Inwas a kid, and knowing these stories made it much easier to remember that a human being accomplished these scientific feats, not the kind of genius demigod that our pop-cultural image of Einstein traditionally conjures</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just read the Walter Isaacson biography of Einstein. I had no clue that he left his wife and essentially abandoned his young kids to marry his own cousin. Then, he openly cheated on and embarrassed his second wife for the remainder of his life. </p>
<p>I see parallels with John Lennon in that Einstein is a celebrated public figure, whose personal life has been a bit whitewashed. One of his kids ended up in a mental institution, partly because of his world famous father completely ignoring him. </p>
<p>I'm in my 40's and through traditional news blurbs on Einstein never knew any of this. Why is it that this part of his character is forgotten? Should he be completely celebrated as a hero without acknowledging him as a whole? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
