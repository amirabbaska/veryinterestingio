		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>African blue dragonflies travel from AUS&gt;Africa&gt;&gt;aus&gt;africa on a yearly cycle, 11,000 miles over the ocean.</p>
<p>In the US you'll recognize them along Gulf coast states, as the Grey or Blue Darner (no studies have been done to track N.American migration patterns)</p>
<p>both adults make the trip, and breed along the way for the next generation to follow - adults can live 3-5 YEARS, Nymphs can live for 3-5 years before they ever spread their wings, so the large dragonflies you see could be up to
10 years old.</p>
<p>(its both a generational and a lifetime journey, they dont settle.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A British study was done on this using radar to track insects flying:</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/12/researchers-use-radar-to-track-3-5-trillion-insects-migrating-over-england/" target="_blank">https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/12/researchers-use-radar-to-track-3-5-trillion-insects-migrating-over-england/</a></p>
<p>&quot;The travel speed of these larger insects indicated that they weren't simply passively riding the wind. They reached speeds of between 30 and 60 kilometers an hour, which suggested that they were actively flying along with the wind. The authors note that, in just a few hours, these insects would be able to cover over 200km.&quot;</p>
<p>Another big surprise of the study was the pure volume of insects, 3.5 trillion insects over the course of a year migrating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It varies a lot. Most non-migratory ants for instance never venture more than a few meters from the place they're born.</p>
<p>Others travel considerable distances. Monarch butterflies, for instance, migrate 2500 miles to survive the winter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
