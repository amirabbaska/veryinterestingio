<p>ATT also called their hspa+ 4G in order to compete with Verizon and Sprint who actually had 4G. </p>
<p>I had an iPhone 4S when ATT changed my service from 3G to 4G by changing the wording on the display, not actually changing my speeds :(</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When your phone displays 4G it means it's using an HSPA+ connection. HSPA+ doesn't meet the 4G standards (it's an upgraded 3G standard) but LTE does. Some American carriers decided to market hspa+ as 4G in order to compete with other networks who had true 4G (LTE). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>4G is the name given to a group of technical standards which are able of operating at a specific speed. At the time that the naming was developed, this was 1 Gbps (1000 Mbps) at the cell tower. Signals designed to achieve that speed could be called 4G. The main example is LTE-Advacned (LTEA).</p>
<p>In practice, what has happened is that a lot of cell networks are using 4G as branding or as a buzzword. </p>
<p>The first 3G technology has gone through a lot of revisions, gaining performance as it has been upgraded. It started with UMTS, then got HSDPA data, which was upgraded to HSPA, and then HSPA+.</p>
<p>However, LTE was a big step forward compared to these technologies, so a lot of networks and phone manufacturers started branding it 4G, even though technically it is not a 4G technology.</p>
<p>These days, some carriers are even branding HSPA+ as 4G, even though it is a big step back from LTE.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
