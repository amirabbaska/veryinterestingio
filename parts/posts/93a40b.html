		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Between fermentation &amp; distilation, there should be virtually zero carbs in hard alcohol.  The body, however, breaks down alcohol for energy and <em>that</em> is what causes problems for diabetics &amp; weight gain.</p>
<p>A shot of vodka is roughly 100 calories.  If you eat &quot;normally&quot; (ie - all you &quot;need&quot;) and then have a few drinks every night, those calories add up over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol is metabolized before carbohydrates. It has a complicated effect on glucose use. People who drink moderate amounts of spirits like whiskey or vodka have lower rates of Type 2 diabetes. Drink alcohol with lots of sugar, though, and you can send your blood sugar sky high. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest way to understand why ethanol, the drinkable alcohol that doesn't leave you blind (<del>isopropanol</del>methanol; thanks /u/Iceman_259 for catching that) or in acute liver failure (<del>methanol</del>isopropanol), is understand a bit of organic chemistry first.</p>
<p>What is a carbohydrate? Well, H2O is water; carbon is C. Slam those together and you get <strong>CH2O</strong> (this particular compound is formaldehyde, a lethal liquid used for fixing tissues often in the form of formalin or 10% formaldehyde). If we, however, add a factor to our simple carbohydrate, we begin to see familiar compounds, such as C6H12O6, or glucose, which can be read as 6(CH2O) which has a factor of 6.</p>
<p>Energy, which is kept in the bonds of sugars/carbohydrates (table sugar, or sucrose, C12H22O11), is how we derive energy. Anything we can consume which we can break the bounds of near a mitochondria will give use energy (although, there is plenty in that category which will also kill us in the process, so don't get any ideas).</p>
<p>Moving from organic chem into biology: the break down in sugars (among other methods) allows us to create energy. This is accomplished via what's known as <em>glycolysis</em> and the <em>citric acid cycle</em>. We can turn glucose (C6H12O6) into two pyruvate (C3H6O3), which undergoes several biological magic, which produces NADH and some ATP. ATP, or <strong>a</strong>denosin <strong>t</strong>ri<strong>p</strong>hosphate, is the molecule which we use to move energy around cells (and our body as a whole). It is the most well known energy currency. We generate more ATP and NADH in the citric acid cycle. It is the NADH which moves off to the membrane of the mitochondria which allows for the electron transfer (all energy, or kJ/Kcal, in biology is about electron transfer) and produce the majority of our energy for cooking, thinking, and somersaults. </p>
<p>Back to ethanol. It is broken down in the liver by a specific enzyme, called alcohol dehydrogenase (the <em>-ase</em> suffix denotes that this is an enzyme). This breaks alcohols down into acetaldehyde (or the hangover compound). Breakdown of acetaldehyde leads to acetate, which leads back into the citric acid cycle. Said differently, alcohol is a sugar with a hydroxyl group that can lead to energy production, but at significant energy cost to break down.</p>
<p>Now, that's energy from alcohol. Question is, <em>how does it impact weight and insulin</em>? The short answer is... well, not that short. If you were to live off of only alcohol, you wouldn't have weight gain. Despite it being a drug which requires a stupidly high dose to be effective (30g+) there isn't enough energy from alcohol alone to furnish your body. Moreover, the lack of nutrition and increased acetate in the body quickly leads to neurological problems, such as Korsikof's Syndrome. Alcohol, however, is a stressor on the body, which leads to stress responses in many systems except the brain, which it acts as a neurologic depressant. The body is very good an anticipatory actions, such as anticipate incoming food and releasing insulin and other digestive enzymes and hormones.</p>
<p>Weight gain with alcohol comes from three sources: first, damage to the liver, which modifies the body's ability to process particular toxins which leads to lipogensis to manage, in a round about way, the increased toxic load in the circulation (fat cells act as buffers/storage areas for some toxins, one hilarious example is psilocybin, or 'magic mushrooms', which is only funny when you ate it 10 years ago and now are experiences high enough g-forces that it forces it out of fat cells and into circulation again--this is why a fighter pilot can <strong>never</strong> have consumed them, else you'd get a tripping pilot in a $50million aircraft with bombs).</p>
<p>Second, we <em>tend</em> to drink socially or with food. This is the empty calories argument. Simply, the alcohol provides us enough energy that the body see benefit in storing excess from a portion of the meal. When we eat more food, we end up with enough glucose coursing around that the lipocytes get their fill of glucose, which via <em>de novo</em> lipogensis, turn into medium chain fatty acids. Moreover, our response to drinking the night before is to consume certain foods which we might otherwise avoid to cure that hangover.</p>
<p>Third, we <em>tend</em> to be less active following moderate drinking and moreso after heavy drinking. This activity gap, which can manifest in many ways in people's lives, can lead to what is known as the <em>fuel partitioning problem</em>. It's difficult and even more long winded to get into, but the gist is that the body, with excess glucose and insulin, will eventually stop accepting as much insulin to move glucose into cells--except for lipocytes. This means the body preferentially stores glucose rather than spend it.</p>
<p>Okay, so this was long. Hopefully it had the parts in there that help one understand that it not as straight forward as &quot;drink and you get fat&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Despite not having carbs or sugars, alcohol itself still has some Calories present in it (around 7 Calories/gram; which is almost <em>double</em> that of carbs or protein). These calories can impact your weight just like any other calories can (and in fact are pretty bad, because they are basically the most empty calories in existence as hard liquor has literally zero nutritional value besides those calories).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
