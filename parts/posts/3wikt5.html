		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The truth is that we really don't know. Actually believe it or not we aren't <em>completely</em> certain that humans and chimpanzees can't still interbreed. Other animals that are separated by similar evolutionary time and with more divergent chromosome structure can make (usually infertile) offspring. Just good luck getting past the ethics board for that study.</p>
<p>Edit:
Thanks for all the interest in my post.  For all those mentioning the Russian studies early in the 20th century, they used Orangutans which are substantially more distantly related than chimps, so they prove nothing.</p>
<p>I had never heard of Chimps being used as sex slaves.  If this does indeed happen then it makes it much less likely that a hybrid is biochemically possible, though it might still be depending on what the barrier is.  For example it might be an inability of the sperm to penetrate the egg, and it might work with the genders reversed. If zygotes are being formed and simply dying early in cell division than there is likely a fundamental genetic issue.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question. The most precise answer is, we're not really sure. </p>
<p>100000 years ago, you would have been mating with a modern human. At least there would be so little genetic difference that your mate would look the same, have functionally compatible DNA, and could even learn to communicate with you using your native language.</p>
<p>200000 years ago, you could have been meeting with homo neatherthalensis. We know this occurred, and you probably still have some of their DNA in you. We're not sure if you could have communicated, at least on a modern language level, but your potential mate's brain size and throat bone structure indicates that you could have at least dated minimally.</p>
<p>1 million years ago, you could have tried mating with Homo erectus. From the neck down you couldn't tell whether or not your mate was a modern human, but I wouldn't recommend kissing that small head with sharp teeth. Chances are that you could produce a viable offspring, the compatible DNA would make a mosaic of traits that would primarily affect the head and brain. You potentially could produce a super smart Homo erectus, or a much less than normal intelligence modern human.</p>
<p>2 million years ago, you would be attempting to woo Homo ergaster or habilis. Unless you really like a hairy mate, you'll have a hard time finding anyone attractive by modern standards. This is also the point of wild speculation, there's a chance you could produce a viable offspring, but you would probably run into several genetic stops that would prevent the fetus from coming to term. If you could pull it off, I would assume the child would be like a mule, sterile.</p>
<p>3 million years ago, you would be meeting Australopithecus africanus. At this point I'm going to say that you're not going to be able to produce a viable offspring, in fact I'd be impressed if you could even mate without having your head torn off. Your partner would be much smaller, but have a lot more muscle power, would also be far more violent than you're used to from a modern human.</p>
<p>Of course all this is said with the knowledge that at one point, well a million years, what became the human species interbreed with what later became chimpanzees. That was a long time ago though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is most likely. Homo as a genus first appeared about 2 - 2.5 million years ago. That included different human species at that point like <em>Homo neanderthalensis</em> . Modern humans are though to have appeared around  200,000 years ago so you'd almost for sure be able to breed with them. </p>
<p>Evidence suggest that early Homo <em>sapiens, neanderthals and denisovans</em> all had 23 pars of chromosomes as you do, so you'd have a good chance  making some weird babies with them too, as a modern human.  </p>
<p>I'd assume we look different from them, selection will change or appearance and even some physical features over that much time but realistically modern humans and ancient other/early human species are all still human.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It makes me wonder based on this comment and others comments, if it makes any difference, in which sex the two are. Meaning, is it possible that cross breeding with any species, may work one direction and not the other. Like a male chimp/neadrathal with modern day female. Or female chimp/neandrathal with modern day males sperm? Maybe one direction would fail, but the other would succeed? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
