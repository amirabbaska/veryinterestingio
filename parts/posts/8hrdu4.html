		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>osmosis.</p>
<p>Freshwater dwellers have salty blood relative to the water around them. Without a mechanism in place to control it, osmosis would equalise salt concentrations between the animal and the water surrounding it, pumping salt out of the body and flooding it with freshwater. A sodium pump, like that found in freshwater fish species, uses chloride cells on the gill surface to actively absorb sodium and potassium ions from the environment. Any excess water taken in at the same time is excreted as urine.</p>
<p>Marine dwellers have the opposite problem, and need to conserve fresh water while expelling salt. Cephalopods pump seawater through their gills and use their kidneys to filter out fresh water from the ocean. Salts and waste water are channelled through the funnel.</p>
<p>ie, they never developed a sodium pump that would help them cope with osmotic change in freshwater.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mollusks and gastropods evolved freshwater forms (and the latter even terrestrial ones), but cephalopods weren't pressured into adapting to that.</p>
<p>The adaptations to deal with osmosis are also very diverse and novel across different clades: crabs pretty much have seawater as plasma, sharks have their blood and tissues full of urea to act as a tampon, bony fish pump salt out through their gills, sauropsids have damn fine salt glands that produce brine jelly (crocodile tears, but sea turtles and sea birds also have them), cetaceans have the same adaptations as CAMELS to deal with the lack of freshwater and only get water from their prey... really interesting bit of comparative physiology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I've done some digging on this one, it's a really interesting question because other molluscs (snails and clams) <em>have</em> invaded freshwater.  So why not cephalopods?</p>
<p>I don't have a solid answer for you, but I do have a hypothesis:</p>
<p>The main issue for invertebrates in freshwater is maintaining sufficient concentration of salts in the body while preventing too much water from coming in.  Cells are saltier than freshwater, and water wants to diffuse from less salty to more salty.  Stick a standard marine animal in freshwater, and a bunch of water rushes into the animal.  The animal needs to eliminate the water, but loses salts along with it.  To live in freshwater, you need some sort of osmoregulatory organ...something that can isolate and retain salts in the body while excreting water.  Freshwater shrimp and worms have such organs.  Squid and octopus apparently don't....but why can their relatives the snails and clams manage while they can't?</p>
<p>Well....it turns out that mollusks are pretty crappy at osmoregulation.  Freshwater clams and snails mostly deal with freshwater environments by....having really low salinities <em>in</em> their tissues.  The difference between internal and external concentrations are lower, and therefore easier for the animals to deal with.   But....the very ions they have at lower concentrations are the ones that are used for nerve signaling.  I couldn't find any studies specifically addressing this, but it's <em>plausible</em> that the reason snails and clams can invade freshwater but cephalopods can't is that cephalopods rely on fast and complex neural action, while snails and clams...don't.  Therefore, snails and clams can afford to operate at low nerve signaling efficiency brought on by low salinity tissues  in freshwater while squid and octopus can't.  </p>
<p>If nobody's studied this directly, it'd make a pretty good project I think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Not really freshwater but not quite ocean salinity either.</p>
<p>It's interesting they supposedly get bigger/nicer with less salty water. Even though freshwater would kill them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
