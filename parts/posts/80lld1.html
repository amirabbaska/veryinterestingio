		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe that is a tricky question.
Elephants, dolphins and crows mourn their dead, and this behavior is probably also seen in other animals that I’m not aware.
They are very clever animals though so they may be unique in that sense.
Koko is also a gorilla who was taught sign language, and there was a video were when asked where her pet went she answered with sadness and what seemed like comprehension (I do not remember the actual “words” Koko used though).
I believe it’s impossible to actually prove if they know know, but it seems possible for the most clever ones I guess.
I’m sure someone else will answer better than me, but that’s what I know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You'll get a lot of answers that don't actually address your question.  They'll say things like: &quot;Animals X and Y display a behavior that we anthropocentrically interpret as 'mourning the dead'&quot;.  Or possibly: &quot;animals that are near death tend to isolate themselves as if they know they're going to die&quot;.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have absolutely no idea what ANY animal is &quot;aware of&quot; in terms of their conscious experience.  Their bodies are clearly aware of death in some respects.  But their internal mental awareness of mortality is likely very limited, just like their awareness of any other long-term causal chain of events.  Non-human animals are generally not capable of the kind of predictive causal reasoning that humans are.  You can get certain human-like behaviors out of the more intelligent species, but many of these occur under contrived laboratory conditions (ape language, etc.).</p>
<p>When your pet dog or cat is nearing death, for example, it is highly likely that any behaviors you interpret as &quot;knowledge of their impending death&quot; are just instinctive biologically driven actions with no mental component that would correspond to &quot;awareness of this leading to or being caused by my impending death&quot;.  For most animals, most things that happen to them are &quot;just happening&quot;.  They may be &quot;feeling bad&quot; without knowing that their existence is coming to an end in any concrete way (which is something we humans may have reason to be envious of).</p>
<p>Now, all that being said, it is certainly possible that non-human animals have <em>different kinds</em> of awareness of death than humans - e.g. awareness that does not include our human like notion of abstract causality.  This is getting a bit philosophical and speculative, so I'll keep it brief.  The emotional content of the death-related behaviors of non-human animals is essentially off limits to us (see Nagel's 'What is it Like to be a Bat?').  So it is within the realm of possibility that a corvid, for example, might have some special kind of knowledge about it's own death (or the death of other corvids) that we are simply incapable of understanding at present in the same way that we are incapable of understanding the knowledge of a bee who is interpreting another bee's &quot;waggle dance&quot; (bees use this to convey info on water/pollen sources).  What we see externally are the behaviors, not the experience (or the knowledge that comes with that experience).  But now we begin to butt up against the deepest unsolved problems in science and philosophy.  Just what <em>is</em> experience?  How does it relate an organism's biology?  A paramecium is capable of reinforcement learning, but it has no nervous system - is it &quot;aware&quot; of anything at all?  It's all quite mysterious still!  </p>
<p>EDIT: Note that when talking about <em>different kinds</em> of awareness I am explicitly avoiding the term &quot;mortality&quot; in favor of &quot;death&quot;.  The notion of mortality is more abstract than that of death - it seems to include the notion that one is aware that they <em>will die in the future</em> even in the absence of current death-related experiences.  This requires the human-like ability of abstract, high level reasoning about causes and possible futures (discussed earlier). Imagine a dog that gets a terminal disease.  3 months before the terminal disease appears, it may see another dog die.  It may enact certain death-witnessing behaviors, but it does not have a concept that &quot;this will happen to me some day&quot;.  After the disease appears, it may feel terrible, but it still does not have a concept that &quot;I am going to end up like that other dog&quot;.  If it <em>did</em> have either of those concepts, we would expect radically different behaviors from it that showed high level reasoning about mortality.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Contrary to a few responses, I am not suggesting that animals don't have conscious experiences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are cases such as seagulls flying out to sea and cats leaving a home never to return and it's been thought they do this because they know they're about to die. My question would be weather or not these are conscious decisions on the animal's part, and there fore, does that mean they have this knowledge prior to that &quot;I'm about to die&quot; feeling, which makes them do this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, until we can devise some way of reading the thoughts and emotions of non-human animals, we can't really say.  We know that animals such as elephants, crows, primates, and dolphins have strong reactions upon a member of the home group dying, sometimes standing guard over the corpse, gathering around it, or burying it under foliage.
In elephants, even unrelated animals will come to apparently stand vigil over a dead conspecific.  Elephants have also been observed interacting with elephant skeletons; picking the bones up, turning them over, and carefully examining them.  Other examples include dead dolphins being guarded by two or more animals (in at least one case, an entire pod, and they displayed aggressively when scientists came in to retrieve the corpse).  Sometimes they appear to be trying to &quot;wake&quot; the dead animal by nudging or touching it, other times they simply stand around.  </p>
<p>Female primates whose infants have died have been known to continue carrying the bodies for days or weeks; some female cetaceans have done the same with their dead calves.  Western scrub-jays have also been observed to gather around dead birds, calling to encourage others to join them, and have stopped foraging for a full day in order to do so, so clearly it was important to them!  </p>
<p>Wolves will also become agitated and fretful when exploring the area where a packmate has died, lowering their tails and pinning back their ears; signs of fear.  If the corpse is still in the pack's territory, they may visit it repeatedly.  </p>
<p>So...we don't know.  Some species, particularly highly social species, seem to have the idea that something has happened, and even display a certain fascination.  And many species display behaviours that we would like to interpret as grief.  But as to whether they truly understand what death is, and that they too will die someday...we just don't know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question.<br />
Is it possible to be unaware of one's mortality and exhibit traits related to survival?   </p>
<p>ex. How else would animals know to avoid predators, environmental dangers, constantly search for food and shelter, as well as procreate if they were unaware of the concept of death.  </p>
<p>I feel they would have to know that the risk of failing to do any of the above would lead to the end of their species, as death does not allow for the species to continue.<br />
The last statement above is obvious I know; but how else would animals have an instilled fear of things that could hurt/kill them, as well as the instinctual need to find food/shelter/and potential mates if they were unaware of their own mortality?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
