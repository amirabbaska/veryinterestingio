		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good resource is <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/proposing/panel/Cycle25-HST-status.pdf" target="_blank">this Hubble Status presentation PDF from 2017.</a></p>
<p>The HST's most vulnerable component is its gyroscopes, which are used for precisely pointing the telescope.  It needs three gyroscopes for normal operations, and it has six on-board for redundancy.  <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/hubble-spacecraft-update" target="_blank">The second gyro of those six failed in April of this year.</a>  Once two more fail, it will start to affect operations. Operations can continue in a more limited capacity all the way down to one gyro (which would get Hubble very solidly into the 2030s, where its orbit would become the limiting factor). But the question once we reach sub-three-gyro operations (estimated at ~2023) will be if a limited Hubble is worth $100M a year, which is what it costs to run.</p>
<p>Right now, it is *very* worth it.</p>
<p>And as you can see from <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/proposing/panel/Cycle25-HST-status.pdf" target="_blank">that PDF I linked</a>, folks are working hard to develop innovative plans that keep all these instruments going, all so it can keep being worth the upkeep as we go forward into this uncharted territory.</p>
<hr />
<p>* Edit for clarity: It's important to note that these gyroscopes are not like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_moment_gyroscope" target="_blank">control moment gyros</a> that the ISS uses the momentum of to rotate. The Hubble gyroscopes just help you know which way you're pointing.  For a complete picture of how Hubble points itself and knows where it's pointing, check out <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/hubble-space-telescope-pointing-control-system" target="_blank">this page</a> (the magnetic momentum dumping is pretty cool).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
