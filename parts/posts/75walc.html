		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I haven't seen mentioned is the seal between the tire and the rim. Usually there's a bead that helps seal and the tire pressure itself holds the seal. The bead can degrade or there could be corrosion on the rim that would cause a really slow leak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The air permeates through the rubber. Permeability is a property of solids, and it can vary depending on the liquid/gas it's interacting with. Oxygen permeates through rubber faster than nitrogen, which is why you sometimes see garages offering nitrogen inflation, because 100% nitrogen will stay inflated longer than 80% N2 and 20% O2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Funfact: I work in a tire manufacturing plant. There is a rubber compound called butyl they put in the tire to keep air sealed in. Ironically this compound is toxic to the other rubber in the tire itself and had to be separated by another compound. That compound is actually irradiated when it is made (though it's safe by the time it is put into the tire).</p>
<p>Also without butyl your tire would lose the majority of its air pressure in about 8-48 hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of different ways a tire can lose air. Here are a few common culprits.</p>
<p>If it's losing air extremely slowly and consistently over a long time, it is likely that this is only due to air permeating through the rubber, which happens on some scale in every tire.</p>
<p>If the tire pressure is fluctuating and generally decreasing slowly the cause could be change in season. Similarly, long drives to new locations with new pressures/temperatures can affect the air pressure of your tires.</p>
<p>If it is losing air pressure consistently but not catastrophically (a blown out tire, severed valve stem, gaping hole), the leak could be from several places. A bent, cracked or corroded wheel will cause a tire to lose pressure at varying rates. Similarly, if a tires rubber is corroded along the bead (where it seals with the wheel) air is likely to escape. The same could happen due to a worn or dry-rotted valve stem. Even a small puncture can cause a tire to lose air relatively slowly, and because drivers are only losing a psi every few days, they are misled to believe it must be something other than a nail, screw, staple, metal shaving, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key component to keep air pressure inside the modern tire is the inner liner, made out of halobutyl rubber. Halobutyl rubber has a much lower permeability than the other parts of a tire.</p>
<p>The thickness of the inner liner is a key component to determine how eco friendly a tire is. Less pressure = more contact with the road = higher fuel consumption. </p>
<p>Legislation in many countries determines the minimum thickness of this layer. For example in Asia, this is not as strict and as a result, tires (from smaller brands) in Asia loose air much quicker, resulting in more fuel consumption.</p>
