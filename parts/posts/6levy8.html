		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many internet forums such as 4chan serve as a home for the counter-culture and contrarian opinions and personalities.</p>
<p>Alt-right seems to be a backlash to a culture that is moving left and, in their opinion, seeks to accommodate and &quot;baby&quot; the general citizenry at the expense of individual freedoms.</p>
<p>It is a counter-culture and contrarian movement that fits with the personalities and opinions that find a home in such internet forums.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, some people are throwing words around however not knowing quite how to use them correctly. First of all it needs to be established that, despite what people say, 4chan is heavily liberal. That's a fact. However where it gets confusing is in defining Liberal. 4chan subscribes to classical liberalism, which is essentially freedom above all else. And that is 4chans main driving force (or was, some say it became to moderated so 8chan became a thing, but that's besides the point). However done confuse that with being altright. There is a large socially right wing faction on 4chan (different to economically right), which opposes socially progressive.</p>
<p>As to how this happened, it is partially due to simple politics. To understand 4chan you must understand it's antithesis, Tumblr. Tumblr represents the far left side of the internet (socially speaking) where as 4chan are the far right. This is largley why 4chan and Tumblr are what they are, they stand tonoppsoe each other. That is not to say that they could not exist without each other, however they both grow due to their reactions with each other, and both attract people who oppose what the other site believes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a user of several 4chan boards, I reject the premise of the question. Crazy I know, but allow me to explain.</p>
<p>4chan is likely not significantly more conservative than other social media platforms,</p>
<p>The right are more vocal than the left, or at least they are recently. 4chan gives equal footing to all posts, where on reddit and Facebook there is an echo chamber effect, meaning if you're not a trump supporter, you're generally less likely to see pro trump posts.</p>
<p>/pol/ is the alt right board of 4chan, and they have a tendency to post political posts on other boards such as /trv/, making them seem more numerous than they really are. If you want to see more left oriented discussions, check out /news/.</p>
<p>I'll also point out here that the lack of an echo chamber means the alt right is challenged on their beliefs on 4chan, where on reddit and Facebook they spend their time constructing strawmen.</p>
<p>In short, 4chan makes it easier to make more noise as one person, but demographically, 4chan is likely not much different than reddit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been a semi-regular 4chan poster for about 10 years now and it really hasn't changed all that much in that time.  There are ever more boards, but /b/ is still /b/ and /v/ is still /v/ and so on.  Some people come and go, however, the general place stays the same.</p>
<p>When the whole &quot;Anonymous&quot; hacker thing happened nothing changed on 4chan.  It was still the same groups of people hanging out there that had always been there.  With the creation of a collective name though it gave a small sub-set of people an easy way to coalesce.  Suddenly 4chan hacker &quot;Anonymous&quot; became a thing everywhere even though it was no more or less of a thing on the site than it had been before.</p>
<p>The only thing that has changed on 4chan is the creation of the term &quot;alt-right&quot;.  Now all the little bigots have a common name to collect themselves around.  With a name, cause, and rules they seem like a bigger group to outsiders.  To those of us who have been there a long time it is the same group as always.  No more.  No less.</p>
<p>Honestly, if somebody came up with a name for it you could just as easily make 4chan out to be the home of an open progressive sexuality movement.  An active /lgbt/ board, /soc/'s nebulous sexuality, and /b/ &amp; /v/ love of transporn would make the perfect examples.  Just give it a good name to gather around and watch it take off as the next group defining 4chan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like, ten years ago, 4chan was a novelty because of you could make any dumb post you wanted and never worry about it again. This was the genesis of modern shitposting. On the /b/ forum, which famously has no rules except &quot;Don't post anything illegal,&quot; ironically posting racist shit became a fun thing to do, but even on /b/, at the time, far-right bullcrap was the subject of mockery. See also their raid on white supremacist talk show host Hal Turner.</p>
<p>The original owner of 4chan, created /n/, a board for discussing news and current events. Stormfront, a racist website that /b/ would often raid at the time, moved in and started posting unironically. The board was closed, and eventually reopened as /pol/ and /int/ - Politically Incorrect and International. Stormfront returned and continued to be awful. This time they weren't stopped, because it was funny, at first, to see white supremacists from the previous generation being all &quot;HOW DO YOU DO FELLOW KIDS, THE BLACKS SURE ARE UPPITY AREN'T THEY HA HA HA.&quot; It became less funny when they snared angry young people that were better able to fit in and spread their toxic beliefs to other popular, loosely-moderated boards like /v/. This eventually resulted in shenanigans like gamergate.</p>
<p>tl;dr Any community that gets its laughs by pretending to be idiots will eventually be flooded by actual idiots who mistakenly believe that they're in good company.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
