<p>Same thing: your body's sense of acceleration doesn't stop when you go to sleep.  Your body knows and wakes up when it suddenly accelerates (like if it's about to fall off a bed).  You probably stop yourself from rolling off a bed more often than you know, because most of the time you go right back to sleep and forget the whole thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You never go completely to sleep at night. A small part of your brain never sleeps and always watch out for dangers. It is this part of your brain that will listen to your alarm and make you wake up. It is also making sure you do not fall off the edge of the bed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain also shuts down some motor functions to keep you from acting out all your dreams, of course this doesn't always happen (e.g., sleepwalking) and sometimes you wake up while the body is in this state which is known as sleep paralysis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually due to evolutionary traits we picked up, they were to keep us from falling off of branches while we were asleep if you were to start leaning too far in one direction your body's reflexes would kick in to catch you and because reflexes are actually &quot;shortcuts&quot; in your neurological system your brain doesn't need to &quot;wake up&quot; to keep yourself balanced. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
