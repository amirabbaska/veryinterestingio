<p>Jupiter's interior is still hot, while the outside is cooled by radiation (to space). In addition there is the &quot;daily&quot; cycle of sunlight. That leads to temperature gradients, and that leads to convection. Convection mixes up the different atmospheric layers in many individual cells and generates patterns in the atmosphere. There are many more things (interaction with the magnetic field, for example), but convection alone prevents an atmosphere in equilibrium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
