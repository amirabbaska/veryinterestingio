Is there a reason why this is such a global phenomenon, and why it's nowhere near as common for other levels of relationship, e.g. siblings?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is sort of backwards because it's really the parents' doing, not the children.  The earliest sound shapes that infants tend to produce are usually a consonant followed by a vowel.  The easiest consonants for a baby to produce are ones that don't require a lot of fine control of the tongue and lips, so sounds like /m/, /b/, /p/, /d/ tend to emerge first with a generic mid or back vowel sound, such as /a/.  This results in early babbling and proto-words that often sound like /mama/, /dada/, or /papa/ across a large number of languages.  Parents throughout history have likely assumed that the first sounds that their children were making were referring to them or seeking their attention, so these early proto-words became associated with or evolved into the words for 'mother', 'father', 'grandmother' and other caretakers.  This also helps to explain why /mama/ is such a common word for 'mother' across many unrelated languages (Chinese, Swahili, English, Navajo...).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans use kinship terms as a way to show and make social meaning--across multiple cultures and languages parent-child relationships are immensely meaningful, and so what you call your parent means a lot.</p>
<ol>
<li>Using kinship terms of address is a <em>footing</em> move, reflecting and constructing social power. For example, among the Shona people, parents have the power to switch from affectionate kinship terms/nicknames to first name use, to show anger to reprove their children, but that power is one-sided: children can never do the same thing back. Similarly, in Japanese culture, personal names are only used by senior family members speaking to junior members--parents may call their children by their first name, but children may not call their parents back by their personal name.</li>
<li>Kinship address terms are variable and context-dependent. In America, children call their parents Father, Mother, Dad, Daddy, Pop, Mom, Ma, and so on. This variable between families--some children will use &quot;Pop/Ma&quot; to show intimacy, while others use Father/Mother to show respect. This is also situationally variable, as parents and children try to show closeness or distance based on what's happening at the moment. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question is really misclassified as linguistics -- it's really more of a question for anthropologists.  Musing about articulatory or developmental paths leading to 'mama' or 'papa' is fun and everything, but it's rubbish science.  /u/grizzleyt gives probably the best answer, it's social.  Who says calling siblings by their kinship term is less common?  A bunch of English monolinguals, I think.  edit:  Check out, just for a single counter-example, Korean  <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~korean/E305/kinterms_Korean.html" target="_blank">http://www.indiana.edu/~korean/E305/kinterms_Korean.html</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
