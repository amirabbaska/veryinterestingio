		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other answers, you need a question that gets to whether or not they might be pregnant without asking tough to answer questions.</p>
<p>eg </p>
<p>q: 'when did you last have sex?' a: 'with my husband, or with the pool boy?'</p>
<p>q: 'is there any reason why you might be pregnant?' a: 15yr old looks at mother, thinks about it, says 'no'. mother snaps 'of course not' in an angry voice</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because some medications can kill or cause gross deformities and disabilities in pregnant women's babies that the doctor will be paying for by court order for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>It's an <em>enormous</em> risk not to and it's such an easy question to ask that most women are used to being asked so there's little to no reason not to.</p>
<p>Go look up the court awards for Accutane sometime. Look at those babies head's - watermelon sized, and completely nonfunctional. You want to avoid that.</p>
<p>That said, in most hospitals they are going to go ahead and give you a pregnancy test as a matter of course before they give you a script or treatment, asking about the period is more an easy way to make sure their hormones are functioning normally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
