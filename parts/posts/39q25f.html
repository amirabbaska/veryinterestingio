		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main reason is the way the law treats both companies.
Microsoft was a software only vendor in the past but Apple is the hardware and software vendor.
US and EU laws dictate that the hardware manufacturer to have full control over the ecosystem becuase of the industry behaviour in the past and who the end-consumer pays his money to. </p>
<p>The IE case: Microsoft was accused of using it's monopoly status in the software industry and force the hardware vendors from changing the default browser to something not made by Microsoft beause back in the many hardware vendors included netscape with the preinstalled windows' PC's. Since the EU laws treated the hardware vendors as the ecosystem owners Microsoft ws violating the law by forcing it's will on the PC manufacturers allegedly threatening them of not allowing preinstalls if they do not include IE as the default browser. The EU law states that it's not a Microsoft ecosystem if the end-consumer pays their money to the hardware vendor(pre-installed systems only) and not Microsoft.</p>
<p>The Apple case: Apple is itself both the software and hardware vendor and the end consumer pays the money to Apple for their services and agrees to their services agreement. Apple can have full control over what their hardware will have and won't have. </p>
<p>This is not related to marketshare of Apple or Microsoft but related to who is the hardware vendor.</p>
<p>Edit: Microsoft argued at the time that they are not forcing manufacturers to use IE as the default browser but IE is an integral part of the operating system and hence microsoft did not give an uninstall button. The EU was not happy with this explanation and fined them for unfair practices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the problems with Microsoft and IE is they were deliberately using their monopoly status to try and kill the competition (in the case of IE, that was Netscape and it succeeded). </p>
<p>Apple is hardly a monopoly in the mobile phone business. If you group all the Android devices together they have more than 50% of the market. </p>
<p>They also don't stop you from installing any other music app, and if you do you can choose which one to use as the default. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would just like to point out that Microsoft won that case, and you STILL can't uninstall IE.</p>
<p>They won by saying it is an integrated part of the operating system and users have the option using another browser if they install it. The same thing applies here, the Apple Music app is integrated so deeply into iOS that they can't separate it without it destroying many other services (phone, games, iTunes store, etc) and you can download alternatives from the Apple App Store.</p>
<p><em>If you wish to know how it is integrated, I'll answer that more. But only if asked.</em></p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <em>For all those saying &quot;You can just remove IE by disabling it&quot; or &quot;Delete the IE folder!&quot;, this is NOT uninstalling IE. All you simply did was turn off ONE VISUAL element of IE.</em></p>
<p><em>For those who deleted the folder, you deleted key .dll files and other files Windows uses to run some internet processes, and other programs use as well. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/product/windows/windows-8-1" target="_blank">Here is the link</a> to the Windows Support page, so stop saying &quot;Well I removed it, but my computer doesn't work properly now!&quot;, it's because you deleted key files!</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microsoft sells software to computer manufacturers. They were making that sale of software conditional on the avoidance of a certain other piece of software made by another software company. This is illegal if the company is in a monopolistic position. </p>
<p>Apple sells iPhones. An iPhone can look like whatever Apple wants it to look like, just like a Samsung phone can look like whatever Samsung wants it to look like. </p>
<p>IF Apple were in a monopolistic position with the iPhone, they would be barred from disallowing Google from selling software in their App Store. They might even be barred from disallowing their competing software from being uninstalled. But they would not be forced to preload competing software because they own the hardware and can sell it in whatever configuration they want. </p>
<p>But Apple is definitely NOT in a monopolistic position with the iPhone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For what it is worth, Apple Music is being included in iOS 9 because the functionality will be rolled into the built-in Music app, just like how Xbox Music functionality is bundled into the preinstalled Music app on Windows 8.</p>
<p>There is no real competition issue here, because it does not inhibit the use of other services, and it is not a majority enough to be monopolising.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
