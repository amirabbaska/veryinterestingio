		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The red eye in pictures is due to light reflecting off the back of your eyes, when you're on a dark room your pupil dilates to allow more light in, this causes the flash to reflect off the back of your eye, so one way that newer cameras reduce this is by having a pre-flash that constricts your pupils before the main photo. It's likely that your camera also has red eye reducing software in it too and uses this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One other reason is that almost all casual photos these days are taken with phone cameras, and almost all phones have LED &quot;flashes&quot; instead of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashtube" target="_blank">flashtubes</a> found in dedicated cameras. The latter are simply much, much brighter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We still get them, but there's a few reasons that they are more rare now.  </p>
<p>Some phone cameras automatically remove it.  A lot of cameras have a pre-flash, minimizing the effect the true flash has on your pupils.  And a big one, digital photography technology has evolved to be very high quality in lower and lower lighting, so we need a flash less and less these days, meaning we never see the red-eye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Red eye reduction, like all technologies, gets better over time as well. </p>
<p>Also, software solutions for dealing with high ISO noise have gotten better, so you can take pictures in darker environments without the flash more often than you could in the past.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
