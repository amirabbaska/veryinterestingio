<p>I occasionally take Nyquil to help put me to sleep on days where I work nights and sometimes have trouble falling asleep because I am still wired. What exactly happens in our bodies since that medicine is mostly to help battle cold/flu? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The medicine still does its thing: a decongestant will still constrict your blood vessels (to no noticeable effect), a pain reliever/anti-inflammatory will anti-inflame (to no noticeable effect), etc.  Your body will work through it like it would if you were sick, except you won't notice most of the effects.</p>
<p>If you're taking NyQuil just to get to sleep, get yourself some sleep medication (like generic Unisom).  Those have either diphenhydramine (Benadryl), or doxylamine (the stuff in NyQuil) alone, which sounds like what you really want to be taking.  Also consider something else, because long-term that's no good.  Go to sleep later when you're naturally tired, do something non-electronic that makes you sleepy (books really do it for me), etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>specifically, it's to battle the <em>symptoms</em> of a cold. It does the exact same things in your body whether you have a cold or not, like suppressing histamine receptors. However, since you don't have the symptoms to fight, you won't notice relief from them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, medication does not &quot;go where it is needed&quot;, rather it goes everywhere in the body and does what it does in all those places. Some areas of the body might be more sensitive to a particular drug but the drug is present all over.</p>
<p>So when you take a drug when not needed the drugs just do what they always do, regardless of if that is helpful. Taking Nyquil as a sleep aid is a pretty bad idea because of all the other drugs in it which cause undesirable side effects and strain on your body. Instead just take a sleep aid drug directly if you must.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>To clarify, I am aware that there are actual sleep aids out there as Zzzquil and Unisom. I am only actually taking the Nyquil every once in a while because it is just available. Not as often as the post makes it seem. </p>
<p>I just actually wondered since it was specifically for cold/flu if it affected me. Thanks again!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I highly recommend doxylamine if you're not sick and just looking for sleep (it does tend to be more expensive though). I don't know if its just me, but that stuff always does a much better job not giving me a tired feeling the next day like benadryl but works just as good getting me to sleep</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
