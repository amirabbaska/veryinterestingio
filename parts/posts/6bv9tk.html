		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there.</p>
<p>The biological processes of bone healing are the same in both horses and humans. The problem is in their weight and behavior. And it depends on the location of the fracture whether or not the horse may need to be euthanized.</p>
<p>When humans break bones, they can take weight off by sitting down, using crutches, etc. Horses don't have this option. If they take the weight off of the leg by themselves by favoring the leg, especially if they are young, the other limb may become deformed due to the increased burden. Even if they do lie down, the act of standing back up can cause the fracture to break again. Smaller horses may heal from fractures better, and a few cases may do well with amputation, but these cases are few and far between.</p>
<p>Even if the leg is stabilized, it takes a very long time to heal. During this long time of inflammation, the horse may develop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminitis" target="_blank">laminitis</a>, which causes, in a word, the hooves to fall off. This is similar to having your fingernails pulled off, and for an animal that relies on supporting all of its weight on its &quot;fingernails&quot; this is incredibly painful and debilitating. (This is actually what happened to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbaro" target="_blank">Barbaro</a>). Here is a look at <a href="http://www.two-views.com/celebrity/barbaro-leg-xray.html#sthash.uUMadT8t.dpbs" target="_blank">Barbaro's radiographs</a> and how they attempted to stabilize his distal limb.</p>
<p>Also, practically, many horses have jobs (racers like thoroughbreds/standardbreds, work-horses like draft horses, etc), and their lives are sometimes seen as an investment. If the owner cannot afford to keep them on pasture, if it isn't a financially viable option, they may elect to euthanize.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>And another point: horse physiology is designed so that blood flow to the foot and leg is partially accomplished through pressure to an area on the sole of the foot called the frog. When horses don't move regularly and put pressure on this surface, it can damage circulation in the hoof wall and cause reduced circulation in the entire injured leg.</p>
<p>What's more, the additional weight on the non- injured feet frequently causes a condition in the weight-bearing feet called laminitis, where circulation is damaged and the hoof wall begins to detach. This is a condition that is frequently the cause of permanent and severe lameness and often requires the horse to be put down. </p>
<p>So ultimately it is not the broken leg that is the problem, but the cascade of other problems that results in the horse being euthanized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at a racino (horse racing and casino) and there was one summer where we had two horses get euthanized on the track. They put up sheets so nobody had to see but they knew that the breaks were so bad that it would have been torture to move the horses. </p>
<p>The audience almost went into a riot the night of the second accident. People just couldn't get why we wouldn't move the horse off the track so it could pass away in peace. Well, turns out that one of its bones was almost though it's skin and moving the horse would most likely make the bone rip through. Others said that the owners just killed it because of greed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You can mend the broken leg, but it is very costly to do so and has no guarantees that it will work.  The horse has to be kept stabled and supported in a sling (horses cannot lay down for days on end or they wont digest food).  Some horses simply cannot tolerate this (horse moves too much) and as such people don't put in the expense of the surgery knowing that it may not work.</p>
<p>There have been a few horses fitted with prosthetic limbs though - but mostly as an experiment to see if it will work.</p>
<p>Many horses are &quot;pets&quot; and the owners don't have the money for this knowing that the horse wont be of use to them for a very long time - and a racehorse will have its racing (money earning) carrier ended after a leg break.</p>
<p>The main thing is trying to keep a horse in a resting position to allow for healing is VERY tough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a high risk of infection, and the horse may not sit still long enough for the bone to heal.  Infections are most likely when the animal suffers a compound fracture, in which the bones tear through the skin of the leg.  In this case, dirt from the track will grind into and contaminate the wound. </p>
<p>To make matters worse, there isn't much blood circulation in the lower part of a horse's leg. (There's very little muscle, either.)
A nasty break below the knee could easily destroy these fragile vessels and deprive the animal of its full immune response at the site of the injury. </p>
<p>It's not easy to treat a horse with antibiotics, either.  Since the animals are so big, you have to pump in lots of drugs to get the necessary effect. But if you use too many antibiotics, you'll destroy the natural flora of its intestinal tract, which can lead to life-threatening, infectious diarrhea.  You also have to worry about how the antibiotics will interact with large doses of painkillers, which can themselves cause ulcers.</p>
<p>If the horse manages to avoid early infection, he might not make it through the recovery.  First, he must wake up from anesthesia without reinjuring himself. Not all horses are willing to sit around in a sling, and the antsy ones can thrash about and break their limbs all over again. </p>
<p>A horse after surgery would face other obstacles:  Potential to develop laminitis in the opposite hind foot;  chance of infection;
possibility of impaction colic from physical and mental stress;
reinjury because of the tendency of an ultra-fit horse to be too active while confined; and unsatisfactory healing.  If he starts favoring his wounded leg post-surgery, he may overload his other legs, causing a condition known as laminitis  If that happens, the hooves on the other legs will start to separate from the bone, and his weight will be driven into the soft flesh of the feet. He may also develop life-threatening constipation as a side effect of the anesthetic.</p>
<p>Laminitis explained further: When a horse places weight on a foot, it registers a negative blood flow, actually forcing blood away from the coffin bone and through the back of the foot through tiny blood vessels called microvasculature. A horse with an orthopedic injury that spends too much time standing on the opposite leg causes the blood flow to diminish in that foot, which can lead to laminitis. Doctors will often put down a horse that develops a nasty infection, reinjures its broken leg, or develops laminitis in its other hooves.
A horse that's unable to stand will develop nasty sores and can be expected to die a slow and painful death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
