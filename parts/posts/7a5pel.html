<p>Is it possible to make someone allergic to something, or remove their allergies?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two parts. First I should explain 'allergies'.</p>
<p>Allergies are when your immune system recognizes a foreign object that is not harmful as harmful and attacks it - producing symptoms ranging from a stuffy nose to lethal amounts of fluid in the lungs, depending on how big a threat it thinks it is.</p>
<p>1) People can become allergic to something when, completely randomly, one of their immune cells 'suddenly sees it' and becomes activated, eventually resulting in many more immune system cells that all see the foreign object as harmful. This is also how an allergy can get worse over time - constant exposure to some allergans can cause more and more anti-allergan immune cells to be produced, causing a bigger and bigger effect every time you are exposed to the allergan.</p>
<p>2) People can become gradually non-allergic to something (or rather, their immune system response becomes muted) by exposing them to very gradually increasing doses of the allergan. This causes their body to kill off some of the anti-peanut or whatever cells over time as the body does have ways of shutting down a mistaken response.</p>
<p>2.b) People can become suddenly non-allergic to something in two ways - </p>
<p>1) Nuke the immune system from orbit, it's the only way to be sure. You can go through some surgical/cancer procedures that require your immune cells be killed off completely - often they will manage to kill off every single one that produces that allergan's antibody, rendering you no longer allergic to it. Then you die unless you get a bone marrow transplant. Measles has also been know to reset allergies by resetting the immune system. </p>
<p>2) Your body randomly kills off all the anti-allergan antibody producers on it's own. It 'suddenly sees' that they are attacking self and kills them all off.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh, man! Finally my time to shine. </p>
<p>Background: I administer skin prick allergy tests and  mix/administer immunotherapy under the guidance and supervision of a physician. I AM NOT A DOCTOR.</p>
<p>Allergies come from your body encountering something and misidentifying it as a threat. Your body raises the alarm any time this allergen is encountered and sends in the troops to eliminate it. Unfortunately for you, it results in a variety of symptoms. Itchy/red/watery eyes, runny/itchy nose, rashes, migraines, sinus pressure or congestion, etc. are all common.</p>
<p>Immunotherapy, in this case allergy shots, helps to reduce allergies by introducing small, precise doses of allergens to your system. Over time the dose is increased to keep building your body's tolerance to the substance. Eventually, your body stops going &quot;red alert&quot; when you breathe in some Ragweed pollen because it's used to seeing it in larger amounts via the allergy shots. Typically, people have this reduction in symptoms for years. 3-4 years of allergy shots can lead to a decade or so of significantly reduced symptoms. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Allergies are often when the body mistakes a substance for an attacker and all the defense mechanisms kick in to try and defend you.</p>
<p>The immune system is complicated and evolves over time to adapt to the threats it finds, some allergies like hayfever can be both 'grown into' and 'grown out of' depending on what the individual is experiencing and eating. Other allergies are harder to shake or gain, as our body may find that substance vital or lethal depending on circumstances.</p>
<p>My hayfever centers around a kind of plant that grows near where my old school was, but nowhere near the town. So I seemed to 'grow into' hayfever and also 'grow out' of it, but really it was location driven. I'm probably still allergic to that plant, but it's pollen doesn't reach me anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another fun thing to think about, with people who seem to develop allergies later in life (but not the ones who have one that they grow out of)</p>
<p>There's a series of conditions that fall under mast cell activation disorders that are generally all progressive. </p>
<p>Basically your mast cells start to really inappropriately activate immune responses to the point that it seems you're allergic to everything, life itself, and it can get worse/intensified over time. So, you may have low grade symptoms as a child and seemingly be allergic to one or two things but then suddenly as an adult more body systems are more intensively involved so you seem to be allergic to more things that affect many areas of your body. It's not technically an allergy to one specific trigger but an overall overreaction of your body's immune system to the world around you.</p>
<p>This is a very newly classified set of disorders with names and diagnostic criteria only really established since around 2010. </p>
<p>There's a chance some percentage of the population generally classified with allergies actually have mast cell disorders. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I haven't spotted a mention of in other answers is that you are not born allergic to things. The first time you eat a peanut or get stung by a bee you won't have a severe allergic reaction - your body doesn't know what the stuff it's just encountered is, so doesn't have an allergic reaction prepared. </p>
<p>Your immune system may however look at that peanut and say to itself &quot;hmm. That peanut was unusual. A bit worrying. We better be ready in case it comes back.&quot; Then the <em>second</em> time you eat a peanut the immune system may have over prepared, start attacking peanuts with everything it has, and give you an anaphylactic reaction. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
