<p>Doing some digging into my family tree when I found my great grandfathers thesis for his masters in electrical engineering at the age of 23. </p>
<p>Went on to become a physics professor at the university of Nebraska </p>
<p>Rumored to have worked with Tesla.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I first want to say how cool this is and thank you very much for sharing. So this was long before the days of digital electronics that you could just program to do something like find the current in a circuit. What your great grandfather did was work with a method of measuring the current going through a circuit by taking pictures of a magnatized needle. When you have current running through a wire, it creates a magnetic field around the wire. So if you have a magnetized needle next to it, the needle should move according to the strength of the current. Since the current from an AC source is constantly changing, if you take a bunch of photos timed just right, you can backtrack the current going through the wire at some time by the position of the needle.</p>
<p>Though, he says at the beginning that he did not develop the technique, it seems like he was focused on applying it to new situations to make sure it is a valid way to measure the current in complicated circuits. Again, this is really awesome and I'm glad you shared it!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
