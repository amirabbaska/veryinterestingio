		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unsold books are counted and returned to the manufacturer by tearing the cover off and simply sending that back. This saves weight shipping and room for all parties involved. Technically once the cover has been torn off the remaining paper can be recycled into pulp or put in a landfil.  The notices advise people that if they bought the book with the cover torn off that it has been counted as destroyed and the book seller is guilty of theft.</p>
<p>I read many great novels minus the cover for free as a book store employee. Hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Books and magazines are heavy and it can cost hundreds of dollars in freight to return them to a publisher, which wipes out any profit.  This is an industry where sales are in volume.  The publisher trusts the booksellers to destroy the books and not sell them.  If they get wind a bookseller is selling damaged items, they can sue them or cut the store off killing the business.</p>
<p>During the summer when I was 12, we recovered about a hundred pounds of Playboys, Penthouses, and Genesis from dumpsters when I was a kid behind a Stars &amp; Stripes bookstore overseas.  Handed them out to workers at the bus stop, organized them, and created a porn lending library for the neighborhood kids.  EVERY single thing in that dumpster was always ripped in two.  The crown jewels were the magazines where they were lazy and just ripped an inch.  Also yes, can confirm Suzanne Somers was hot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the 1970s, some discount and convenience stores would have bundles of coverless paperbacks for sale. There would be from 5-10 books shrink-wrapped together and you could see the titles on the spines. They were very cheap, so worth it for two or three good titles. I read lots of sci-fi and Mad magazine compilations that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
