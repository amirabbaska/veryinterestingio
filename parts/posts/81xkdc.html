		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So essentially it's your body's reaction to not having food, the early signs of &quot;starvation&quot;. When you're hungry your body signals to your brain saying &quot;Hey, feed me you buffoon!&quot; But when you don't respond quick enough your body takes matters into it's own hands and begins to break down fat into sugars so your body can continue it's processes. This is the same idea of going to bed hungry and waking up not hungry. It's not that you aren't necessarily hungry anymore, but the actual needs for your body are temporarily being met and that's good enough for it to stop sending hunger signals to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You body consumes the food you eat rather quickly and after it does it asks for more. If you don't eat immediately your body will move on to the things it already has, pausing the hunger until it runs out when you start getting really hungry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once heard that the feeling of hunger, isn't exactly the feeling of hunger. It's just that we have been programmed to perceive it that way. (Unfortunately, it's been so long since I have heard it, I cannot remember the source) Similar to us being programmed to believe that yawning indicates sleepiness. When in actuality, there could be many reasons for it. One because they're more contagious than the flu lol.</p>
<p>Take someone who is fasting, for health or for Church. The longest I made it was 21 days, and I don't remember feeling very hungry. Except for when I went to work, since I worked with food. Although, the day I told my mind it was time to eat...i harmed some food lol. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ELI5 response is just your body needs food so it creates ghrelin, the &quot;hunger hormone&quot; so that you have an increased motivation to find something to eat. After not eating for a while you stop making the hunger hormone because it's not seemingly helpful and will return later.</p>
<p>More explanation is:</p>
<p>After a while your body begins breaking down fat and or muscle to fill the energy needs of your body.</p>
<p>If you're fat adapted body fat will be used primarily but if you're on a high sugar and carbohydrate diet your body will convert muscle into glucose in a process known as gluconeogenisis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
