<p>With these numbers, how is DNA able to maintain its structure? Shouldn't its constituent particles be able to occasionally tunnel out of the potential wells holding them in place? If so, why is this not a problem? If not, why not?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You can see this by looking at organisms given heavy water, which contains deuterium instead of hydrogen. Since the nucleus of deuterium is heavier, that means it is less likely to tunnel, and the rate of mutation in these organisms decreases.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All chemical bonding is fundamentally based on quantum-mechanical phenomena.  DNA can maintain its structure precisely because of energy minimization which of course is, at the most fundamental level, in your &quot;Quantum Realm.&quot;  Does quantum tunneling occur, well yes, there is always a small probability this will occur, and could conceivably cause deleterious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautomer" target="_blank">effects if for example you altered a hydrogen bond and changed the genetic sequence</a>.  This is very much an active area of research.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, DNA in your body is constantly being repaired. There's a general misconception that any damage to your DNA is irreversible, but usually several different things have to go wrong with the reconstructive part of the genome before real damage will occur, IE cancer. So even if certain sections did fall apart, your body has mechanisms in place to replace most missing pieces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I'm not an expert in biology, but even the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling#Quantum_biology" target="_blank">quantum tunelling article</a> on wikipedia says they are important in hydrogen bonds. The proton (in other words, hydrogen) can tunnel through hydrogen-bound base pairs causing spontaneous mutation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
