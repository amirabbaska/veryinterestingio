<blockquote>
<p>It is not impossible that with bodies whose energy-content is variable to a
high degree (e.g. with radium salts) the theory may be successfully put to the
test.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There has been for example <a href="https://jila.colorado.edu/thompson/sites/default/files/pdf/4381096a.pdf" target="_blank">this experiment</a> measuring the change in mass of isotopes as they decay and finding it equivalent to the energy released.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/iorgfeflkd already answered your question correctly, but I'd like to add a bit. Emission of radiation is not purely emission of energy like in gamma decay, some forms of radiation are actual emission of massive particles. Alpha decay for example is the spontaneous ejection of a helium nucleus and is common with heavy nuclei like U238. You can also have spontaneous ejection of protons, neutrons, positrons, electrons and other stuff, including very massive chunks in spontaneous fission that represent almost 50% of the original mass. These represent a pretty significant mass and are definitely measurable, not just a theoretical consideration.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that if you look at spontaneous nuclear reactions, the sum of the rest masses of the products is <em>less than</em> the sum of the parent - some mass goes missing. This missing mass is called the &quot;mass defect&quot; and results from the extra potential energy that was required to hold the original nucleus together. That energy is manifested as the kinetic energy of the products. This missing mass is somewhat small but still significant, e.g. for uranium fission it's almost 0.1% of the original mass. </p>
<p>Technically this also applies to chemical reactions too, because electrons have binding energy as well so chemical reactions also have a mass defect. The binding energies involved are much much smaller though, so it is harder (but not impossible) to measure and it is common to assume that mass is approximately conserved in chemical reactions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another neat implication of E=MC2 is if you had two identical wind up watches and one was wound up. The wound up watch would have a larger mass, due to the additional potential energy, then the other watch that wasn't wound up. (Assuming they were identical to the atom. The amount of gain might be less then we can measure or that is measurable but it's there. )</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They lose mass in one of three ways-</p>
<p>One, you emit a beta particle, you lose the mass of that electron that shoots out.  That's just losing mass.</p>
<p>Second, the <em>binding energy</em> has mass by E=MC^2.  You can end up with the same number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in a jar, but still lose mass and time you lose energy.  This is true of all forms of energy.  A battery loses a <em>really tiny</em> amount of mass when it's run down.  A book placed on a higher shelf is slightly heavier, technically you could read it on a scale but it's a <em>really miniscule</em> difference. </p>
<p>Third, in some nuclear processes, an antiparticle is created, which is then annihilated.   Literally.  A positron finds a regular electron, they touch, and BOTH cease to exist ever again.  Their mass converts to gamma ray energy.  A photon.</p>
<p>Photons of any type have no <em>rest</em> mass to weigh, but they do have mass in accordance with their energy.</p>
<p>For reference, every 20kiloton of nuclear bomb is 1 gram of mass turned into energy.  ALMOST the entire original mass becomes dust and emitted particles... but all that heat energy and radiation is just 1g/20kt of missing mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
