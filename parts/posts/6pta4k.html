		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have any sources, but I'm pretty sure when you sleep, the glands that control saliva flow under your tongue and in your cheeks refrain from secreting saliva. </p>
<p>30 minutes is enough for bacteria to grow without saliva. On the other hand, when you're awake, you're constantly producing saliva. Even if you aren't eating or talking. That makes it much harder for &quot;dirtiness&quot; to spread.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you say it only happens when you sleep, the most common explanation is breathing through your mouth when you sleep.  This causes the reduced production of saliva.  There are other possible causes of reduced saliva production, though, such as drugs or certain medical diseases/disorders.  However, those would generally cause dry mouth during the day as well.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have always known it to be because you constantly swallow the saliva (and bateria) when you are awake, but don't when you are asleep. This gives the bacteria a nice place to grow and you will taste it when you wake up. If you go a while without brushing your teeth in the morning, soon your mouth will feel normal again, as the saliva has been &quot;switched out&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's essentially a combination of the top comments, but just to sum it up for clarity: when you sleep, you produce less saliva and don't swallow it. When it isn't circulating, bacteria can grow more easily. If you are breathing through your mouth, your mouth will dry out and feel even more disgusting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
