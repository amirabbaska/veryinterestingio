The plot is based in a medieval-themed world, however, characters have these shiny white Hollywood teeth. For me this is a small detail that distracts me a lot from the actual story and acting.  </p>
<p><strong>To clarify:</strong>
I do not expect that the teeth are actual rotting or missing at all, but a little bit dirt, making them more yellowish or added plaque would make this way more authentic. What bothers me is that the characters have just <em>perfect and shiny white</em> teeth.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it would gross people out and they would be less inclined to watch. It sounds shallow, but is very likely to happen. </p>
<p>I actually started watching a show called &quot;Frontier&quot; on Netflix: Ahistorical drama, set during the colonization of North America, all about the fur trade in the 1700s. </p>
<p>Some of the main characters (Irish immigrants) are dirt poor and basically stealing to survive. These characters are interesting and endearing (and are portrayed by impossibly good looking actors) but - suitably for poverty stricken paupers in the 1700s - their teeth are yellow and rotten. </p>
<p>Their teeth drew my attention a lot, and kind of made me uncomfortable, because I'm a sheltered bigot or whatever I guess. </p>
<p>I watched an episode or two, then the next week, when I returned to watch some more, that was my overriding memory - how grossed out I would be by their teeth - and in the end, I didn't watch any more of the show. </p>
<p>I would bet my house I'm not the only person who didn't continue with that show because of the historically accurate teeth 'make up'. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was an HBO show called &quot;John Adams&quot; a few years ago, and one of the (many) great things about it was that the characters' teeth got worse as they got older.</p>
<p>Their fingertips were also perpetually stained with ink. Which, they would be, right?</p>
<p>And, there was one scene where a few characters are watching a battle from miles away, and they see an explosion, but seconds later they hear the sound of it. That's classy film making, if you ask me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Concerning Game of Thrones: I've read somewhere that diet and nutrition in the pre industrialized world contained way less sugar and sweetener that affect one's teeth.</p>
<p>I've also wondered how people &quot;back in the day&quot; were supposed to keep up the modern high maintenance of brushing two times a day, turns out when you're a peasant that only eats a thin vegetable soup all day that you don't have to worry about flushing.</p>
<p>Dental surgeries on the other hand are a whole other story.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My dad grew up poor in India and his entire family has perfect straight white teeth. I definitely inherited the nice teeth from his genetics, people always ask if I had braces or not and I've had complete strangers compliment my smile. Your environment plays a role in what your teeth look like but genetics are also huge. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
