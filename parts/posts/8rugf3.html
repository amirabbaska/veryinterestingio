		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geology of the shore is very important. A harder rock type (granite for instance) is more resistant to erosion and has the internal strength to form cliffs compared to loose sand and gravel deposited by a river. </p>
<p>Almost all landforms that you see are a result of the underlying geology (a ravine marks an old fault that weakened the rock and made it erode a little more there or an old stream bed with big cobbles is stronger than the surrounding rocks and forms a ridge (it can be paradoxical sometimes). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all to do with the geology but then i would say that as I'm a geologist.  </p>
<p>Basically, different rocks and landscapes wear down at different rates. Some float away as fine sediment in rivers (which is why rivers can look murky), sands are heavier and move slowly along the bottom of rivers, slowly moving to the sea.  When the river flows into the sea, the heavy sands spread out along the shore as beaches (quartz sand).</p>
<p>In shelly beaches (carbonate sand), it's often from wave action on coral reefs breaking it up and grinding it into sand which then deposits on the shores. </p>
<p>-ish. It's a lot more complicated than that but as this is ELI5...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically waves are refracted as they head towards shore. This means that they won't just travel in a straight line to land. Waves will converge (come together) and create a greater erosional intensity or diverge (split apart) and lose erosional intensity. The areas of land where the waves are converging are known as headlands and they are characterized by those steep, rocky cliffs. Greater erosion = steep cliffs where land is continuously breaking off and falling into the ocean. The areas of land where the waves are diverging are beaches (or bays) and face much less erosional forces and will accumulate a great amount of sedimentary deposits. Less erosion = shallow slopes and more deposits of sediments. These headlands and beaches will alternate along the coast because they are in a relationship with each other. Because headlands take on greater erosional forces, they are broken down and beaches will form on either side of them as the sediments are deposited in the areas of weaker erosional force. That's why you often see steep cliffs next to beaches along the coast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
