		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Square-cube law, and the fact that they don't have lungs.</p>
<p>If you increace the size of something, its height increases by a factor of n, its surface area increases by n^2 , and its volume increases by n^3 . Double the size of something, and you increase its height by 2x you increase its surface area by 4x and you increase the volume by 8x.</p>
<p>Oxygen transfer takes place over the area of a surface. The amount of tissue that needs oxygen is based on its volume. Double the size of an animal, it gets 4x more oxygen, but it has 8x more tissues that need oxygen, so now it's effectively getting about 1/2 of the oxygen it needs.</p>
<p>Insects have holes in the sides of their abdomens that they breathe through. That's enough for a creature that small. But mammals have lungs. Lungs are shaped like trees. A shape that maximizes surface area, to have enough area to transfer enough oxygen to live. For reference, an adult human's skin has an area of about 2 m^2 their lungs have a surface area of about 100 m^2, or about the size of a tennis court. If like insects, humans breathed through their skin, they'd only get about 1% of they need. Which is why you can't have human sized bugs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the first answer. Insect doesn't have lung, so they ''breath'' oxygen through their skin.</p>
<p>Volume increase faster than surface area. You can see that in any shape. A cube of 1 by 1 will have a volume of 1 and a surface area of 6. A cube of 10 by 10 will have a volume of 100 and a surface area of 60.</p>
<p>The volume of the insect determine how much oxygen it will need, and the surface area determine how much oxygen it will be able to absorb. So there is a point where there is just not enough surface area compare to the volume of the insect and that's the limit of the size of an insect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insect don't have lungs.
they get Oxygen though Spiracles (I think just external openings in their hard outer body)</p>
<p>the Oxygen also doesn't get pumped through their system via blood.</p>
<p>I think their internal system just gets pressurized.</p>
<p>this type of system is not very efficient and the max size of the insects is limited by how much oxygen they can process</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
