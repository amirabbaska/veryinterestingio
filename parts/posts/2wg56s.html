		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ex auto engineer speaking. Simple answer is they are true diesels. All diesel engines have major advantages over gasoline engines. Diesel car engines have lasted 750k+ miles many, many times (proper ones, European cars almost exclusively). In the USA we got fooled by crap diesel cars we designed from gas engines, but that's another topic. Proper diesels use compression firing instead of super hot spark plugs. Diesel is an oily fuel and lubricates whereas gasoline is &quot;dry&quot; and solvent-like. Diesels run cooler. Diesels have loads of torque at low RPMs. Add all this up and you have cool, oily, metal that moves at lower RPMs. Good things for metal engines.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow thanks! Didn't expect all the attention! Ok: I've had persistent requests so here goes:
True diesel: 1980's-2000's Renault 4-cylinder design. 55mpg, spirited off the line and virtually indestructible.
Crap diesel: 1978-1990's Oldsmobile hastily designed from an existing gas engine - of course the diesel design didn't include spark plugs! But many inadequate parts for diesel specs remained. Temperature- Diesel autoignition at max compression firing doesn't approach the 500-800 deg. C of spark plugs.
Pressure- until recently diesel injection, even with turbo, didn't approach the incredible pressure of gasoline piezo elec.@ 1750 bar (25,000 psi!)
Complexity/cost: diesels cost more at first to build and even maintain but make sense after a few years. . . as long as emissions requirements, higher diesel tax, turbos, etc. don't piss on the parade first. They are more powerful than gas engines (esp. for initial accelerating/towing), more efficient than hybrids, safer than electrics (and better for enviroment). Why aren't diesels more popular? Like streetcars and carpooling, they make more sense than money, and consumerism rules the day. Sales (Kia) vs. epic reliability (Allis-Chalmers)
Edit 2:
I've been asked how I buy cars.Launching any new model for any reason and each individual change is an opportunity for problems to pop up. Brand new models typically are junk and get recalled for this and that as Engineers scramble to fix unforeseen problems. So in secret, development continues in earnest for a year after it launches until as many bugs are fixed as possible during countless customer and consumer tester reviews. By the second year the jury has spoken, first impressions are in the books and the money for improvements switches off and gets routed to newer projects. Diesel trucks don't have this extremely short cycle. Anyway the second model year is the best. This is the point the quality is optimal. I always buy 2nd or 3rd model year vehicles. From year 3 cost-saving schemes begin to strip down the car in every sense. Cheaper materials, rework components start rotating in, new lower cost suppliers, less inspection, backup features go away if no one notices (like double seals, to save cost of one o ring). By year 5 most plastic is regrind resin and will fade and warp in heat / sun / cold. Big rig makers would have hell to pay trying that stuff on haulers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2000 Chrysler 300 with between 550,000 and 600,000 miles (unverified, odometer stopped @ 460ish, now running GPS), almost all original where it counts.</p>
<p>I'm no mechanic, but I think a few factors explain why my car drives so well for such high mileage:</p>
<p>1) I drive long distances, almost all of it highway. Minimizes gear-shifting, keeps engine RPMs low for less wear, and the engine is hardly doing work while racking up miles quickly. This also means the oil stays warm--as I understand it, cold-starts are where engines experience the most wear.</p>
<p>2) Maintenance has always been of UTMOST importance. I'm strict in that I change my oil every 6,000 miles, transmission fluid change (NO FLUSH) every 50,000 miles. Vehicle specific, but every 100,000 miles I change the spark plugs, timing belt &amp; tensioner, and coolant pump. Tire-wise, I rotate every oil change and only buy all-seasons (they seem to last longer). Every once in a while, I have a good mechanic friend look it over too. He greases the chassis as well (no set interval though).</p>
<p>3) Good driving habits. For example, my wife has a tendency to reverse and then slam it into drive before the car comes to a complete stop (I've seen lots of people do this). Over time, I imagine that could decrease the life of the transmission. Also, let your car idle for a few minutes before shifting gears on a cold-start.. the transmission needs time to get the fluids flowing. Basically, treat your car like you WANT it to last forever. Of course, I think it's good to open it up every once in a while too (full-throttle runs).</p>
<p>I'm positive I'm forgetting some stuff... if I think of more, I'll add it. And of course, most of what I've said is fairly intuitive. Personally, I've never run any fuel or oil additives. I fill up at gas stations I trust (always Top-Tier, which I guess has additives), and never when there are tankers filling the reservoirs (they stir up debris which could end up in your tank). </p>
<p>Lastly, I imagine trucks are simply designed to go long, long distances. They're probably over-engineered by comparison to passenger vehicles. I'm not a truck driver, however, so I can't necessarily speak to that from personal experience. My point is that with the right treatment, passenger cars can go for a long time too. Maintenance (even when you think you don't need it) really is a paramount factor. Last year we traded my wife's Hyundai at only 100k because it was starting to develop a bit of rod knock (don't ask me how or why). All I can say is I wasn't the one responsible for maintaining it. The new car, I check in on every once in a while ;)</p>
<p>In summation, I've always treated my car like a member of the family (or a great friend). My driving style (frequently and for long distances) is also favorable--city-bound cars won't typically last as long because they operate under more &quot;harsh&quot; conditions (short trips, stop &amp; go traffic). Most of it comes down to maintenance, I believe. Truck drivers are probably especially meticulous, since their career quite literally depends on their vehicle.</p>
<p>I like to think of how much money I've saved with this car. I bought it with around 170k for only $4.5k and am almost to the moon for the second time. She hasn't asked for much, either. I know at least one other person here already said it: people have a tendency to treat cars as if they're disposable. At the slightest problem, people would rather trade it than put a little money into it (I admit we took this route with my wife's car but frankly, I always kind of hated that car anyways). It's not the end of the world (look at the economy it has produced!), but it's something to think about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two main reasons for this:
1) You are talking about &quot;long haulers.&quot; These guys and gals drive 8 (previously 12) hours a day with 90% of it being on the highway in their highest gear. This doesn't actually put a lot of strain or wear on the vehicle. &quot;City haulers&quot; on the other hand drive stop-and-go and wear their trucks out significantly quicker.
2) Diesel semis are designed specifically to be rebuilt. The cylinders are lined so you don't have to change the entire engine but just six liners, as well as the pistons, connecting rods and bearings (in addition to your typical wear parts, like injectors). In the end, you basically have a new motor without completely switching it.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diesel tractors (commonly referred to as 'trucks' or 'semis', when a semi is a type of trailer...) have engines which are quite commonly rebuilt as a preventative measure, which could be scheduled months or even years in advance if a set number of kilometers or poor oil sample results are identified. Many of the tractors you see on the highway have had extensive maintenance and many, many parts replaced in order to make sure that the vehicle they paid $250k  for will stay on the road until such time as either a new tractor is nessecary or they are making significant profit with the old, paid for tractor they own now.</p>
<p>Diesel fuel is a lubricant, yes, but it is also VERY dirty (ultra low sulphur diesel in North America is actually dirtier than ULSD in Europe) which means that with new oil standards (CES20081 CJ4 low ash oil) you will need more frequent oil changes to recome contaminants from the system. This usually doesn't happen, and I see a lot of diesel engines everyday that do not make it to one million of anything. And now with most large tractor fleets moving away from owning trucks for more than 3 years seeing a tractor with 1mil  is going to be more and more uncommon.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Along with the already discussed benefits of the diesel engines long life...</p>
<p>Most of the wear and tear on engines (and vehicles as a whole) is due to stop-and-go traffic. The repetition of braking, idling, then accelerating, then braking again puts more strain on the engine because inertia will make moving the car harder from stopped.  The life of a semi truck is mostly spent on the interstate,at a single speed, and maintaining a pretty constant RPM. The Truck can potentially only accelerate from stopped once a day, he can carry his momentum from that point on until he runs out of fuel. This puts way less strain on the motor itself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
