		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems to me that it would be really tough to surface during some of the storms I have seen on youtube (aircraft carriers seemingly thrown around). How on earth can a tiny dolphin surface and get an appropriate breath in without pulling in water? does their respiratory system have a special valve in it to ensure water can't get through?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you're greatly underestimating how comfortable marine mammals are in the ocean. They're literally in their element. They pop up and take a breath, no big deal. If you've ever seen seals in a high surf zone, they just bob &amp; float with not a care in the world, and duck underwater at the right time to avoid injury. And <em>that's</em> near a rocky coast, a far more dangerous environment than the open ocean.</p>
<p>For one, marine mammals are flexible, compared to the rigid hull of a ship which is prone to breakage.</p>
<p>For another, they're small &amp; nimble compared to aircraft carriers &amp; tankers. Surfacing during huge swells would feel more akin to an amusing ride than a life-threatening scenario.</p>
<p>They're also made to be <em>in</em> the water, not on top of the water. Trying to keep an open canoe afloat in rough weather would be a harrowing experience. But simply floating an incredibly buoyant body near the surface? No challenge whatsoever. </p>
<p>Marine mammals are incredibly well-designed for taking quick gulps of air, and in large seas it's easy to time breaths so they don't take in gulps of water. Finally, I'll add that all marine creatures are by definition fine-tuned to ocean living. Even experienced humans (surfers, for example) can feel inertial changes underwater and sense when wave crests are approaching. Marine mammals' ability to read water far outstrips ours, as you can imagine, which would give them further ability to withstand, even enjoy, large seas. At sea you can often see dolphins surfing the swells, and I wouldn't be surprised if they used large storms to their benefit, traveling long distances with minimal effort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the more violent the storm, the larger the waves. the larger the waves, the longer the time between waves. an air breathing mammal would have plenty of time to grab a breath in a large wave trough. </p>
<p>Not to mention - whales and dolphins can leap from the water. Not sure if they are able to grab a breath while doing so or not. </p>
<p>Edit: Don't forget - some of these critters can hold their breath for 30 minutes or more. If you only need a couple breaths an hour, what are the chances of that violent storm just sticking around long enough to even be a challenge?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whale Watching Captain/Naturalist here. Cetaceans exhale most of their lung contents AND inhale in less than a second. Even while they are breathing &quot;normally,&quot; they hold their breath between ten and thirty seconds. After a handful of breaths they often &quot;sound&quot; (diving deeper, and for an extended period of time- anywhere from 5 to 90 minutes depending on species). For developed adults, a storm would be well within their comfort zone. However, a storm would very likely present a threat to newborns and perhaps very young individuals. This is believed to be part of why some species (though not all) migrate to calm, warm, and protected waters during their respective winter months (when storms are most prevalent). I hope.my answer helps :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>.....So apparently I made it 30 years without knowing Whales and Dolphins breathe air. What are you telling me right now? I know they have blow holes but I never once thought they used it to breathe. I just thought it was somehow related to food. Like they eat something and the stuff they don't eat they blow out through the hole. </p>
<p>Fucking damnit I'm stupid</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The surface of the ocean away from land during a large storm isn't full of breakers - it's just rolling wave after rolling wave. The waves can get quite large, but keep in mind that the animal is mostly under the water. It can surface on the back of the wave and ride the wave down to the bottom of the trough and breath that entire time, and then just submerge and the bottom of the trough. </p>
<p>it takes a little bit more timing than on a calm surface, but otherwise is basically the same operation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
