		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When sound, or any wave, travels through a medium, it loses energy by transferring it to the medium. For sound, this usually means kinetic energy - the medium vibrates with the sound, which robs the sound wave of energy. Each time the wave cycles through the medium, some of that energy is lost. Since lower frequencies of sound have a longer wavelength, it takes fewer wave cycles to make it through the medium, therefore less energy is absorbed by the medium.</p>
<p>Say you're using a piece of material that matches the wavelength of a 20 Hz sine, i.e. 1 cycle of a 20 Hz wave takes up the width of the piece of material. At 40 Hz, it takes two cycles for the wave to make it to the other side. At 80 Hz, 4 cycles, and so on, all the way from 20 to 20,000 Hz. By the time you've reached 20kHz, your waves are having to cycle through 1,000 times to make it to the other side, compared to just once at 20 Hz, meaning much more energy is being lost from the higher frequencies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two reasons I can think of off the top of my head.</p>
<p>First, higher frequencies have shorter periods and shorter wavelengths (Edit: Humans can hear wavelengths ranging from a centimeter-ish, the highest of screechy high pitches, to tens of meters, the deepest of groans). That means these waves are sensitive to changes in short time periods and over short distance scales, while low frequencies just average over them and don't notice. For example, if the air in your home has a bunch of little eddies and turbulent stuff going on at the 1cm scale and smaller, wavelengths at the 1cm scale and smaller are going to get disrupted. But, longer wavelengths just average over these little features and don't notice. Waves in water that would make swimming difficult for a human don't even jostle a supertanker. </p>
<p>A great everyday example of this effect is the color of the sky. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and so bounces off dust in the atmosphere, making it look like there's blue light coming from everywhere. Red light has a longer wavelength and isn't sensitive to the smaller dust particles, so it passes through the atmosphere cleanly.</p>
<p>Second is resonance. Longer wavelengths can get the entire building/car/etc. vibrating in phase with them, because they are similar in size to the building/car/etc. This transmits their sound through the entire object very nicely. Smaller wavelengths can get, say, nearby paper clips to vibrate in phase with them, but that doesn't help them spread nicely over the scale of a building/car/etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mediums such as walls are not quite rigid, so the sound wave gives some energy up to the wall each oscillation and causes the wall to move a bit. This decreases the amplitude of the sound wave each cycle. High frequency sounds lose energy more quickly than low frequency sounds simply because they experience more oscillations during the time they are propagating through the wall. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really though if you had a sound source and sheet of material between it and you, and increased frequency of the source while maintaining constant weighted amplitude, it would get louder as you pass the critical frequency of the material due to coincidence. </p>
<p>Edit:coincidence not attenuation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
