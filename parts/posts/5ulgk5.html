		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/tsuuga has done a decent summary. I'd like to explain it in a little more detail:</p>
<p>With net neutrality in place, your ISP is obliged to provide you with an internet connection, the speed of which is determined by how much you pay for that service.<br />
And no matter which website you go to, the speed at which you receive the data (load the website, stream the audio or video) will be the same.</p>
<p>Without net neutrality, the ISP is free to decide at which speeds you're going to be receiving data from various sites. For example, your ISP might decide that it doesn't want youtube videos to load so quickly, because reasons, They might say &quot;Well our infrastructure can't handle video data at that amount. Yes we can upgrade, but it will cost more money. Youtube can pay us an amount and we'll make sure their data goes through smoothly.<br />
And they can extend the same kind of deal to anyone. With diffrent prices.  </p>
<p>Seems fair so far right? Well not entirely, a lot of ISP's have other interests as well. For example, in the US Time Warner has it's own video streaming service. And Netflix has one as well.<br />
In this case it's a very good idea for TW to throttle the bandwith of Netflix to a point where it's no longer possible for you to watch Netflix. But their own streaming service will work like a dream. So it gives ISP's unfair oppertunities to stop competitors from doing business.</p>
<p>And the same thing could happen for other things as well. Perhaps removing/restricting access to websites which go against the interests of the company. IE you can't see the site for a competing ISP because well, that's competition. You can't go to the site for political party X because they're going to try and push through legislation that the ISP doesn't like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Internet service providers could charge you, companies or both higher fees to retain the same service and they also gain the ability to censor as they see fit as they could simply strange connections to websites they don't want to have traffic.</p>
<p>Internet access could become more subscription based. You'd have your 'base internet' access, but for only $19,99 you could subscribe to the Social Media Package™ and have unrestricted access to Twitter, Facebook etc. Alternatively those sites would pay the ISP to give users access to their websites. If you like videos, for an additional fee you could also subscribe to the YouTube Package™ - you get the idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right now, ISPs have to treat all data the same.  If neutrality goes away, your ISP could take bribes from a company like best buy and make their website run faster.  Meanwhile, Jim Smith, the owner of jim's electronics, is unable to afford to bribe the ISP, so his website takes 5 minutes to load and all his customers get pissed off.  Jim's customers buy things from the best buy website and Jim goes out of business because he couldnt afford to be extorted by comcast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I pay for internet service.  That service is a certain speed and may include a data cap (or not).  For my payment I am entitled to &quot;equal&quot; access to the entire internet.  My internet provider is NOT entitled to give priority to certain traffic over others.  This is a world with a neutral internet.  The ISP's network is natural to the traffic it carries, it does not give priority to some over others, it simply gives me exactly what I requested at the maximum speed it is able. </p>
<p>In a world without a natural ISP, the internet provider (for example, Virizon, Comcast, Time Warner ect) is able to give priority to certain traffic over others. At first, that seems OK, but once we start looking at it in pratice things look much darker.</p>
<p>What the ISPs want, is the ability to charge the company that you are connecting to for the right for a good connection.  So in addition to charging you for internet service, they'll be charging companies like Youtube, Netflix, Facebook and so on so that those companies can access the highest speeds.  Keep in mind, these companies are already paying their own ISP for their internet access.  But now they would also be paying your ISP for special access to you. This is particularly important for HD video content as it uses lots of bandwidth for good quality. </p>
<p>Any website that does not have a special deal with your ISP, would be delivered at a slower service.  This again seems kind of fine, but kind of not.  Where it really falls apart is in the world of innovation.</p>
<p>It was not that long ago when streaming video games was just not really a thing people did.  Then along came twitch (and others) and the popularity exploded.  Not streaming games is extremely popular. </p>
<p>In a world of a not natural internet a start up like Twitch could never have survived.  It pays for it's own internet access.  You pay for your internet access.  But baby Twitch can't afford these extra fees to every ISP in America, so they are on the &quot;general access&quot; network.  But they don't have enough bandwidth to deliver HD content over that network, so everything is pixilitaed and of poor quality. Some users use it anyway, other's don't because the service is so poor.</p>
<p>In a natural intent, the users would choose to use the bandwidth they've paid for to stream from Twitch at the highest quality possible.  In a non natural world, Twitch would have to pay for that privilege and the users would not be the wiser. </p>
<p>It gets even more nasty.  Netflix is a BIG competitor to your cable company.  For most users, their cable company is also their internet provider.  In a non natural world, the cable company could tell Netflix &quot;OK, no more HD streaming for you, we're just not going to allow that&quot;. Then turn right around and offer their own streaming service that DOES stream in HD. So if you want HD streaming you'll be forced to buy it from the cable company. </p>
<p>You already see a little of this in the Cell Phone world.  AT&amp;T owns Direct TV.  If you subscribe to Direct TV now (Direct TV's streaming service) and use it on your AT&amp;T cell phone, it does not count against your data.  If you use Netflix, it does.  So if you have to choose what streaming service to subscribe to, you'll chose the one that you can actually use while on mobile data. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basic point: Your service provider will have control on what you do online.</p>
<p>How is this bad: You already know this, but for speculation and prospective purposes, but basically it can (and will) be corrupted for political/financial agendas.</p>
<p>E.G. Your ISP leans to the right, I mean FAR right like Breitbart right. Your ISP has the right/capability to basically prevent you from accessing any news site that isn't far-right or Breitbart.</p>
<p>You like streaming movies on Netflix. Your ISP happens to have a deal with Time Warner Cable. Your ISP prevents videos from Netflix, Youtube, or any other service that loads videos from working on your computer. The only time you can stream is content from TWC because your ISP controls what data and how much you have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
