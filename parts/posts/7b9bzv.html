		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Key things are transfer payments.  You could create iamkimi Brands that owns all your product's names and trademarks and charges iamkimi Europe and iamkimi America to use those names and trademarks.  Doing this smartly lets you recognize the profits wherever iamkimi Brands is located rather than where your sales are. </p>
<p>This gets your tax rate down to the level charged in a low corporate tax country (Ireland is the common example) at about 12.5%.  </p>
<p>However, you can go much further.  Doing this uses some unintended consequences of EU and EU member nation laws, with the goal of creating income that no one calls earned in their nation.  </p>
<p>By setting up a Bermuda company that has an office in Ireland, Ireland doesn't consider it an Irish company, and Bermuda doesn't tax the income the company earned in Ireland.  You can't just do that with the first firm, but by taking a series of steps (the original was to have the iamkimi Brands pay a royalty to a Dutch subsidiary (iamkimi Netherlands) and then pay another royalty to a second Bermuda/Irish company (iamkimi Brands2) you create income that neither country recognizes as corporate income.  </p>
<p>And the US allows foreign subsidiaries to earn income indefinitely without tax so long as it's reinvested overseas, and you report to your owners the consolidated financial statements which include the income and assets from all your subsidiaries (the US firm iamkimi Holdings owns all the above firms so reports their income as it's own).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all done through subsidiaries that the company owns in lower tax areas. This is really easy when it comes to intellectual property because they can just sell their subsidiaries the rights for a one time tax payment or they can try to claim that the income generating idea was created in a lower taxed area. Another interesting and very very smart move: a parent company issues debt and the subsidiary loans the parent company money while the parent company is able to take a tax write off for the interest payments made to the subsidiary. It's genius really and, in my opinion, it's one of those &quot;don't hate the player, hate the game&quot; situations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the ways I heard it is this:</p>
<p>Apple has HQs in Ireland. They buy iPhones from China say at 200€ a piece. They then sell those iPhones to apple of America for 1000€. Apple of America then sells those iPhones for 1000€ for a grand total of 0 income.</p>
<p>There's probably more nuance and you need to pay something, but the idea is to shift profits to where they are taxes the least</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Company's are taxed off of profits. Profit is revenue - costs. A company can be located in multiple countries and therefore taxed in multiple countries. If a product is created in one country and sold in another country. One country has the revenue and the other has the the cost. So their each missing a piece to calculate profit. To create the missing piece the countries pretend that company made an internal sale whenever the product leaves the country's jurisdiction. Countries generally allow company's to determine this internal transfer price since its to expensive for the government to determine a rate for every product. </p>
<p>Company's can abuse this leeway by creating accounting profits in countries with low tax rates by saying that the internal sale price was high (more profits for the selling division) or low (less profits for the selling division). Though keep in mind that if the company is audited they need to justify their internal sale price or they will get fined.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Irish law says you have to pay the relevant tax to the Netherlands, Dutch law (the Netherlands) says you have to pay tax to Ireland. Then when it comes time to pay your tax neither country wants it, both governments know about this, and allow it because it brings in a lot of business that the countries otherwise wouldn't get. </p>
<p>There is even (or was I don't recall if it's finished yet) a court case where the EU was taking Ireland to court trying to force Apple to pay money it owes to them, Ireland are appearing on Apple's side saying they don't want the money that Apple lawfully owes. This is because any judgment against Apple would damage their reputation as a tax avoidance haven. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
