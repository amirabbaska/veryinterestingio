		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>He invaded and occupied major industrial military producers, like Czechoslovakia. Read this from Wikipedia...</p>
<p>&quot;In a speech delivered in the Reichstag, Hitler stressed the military importance of occupation, noting that by occupying Czechoslovakia, Germany gained 2,175 field cannons, 469 tanks, 500 anti-aircraft artillery pieces, 43,000 machine guns, 1,090,000 military rifles, 114,000 pistols, about a billion rounds of ammunition and three million anti-aircraft grenades. This amount of weaponry would be sufficient to arm about half of the then Wehrmacht.[9] Czechoslovak weaponry later played a major part in the German conquests of Poland (1939) and France (1940) - countries that had pressured Czechoslovakia's surrender to Germany in 1938.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: I said invaded and occupied, but Austria was sympathetic and became German through an Anschluss plebiscite. Czech Sudetenland and the Skoda arms factory was gifted to Germany through the Munich Agreement in an appeasement move. This is all covered by commenters below.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what other people are saying:</p>
<p>In WW1, Germany launched a sudden attack against France (and Belgium), and so most of the trench warfare happened next to its borders, but outside of Germany. When the rides of battle turned, and Entente soldiers began making their way towards Germany, they surrendered before they actually reached Germany. </p>
<p>This means that the German soil saw no fighting during the war, and the country's infrastructure was essentially intact. Compare and contrast with France that had huge swathes of its territory rendered completely unusable to the point that some areas remain even today still off-limits. </p>
<p>EDIT: changed the text to make the devastation in France clearer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It didn't. It was wrecking its own economy in the build-up of WW2 (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mefo_bills" target="_blank">hiding its near bankruptcy by handing out funny money</a>), it was desperately short on manpower (parts of the army were demobilized between Poland and France so the men could be sent back into factories to make the ammunition they'd be shooting later!) and so short on equipment that each conquered country had to be plundered for just enough materials to fund the <em>next</em> conquest (the soldiers invading Russia had to use captured French and Polish equipment, which were conquered using Czech tanks). </p>
<p>The German war economy was a dumpster fire that needed to rape and pillage all of Europe to <em>barely</em> match the industrial output of a fully mobilized Britain, with no hope of ever matching the USSR or the USA. (Hence the whole Blitzkrieg idea – Germany couldn't afford more than a few months war, therefore everyone had to surrender within a few months. Too bad Stalin didn't want to cooperate.)</p>
<p>Germany mainly got away with it during the 1930s and the first two years of the war because everyone else was too reluctant to mobilize and match Germany's war machine – the Great Depression was wrecking havoc with everyone else's economies too, and they instead focused on rebuilding their industrial base to have a healthy civilian economy instead. For France and the rest of continental Europe, this was a bad idea, since Germany could quickly assemble an army <em>just barely</em> good enough to take on the continental European peace time armies. But for Britain, the USSR and the USA, this gave them the broad industrial base they needed to out-last Germany.</p>
<p>Germany never had hope of sustaining a long war. Not enough time nor resources to build a sufficient navy (and thus no hope of taking on the US or even Britain), no time nor resources to develop high-performance aero engines needed for strategic bombers (and thus no way to even slow down Britain, or hit the Soviet war industry); hell, for a large part there was no time nor resources to even build <em>assembly lines!</em> Apart from a few prestige projects like the Bf 109 short-range fighter (too short range to fight over Britain) and the Ju 88 light bomber (too light bomb load to be useful over Britain), Germany couldn't afford assembly line manufacturing for most of their equipment in the build-up to WW2. </p>
<p>Even Speer, despite his promises, couldn't rationalize German industry as much as he liked to – too little resources and too little manpower to get by. He mostly just fudged the numbers by burning through slave labour (literally, in many cases; the Germans killed more slaves while building the V-2 than they did by using it) and allocating all available resources to tank and airplane factories at the expense of &quot;less important&quot; industry… like machine tool factories that made the tooling said tank and plane factories needed to keep running. </p>
<p>Manpower, as mentioned, was a similar dumpster fire. Because Germany was pouring all its resources into getting ready for WW2, it didn't have any reserves to invest in, say, mechanized farming equipment. (Not that it would've been useful, with how little oil Germany had.) As a result, Germany needed a <strong>lot</strong> of farm hands and peasants to feed its population, and mobilization for war was only possible by raiding all of Europe for slave labour and food (thus leading to millions of people starving). Again, completely unsustainable; Germany ran out of its nominal manpower reserves by 1940 and was improvising from then on. The Allies, on the other hand, never had that problem – both because they <em>had</em> more reserves, and because they weren't ideologically blind and mobilized women at a much more massive scale in all possible fields (factory work, and in case of the USSR, even front line combat duty).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to that question entails an accurate understanding of WWII, which few people in the West are ever taught. Germany had enough resources and manpower to start WWII because their entire war plan consisted of a knockout blow to the Soviet Union that would conclude the war in a matter of three months. Barbarossa was not the &quot;start&quot; of he war for Germany. It was the beginning, middle, and end. They didn't really have the resources to fight beyond that and when Barbarossa failed to topple the Soviet Government, the Germans were doomed. If the Germans knew how strong the Russians really were, they never would have invaded (though they'd still be in a perilous position because every year the Russians would increase their advantage and eventually use that to invade Germany). The real question is how the Russians became strong enough to not just withstand a German assault but to counterattack and conquer all of Eastern Europe just 20 years after losing WWI.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
