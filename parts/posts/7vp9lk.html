		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Digesting food takes energy, since your body has to produce enzymes to break down food in your stomach and then move a lot of muscles to break it down some more and later to absorb the nutrients from the food. </p>
<p>When you're sick, your body tries to divert whatever energy is necessary to fight the intruding bacteria. Usually for small infections, your body often recognizes the bacteria and knows how much energy is necessary to get rid of it, thus able to be more efficient in getting rid of it without making you lose your appetite. When you encounter bacteria that you've never encountered before, your body now has to work a little harder to memorize and fight against that bacteria. This takes more energy, and your body isn't exactly sure how much energy is necessary, so it might take some more as a precaution. This is usually what makes you feel tired.</p>
<p>There are also bacteria that uses the nutrients your body absorbs to grow. To prevent this, your body will make you lose your appetite so that you won't eat so much or at all. This way, in the event the bacteria does feed on the nutrients your body absorbs, your body can prevent bacteria growth and get rid of it much faster. Of course, not all bacteria do this, but your body can't tell the difference when it hasn't encountered the bacteria before, so it's really a precaution. Most of the time, it's fine to eat. You just won't feel like it though.</p>
<p>Edit: The second part might just be a bonus side-effect, but I consider it part of the cause. Let me know if anyone finds an article discussing this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
