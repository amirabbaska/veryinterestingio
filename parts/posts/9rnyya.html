		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read a Bunch of reasons:</p>
<p>Pressing makes it hurt a little more - natural pain relievers respond - then you stop (or massage) and now it's not under pressure and filled with pain relief molecules.</p>
<p>Theory 2: by moving around the muscles, you allow the... Lactic acid?... To be pushed through thus allowing your body to remove it. (like squeezing a tube filled with liquid)</p>
<p>Theory 3. Worn muscles develop cuts and need to build on them selves. Looking at it might look kinda like a pile of spaghetti - by pressing it, it allows the fibers to get into better place.</p>
<p>Theory 4 : benevolent wizards. </p>
<p>Mobile. Spelling n formatting. </p>
<p>Edit: of course the joke response gets the most attention. I love you internets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It temporarily reduces inflammation through the application of pressure, which feels good. It also puts pressure on pain receptors, which feels bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gate Control Theory: sensory nerves are faster than pain nerves, so when you activate sensory nerves when you press down on the muscle, they block the pain nerves’ ability to tell your brain ouch. This pressing also causes “tissue damage” which is why it hurts a little, but ultimately feels better due to not as many pain signals getting to the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It could be a learned enjoyment of the pain because you start associating it with the relief that follow.</p>
<p>The first times I got massages they were unpleasant and painful, now I enjoy them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
