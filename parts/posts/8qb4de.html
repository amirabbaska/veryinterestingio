		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Overall yes, for cervical adenocarcinoma, no.</p>
<p>Long answer: I would say that the introduction of Pap smear screening and HPV testing is a bigger factor for the decrease in the incidence of cervical cancer since it can reliably detect precancerous lesions such as ASCUS, ASCH, LSIL and HSIL. Of course the introduction of HPV vaccination is also helpful as a method of primary prevention. But while the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma is decreasing in the developed world the cervical adenocarcinoma incidence has been increasing. Conventional pap smears are less effective in detecting glandular lesions so invasive adenocarcinoma may be missed with these screening methods and also some studies suggest that HPV infection plays a less major role in their development compared to squamous cell carcinoma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) can induce cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Vaccination against HPV can play an important role in CIN prevention. This study aims to estimate the efficacy of L1 protein vaccines (Cervarix and Gardasil) in CIN 1, 2, 3 risk reduction using meta-analysis. Relevant articles were identified by two independent researchers searching international databanks. After application of inclusion/exclusion criteria and quality assessment, eligible articles were entered into the final meta-analysis. Inverse variance method and fixed effect model were used to combine the results of the primary studies. The heterogeneity between the results was assessed using Cochrane and <em>I</em>2 indices. Of 11,530 evidence identified during the primary search, three papers were found eligible for meta-analysis, including 7213 participants in the intervention groups and 7170 healthy controls**. The efficacy (95&#37; confidence interval) of HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 monovalent and quadrivalent vaccines against CIN 1, CIN 2, and CIN 3 were estimated as of 95&#37; (88-98), 97&#37; (85-99), and 95&#37; (78-99), respectivel**y. This study showed that L1 protein vaccines Cervarix and Gardasil are highly protective vaccines playing an effective role in the prevention of HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 which are responsible for CIN 1, CIN 2, and CIN 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In about 10 years, we will be able to see a decline in deaths from cervical cancer if this trend holds.  Agree with u/udenizc that pap smear screening and HPV testing is the major factor in the fight against cervical cancer, but we still see metastatic cervical cancer EVERY DAY at our cancer center and hopefully these vaccines will prevent a significant fraction of these cases in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’d like to add that because there are many strains, being vaccinated doesn’t protect against all of them and you can still get HPV. Pap smears however allow to detect it and treat it on time. So even if it’s unpleasant, please do it at the recommended frequency!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no data that I know of yet showing that the rates of invasive cervical cancer have declined due to the HPV vaccine (in fact, the incidence of HPV related throat cancer is increasing), but this is mainly because it’s too early to see an effect yet. Elimination of HPV related cancers is exactly the goal of vaccination and a public health campaign directed at this was recently endorsed by the Americans cancer society:
