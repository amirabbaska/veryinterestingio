		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recently I saw an article dating 2014 saying that WADA had banned the use of Xenon and Argon then I saw a 2017 article saying there's still no test for either of them from what I've read athletes, mainly long distance runners and cyclists inhale the gas and it enhances their performance but how? My understanding is that both are inert/noble gases which means they are unreactive so how do they enhance performance</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the replys I have a good understanding of it now </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind xenon is not inert! It can experience a dipole due to weak electron attraction to the nucleus in the outermost electron shell, which not only allows it to form compounds (e.g. xenon tetrafluoride), but it can also interact with certain protein structures.</p>
<p>For example, as another user mentioned, xenon is actually a brilliant anesthetic. There’s been quite a bit of work done with it, and it’s totally awesome: Blood solubility is low, so it goes in, does it’s job, and leaves your bloodstream super fast, allowing for quick induction and quick recovery. The only limiting factor is price. Xenon costs about $8 per liter in the current market. Say we have a mean flow of 2L/min for a given procedure that lasts 60 minutes. That’s $960 for the gas alone. Not to mention fees for other supplies, fees to pay the anesthesiologist, or the cost of the actual surgery.</p>
<p>As others have mentioned, EPO production is why it’s banned in sports. Just wanted to point out though that xenon (and some other noble gases) are not biologically inert. If you inhale enough xenon, you will pass out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
