		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/dynamo_effect.html" target="_blank">Dynamo Theory</a>. Quote:</p>
<p><em>&quot;In this dynamo mechanism, fluid motion in the Earth's outer core moves conducting material (liquid iron) across an already existing, weak magnetic field and generates an electric current. The electric current, in turn, produces a magnetic field that also interacts with the fluid motion to create a secondary magnetic field.&quot;</em></p>
<p>So, to paraphrase, while the iron itself is not magnetic, it produces an electric current, which generates an electo-magnetic effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two different magnetic effects there.  </p>
<p>The inherent &quot;magnetism&quot; of ferrous magnets (&quot;permanent magnets&quot;), like you might find on your fridge, is due to a magnetic field being aligned in the metal (frozen, quite literally). As you heat the metal, the field &quot;melts&quot; and becomes misaligned.  </p>
<p>The magnetic field generated by the core is due to the material being in motion. Electric and magnetic fields are generated by charged particles in motion. A classic example of this is an electromagnet where you coil conductive wire and run electricity through it to generate a magnet (electricity is just electrons, charged particles, in motion). The liquid iron at the core of earth has sufficient charge that it acts in a similar manner, and generates a magnetic field. If the earth's core would cool fairly quickly, and we had an external magnetic field that was strong enough - the earth could become a permanent magnet as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason why the earth generates a magnetic field despite iron losing its magnetism at a temperature much lower than the core is because the molten core, which contains electric charges, rotates and thus produces an electric current which in turn produces the
magnetic field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So magnetism is a bit weird in general. Electricity and magnetism are part of the same basic force, electromagnetism, and they're both caused by the movement of electrons.</p>
<p>Magnetism, in particular, arises as a consequence  of electron motion. Moving electrical charges generate a magnetic field. </p>
<p>There's two very basic types of magnet then: permanent magnets and electromagnets. Permanent magnets are likely what you're thinking of when you talk about iron losing its magnetism. They're the result of an imbalance in electron spins throughout a material, resulting in a net motion that's moves in one direction. This net motion creates a magnetic field, and can be lost because heat disturbs the crystal structure of the material, allowing them to reorient and balance out the spins. However, at the pressures of the solid iron core, it takes much more heat to disturb the structure, meaning the core itself can remain magnetic at much higher temperatures--though this field should be fairly weak.</p>
<p>Electromagnets result from moving the electrons through a material in a certain pattern to induce a magnetic field. This works in reverse too, as moving a magnet through a coiled conductor can also generate an electrical current. In the core of the earth, you've got a strange setup for this: instead of moving the electrons through the conductor, you're moving the conductor itself (the molten iron) around the magnetic solid core. This electrical &quot;current&quot; around the magnet essentially acts like an amplifier for the magnetic field. It's something of a combination of an electromagnet and a permanent magnet. At least from my understanding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Superheating any metal will create an electromagnetic field due to the movement of electrons. </p>
<p>Take a massive amount of metal, molten and flowing with heat and pressure, and you get a significant amount of electron movement, and a resulting electromagnetic field.</p>
<p>This is also why the Earth's magnetic field is so inconsistent in terms of flux lines and fluctuates significantly over time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
