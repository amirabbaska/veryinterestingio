It's fairly common knowledge that carbon-14 dating relies on decay into nitrogen-14, but of course nitrogen and carbon have very different chemical properties. The half life of carbon-14 is very long, which means that the conversion of carbon to nitrogen doesn't happen at an appreciable rate, but nonetheless something has to happen to the molecules in which the carbon is located when it suddenly becomes a nitrogen atom. Has this been studied? Does the result vary for sp3, sp2, and sp hybridized carbons? Does the degree of substitution effect the resulting products (primary, secondary, and so on)? I imagine this can be considered for other elements as well (isotopes with shorter, more &quot;studyable&quot; half-lives), but the fact that carbon can form so many different types of bonds makes this particular example very interesting to me.</p></div></div>
