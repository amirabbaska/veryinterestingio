		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a chemistry major studying organic synthesis and catalysis, but something we've never talked about is the molecular effects of isotopic decay. It's fairly common knowledge that carbon-14 dating relies on decay into nitrogen-14, but of course nitrogen and carbon have very different chemical properties. The half life of carbon-14 is very long, which means that the conversion of carbon to nitrogen doesn't happen at an appreciable rate, but nonetheless something has to happen to the molecules in which the carbon is located when it suddenly becomes a nitrogen atom. Has this been studied? Does the result vary for sp3, sp2, and sp hybridized carbons? Does the degree of substitution effect the resulting products (primary, secondary, and so on)? I imagine this can be considered for other elements as well (isotopes with shorter, more &quot;studyable&quot; half-lives), but the fact that carbon can form so many different types of bonds makes this particular example very interesting to me.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the decay type.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alpha decays give the remaining nuclei a large kinetic energy - typically in the range of tens of keV. Way too much for chemical bonds to matter, so the atom gets ejected. Same for proton and neutron emission.</li>
<li>Gamma decays typically give the atom less than 1 eV, not enough to break chemical bonds, and the isotope doesn't change either, so the molecule has a good chance to stay intact.</li>
<li>That leaves beta decays (like Carbon-14) as interesting case. A typical recoil energy is a few eV, but with a large range (and no threshold - the recoil can be zero, as it is a three-body decay). It can be sufficient to break bonds, but it does not have to be. If the molecule doesn't break directly, you replace C with N+ for example. What happens afterwards? I don't know, I'll let chemists answer that.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read something recently where they need to engineer pressure release valves in radioactive waste storage containers.  Many of the heavier elements have long term alpha decay, which essentially means it's off-gassing helium.  Eventually, helium would build up and our grandchildren have to deal with atomic waste balloons popping in abandoned mineshafts around the world.  Pretty sure it was a Nova doc on Plutonium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
