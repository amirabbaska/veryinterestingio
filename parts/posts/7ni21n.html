		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They make soft chocolate.</p>
<p>It's called ganache. In kitchens, you melt chocolate with heavy cream and whip air into it to make it lighter. In general, this melts faster than the solid chocolate on the outside.</p>
<p>Edit: Whoops, didn't explain how it gets inside.</p>
<p>They use a split mold in order to make a hollow core which is then filled with ganache. You can see when you buy them, they have a very faint line going all the way around. This is left over from the mold.</p>
<p>Edit 2: <a href="https://imgur.com/Y3BVjrl" target="_blank">A lindor truffle pic!</a> </p>
<p>I've added a picture for clarity because some people don't see it. Look at the truffle in the back and you'll see the line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A simplistic overview:
Step one: line the spherical mold halves with tempered chocolate to form a shell, and let it set. Basically, you pour chocolate into the mold halves, and then let it drain out sleep slowly ; which leaves a shell.
Step two: fill both halves with a panache or other semi liquid filling .
Step 3 : let set until firm
Step 4; join the halves of the mold, fill as needed with more chocolate, and let it set
Step 5: pop them out of the molds</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two ways. </p>
<p>1) The shell is made then filled and capped with more of the shell chocolate. If there appears to be a small hole on the base or top this is how it was done. </p>
<p>2) An additional method is to chill or freeze the core then then dip it in the shell coating. </p>
<p>Some will use a split mold and that functions like style one, but that is not extremely common as it is a much more difficult method. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just look at one sometime.  There is a plugged hole on one end.  They put 2 hollow halves together then squirt the softer filling inside then plug the hole.</p>
<p>This is not how all truffles are made by any means. Just the lindor style ones.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
