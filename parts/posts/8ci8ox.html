Are they dispersed amongst the environment? Would they be stored in a way that they aren't immediately dangerous upon release? Are they burned off by any explosions? Please fill me in!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary way of destroying toxic chemicals is by burning it at an extremely hot temperature.  Traditional explosives aren't very effective since, like you insinuate, an explosion is just going to disperse the agents, and for simple substances they are not going to be stored just as precursors.</p>
<p>One of our first attempts to deal with that was to actually use a white phosporus bomb, amusingly enough.  The white phosphorus burns at such a high temerature it is able to destroy the agents in the explosion.  But anyone who knows anything about white phosphorus can see why this is uh...not an ideal solution, lets put it that way.</p>
<p>Last I checked, the more advanced version of this is using a thermite bomb.  Thermite burns as hot as is needed, but in a much more controlled manner in a form that's less volatile.  There are additional challenges to using a thermite bomb, but it also has a lot of advantages over white phosporus.</p>
<p>The easiest method, and the one I believe we did just recently in Syria, was to be indirect and simply target planes and helicopters that are able to carry and disperse the agents.  You can't gas your own population if you can't get the gas to them after all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First chemical weapons are generally not stored in the weaponized form, many chemical weapons have very short shelf lives, are risky to handle,  etc. So generally they are stored as an precursor chemicals that are mixed when the weapons is used.</p>
<p>Second the weapons we know Syria has or has used are chlorine and sarin. Chlorine is everywhere, it has many industrial uses, and in water treatment. Blowing up a storage facility is fairly safe except for the workers on site, because it disappates quickly, storage facilities are often far from urban areas.</p>
<p>Remember the attack occurred early in the morning, so most workers would be home.just blow up the storage tanks, maybe kill a few night crew workers, and maybe some of the manufacturing equipment.</p>
<p>For sarin, hope the precursors are stored away from each other, just maybe some incidental mixing may occur, but again early morning, far from residential areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most chemical agents are organic carbon based. I can't readily find which agent they used in Syria, but I'm going to assume carbon based. </p>
<p>The determining factor is the type of explosion. A high energy  might disperse a bit of the agent in the shockwave. </p>
<p>A lower energy blast (think more like napalm bombs) would result in the destruction of the organic chemicals due to the heat. </p>
<p>I'm far from an explosions expert, but I know there's a a specific term to describe the different types of explosions</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting question and one I'm curious to see answered as well, but bear in mind there likely were no chemicals there, save any residue in equipment too difficult to relocate. Syria had almost a weeks notice of the impending strike, so anything important that wasn't bolted down was likely relocated, and all components that could be unbolted and hauled away in that time were likely pulled out as well. What I'd really be interested in having explained is what the infrastructure to manufacture sarin looks like, to understand what was likely left there for us to destroy that will set them back significantly from starting the process up again elsewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They burn up but remember such countermeasures likely merely mitigate damage, not completely eliminate.</p>
<p>Chemical agent might still proliferate even if the delivery mechanism is intercepted. Just hopefully not as severely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
