		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your feed is in chronological order, it’s easier to feel like you’ve seen everything and can therefore leave the site without missing anything. If they jumble it all up, you don’t get the feeling of “completing” an action, so you continue scrolling and scrolling, seeing more and more ads. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It gives the social media companies more control over what content their users are exposed to. More control over the content means more control over the experience, which they tailor to a user so that their social media platform gets used more regularly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If something benefits the owner of a platform the platform owner will do that thing.</p>
<p>Without looking at the data, I'd guess that non-linear feeds result in more positive metrics for the platform owners. Probably more engagement, longer time in app etc.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that user preferences are only considered when they lead to increased conversion, leads, etc.</p>
<p>Tldr: apps do whatever makes you click more. Even if users <em>say</em> a thing makes them <em>like</em> the app more, if that thing makes them engage less, the app won't do it.</p>
<p>Tldrtldr: what makes people convert is considered over what people say they like.</p>
<p>Source: I'm in marketing and data from user surveys often doesn't correspond with analytics data about what actually results in higher conversion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
