<p>Hoe on earth does this work?</p>
<p>EDIT: Went to do stuff today and came back to a lot of shit. Thanks for all the feedback and discussion. Also, I just realized I misspelled &quot;How&quot; but I am going to leave it because I think it is funny.</p></div></div>

<p>Here is a frozen tube that's been cut open</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So no one has addressed WHY the colors come out evenly. The stripes are indeed injected into the tube, which can be seen from tube cross sections. However the <strong>reason</strong> the stripes come out so well is due to the mechanics of <strong>laminar flow</strong>. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p08_KlTKP50" target="_blank">video</a> is a good example of laminar flow in action. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFm8IxLwaoI" target="_blank">Here is a video showing tube filling with laminar flow.</a> If you have any other specific questions just let me know!

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on to u/AtomicFlx's comment, toothpaste in a tube would have a low Reynolds number. Basically this just means the flow would be <em>laminar</em>, meaning not easy to mix (not <em>turbulent</em>). This just related to its high viscosity and geometric constraints.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
