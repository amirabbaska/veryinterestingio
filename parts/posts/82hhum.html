<p>EDIT: for those wondering why this question comes up, Paul Allen's research team released pictures today of the recently discovered resting place of the USS Lexington which sank May 8, 1942 (links below). The pictures are incredible, and personally I'm most shocked by the impeccable state of the Naval aircraft which sank along with the carrier. It is the same research team that 'discovered' the USS Indianapolis in the month of August last year.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There can be a lot of factors. The chemical makeup of the water, the salinity, the current flow, pollution level, all of those can have a bearing on how much anything that sinks deteriorates. </p>
<p>For an extreme example, look at the wreck of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship\)" target="_blank">Vasa</a>. </p>
<p>That was a ship that went down in the 17th century and was recovered in the 1960s, in <em>astonishingly</em> good condition considering it was a wooden ship that had been underwater for nearly three hundred and fifty years. Again it depends on the conditions at the particular site. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First there isn't much organic material there for life to deteriorate. Then the surroundings are dark, cold,  and salty this means organisms that do grow there grow slowly. Chemical degradation is also slowed in the cold and dark (even with salt) and thus you end with what you see now. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Vasa was pretty deep in cold water too if I remember well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
