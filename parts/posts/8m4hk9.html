		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cell division is preceded by copying of all the chromosomes and splitting them between the two resulting cells. Nondisjunction can happen, which means the two copies don't split evenly and migrate to their corresponding new cells and they may all end up on one side and make a cell with double the normal amount. Repeat this a couple times and mess up the last one so only one X goes with the one that already has 4 and you end up with 5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sperm and eggs <em>should</em> only have one sex chromosome each (eggs will only have X, but it could be either X from the mother; sperm can have X or Y and this determines gender)</p>
<p>When eggs and sperm are made, the parent cell first <em>doubles</em> itself to have 4 copies of the sex chromsomes (a male will have XYXY and the female will have XXXX). The next step is <em>two</em> divisions in which all chromsomes segregate until there is only 1 copy of each. (After the first division, there will be 2 parent sperm cells XY and XY, and after the second division there will be 4 sperm X, X, Y, and Y).</p>
<p>Sometimes the chromosomes don't split evenly like they are supposed to. This might mean there is a sperm cell that still has XY (in this case the offspring will be XXY, a trisomy). If this unlikely event happens <em>twice</em> during <em>both</em> egg cell divisions, the final egg will have XXXX (instead of just X). If the fertilizing sperm has X, then the final product will be XXXXX.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't get your chromosomes directly from your parents, you get them from their gametes, their sperm and egg cells.  Gametes only have a single set of chromosomes, not the pairs most body cells have.  Or at least they are supposed to, sometimes the process of making gametes go wrong, and they get too many or too few.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if each parent only has either XX or XY chromosomes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their gametes are supposed to only have one X or one Y chromosome, but it doesn't always work out that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's see if I can actually apply what I've learned in my bio classes lol.</p>
<p>Cells duplicate their genetic info (DNA, which are condensed into chromosomes) in the S phase. Gametic cells (sperm/egg cells) contain sex chromosomes X and Y. They enter a process known as Meiosis after duplication. Meiosis is split into Meiosis I and Meiosis II. The baby in conception gets one X from mom and either an X or Y from dad. </p>
<p>However, defects can occur in the S phase or in the Meiosis I or II process. In S phase defect, multiple sex chromosomes can be duplicated. In Meiosis, an event called nondisjunction can occur where chromosomes aren't split evenly among new cells. Normally, the egg cell is supposed to contain one of everything; 1 of each of the 22 chromosomes + the X chromosome = 23. Same for the sperm except it can be an X or Y chromosome = 23</p>
<p>Egg + sperm = 46</p>
<p>In nondisjunction, not every egg or sperm cell will be 23. The chromosomes will separate incorrectly. Some cells will divide and get multiple copies of a chromosome. Some might also lose some which is called nullisomy. For a pentasomy, the error will usually occur in the mother (egg cells) because she carries ONLY X chromosomes.</p>

<p>This picture shows a trisomy. A pentasomy would result in a duplication error combined with a nondisjunction (4 blue sticks + one orange stick = a pentasomic cell)</p>
<p>This doesn't feel very coherent lol but I hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
