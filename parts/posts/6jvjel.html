		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From an evolutionary perspective, it's useful to me as an individual if I can prove certain emotions with hard to fake signals. Tears, for example, are a hard to fake signal that I'm in pain and need help, as opposed to simply faking injury to be exploitive.</p>
<p>Also, from Steven Pinker's <em>How the Mind Works</em>:</p>
<p>“Facial expressions are useful only if they are hard to fake. As a matter of fact, they are hard to fake. People don’t really believe that the grinning flight attendant is happy to see them. That is because a social smile is formed with a different configuration of muscles from the genuine smile of pleasure. A social smile is executed by circuits in the cerebral cortex that are under voluntary control; a smile of pleasure is executed by circuits in the limbic system and other brain systems and is involuntary. Anger, fear, and sadness, too, recruit muscles that can’t be controlled voluntarily, and the genuine expressions are hard to fake, though we can pantomime an approximation. Actors must simulate facial expressions for a living, but many cannot avoid a mannered look. Some great actors, like Laurence Olivier, are highly coordinated athletes who have doggedly learned to control every muscle. Others learn method acting, inspired by Konstantin Stanislavsky, in which actors make themselves feel an emotion by remembering or imagining a charged experience, and the expression pops on the face reflexively.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Facial expressions are closely linked to emotions. It is thought that the purpose of facial expressions is to convey emotions within a social group. Studies have shown that the link goes both ways: being happy can make you smile and forcing yourself to smile can make you happier, which reinforces the idea that feeling emotions and exhibiting their signs are closely linked. Emotions aren't entirely involuntary, but strong emotional reactions that are triggered by an external stimulus can be hard to override. Basically, what I'm saying is that controlling the physical manifestations of your emotional responses partly involves controlling the emotions themselves, which can be much more difficult than just moving your arm around or some other voluntary muscular action.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We also CAN control it, but the psychological effect of the emotion overpowers it pretty quick. If you're laughing really hard, you CAN instantly straighten your facial expression, physically speaking - but you'll probably lose it again in three seconds. It's not that you can't control your muscles - the muscles in your face are actually much more fine-tuned than the rest of your body generally - it's just that the involuntary mental response keeps you from maintaining that control for a bit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You <em>perceive</em> to have control over more muscles than you think.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Examples that don't include the heart and digestive system: Eyes that allow direct gross movement, but which ultimately function through involuntary micro-movements (Same with every muscle we focus our perceptions on, even as a whole host of bio-mechanics escapes our active perception.  The very idea of &quot;muscle memory&quot; is entangled with the reality that we <em>don't</em> have overwhelming dominion over our muscles.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can <em>develop</em> control over all sorts of muscles, as well as their reflexive behaviors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Laughter or smiles are not mere artifacts of musculature, they are artifacts of psychological mechanisms and behavioral norms.  They are reflex actions a step beyond normal muscle reflexes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You're not asking why you can move your leg muscles but those muscles still respond to an outside stimulus administered by a doctor for a reflex test.  This is laughter and smiling.  Not muscles, reflex actions involving muscles and <em>outside</em> stimulus (even an internal point of humor involves metaphorical entanglements with elements outside the immediate muscles involved in externalizing that humor).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Societies of humans are more elegantly complicated than your question accommodates.  Human social situations are the only way your question even gets the &quot;difficulty&quot; part.  Laugh by yourself and the difficulty will just come down to breathing regulation.</p>
</li>
<li>Some people get tumors and have <em>difficulty</em> suppressing a reflex of trying to fuck children, despite never having that reflex to fuck children before.  If you're looking for real difficult mysteries, go for that.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has nothing to do with muscles.  It has to do with the layers of control over those muscles.  For example, you can hold your breath.  That is a high level control.  However, there is a lower level control that, when it senses high carbon dioxide/low oxygen in the lungs, ignores the high level command to hold your breath and forces the breathing to restart.  </p>
<p>We also have an area of the brain that coordinates multiple functions almost as &quot;canned&quot; functions.  For example, sneezing is a complex coordination of breathing, eye motion, mouth motion, head and neck motion designed to clear the nasal passageway of an obstruction.  Sneezing is not a reflex, but a brain-controlled sequence.  Once started, it cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>The area of our brain that controls smiling or laughter gets signals from our voluntary system, and it also gets signals from our emotional system, and the emotional system gets priority.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
