		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When Hubble discovered conclusively that the Universe was expanding, developing the first estimate of the Hubble Constant, Einstein abandoned the Static-Universe-Causing Constant introduced into his equations.</p>
<p>Why did he not just change the value of it to account for the expansion, and therefore predict what we now call Dark Energy?</p>
<p>Was this because the universe was thought to be expanding at a constant rate, as opposed to the now suspected Accelerating rate; a solution to which his equations could provide (sans Lambda) ?</p>
<p>In Hubble's original model he determined that further galaxies were moving away faster (and therefore accelerating) - is this value is the Hubble Constant? </p>
<p>Am I correct in thinking that an accelerating expansion means a constantly changing Hubble Constant? </p>
<p>Last question: What caused/causes the farther galaxies to move away faster - why are they not moving away at a static rate (before we realized the accelerating expansion)? </p></div></div>

<p>No, and what /u/hikaruzero wrote is wrong. A perfect exponential expansion (dark energy and nothing else) corresponds to a <em>constant</em> Hubble constant. &quot;exponential&quot; and &quot;constant&quot; are referencing different things here: &quot;Exponential&quot; looks at a given object and how the distance to it increases (exponentially). The Hubble constant looks at at given distance and looks how the apparent recession speed is there (constant).</p>
<p>We have matter in our universe so the expansion is not completely exponential and the Hubble constant is still changing a bit, but not much any more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Space is expanding everywhere. Essentially new space is being created, pulling everything that isn't gravitationally bound to each other apart. Imagine baking bread with walnuts - as the bread rises, as essentially more volume of bread is being created, all the walnuts are pushed away from each other.</p>
<p>So, then, the more far apart two things are, the more space is being created between them, which leads them to accelerate away from each other at a faster rate than nearer objects would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
