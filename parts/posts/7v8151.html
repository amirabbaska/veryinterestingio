		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All materials emit light all the time.  The frequency of the emitted light changes with temperature, though.</p>
<p>For example, humans are warm enough to emit infrared light.  As things get hotter, the emitted light eventually moves up past infrared into red, and on into orange, yellow, etc.</p>
<p>This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation" target="_blank">black-body radiation</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While all objects emit various wavelengths of light, narrowing it down to visible light when heating an object can be described in the following way. Imagine walking a bunch of dogs on a leashes. If I came up and gave a bunch some espresso beans they would start to dart around faster and faster and pull harder and harder on their leashes which would cause you to pull back on their leashes to bring them back closer to you (not too harsh now, dogs deserve the best of treatment). Now most likely pulling them back would cause some sort of yelp or sound from the abrupt movment.</p>
<p>The nucleus of an atom is you in this scenario, and the dogs are it's electrons. I act as the heating of the object. As heat energy is added to an object (espresso beans), it's electrons get more and more excited and full of energy. This causes them to start moving further away from their nucleus. The attraction between nucleus and electron (the leash in this case) doesn't allow the electrons to fully escape but instead they are brought back down to their original position and doing so releases a small packet of energy called a photon (the yelp) which you detect as light if the drop releases energy in a certain range your eyes can detect. Repeat this process countless times with countless atoms and the object will glow.</p>
<p>This scenario is FAR too simplistic as to how it actually works but it'll do as far as simple understanding goes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hot things glow through a process called &quot;blackbody radiation.”</p>
<p>Very hot objects, like our sun, glow brightly and put out most of their light in the visible spectrum. Shifting to cooler temperatures, like a filament in a light bulb, decreases the light and shifts it more towards a warmer orange glow. At increasingly lower temperatures, like the element in an electric heater, the peak output shifts to the red and infrared parts of the spectrum.</p>
<p>Even cold objects emit blackbody radiation, but do so entirely in infrared light. </p>
<p>———</p>
<p>As you add more thermal energy to atoms, they go into higher excites states and emit more electromagnetic radiation and from the electromagnetic radiation you see more light as it shifted from Ultraviolet to visible light spectrum. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All bodies, no matter how hot or cold, continuously radiate electromagnetic waves. For instance, we see the glow of very hot objects because they emit electromagnetic waves in the visible region of the spectrum. At relatively low temperatures, cooler objects emit visible light waves only weak and, as a result, do not appear to be glowing. Even human bodies emit light, which is why it is detected in infrared sensors. (Quoted from cutnell physics book, I was reading the chapter on particle and waves when this question appeared on reddit! What are the odds?)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
