		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, probably. But we don't know what it is, and it's likely higher than what we're currently capable of producing experimentally.</p>
<p>The IUPAC has strict criteria for what can be considered an &quot;element&quot;. One of this criteria is that it has at least one isotope with a lifetime at least on the order of 10^(-14) seconds.</p>
<p>As you go up in Z around the superheavy elements, they become very unstable to alpha decay and spontaneous fission. If you extrapolate the lifetimes to heavier species based on trends in nuclei that we know of, eventually you'll probably reach a point where no heavier species has a lifetime which meets that criterion in the definition of an element.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physicist Richard Feynman did some extrapolation on Dirac's equations and noted that as the elements get heavier, their orbiting electrons move faster. This makes sense, because as we add weight, the electrons have to add speed to prevent from flying off or being sucked in. His result was at element 137 the electrons will be moving just under the speed of light, but more careful calculations suggest 173 will be the last element. Either way, we're nowhere near synthesising these, so don't hold your breath. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mathmatically, there should be a limit because of mass, stability, etc. </p>
<p>Reality though, the probability of any other element (that we have not made already) existing for more than 1 hour after synthesis is highly unlikely. We are already reaching the limits of stability for an atom</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
