<p>Short answer:
A lot of practice.</p>
<p>Long answer:
To solve a Rubik's Cube you break up the problem into steps.  One way you might do that is like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Solve a layer</li>
<li>Solve the middle layer</li>
<li>Solve the final layer</li>
</ol>
<p>You then break these problems into steps. For example to solve the final layer you need to twist (orient) the pieces, and move (permute) the pieces. So step 3 really has 2 steps involved.</p>
<p>To complete each step you need to learn or memorize algorithms which are sequences of moves that do a specific things to the cube while not affecting other parts of the cube.</p>
<p>To solve a Rubik's Cube you only need to learn a handful of these algorithms.  For example to do the final step of moving (permuting) the pieces of the last layer you only need to learn 2 algorithms.  You then apply these algorithms as needed to finish the layer. Often you will need to repeat the algorithm multiple times until that final layer is finished.</p>
<p>A speed cuber will do it differently they will know that the final step has 21 different cases and they will learn a different algorithm for each case.  Sometimes even multiple algorithms for each case depending on how the layer is oriented.  That way when they get to the finally step they only need to recognize the case and then execute the algorithm. </p>
<p>Besides memorizing 100+ algorithms, speed cubers will do other things to improve their time:</p>
<ol>
<li>They will try to reduce the amount of times they rotate the cube</li>
<li>While they are moving the cube or executing a memorized algorithm, they will look ahead for the next thing they are planning on doing. (Similar to sight-reading music)</li>
<li>They will learn efficient ways of performing algorithms using &quot;finger tricks&quot;</li>
<li>During inspection time (15 seconds before solving the cube) they will try to plan their entire first step of solving and maybe even part of their second step</li>
<li>They will buy nice speedcubes that turn far better than a normal Rubik's Cube</li>
<li>They will practice and practice and practice</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a 'solve' the person examines the cubes and decides on one or more steps to advance the cube towards completion (they <em>may</em> plan the complete solve but are more likely to complete their choice while solving the first steps).</p>
<p>I'm not certain of the official rules but I believe this examination phase is up to 15 seconds.</p>
<p>The steps used are called algorithms which are a sequence turns of one face after another to achieve a goal - such as moving two or more related pieces together without moving the overall state of cube further from completion. Including differing rotations and reflections of each algorithm and their selection conditions and desired outcomes there are 100's of algorithms to select from and the person solving must very quickly choose the best combination to complete the current state of the cube.</p>
<p>Solve-time is a combination of the number of algorithm used, the number of turns in the algorithms, the rate at which the person can execute the turns in the algorithm and any decision time lost between execution of each algorithm. Improving all of these requires dedication to learn all of the algorithms, recognise which to use quickly and apply them quickly.</p>
<p>Knowing only a dozen algorithms (including reflections) I can solve it in about 45 seconds - I am very jealous of those consistently under 30, those under 15 make me believe in aliens...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey there, there is a lot of misinformation in all the comments before me, so as an avid (albeit closet) Rubik's Cube fan, I thought I might share some of my knowledge.</p>
<p>To answer your question, it's first necessary to break down how single solves are executed in timed competition.</p>
<p>1) First, a random computer generated scramble is applied to the cube. </p>
<p>2) Then the cube is covered and then revealed to the person solving for a maximum of 15 seconds to inspect the cube. During this phase you look for your first 4 edge pieces to line up on the first layer.</p>
<p>3) After inspection is done, the cube is placed down and the solvers hands are put on a StackMat so that the timer starts once the solver lifts their hands from it to start.</p>
<p>4) The solve is executed.</p>
<p>The way these sub 10 second times are usually performed are using tuition to solve the first 2 layers of the Rubik's cube in order, (thus limiting the possible configurations of the last layer), orienting the last layer so that the correct color is showing on top, and finally permuting the last layer, or placing all the cubes in the final layer in their proper places.</p>
<p>This is called the Fridrich Method and is very simple to learn but hard to master. Fast Rubik's Cubers will not only execute very fast, but already see the next algorithm that they need to perform to solve the last layer. Sometimes they get lucky and the permute algorithm can be skipped because the orient algorithm will do it accidentally.</p>
<p>Sorry this is kinda confusing, it's a lot simpler to understand with a cube in front of you.</p>
<p>For a more in depth look into it take a look at:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost everyone you see on YouTube/in real life has learned off of YouTube tutorials. I suggest badmephisto's. After watching these tutorials, you should be able to solve the cube in &lt;15 minutes within a few days. Then you just practice. With just the beginner's method, you can get to 30 seconds (maybe a bit faster if you really practiced).</p>
<p>If you want to solve the cube in under 10 seconds, you'll have to learn a lot more algorithms. Almost all cubers who are under 20 seconds know at least 78 algorithms (21 PLLs and 57 OLLs), which sounds intimidating, but a lot of them are very similar and also very simple and short. Don't fret; there's still lots of cubers who are fast (even sub 10) who don't know all of these algorithms. The most important &quot;upgrade&quot; from beginner's method is learning F2L - the best tutorial I have found is called &quot;RiDo's hunting story.&quot; You should understand most of F2L after watching his two videos.</p>
<p>The rest is just practice. Lots of it. It probably took me 2 years to become sub-10 after first learning how to solve the cube, but with more practice, you can do it much faster. I'm not exactly sure what the fastest time it took for someone to get sub-10 was, but I'd say a few have done it under a year (pls don't quote me on this). I know a few people have gotten sub-20 in just 2 months though.</p>
<p>If you're wondering how people actually solve the cube, then the process is pretty simple. The videos explain it with much more detail and clarity, but the basic process is to solve the cube layer-by-layer, since the cube is just made up of three 3x3x1 blocks. You solve the 4 edges of the first layer, then the first layer's corners and second layer's edges simultaneously (this is called F2L), and then use one algorithm to orient the top layer, and one more algorithm to permute it.</p>
<p>Hope this helps! The key is patience, and lots of practice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>We solve the first two layers by intuition, and then orient and permute the last layer by recognizing the patterns and performing memorized algorithms.</p>
<p>This method is called CFOP (<strong>C</strong>ross, <strong>F</strong>2L (first two layers), <strong>O</strong>LL (orientation of last layer), <strong>P</strong>LL (permutation of last layers)).</p>
<p>There are other methods too, but to the largest degree, CFOP is the most widely used among speedcubers.</p>
