The lowest confirmed air temperature on the ground was -129F (-89C). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_temperature_recorded_on_Earth" target="_blank">Wiki link to sources</a>.</p>
<p>So it seems that it's already possible for air temperatures to fall below the freezing point of carbon dioxide, so in these cases, would atmospheric CO2 have been freezing and snowing down at these times?</p>
<p>Thanks for any input!</p></div></div>

<p>Hypothetically yes, a container of CO2 would freeze in those conditions, in a practical sense though, CO2 only makes up 0.04% of the atmosphere, and, unlike water nucleating into raindrops, won't gather into single places, so you wouldn't actually get dry ice snow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's cold enough, but there is very little CO2 in the atmosphere. You can't look at the sublimination point at 1 atm because the partial pressure of CO2 is much lower. The low partial pressure of carbon dioxide would cause it to subliminate in this environment--some molecules are freezing out, but at the same time others are sublimating and there is no accumulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really. This has nothing to do with freezing point and everything to do with saturation: air can contain humidity even if the air temperature is below freezing. At some temperature carbon dioxide <em>will</em> precipitate out of the site as dry ice &quot;snow&quot;, but that temperature is very low because there is very little CO2 in the air, about 0.04%.    </p>
<p>Compare that to water, which typically make up about 1% of the air and has a much higher freezing point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere on Earth is not in a high enough concentration to cause CO2 snowfall. </li>
<li>At the locations in Antarctica that experience these temperatures the air is extremely dry and there would be little H2O to cause normal snowfall. Some, but these temperatures occur in a desert.</li>
