		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Civil engineer here. Two things I've learned about concrete: It gets hard, and it cracks</p>
<p>As others have said, concrete cracks due to shrinkage after placement and in response to fluctuations in ambient temperature throughout is design life (thermal expansion and contraction). The first cracks typically show up within 24 hours of placement as free water is lost to the hydration process (how concrete gains strength).</p>
<p>Joints are an effort to tell the concrete where to crack by creating a plane of weakness. Depending on the joint type you may have additional reinforcement or smooth steel rods to allow the panels to expand and contract.</p>
<p>Meanwhile asphalt has more elasticity meaning it has a greater ability to deform under load (i.e. thermal expansion/contraction) and return to its original size and shape more or less. Its ability to do this decreases as the pavement ages. </p>
<p>Asphalt tends to be less durable than properly placed concrete and has a greater susceptibility to fatigue stress. Rutting in asphalt at stop lights or in parking stalls are examples fatigue distress due to repeated loading/unloading.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Concrete has great compressive strength (ability to be pushed down), but poor tensile strength (ability to be stretched out). As temperatures rise and fall, it expands and contracts, and eventually one large slab of concrete will stretch itself until it cracks and breaks into smaller pieces.</p>
<p>By cutting in expansion joints, you are essentially telling the concrete where to break. If done correctly, the concrete will crack beneath the expansion joint, where you cannot see it. This also causes less stress on the slab as it expands and contracts.</p>
<p>Well made concrete slabs can easily stand for upwards of 40 years, requiring very little maintenance, whereas asphalt needs to be replaced (or at the very least maintained) far more often.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concrete is a harder material. It behaves different to asphalt when the surrounding temperature changes.</p>
<p>You literally <em>need</em> to have seams here and there because if you don't the natural, temperature induced expansion will make the tiles expand towards each other. And eventually crack, because there is no room for more expansion.</p>
<p>Then, of course, the concrete slabs can be manufactured in a factory and transported to the construction site.</p>
<p>It's just like when you build a path in your garden. You buy concrete tiles and place them in a nice fashion all the way to your front door. Exactly the same principle with a road, except the tiles are huge in comparison.</p>
<p>But, seriously though. Concrete roads tend to be built with fully automated machinery that pour concrete into a mobile molding form that is in slow constant motion all the time. Even then, it's important to &quot;break&quot; the tiles now and then so that the road won't immediately crack itself the first year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Concrete is a rigid pavement. As the ground below the pavement expands and contracts it will move whatever is on top of it. In the case of concrete, you need to put expansion joints in it or it will break apart.</p>
<p>Asphalt is a flexible pavement and will move with the pavement below. If the underlying base is moving a lot you can see cracks in the asphalt but due to the materials flexibility they can self heal.</p>
<p>Hot mix asphalt is dirt cheap ( 2c/lb) and if the road design has been done correctly should last 20 years </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
