<p>great question buddy! I've come across this question before and I'd like to share <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-clouds-always-appe/" target="_blank">this</a> link. Hope you found your answer! </p>
<p>here's a copy paste of the information from the source:</p>
<p><em>A good analogy for cloud formation is the development of bubbles of steam on the bottom of a kettle. Some spots are slightly hotter than others; it is at these locations that the water is turned to vapor. When a bubble gets large enough, the water's surface tension can no longer hold it, and so it rises. Fluids having different densities behave quite independently. The bubble stays a bubble all the way to the top where it breaks free as steam</em></p>
<p><em>So, too, with clouds. A spot on the earth's surface gets hotter than the surrounding area. An example would be the black, flat tarred roof of a large building or a vacant parking lot. The air above it heats up and forms a bubble of hot air, which is less dense than the surrounding air. When the surface tension can no longer hold it, the bubble breaks free and rises. This is why soaring birds such as hawks and eagles are always circling--they sense an updraft and keep turning to stay inside the bubble of rising air. The hot air ascends until it reaches an altitude where the temperature is cool enough to condense the water vapor contained in the air bubble into visible droplets. The visible droplets become a cloud, and that altitude (temperature) at which it forms is called the condensation level</em></p>
<p><em>There can be some mixing of clouds on windy days, but in general the air mass at the cloud level is moving quite steadily. And again, fluids of slightly different densities do not mix well. This tendency not to mix accounts for one of the most familiar types of weather systems. When a cold front (a mass of cool, dense air) bumps into a warm air mass, it runs underneath the warm air mass and pushes all the warm air up. When that warm air reaches the condensation level, you get a solid cloud mass and rainy weather</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
