You don't see this same for normal sports. Why is that? How people are not getting bored of normal sports even nothing would be changed?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sports, in general, are immediately impressive. You don’t need any context to be amazed by speed, dexterity, explosiveness, size...the list goes on. You know you can’t do what you see these athletes do.</p>
<p>Esports require insane context. Most people have no idea if what they are watching is hard (and the skill and dedication it takes) or not until they’ve experienced it directly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Video games exist in a consumer bubble.</p>
<p>Sports don't. Sports don't change. Sports don't get re written, or replaced. You can't change physics. And to get good at a sport athletes spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and for some sports their entire lifetime getting good at it. </p>
<p>Then take a new game. It's going to be replaced by another new engine with better graphics that takes what that game did, but does it better.</p>
<p>People want esports to be taken seriously like real sports. It's competitive and entertaining. But something new comes along all the time. Even the most popular, intensive game like dota, hasn't existed a fraction of the time of a lot of the popular sports. So it can't have the same trans generational appeal.</p>
<p>Sports largely exist as entertainment. That's why they have monetary value (advertisement potential). But they exist in our society for complex reasons like mastery, didactis and some believe a replacement for war. Esports will always struggle to be in the same area because they can't natually/quickly appeal to society outside those who play the game. There isn't a physical component to it either. Your grandfather can't sit there and watch you play and be impressed the very first time he see's it. But he can watch someone basically defy physics on the tv and be impressed the very first time. He can make sense of what he's watching. And again, 10 years from now that game will be replaced; there never will be a catch up period.</p>
<p>Edit: so this is what it's like to be one of the first commentators on a thread. Cool. Hi mom</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons:</p>
<p>1) The sports that have large audiences have evolved and been refined for decades and even centuries: basketball, football, baseball, racing, etc.</p>
<p>Late 1800s baseball looks nothing like baseball today. </p>
<p>There are very few sports which have become popular within the last 20 years, perhaps MMA is the one that comes to mind. Though you can argue that even MMA has existed for many decades and was refined somewhat before it became further refined by the UFC.</p>
<p>So changing and evolving to find a format that works and attracts audiences is something that sports have had to do, just like esports are doing.</p>
<p>Also, I think many video games were not designed with large audiences in mind. I love to play Civ or WoW, but I don't want to watch other people play them for hours on end. Some people do, but they're not designed with audiences in mind, they're designed with a single player playing or multiple people playing together. They are not spectator activities, they're participatory.</p>
<p>In the physical world, hiking is a great participatory activity, but it doesn't make for much of a spectator activity.</p>
<p>2) There are many more sports which do not attract large audiences than those that do.</p>
<p>In the United States (where I live, it varies by country), very few people tune in to watch curling, kayaking, horseshoes, badminton, dodgeball, volleyball, polo, water polo, archery, sailing, weightlifting, lacrosse, rugby, ultimate, or skiing. Some of those sports have professional leagues here, but attendance and pay are minimal. Some of them get watched every 4 years during the Olympics but that's it.</p>
<p>Now think about games. Hardly anyone watches chess, backgammon, bowling, darts, go, scrabble, or crossword puzzle competitions on TV.</p>
<p>The number of sports and games that are watched by large audiences is far smaller than the number of sports and games that are not watched much at all.</p>
<p>I think that esports will be popular if the game is designed from the beginning with spectators in mind. Hardly anyone watches chess on TV these days, but millions watch Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune. In order to be popular, something has to be designed for spectators.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One issue is that in sports, the player and the game are one. For example, you might say that an Overwatch player is a great Tracer, but he and other DPS players on other teams only play Tracer so much because the character is overpowered. And as a result, Blizzard nerfs Tracer or buffs her counter or whatever. In physical sports, there are just skilled players, there's no question of an issue with the game itself like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe there's something to be said for games that can't be subject to change. Instances that comes to mind are the competitive Super Smash Bros. Melee scene and the speedrunning community. </p>
<p>Competitive Melee has grown in popularity over the years despite being a 17 year old game with zero updates from Nintendo. I don't know too much about speedrunning but many of the interesting runs to watch are of games that are no longer actively patched/updated. </p>
<p>I'd like to think that the competitive scene truly flourishes after having been established and people are trying to perfect their mastery of the game rather than perfecting the game itself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
