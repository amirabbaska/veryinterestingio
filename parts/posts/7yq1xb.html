		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The last time I looked into humans and phermones the most recent findings were that humans do have the genes for phermone receptors (like other animals) but that these genes are not expressed in humans. </p>
<p>Perhaps there is a link between our lack of phermone detection and tge permanent breasts and hidden ovulation of human females. Since they both are linked to not only being &quot;attracted&quot; to people when they are able to become pregnant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>An interesting example of this is trans people who take HRT. One of the earliest effects of that (within days to weeks) is that things like underarm scent change to one typical of the other sex.</p>
<p>I'm unaware of a study of this specific to trans people, but it's been studied more generally. <a href="http://time.com/84286/you-can-smell-someones-gender-says-science/" target="_blank">http://time.com/84286/you-can-smell-someones-gender-says-science/</a> gives one starting point for finding relevant studies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
