I've heard a lot through school about how alcohol stunts development in young people. To what degree is this true, especially in the young adult age group where people are mostly done developing physically. </p>
<p>How much do different levels of drinking harm different age groups? (A few drinks every weekend vs once a month vs heavy regular binge drinking). I feel like there are a lot of biased answers on this topic so I'd love to see your sources!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heavy drinking during those ages seems to have a serious deleterious effect on some very important brain regions:</p>
<p><em>The frontal lobe is associated with higher-order executive functioning, emotional regulation, integration of novel stimuli, and cognitive flexibility. In adults, heavy alcohol use is associated with smaller prefrontal regions (Pfefferbaum et al., 1997). Initial findings in adolescent populations have found that the prefrontal cortex may be more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol than other brain regions, because this area of the brain continues to develop throughout adolescence and young adulthood. Significantly smaller gray- and white-matter volume has been reported in the prefrontal cortex in adolescents with comorbid alcohol use and psychiatric disorders when compared with demographically matched controls (De Bellis et al., 2005). These findings were replicated in a study examining adolescents who did not meet criteria for comorbid mood or attention disorders (Medina et al., 2008).</em></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thomas Vander Van  wrote a book on college drinking culture called getting wasted. Most binge drinking subsides by the end of college. Somewhere around 95% of people stop binge drinking. I doubt a few years of it have long lasting effects after a few years. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
