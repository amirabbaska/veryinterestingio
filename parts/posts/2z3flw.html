		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally people do not stay in comas for years and just randomly wake up. And the few that do wake up with fairly deteriorated mental capabilities and usually do not make full recoveries.</p>
<p>People that suddenly wake up from a coma after several years and with a relatively intact mental state are pretty much medical marvels, and it's usually because of very light and precise brain damage. Precise enough that very little could cause complete unconsciousness, but small enough that there is a decent chance that the brain could gradually recover.</p>
<p>In this case, recovery is facilitated by the brain reforming the crucial broken connection. The parts of the brain that facilitate being the &quot;on-switch&quot;/&quot;power supply&quot; reside in the brain stem (there are other parts that are crucial to conciousness/&quot;you&quot; but damage to them is usually irreversible due to the fact that they developed individually as you grew up and not according to a &quot;genetic map&quot;); these parts serve to keep your brain in the awake state (aka &quot;aroused&quot;).</p>
<p>Damage to them usually causes an immediate coma, even though all the higher parts that store your personality and memories are intact. It's like a fuse being burned out in your house; your electronics are fine, but they won't turn on until it's fixed.</p>
<p>Often brain damage can be permanent, though in less critical areas the brain is more flexible and apt to work around the broken area, which is often filled with scar tissue. Also, the brain has a lot of redundancy, small children for example are capable of losing half of their brain (a surgical procedure known as a hemispherectomy) with minimal permanent damage owing to how adaptable their brains are. Adults can lose small chunks without being permanently damaged depending on the region.</p>
<p>Anyways, so in the case of a brainstem injury, often it's less recoverably given that you only have one brainstem (unlike the higher brain's two hemispheres), which has less redundancy. However, the body may be able to gradually break down the scar tissue (or scar tissue never forms for some reason), allowing for the damaged neural connections to reform.</p>
<p>The brain recovers from damage through two important mechanisms:</p>
<p>A) A group of chemicals called neurotrophic factors. In the presence of these, neurons are encouraged to grow and multiply. Note that the reason that you don't have tons of these seemingly good chemicals floating around your brain all the time is that small groups of neurons dying or breaking off connections with certain other neurons is a normal part of brain function. It's like pruning a shrub, it keeps things tidy.</p>
<p>B) A chemical called &quot;netrin&quot; that essentially guides &quot;axons&quot; aka &quot;connections&quot; between neurons. This would help the neurons &quot;know&quot; where to grow towards across a gap, as gradients of this would build up in the empty space.</p>
<p><strong>Finally,</strong> the brain may reach a level of connectedness that signalling can begin to occur again in the area, and so the area begins to recover. A person waking up in this manner would not suddenly sit bolt upright; they would experience an a gradual buildup to consciousness, growing increasingly responsive over a period of weeks or months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Coma&quot; is really just a term that describes a prolonged state of unconsciousness. It does not say anything about why a patient is unconscious. So the ability for recovery from a coma really depends on the cause of the coma. Some of these causes are reversible and others are not.  For example if a patient suffered a massive stroke causing permanent brain damage then the likelihood for any kind of a meaningful recovery is unlikely.  If the patient has an overwhelming infection the infection itself and the physiologic consequences can also cause an acute delirium and sometimes result in a coma.  These patients may very well recover once the infection is treated adequately.  To make things more complicated the ability for recovery will also depend on any comorbid conditions. A young healthy 18 year old patient will have a much higher chance of recovery than a 70 year old with multiple medical problems.</p>
<p>Edit: One more thing.  What op mentions in his question about being in a coma for years and randomly waking up <del>does not really happen in real life</del> very rarely happens in real life.  Patients that are in a coma due to reversible causes will generally have some form of recovery within the first few weeks.  If there is no improvement over the course of months, any form of meaningful recovery is unlikely and they may be deemed to be in &quot;persistent vegetative state&quot; or brain dead.</p>
<p>Edit2: People are citing lots of cases where patients in a coma wake up and remember things that occurred while they were thought to be unconscious. They are also citing cases of patients waking up after years. I obviously cannot speak to these cases specifically because i do not know the details of them. What i will say is that obviously the human body and in particular the brain are incredibly complex. I do not claim to know everything about it. There will always be cases that do not seem to follow the &quot;rules&quot; but for every miracle patient that wakes up there are thousands that do not. I hope with more research we can understand more about the various states of consciousness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But as a person who has been in a coma - I can tell you it's not like being asleep.   You are not fucking asleep.    I literally lost days of my life with no memory.   No dreams.   No glimpses of what was happening.   I was fucking out.  Gone.   I really don't think I was even in there.   I had a medical emergency in childbirth that got way out of hand (called AFE).    I remember thinking I was dying for sure.  The whole thing.   Out of body.  Looking down on the room.   Feeling the peace come.   All the noise goes away.   It's calming and made me feel better. ....    Then 6 days later I open my eyes and realize I'm laying on my chest.    There is a nurse tapping my shoulder telling me they're going to slide me for chest xrays.   I try to talk but realize there is a huge tube in my throat.
So I just pretend like it's all cool because they're being cool about it.<br />
I thought it was the same day.    Then I look at the little ICU board of info in my room and realize that the date looks wrong.    It's basically a week later.<br />
Trust me.   Time is frozen when you're in a coma.   Your spirit is not in there.    It's just your body laying there trying to fix itself.  And even though you might 'wake up' you are not the same.  Not even close.  My brain and the way I think and feel about things could not be more different than before this happened.  People can obviously be out for months on end.   It only took a week to fuck up my life and change me forever.  Those were the first days of my daughter's life and I will never get them back.   So I took it pretty hard.   </p>
<p>If you can do anything for someone who is in long term care -  please just keep track of the days they miss.   Write down just a few lines about each day so they have it when they come back.   It will be instrumental in their recovery - I promise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're playing Dwarf Fortress. Your fortress is big, complex, and detailed levels stretch from surface to the underground caves. Suddenly there's a cave in that collapses a wide area of tunnels three quarters of the way down your whole fortress. This is a gigantic mess. The majority of your dwarves will be tasked clearing rubble, digging new tunnels, redigging old tunnels, basically repairing the whole fortress. It takes too many dwarves to spare any for trading or diplomacy or military, so you close up the fortress while the long repairs are underway.  </p>
<p>Normally this would spell death as the fortress is not farming or hunting food for itself, but other fortresses in the area donate foodstuffs while the long repairs are underway. They don't know the progress of the repairs, but they're hedging that your dwarves can get it done.  If they do, if they manage to get things <em>just</em> to the point where the fortress can operate again, the gates will open and the dwarves will pour out to get things running again.</p>
<p>Sometimes they can't. The chasms are too big, the remaining stone too weak to build with. This fortress is never going to be up and running again. It's dwarves will live only as long as the food supplies last. But we can not know that, we can only judge by what we can see from the outside.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ITT: I'm not a doctor, but...</p>
<p>But on topic: I am, actually a doctor and I cannot answer this question. I do believe, though, that cases of patients being in a coma for several years and then suddenly awaking are extremely sparse, and more likely TV-tropes than actual clinical phenomenae. </p>
<p>A coma can be artificially induced using anesthetics during recovery from, say, trauma. These patients usually wake up and can recover quite well if there was no traumatic brain injury in the first place.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people in a prolonged coma (= low state of consciousness) following brain damage caused by trauma, stroke or hypoxia have a dismal chance of recovery. If the do recover, they almost always have severe brain damage and need months to years of rehabilitation to function at all. They usually don't just &quot;wake up&quot; from the coma, either - rather they make small gradual steps toward consciousness.</p>
<p>That being said, googling around can give you cases of people who have fallen into comas and then woken up. But I can't explain them, I have never witnessed such a case in the hospital where I work and know no colleagues who have worked with such cases, either. But that doesn't mean it never happens, I guess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
