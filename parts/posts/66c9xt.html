		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modernism and Post-Modernism are extremely broad terms that describe mass cultural movements in Western art and philosophy. To understand them, one must also understand the general evolution of Western philosophy, especially the concepts of Rationalism and Romanticism.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<p><strong>Modernism is an extension of Romanticism (which was a revolt against Rationalism)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Post-Modernism is a critique of Modernism.</strong></p>
<p>I don't know much about Post-Post-Modernism (what a name) as I believe it is still in its infancy.</p>
<p>In long form:</p>
<p>I'll try to start with Rationalism. Rationalism developed through the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, and encouraged the use of empirical observation and reason to determine the truth of the universe. A quintessential example of Rationalist thought is Descartes and his famous conclusion, &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;. To keep it brief, Descartes theorized that human beings may not necessarily be able to trust their own senses - you may see, hear, or touch an object, but how can you trust that what you see is the truth rather than a very elaborate illusion. He therefore uses deductive reasoning to determine the first thing that can objectively be determined as real - because you think, you therefore <em>must</em> exist as a real, and not illusory, entity. Descartes is thus using deductive reasoning to determine what is objectively real.</p>
<p>Romanticism was a reaction to the changing society of 19th-century Europe - industrial and scientific developments were quickly rendering ancient institutions and social orders obsolete. It was thus a reaction against the values of Rationalism that had been quite important in developing the modern scientific method and driving that progress forward.</p>
<p>Romanticism was also far more of an art movement than a true philosophical movement. It evoked imagery of a romantic past, and emphasized the use of meta-narratives to justify an argument. It focuses more on the intangible than the tangible. For example, a common theme of the Romantic movement was that scientific progress disrupts the natural order and is thus dangerous and volatile - Mary Shelley's <em>Frankenstein</em> is one of the most famous works of the Romantic movement, and concerns this theme.</p>
<p>It is from Romanticism that many intangible modern political concepts spring. Manifest Destiny, Ethnic Nationalism, Zeitgeist, &quot;Human Spirit&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>In between here, Realism developed as an art movement, a reaction to Romanticism. It emphasized realistic depictions of its subjects and sympathized more with the lower strata of society and new developments rather than the upper strata and an idealized past.</p>
<p>Modernism was an evolution of Romanticism. Modernism utilized meta-narratives, but also encouraged the criticism of everything, including the old order. It rejected Realism. Where Romanticism was more concerned with the dangers of human progress and a return to an idealized past, Modernism was more concerned with finding out where wayward progress went wrong and finding out what is &quot;holding back&quot; true progress. As Modernism developed as an art movement, it encouraged the use of more abstract forms of creative expression - hence the stereotype of &quot;modern art&quot; being incomprehensible.</p>
<p>World War I was a huge influence on the rising Modernist movement. The horror and destruction of that war showed how dangerous and destructive modern industrial warfare could be. But World War I also represented a huge shake-up of the European political order - old monarchial empires were toppled in favor of democratic republics or communist states. And so as a political movement, Modernism examined the meta-narratives surrounding Western society - what holds back social progress, and how can that change.</p>
<p>It is from this that we see the rise of social movements against perceived oppression: progressivism, socialism, feminism, civil rights, popular sovereignty. These are all movements centered around a meta-narrative of one group being oppressed in some way by another - laborers by capitalists, women by men, minorities by a majority, ethnic groups by other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Post-Modernism developed as a result of the trauma of World War II. It is primarily a critique of Modernism. A central part of Post-Modernism is the inherent unreliability of human judgment - humans are not inherently rational creatures, and will commit irrational and self-defeating actions if they <em>believe</em> those actions will be beneficial. Post-Modernism thus emphasizes the inherent unreliability of those Modernist meta-narratives - these meta-narratives are formulated by humans, and are thus an unreliable source. A pretty good example of how this relates to WWII, and the inherent unreliability of meta-narratives, is the Nazis themselves - the Nazi ideology heavily relied upon the use of extreme (and false) nationalist and racist meta-narratives to justify itself.</p>
<p>Thus, in both Post-Modernist philosophy and art you will see a heavy emphasis on criticism of institutions and their foundations. Overcoming oppression on the surface-level is not enough - we must examine and change the factors and flaws deep within our culture and society in order to progress as a species. Thus you get emphasis on concepts such as moral relativism in Post-Modernism than in Modernism.</p>
<p>I'm more familiar with the artistic side of Post-Modernism, and can give several examples of Post-Modern art. One of the most famous is <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/MagrittePipe.jpg" target="_blank">&quot;The Treachery of Images&quot;</a>. It is a painting of a pipe, with the caption reading &quot;This is not a pipe&quot;. The image is not lying - it's not a pipe, it's the painting of a pipe. But when you look at it and are asked what it is, you wouldn't say &quot;That's a painting of pipe&quot; you would likely say &quot;That's a pipe&quot;. I hope this isn't too abstract. Essentially, the image encourages the observer to question their assumptions about what they are seeing.</p>
<p>Post-Modern film and television tend to examine and critique the tropes and norms of their genre or medium (as a Post-Modern social movement would critique the norms and values of their culture). For example, a big part of <em>Scream</em>'s appeal and popularity was its willingness to extensively explore and make fun of the conventions of the slasher genre, which had been run into the ground by the mid-1990s. <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> examines the conventions and cliches of the horror and high school drama genres, and is positively soaked in existentialist philosophy.</p>
<p>And in literature, a good example of a Post-Modern book series is <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, which brutally deconstructs the conventions of the high fantasy genre. And <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" target="_blank">Deconstruction</a> is a key weapon in the arsenal of the Post-Modern artist or activist - examine a convention or norm, explore its unfiltered effects and origins, and try to make it different.</p>
<p>As for Post-Post-Modernism, again I am unfamiliar, but because it is a reaction to Post-Modernism I assume it has to do with rejecting the relativist and deconstructionist beliefs of the Post-Modernists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did a module on contemporary American fiction last term at university -- I study English literature -- so I'll add my two cents on how postpostmodernism was presented there.</p>
<p>Essentially, it's what you'd expect; how do the generation of writers born after the postmodern epoch of the 80s/90s deal with that intellectual shadow hanging over them?</p>
<p>The two writers we associated most strongly with the term were David Foster Wallace and Jennifer Egan. You can make relatively decent arguments for them both actually being just postmodern, but hey, it's the humanities: you can argue a lot of things.</p>
<p>In brief, their takeaway from postmodernism was one of overbearing cynicism. True knowledge is impossible. Capitalism is destructive and capricious. There was a shift from ontology to epistemology, usually in the vein of &quot;you can't ever really know anything, har har!&quot;. Mass-media was thought to be profoundly affecting society, usually in a bad way. We lived in a hyperreal late-capitalist wasteland of cultural emptiness, copies without originals, etc. etc.</p>
<p>The postpostmodernists, essentially, got tired of this cynicism and decided to have a go at fighting back. David Foster Wallace is linked with the term 'sincerity' for this reason, and a lot of his works deal with themes of how to break down the endless barriers of irony, cynicism, facades, mind-games and double-guesses of academia and postmodern discourse to arrive at actual sincerity. Egan goes at it from a different tack, essentially (I'm summarising in very broad strokes) saying that if we're strictly historical, if we very carefully map out how our culture got to where it is now, we might be able to understand things -- and change them.</p>
<p>Everything I've said here is up for debate. That said, no-one else has yet offered much on postpostmodernism, so I hope you find this useful. I welcome any questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modernism is more or less the first major cultural era to happen after industrialism really settled in. So you see a lot of cutting edge/boundary pushing stuff. Sort of a &quot;We live in the future now, let's damn well act like it!&quot; Pop art, nuclear technology, goofy Free Jazz, the transistor, etc.</p>
<p>Postmodernism (at least to me) is the backlash to modernism and is super snarky, pretentious, socially aware, and critical in comparison. Sort of a &quot;Your future sucks and needs to be better.&quot; You see a lot of weird -isms pop up here.</p>
<p>Postpostmodernism is a more gentle backlash to the previous backlash and is sort of a &quot;Christ, that was exhausting. Let's just try to get our shit together and get on with it.&quot; I like to think of it as that moment while you're still hungover from the night before and you're super motivated to be a better person with better goals.</p>
<p>In food terms: Modernism is a TV dinner (Salisbury steak), Postmodernism is sushi (while it was still &quot;new&quot; in America) with a bunch of zig-zagged sauce all over, Postpostmodernism is a Chipotle burrito after they stopped using unethically raised chickens and also you got it delivered using an app on your phone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
