		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water effectively acts as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticizer" target="_blank">platicizer</a> for wood and materials derived from wood. In other words, it increases the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticity_(physics\)" target="_blank">plasticity</a> of the wood, or the property to deform (e.g. bend) in a non-reversible way. The way water does this is that water molecules get in between the strands of cellulose polymer and the lignin matrix making up the wood. Normally these polymers are held together by strong hydrogen bonds so they can't easily slip past each other. However, the water helps to break these bonds, instead creating new ones with itself. As a result, the material becomes much more flexible. On top of that, if you raise the temperature you can increase the flexibility yet further. As an aside, this is exactly the same reason why you add water to clothing when ironing it. It's much easier to reshape the fabric when wet then when it is dry. Once the fabric cools down and dries this new shape is then locked in.</p>

Have you ever gotten out of the shower and laid down on a pillow only to find your hair &quot;set&quot; in its position when you got up? The same premise works with a perm, but you are actually effecting permanent bonds instead of these non covalent bonds. Pretty cool stuff!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These guys (at the link below) really went outside the box to bend wood. The process (as I understand it from the explanation I got) is to supersaturate the material and then compress it perpendicular to the grain (as though attempting to shorten the board) with extreme pressure while at the same time providing containment of the piece to prevent splitting. The result is basically like a wet noodle. You can literally tie it into a knot. Once it has been dried it maintains the shape similar to other wood bending techniques. The guy who told me about this had developed the technique and said it effectively turns the cells into something like an accordion. </p>

<p>As the fiber in wood absorb water they swell, becoming softer and separating from one another.  This makes it easier for them to slide past one another when the whole piece is flexed.</p>
<p>Not really a rule of thumb, though.  Different kinds of lumber do different things.  Steam and heat will accomplish the same thing as water in less time and often with less damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
