		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello /r/askscience </p>
<p>I had a really long night trying to understand any explaination, but I couldn't jump to any conclusion.</p>
<p>A common explaination to why an e.g. electron has a magnetic field when moving is the experiment with a wire with protons and electrons and an electron outside the wire.
Because of special relativity, the Coulomb's law experienced from the electrons point of view (the wire is moving, density of protons increases from their point of view), it must translate to a magnetic field from our point of view.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is: How can you explain it in a case that I've drawn here: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/D3d7r64.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/D3d7r64.jpg</a></p>
<p>The moving electron with a constant velocity is in a vacuum (PART A), there is no other charge or anything, so relative to the current point of view, with what is it interacting to produce a magnetic field? Or is there no magnetic field of the electron in Part A? If so, why does it have one in Part B?</p>
<p>//EDIT: To clarify, my question is why there is a magnetic field produced by the electron around itself. The big square (magnetic field) in the image is just to show that the electron must have one because it is deflected.</p>
<p>I hope that most of my question is correct.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even after your edit I don't understand the question. I take it that in part B you are showing an <em>external</em> magnetic field produced by some means other than the electron's own magnetic field. It sounds like you are thinking that the electron will only deflect if it has its own magnetic field, which is wrong. The deflection of the electron in an external magnetic field is due to the external magnetic field, and has nothing to do with whether the electron itself has a magnetic field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the only thing that existed were an electron, then there wouldn't be an electric or magnetic field. Without anything to interact with, there would be no way to even know if such a field existed.</p>
<p>When we say that an electric and magnetic field exists around an object, we are saying that <em>there exists the potential for a change in behaviour due to the interaction with the presence of other particles in the space around it</em>.</p>
<p>The electromagnetic field is mediated by photons, and photon interactions can result in different types of phenomena. These types of phenomena are so distinctive in their behaviour that classically they were thought of as two different interactions - an electric field and a magnetic field. In reality, they are the same thing.</p>
<p>Back to the issue of the moving electron. The moving electron has a potential for change in behaviour surrounding it, and when we bring another charged particle within that space surrounding it, the two particles interact via exchanges of photons. A part of the resulting behaviour that results depends on the position of the electron and a part of that behaviour depends on the motion of the electron. Classically, we called it the electric and magnetic field because they depend on two different things.</p>
<p>Think of waves interacting. Do you know much about quantum mechanics? Let's take for example a particle in an infinite square well. A particle in the lowest energy state forms a standing wave, the expectation value of the momentum is 0 and the expectation value of the position is in the centre. A particle in the second lowest energy state also forms a standing wave with a different energy, and yet the expectation value of its momentum is 0, and the expectation value of the position is in the centre of the well also. But if we take a linear sum of the two energy states - a particle in a mixed state - then the expectation value of the position takes on a time dependence, and the momentum is no longer zero. Two standing waves added up to form something that was no longer stationary.</p>
<p>Similarly with the electron and the magnetic field - the electron is emitting virtual photons around it to produce the &quot;field&quot;. When the electron is stationary, those virtual photons add up in a particular way that we characterize as an electric field. When the electron is moving, those virtual photons add up in a particular way that a different kind of behaviour occurs that we characterize as a magnetic field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to your main question,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To clarify, my question is why there is a magnetic field produced by the electron around itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is tricky. See <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/224064/do-moving-charges-get-affected-by-the-magnetic-field-they-create-while-moving-to" target="_blank">here</a> </p>
<p>In particular, it's mentioned that Jefemienko's equations should be used when particles are not static. And in that case, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefimenko%27s_equations#Discussion" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;... since each of these equations connects quantities simultaneous in time, none of these equations can represent a causal relation.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, it's my understanding that electromagnetic fields are a little like gravity. We're not sure why they are created, only that there are fields under certain conditions. </p>
<p>In your specific drawing, usually that example is given for a charged partical in an <em>externally</em> applied magnetic field to show the deflection of the charged particle. I can't remember if it was discussed in class as to whether the charged particle deflects itself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>with what is it interacting to produce a magnetic field? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing: the electromagnetic field of a moving charge has B-field components. It doesn't need to &quot;interact&quot; with anything.</p>
<p>Ignore SR for a moment. We can find an easy explanation in Ampere's Law: a changing electric field produces a magnetic field. </p>
<p>As the electron travels, the electric field in the area changes, resulting in a magnetic field. Done!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The big square (magnetic field) in the image is just to show that the electron must have one because it is deflected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not so. Charges are deflected in magnetic fields--it has nothing to do with whether or not the charge is producing its own magnetic field. </p>
<p>And how could it? A charge doesn't &quot;see&quot; it's own field. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
