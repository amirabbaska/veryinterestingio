<p>A while back, I got interested in Peto’s Paradox: the observation that big and long-lived organisms like elephants and whales don’t get cancer as often as we think they should. If all cells have a similar risk of developing cancer, then really large animals should be at really high risk.</p>
<p>But there’s absolutely no correlation between body size or lifespan and cancer rates.</p>
<p>So we studied elephant genomes, and now we think we’ve found the mechanism that explains the paradox. Elephants have 20 copies of the very well-known p53 tumor suppressor gene (to be precise: one p53 gene and 19 p53 retrogenes).</p>
<p>We looked in 60+ other animals, including whales, fish, birds, and humans, but found that only elephants (and maybe bats) have more than one p53 gene. We looked in woolly mammoth and mastodon genomes as well, and shed some light onto the evolutionary origins of p53 expansion (if you’re curious about mammoth genomes I did <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3csgs6/science_ama_series_im_vinny_lynch_geneticist_at/" target="_blank">another AMA</a> a few months ago). Lastly, we transferred one of the extra p53 genes from elephants into mouse cells that we grew in the lab and made some pretty interesting observations.</p>
<p>We released our findings on the <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/06/028522" target="_blank">open-access preprint server BioRxiv</a>, and another group, which came to pretty much the same conclusion but focused mostly only on elephants and humans, independently released theirs in <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2456041" target="_blank">JAMA</a>. You can read an article about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/science/why-elephants-get-less-cancer.html" target="_blank">our two studies in the New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: Well, it’s been a lot of fun but I have to run. Thanks for all the questions Reddit!</p></div></div>

<p>What do you think of the potential for CRISPR  and related technologies for treating cancer by selectively targeting sequences of DNA, if that's not too far outside the scope of your work?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! In a tissue engineering course I took last spring we were shown the results from an experiment that looked at the impact on longevity in mice when repressing, as well as over-expressing p53. </p>
<p>Without the gene the mice were prone to develop tumors, but an over-expression of p53 also lowered life expectancy, possibly because it caused otherwise healthy cells to undergo apoptosis. Did you see the same results in your studies with mice? If not, do you have a hypothesis as to why?</p>
<p>I'm sorry if this question is answered in the report you linked, but I had some trouble opening the .pdf.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello Vinny,</p>
<p>Do the 20 extra P53 genes mean that elephants are even less likely to have tumors? Is it a 20x correlation?</p>
<p>Also, if this is why elephants avoid cancers, what's the explanation for whales? Is there the possibility that late sea mammals have their own genetic cocktail for avoiding cancer that we could combine with the P53 research you're doing?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
