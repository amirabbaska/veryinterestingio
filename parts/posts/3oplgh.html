<p>A while back, I got interested in Peto’s Paradox: the observation that big and long-lived organisms like elephants and whales don’t get cancer as often as we think they should. If all cells have a similar risk of developing cancer, then really large animals should be at really high risk.</p>
<p>But there’s absolutely no correlation between body size or lifespan and cancer rates.</p>
<p>So we studied elephant genomes, and now we think we’ve found the mechanism that explains the paradox. Elephants have 20 copies of the very well-known p53 tumor suppressor gene (to be precise: one p53 gene and 19 p53 retrogenes).</p>
<p>We looked in 60+ other animals, including whales, fish, birds, and humans, but found that only elephants (and maybe bats) have more than one p53 gene. We looked in woolly mammoth and mastodon genomes as well, and shed some light onto the evolutionary origins of p53 expansion (if you’re curious about mammoth genomes I did <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3csgs6/science_ama_series_im_vinny_lynch_geneticist_at/" target="_blank">another AMA</a> a few months ago). Lastly, we transferred one of the extra p53 genes from elephants into mouse cells that we grew in the lab and made some pretty interesting observations.</p>
<p>We released our findings on the <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/06/028522" target="_blank">open-access preprint server BioRxiv</a>, and another group, which came to pretty much the same conclusion but focused mostly only on elephants and humans, independently released theirs in <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2456041" target="_blank">JAMA</a>. You can read an article about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/science/why-elephants-get-less-cancer.html" target="_blank">our two studies in the New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: Well, it’s been a lot of fun but I have to run. Thanks for all the questions Reddit!</p></div></div>
