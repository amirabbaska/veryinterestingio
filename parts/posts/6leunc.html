		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're getting a lot of different answers here, and most are correct but people here are talking about cash donations.  There's another big type of donation that rich people make too and that's in illiquid/non-marketable assets such as real estate and/or shares in private companies.</p>
<p>The ELI5 is a little difficult, but the gist is that for private companies, getting a 'value' is about 99% art and 1% science.  Accounting is a lot more assumptions and guess work than people would like to publicly acknowledge.  </p>
<p>So what an individual can do is offer to donate, say, 10% of his company to a charity.  Let's say that the company did really well last year so that guy can easily find an accountant to say that 10% is worth $10M. So the guy has a $10M tax deduction he can use as he sees fit (subject to AMT and other shit, but you get the point).  The guy also knows that last year's performance was a blip and if he repeated that 10% donation this year, he'd only get a valuation of $5M.  In effect he's got an extra $5M from the valuation.  </p>
<p>When I was younger, I was on the young alumni board for the university I went to for undergrad and we used to see this all the time.  Someone would donate property/illiquid securities/art/etc with an 'assessed' value of (say) $10M, but when the school went to sell it, they'd only realize (say) $3M in cash.  But the guy would still get to keep the $10M tax deduction. To a guy like that, a $10M tax deduction could be worth $4m to $5M easily.</p>
<p>I'm sure you're wondering, and yes this is in that 'gray zone' that's just millimeters from being tax fraud.  However, the IRS rarely pursues these cases 1) because they are <em>really</em> hard to win, 2) the school doesn't really care b/c they still just got a $3M donation, and 3) the school isn't going to 'help' the IRS (beyond bare minimum compliance) b/c the school would have to give up the $3M.</p>
<p>A similar, but different, application of this idea is where Mitt Romney reported a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/whats-really-going-on-with-mitt-romneys-102-million-ira/261500/" target="_blank">$102M IRA</a> by having accounts toy with the value/valuation of the assets within the IRA.  There's no reasonable way you could ever get that much into an IRA....unless you got your accountants to depress the value first then re-value later.</p>
<p><strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> I'm getting a lot of questions about how this worked for Romney.  Here is a <em>purely hypothetical</em> example based loosely on when Bain Capital took out Domino's Pizza that I put in a lower comment - I'm putting it here so more people see it:</p>
<p>I'm going to make up the exact numbers, but this is the mechanics: Romney had a type of retirement account where you could but $30K cash per year in the account tax free. He also had a private equity firm invested in private companies.</p>
<p>Romney took $30K cash, put it in the retirement account each year - tax free. Each year, his accountants would say, 0.X% of your portfolio companies is magically equal to $30K, so Romney would take the $30K cash in the tax-sheltered IRA and buy 0.X% of his companies personally. He did this for about (I think) 15 years. After a while, he converted it to a ROTH IRA meaning that he'd pay a small one-time tax hit but withdrawals are tax free.</p>
<p>Later on, his private equity company would sell the individual companies that it owned (or take them public). When they were sold, Romney would recognize the gain BUT it was now within the tax-sheltered IRA he'd pay no taxes and because he converted to a ROTH IRA, he pays no taxes on withdrawals. Genius.</p>
<p>Here's a sort of hypothetical example. In 1998, Bain (Romney's PE company) bought Dominos Pizza for $1.1B. They probably used a standard PE structure meaning that they borrowed $1.0B and put down cash for $100M. So the company is $1.0B debt and $100M equity. Romney puts in $30K each year to buy some of Dominos ($30K/$100M = .03%/year). He buys .03% per year, for a total of .45% of Dominos after 15 years. At this point, he converts from a traditional IRA to a ROTH IRA paying roughly $100K in taxes ($450K in contributions multiplied by his tax rate at the time of the conversion - maybe a little more or less than $100K, but in the neighborhood).</p>
<p>Then they take Dominos public, which they did. Dominos is worth $10B as of right now, so Romney's 0.45% of Dominos would be worth $45M. <strong><em>All completely tax free</em></strong> because its in a ROTH.</p>
<p>In reality, he has an IRA worth $102M, so my example is off by about half, but you get the basic mechanics. The IRS looked at it and said it was aggressive but not illegal when he ran for president in 2012.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of things to consider here.  I can tell you how <em>I</em> manage this.  But...firstly, yes...in the end if how you receive &quot;value&quot; is cash-this-year then keeping it rather than donating it almost always better.</p>
<p>Couple o' things I do:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>donating appreciated assets vs. cash.  If i have a stock that is worth $100,000 more than when I bought it, I could sell it and pay taxes on that 100k and then donate it and get a tax-brackets-worth of deduction (plus this income will influence my tax bracket potentially).  But..if I donate the asset I avoid the taxes associated with that 100K appreciation and then get the 100K tax deduction.  So...if that asset is the the thing I can live without this year I can give 100K by donating the appreciated asset vs. $60K if I sell, pay taxes on it and then donate it.  So...this strategy allows me <em>do more good</em>.  </p>
</li>
<li>I have a small foundation (which I've converted now to a much simpler donor advised fund that is easy and everyone should do!).  This allows me to donate money <em>when I have it</em>, but give it to charities <em>when I want to</em>.  This works by having the donor advised fund (or the foundation) itself be a charitable organization.  So...the tax deduction date/event is putting the money in that fund (you can never get it back).  Then you actually have the money distributed to charities when you want to.  For me this means I can support some organizations every year even though some years it's either less tax advantageous to do so (e.g. a generally down year) or I'm just not comfortable giving up the money that year.    </li>
</ol>
<p>(combine 1 and 2 together and what I generally <em>really do</em> is donate appreciated assets to my foundation / donor-advised-fund).</p>
<ol>
<li>There is &quot;soft value&quot; that comes from being able to make charitable donations.  These are undoubtedly create indirect economic return to the donor.  </li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of the day, when people say they are avoiding taxes with charitable donations they are not keeping more money, but they are <em>controlling the use of more of their money</em>.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that you can't &quot;make money&quot; by donating cash and writing it off, though, as others have mentioned, donating other assets can result in a net gain.</p>
<p>However, there a few other circumstances where it make economic sense:</p>
<p>1) The donation gets you something that you would have purchased anyway, but now you can write-off the cost. Examples could be as small as swag from your local public radio station or as large as a year of tuition or even a building named after you. I'm not saying that people reap a profit from this, but they get the benefit (which may be worth alot to them) AND they get it at a reduced price because they can deduct it.</p>
<p>2) If they donate it to a non-profit which they control. They can then set their friends and family up as employees and pay the money to them and also write it off as a deduction. This happens pretty often with athletes and celebrities. Hopefully they are also doing some charitable good, but it's often pretty sketchy and there are some high profile cases where it looks like almost nothing charitable was happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, the average person doesn't really understand accounting/taxes that well and will just repeat information they don't understand. I've seen redditors downplaying donations to charities from wealthy individuals as if it's nothing because &quot;it's just a write off.&quot; </p>
<p>In general, when donating money or items you just reduce your income by the amount of money donated or the value of the item donated. If you made $10,000,000 in a year and donated $9,000,000 to charity during the same year, you'd essentially be taxed as if you made $1,000,000. Considering that someone who made $10,000,000 would only pay at most ~$4,000,000 in Federal Income Taxes on that amount, donating $9,000,000 to reduce your taxes by $4,000,000 obviously costs more than simply paying the taxes.</p>
<p>Additionally, lot of people here have already explained some &quot;loopholes.&quot; A couple I've seen are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Donating a cheap piece of art and inflating it's value. This is 100% tax fraud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donating assets that have appreciated in value. E.g., you paid $1,000 for stock that is now worth $1,000,000. While this is a valid tax strategy, you are still not coming out ahead by donating. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donating shares of a private company (so the market value is unclear) and having an accountant inflate the value is also tax fraud. Just because the IRS won't go after you does not mean that something is &quot;gray area.&quot; </p>
</li>
<li>Donating $5 worth of clothes to Goodwill and saying you donated $500 worth is tax fraud.</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably not something the truly rich do, but us middle to upper middle class do this sort of thing:</p>
<p>If you are donating goods, say, used furniture, you can write off the value of the furniture.  The IRS does not question values under $500.  So, rather than sell that couch on Craigslist for $50, you donate it and write off some semi-realistic value close to but under $500 for it.  Tax on $500 of your income is more than the $50 you would have made selling it.</p>
<p>Bag of old clothes?  $5 at a yard sale or say $400 in reslae value donated and deducted.</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>Do this a lot, and you actually can save a decent chunk on your taxes, plus your donations can hopefully do some good.  You can donate items under $500 multiple times without proving value.  However, if you abuse this I'm sure the IRS will abuse you.  We do donate stuff probably 10 times a year as we tend to purge regularly and have a kid who outgrows clothes constantly.</p>
<p>EDIT:  I'm not advocating or engaging in illegal activity.  This is perfectly legal so long as you actually donate the goods, get an actual receipt from the charity, and deduct fair market value.  All of which I do every time.  There are plenty of tools out there to determine FMV if you cannot do so yourself or if you want to err on the side of caution.  </p>
<p>Further EDIT:  IRS Rules, specifically mentions the $500 thing on stating you need to file forms demonstrating value over $500 where appropriate: <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p526.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p526.pdf</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
