		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The trivial answer is to &quot;go faster&quot; but why does that happen?
What is actually involved that makes the boat go faster while rowing all in sync instead of alternatively?</p>
<p>[edit] What I mean by alternatively, is, suppose the whole team (present on boat) is divided into 2 halves, A &amp; B. To move through the water, first the team A pulls the boat (using their oars) and when they have finished their power stroke then team B does the pulling. So, when team A is done pulling it goes into its recovery phase. Meanwhile, team B pulls the boat. And then A again, and so on continuing as ABAB... (What I DON'T mean is half team is pulling for half the distance and other half for the left over distance).</p>
<p>[edit 2]
Thank you for all your responses. </p>
<p>Summary of the reasons (mentioned in the thread) rowing is done in sync and not otherwise:</p>
<p>Limited Space on boat   </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making it unable for rowers to go out of sync</p>
</li>
<li>The oars hitting one another</li>
</ul>
<p>Boat imbalance  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unnecessary stresses on the boat when rowers are going in opposite directions</p>
</li>
<li>Half rowers on one side in sync with each other but completely out-of-sync with the other side, make the boat go zig-zag, increasing the distance they're covering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Half of the rowers pulling the weight of other half who are recovering, halves the acceleration (not exactly though), which is not desirable.</p>
<p>Synchronization becomes unmanageable. </p>
<p>While in recovery, rowers move in a direction opposite to the motion of boat, thus the pseudo force pushes the boat forward, slightly though. If the rowers were alternating, the motion of the rowers would cancel out and thus
wasted.    </p>
<p>When a boat is being rowed, if half the rowers have completed their pull, the water is set into motion, and some rower of the other half will be applying the force with the oar in moving-water, thus inefficiency in its application </p></div></div>

If you look at these boats, there is no room for rowers to lift their oars to let the next oar go by. People get injured when one rower gets out of sync. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you mean everyone on the right pull, while everyone on the left recovers, you'll create more drag by the boat tending to move side to side and sorta twist as it moves along.</p>
<p>If you mean the first two people pull both left and right, while the next two recover, you're losing 1/2 your power in each stroke. Those boats are designed to have minimal drag so the gliding phase is less of a loss than losing 1/2 your power. </p>
<p>At least as far as I know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So you're watching Olympic rowing and somehow think it's not smooth enough???</p>
<p>The absolutely <em>simplest</em> answer here is that the way it's done now means there's zero chance of anyone's oars hitting someone else's. And that reason in and of itself is worth not taking the risk.</p>
<p>It's also a lot easier to stay in sync when you work as a team than as two teams. You'll notice there's one pacer per boat; your way would mean either two or on doing two jobs. </p>
<p>Plus, as with many things, it boils down to tradition. That's how they've always rowed; that's how they row now. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physics tells me that, given you can apply the same forward force even if split up, it's more efficient to do so. This is because drag force is relative to the velocity squared, so high velocity is punished harder than what you save from low velocity - keeping the average velocity is more efficient. I'm not sure how much difference this makes though. (1^2 +1^2 =2 while 0.5^2 +1.5^2 =2.5, 25% more drag force if you evenly shift between 0.5 and 1.5m/s compared to a constant 1m/s, although the average speed is still 1m/s)</p>
<p>So why don't they do that?</p>
<p>1) As others have mentioned, there may simply not be space for the oars to be out of sync. While this is probably true, if it was more efficient, I imagine the boats would be designed for that, so I don't buy this fully as a single explanation.</p>
<p>So I'll add two other possible reasons, just speculations from my part:</p>
<p>2) Being at the boats lowest speed when putting down the oars may also allow each rowman to add more force each stroke compared to if they put it down at a speed closer to the average, so my initial assumption may be incorrect.</p>
<p>3) Being out of sync means some rowmen has to wait half a stroke into the race before starting to add their force, this sounds inefficient, it's likely that half the rowmen will put one less stroke into the water by the end of the race.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason, besides oars colliding, is that more power in the stroke means more speed, which lifts the hull further out of the water, so there's less drag, which means even more speed.  It's like a multiplying effect.  Having people stroke at different times means the hull never lifts very much, so you don't get that increase in speed.</p>
<p>See also &quot;hull speed&quot;.  It takes a lot less power to skim over the water than to push through it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
