		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a feeling that in the animal kingdom it's often the males who are more aroused by seeing others mate, but more as an incentive to mate with that female himself and contest the other male. </p>
<p>With cats, where females are hurt by the barbed penis and tries to violently escape any attempt at sex, I doubt they derive any pleasure from being aroused by seeing it. More likely they're simply running away to escape rape. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
