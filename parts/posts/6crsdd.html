		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially you have three constants which relate to different areas of Physics.  There is planck's constant hbar which relates to quantum mechanics,  the speed of light c,  which is to do with relativity,  and the universal gravitational constant G,  which relates to gravity. </p>
<p>There is only one way to combine these three to get a length which is</p>
<p>L = sqrt ( hbar  G / c^3 ) =1.61 Ã—10^-35</p>
<p>By dimensional analysis, this should occur as a natural length scale when dealing with the quantisation of gravitation and the curvature of space. It also occurs in an entropy calculation for black holes</p>
<p>S = A / (4 L)^2</p>
<p>With A the area of the event horizon.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will comment on Planck length in the end, but a better question is how did Max Planck calculate the Planck constant, which can be used to write down the Planck length.</p>
<p>So we know that a hot object emits radiation with certain distribution of wavelengths. This is called the black body radiation. But the exact form of the distribution was a bit of a mystery to the physicists in the end of the 19th century; it was pretty much known from the experiments, but a theory for the distribution was missing. </p>
<p>It turned out that the a missing piece of inventing this theory was assuming that light can only come in certain frequencies. Max Planck first introduced this assumption to his calculations just arbitrarily without any physical reasoning behind it. It turned out that the calculations indeed resulted in the correct shape for the black-body radiation spectrum. The only unknown parameter in the theory, the frequency spacing of different possible light frequencies, could be then calculated from the experiments. This parameter is called the Planck constant.</p>
<p>Now to your question about the Planck length.</p>
<p>In physics we often do something called dimensional analysis. If we have a bunch of parameters we know might be relevant to the phenomenon we want to study, we can try combining these parameters to produce all different kinds of derived parameters. Planck length is essentially just taking Planck constant, the gravitational constant and the speed of light and combining them in such a way that the resulting quantity has dimensions of length. This length scale is supposed to be the one at which the two phenomena represented by the ingredient parameters - gravitation and quantum mechanics - start both playing some role.</p>
<p>Planck might or might not have invented Planck length himself. Dimensional analysis as I described above is such a common tool for physicists that anyone who just knew about the three constants could immediately do it and thus the &quot;inventor&quot; of Planck length is probably not known.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd be surprised if he actually ever did. As far as I know, he thought of his constant not as something fundamental and thus wouldn't really take it seriously.</p>
<p>To add: We don't really know if that length scale (and the other Planck scales) has any actual meaning. There are hints from theories we have at hand and it's quite believable that something ought to happen at these scales, but we don't have any experimental evidence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
