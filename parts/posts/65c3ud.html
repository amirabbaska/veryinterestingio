My new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Future-Humans-Science-Continuing-Evolution/dp/0300208715/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1492200514&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=future+humans" target="_blank">Future Humans: Inside the Science of Our Continuing Evolution</a>, considers how we can use science to make informed predictions about our evolutionary future. Recent research suggests that humans are indeed still evolving, but modernization is affecting the way that natural selection and other mechanisms of evolution affect us today. Technology, medicine, demographic changes, and globalization all seem to be having an impact on our ongoing evolution. But our long-term fate as a species may depend on how we choose to utilize emerging technologies, like CRISPR gene editing or the ability to establish permanent colonies on other planets.</p>

<li>Here is a video in which I discuss how colonizing Mars could affect our evolution: <a href="https://youtu.be/uHo1sL-P4n4" target="_blank"><a href="https://youtu.be/uHo1sL-P4n4" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/uHo1sL-P4n4</a></a></li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, thank you for doing this AMA. I would like to ask your opinion of 'designer babies'? I'm not really talking about removing genetic disease, but parents picking and choosing desirable traits for their children: making them stronger, better looking, smarter etc. Do you think it could potentially create an even greater disparity between the rich and poor? Richer parents being able to afford to give their children far better traits than the poor for example. Or is this unlikely? </p>
<p>Thanks again, I'll be sure to pick up your book! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is anyone thinking about or writing about the possibility that intelligence is a harmful trait for an organism, for the reasons that intelligence allows us to interfere with natural selection and thus potentially weaken the sustainability of the species, inadvertently? Perhaps that's why there are no alien space travelers... because a species that develops that level of intelligence is highly likely to go extinct prior to achieving that ?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Is there any worry that we'd actually see significant declines in human health and intelligence if more intelligent humans have less offspring, and less intelligent have more?</p>
<p>Are we seeing any evidence of this happening now?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As we can manipulate our environment to suit our bodies better and better will our evolution be more subtle, like disease resistance and immunity, rather than more anatomical evolution? Or as we become more reliant on technology will our bodies change to suit?
