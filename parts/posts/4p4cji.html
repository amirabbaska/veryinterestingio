<p>The oceans cover more than 70 percent of the planet and hold the key to many critical challenges facing science and society, from sustainably feeding human populations to addressing the impacts of climate change to protecting vulnerable marine species.</p>
<p>One of the cornerstone methods of keeping tabs on the oceans is through innovative tools and technologies to monitor them. At Scripps Oceanography we contribute to several ocean observation systems and networks that relay critical data about the seas and how they are changing. These include networks just off our populated coastlines (Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System, (<a href="http://www.sccoos.org/" target="_blank">http://www.sccoos.org/</a>)) for applications as diverse as marine operations, coastal hazards, and ecosystems, to far out at sea where it's not easy to access information (Argo, (<a href="http://argo.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">http://argo.ucsd.edu/</a>)) to help us understand phenomena such as El Niños and ocean warming.</p>
<p>I look forward to answering your questions about ocean observations between 12 and 1 EST on Tuesday, 21 June! Ask Me Anything!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Monitoring the ocean probably generates extremely large datasets.  I'm a data nerd, and I like to scour through open data sets to see if I can find trends / correlate with other disparate data sets. Are there any data sets you can make public so that the redditverse can help find trends or patterns within the data?  Others have done so within Amazon's Elastic Cloud Computing platform.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
