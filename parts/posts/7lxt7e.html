He asks why a small movement in earth's (supposed) rotation can increase the heat from the sun from morning / evening to mid-day.  Forgive me if this has been asked before, I did search but did not have much success which is probably why my explanations of the above are not working.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Point a flashlight at a wall. You know the flashlight is delivering 'x' energy to that circle. Tilt the flash light at an angle. Now the circle stretches out into a bigger oval right? But it's still just delivering x energy, so there's less energy per unit of 'area.' The sun hitting the earth impacts things the same way. A ~30 degree angle, iirc, effectively halves the amount of energy being delivered to a spot. </p>
<p>But I agree with the others, if this guy has the capability to believe in flat earth, you may as well bang your head against a wall as talk to him.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But the answer is partly that things take time to warm up once the Sun is on them, and partly that at noon the Sun is at a steeper angle, therefore filtering through less atmosphere before reaching the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Problem number one: you're talking to a flat-earther.  Just so you know, he's probably not even serious.  I have yet to meet someone that's both sane, and earnestly believes that hypothesis.  I hate those guys... my heart is beating a little faster in anxiety just thinking about them.  I wish I could afford to round them all up, take them to the South Pole (past their stupid ice wall), just to make the point.</p>
<p>The heat of the day is primarily due to how long it takes things to heat up.  Just before daybreak is usually the coldest part of the day because it's had all night to cool.  At noon, yes, the light is hitting more directly and the heat from it is most intense.  It's <em>getting warmer</em> most quickly at this time, however, despite that, it's not the hottest part of the day.  Rather, it's usually mid-afternoon, before sundown, that a given area sees its highest temperature, because it's been warming all day.</p>
<p>If you want, check out an hourly weather forecast for a sunny day (try 85251, Scottsdale).  3-4pm is when it finally reaches its hottest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is a photo of how the angle affects the distance-- it's a lot easier to see how the angle we are at relative to the sun could make the sun so bright during the afternoon and dark at night</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Once he denounces gravity, you can go ahead and tell him he's full of shit, and you never want to talk about this shit again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
