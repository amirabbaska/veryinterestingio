<p>Edit: Added oceans in parentheses, feels more ELI5 to me that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the northern hemisphere the ocean current circulates clockwise. </p>
<p>Hurricanes form in the warm southern tropics.  </p>
<p>Therefore hurricanes generally move east to west and eventually south to north. </p>
<p>In order for a hurricane to hit California it would have to form near Mexico, travel west to around Hawaii and then north before turning back east towards Cali. That part of the pacific is really cold and the hurricane will die out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to elaborate on everyone's responses a bit more:</p>
<p>Most hurricanes that hit the East Coast come from a point off West Africa's coast near Cape Verde. Hot dry air from the Sahara Desert and cool moist air from the wetter regions of the south clash here. These powerful winds are known as the African Easterly Jet. This is a vital ingredient for hurricanes that reach the US. Unlike weather in the US that moves west to east, the African Easterly Jet goes from east to west.</p>
<p>These winds interact with the warm waters from the equator which triggers rising columns of warm, moist air over the Atlantic. This is the moment when the columns spawn thunderstorms with really fast, rotating winds and we have ourselves a hurricane.</p>
<p>The Atlantic has perfect conditions for spawning hurricanes, whereas the Pacific US West Coast don't have these conditions of hot dry air clashing with moist cool air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The earth is a spinning body, as a side effect of this when large masses of air / water move around the globe they are deflected (northern hemisphere clockwise and in the Southern Hemisphere anticlockwise). This is called the Coriolis force.</p>
<p>Hurricanes typically form in warm waters (equatorial regions) and once formed in the Atlantic typically move in a West to North-West to North pattern and eventually follow a path North-East similar to the Gulf Stream.</p>
<p>The common pattern of this travel is why the West coast rarely sees Hurricanes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Pacific ocean doesnt get warm enough. The Atlantic has much warmer waters allowing for the formation of tropical storms. The warmer the water the bigger these cyclones become, turning into a hurricane. </p>
<p>Storms that hit the West Coast (of the US) are mostly monsoonal storms or El Ninos.</p>
