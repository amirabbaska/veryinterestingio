		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes he felt it.</p>
<p>Your skin would burn just from the heat radiation, your muscles
and internal organs which contain more water would instantly turn from water to steam and burst ( causing that large flash) .</p>
<p>Nothing would be left, the water in his body exploded in to steam and the remainder burnt till it was only carbon.</p>
<p>Nothing left.</p>
<p>No there would be no statue, the metal would have what ever was left of you as carbon content and anything like your shoes or zipper or teeth fillings would be dipped off as slag. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Depending on what kind of metal it was he was jumping into.<br />
I know horror stories from working in the aluminum factory. Your body is 70% water, and when water boils it expands dramatically. So when the body goes under the surface of the metal and boils there, it creates a huge explosion of molten metal.</p>
<p>It happens very fast and it's probably one of the more horrific ways to die. Do not recommend. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I won't talk about this guy, because I think that is disturbing, instead I'll talk generally about what would happen if a person jumped into a crucible of molten steel. </p>
<p>The water will boil very fast, it only needs to be raised 60 degrees C to boil. </p>
<p>Iron melts at about 1510c, so there's a lot of energy there, but the thermal conductivity of the various tissues will limit how fast they will heat up. Bones are made of hydroxyapatite which boils at 1500c so it will need to be heated up quite a lot.  Molten steel can also be a bit cooler like 1370c, so it's possible that it might be cool enough that it wouldn't ever vaporize the bones. </p>
<p>Also recognize that people are way less dense than molten steel, so the guy is not going to drop into it, he's going to be essentially floating or standing on it. The air is a poor thermal conductor, so the rapid steam cloud would be made when the water in his body that contacts the metal surfaces becomes superheated steam, and heats up the rest of the water in his body, so it's his own water that is heating him up.  The person would essentially boiling himself. </p>
<p>The person would essentially burst, and wouldn't have much holding him together after that.  It's possible that parts would be ejected due to the pressure, but it's likely that it would stay together and the person would fall limp.  Any internal organs would rapidly boil away the water, and the pressure would force its way out of the spine and skull and any other enclosed space. Tendons would see their water boil out as well and the body would fall to the surface.</p>
<p>The bones would heat up quite a lot, and being that they are the only really stable structure in a person's body, everything would either be attached to the bones, attached to something fleshy attached to bones, or  else would fall and contact the molten steel.  This would carbonize and otherwise pyrolize everything, and anything not carbonized would oxidize in the presence of oxygen.</p>
<p>You'd likely be left with the bones, parts of them would be charred where there was carbon left on them, parts of them would likely be white where the steam cleaned them.  They would be brittle as the cellulose has broken down, but the hydroxyapatite would still be there so they would remain solid.  You would likely have to raise the temperature and wait longer to see them fully incinerate. </p>
<p>There would be remains, but the person would die nearly instantly as the water would very quickly create superheated steam, and the steam would heat up the rest of the water in the person's body which would also boil and do the same.  It would be very dangerous for anyone nearby.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The temperature difference between the molten metal and your body would be rather large, making it so you don't immediately sink into the molten metal, just float on top of it as your body's temperture gradually changes to become similar to the excessively high temperature of the molten metal. Oh, but while you do 'float' atop the molten metal, you would also experience excruciating pain of the heat burning everything that is your body, as well as allowing on-lookers to to gaze in bewilderment or avert their gaze as your die in horrible pain. </p>
<p>In terms of the final output (the input being the molten metal and you), it would be mostly just metal. All your body would have burned up into the air as ashes before coming into direct contact with the molten metal (sorry no statue of you upon your demise). The solidified metal would most likely be the only thing that could be considered your 'remains'*, and wouldn't be used for it's intended purpose due to ethical reasons. Still would be a pretty metal way to go though.</p>
<p>*My middle school science teacher told us a story of how his old employer's company had an incident where a guy accidently fell into a vat of molten metal. They buried the solidified metal of which he died in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
