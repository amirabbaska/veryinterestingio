		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The explosion will push the water away in all directions forming a giant bubble.
As the bubble expands the pressure of the gass and vapour will drop and it will cool dome somewhat.
Then because of the water pressure, the bubble will start collapsing again making the volume smaller and therefore increasing the pressure and again making the gas glowing hot again. (really like the opposite of the explosion)
This collapsing bubble will &quot;bounce&quot; and expand again.</p>
<p>u/Astramancer_ linked to an xkcd 'what if' page which in turns links to this article:
<a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/737271.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/737271.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/737271.pdf</a></a>
(worth skimming trough it)
On page 20 you see what I described, the bubble radius increases and falls back again, bounces and increases again, collapses again,...</p>
<p>You might also be interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoluminescence" target="_blank">sonoluminescence</a>:
This is basically the same. You can use a sound wave to &quot;expand&quot; a bubble and collapse it periodically.  Even on a tiny scale enormous temperatures are produced making the bubble glow like a tiny star.
So hot (Like think 10 000°C and some simulatios up to 500 000°C) that the normal way of determining a temperature via the light (via the black body spectrum) doesn't work anymore.
No one really knows how hot the core of the bubble becomes and there are all sort of weird factors that influence the luminescence and noone really knows in detail how it works.</p>
<p>But the collapsing bubble at the depths of the mariana trench will surely produce a series of bright flashes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
