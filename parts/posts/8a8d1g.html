		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I teach electrodynamics, and this is one of the things that is covered.</p>
<p>There are many things at play here.</p>
<p>First of all, all things will do a combination of reflect, transmit, absorb, and disperse when light is incident on them. The amount of each depends on a lot of properties.</p>
<p>Before getting into that, let's first address diffuse vs specular reflection. When a surface is rough, any light it reflects will be in random directions. Thus, light tends to spread out - reflections are not obvious, and the surface seems duller. This is not because it is less reflective, though, <del>per say</del> per se. Specular reflection is caused by smooth surfaces. When a smooth surface reflects, all of the rays typically follow the law of reflection, and remain collimated from their source. This allows you to see an image in the reflection, and thus the brain interprets this as more reflective.</p>
<p>All material interfaces produce some reflection. From an electrodynamics perspective, light is an electromagnetic wave. When the EM field of the wave interacts with the electrons in the material it is entering, it produces an oscillating polarization. This, in turn, radiates the electrodynamic wave backwards (reflection) and produces the known &quot;slowing&quot; of light as it transmits in the material. (A naive look at this would be to claim it is &quot;boundary conditions&quot; that produce the reflection, but that is just a mathematical approach rather than the underlying physics.)</p>
<p>The amount of reflection depends on a lot of different properties of the material:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The more mobile the electrons on, are the more the EM wave interacts with them. Conductive materials have a very high reflectance as a result, since they have much more mobile electrons. This is why silvering is used on the back of mirrors (it is not the glass that produces the reflection, the glass is simply used to make it easy to produce a smooth surface for specular reflection).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The higher the angle of incidence, relative to the normal to the surface, typically results in greater reflection. This is especially true if the index of refraction is lower in the transmitting material (hence total internal reflection). </p>
</li>
<li>Resonances with the material can influence all 4 behaviours of light at an interface. To a first approximation, all binding states can be treated as simple harmonic oscillators - the electrons are bound to the nuclei, and if we disturb them slightly (as with an incoming EM field), then they will oscillate. If they are oscillated at a natural frequency, the energy of the incoming EM wave will be absorbed at a higher rate (and converted to internal forms of energy, or radiated dispersively - in all directions rather than reflected/transmitted directions).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a grasp of the math involved in physics, check out Griffiths' Electrodynamics text. While not the most mathematically rigorous, or educationally helpful text, it does have decent descriptions and can help convince people that they understand (whether they do or not). Chapter 9 is all about electrodynamics waves.</p>
<p>Edit: I don't use the phrase &quot;per se&quot; very often. My misspelling of it shouldn't detract from the rest of what I have said. I am a physicist who has never taken Latin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reflective materials are almost always metals.  The reason for this is that metals form what is known as a conductive band, which is essentially a soup of electrons floating over the rather uneven surface of atoms.  Normally atoms look like a ball pit, but this soup fills in the gaps such that the outside surface is rather flat.</p>
<p>If the surface is essentially flat, every photon that falls on the surface gets reflected back at a very well determined angle (rather than random). This orderly reflection gives the mirror.  Random reflections make things dull. </p>
<p>One way to make things more shiny is to polish them very finely. This polish flattens the surface as much as possible. Polishing also comes with oils which fulfill partially the role of that electron soup found in metals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As probably a related question: why is it I seem to instinctively know that mirrors are silver in color?</p>
<p>I know that if polish I something that is a dull metallic gray enough, it will become a mirror. If I polish something with any other color, it will tint the reflection.</p>
<p>Do I know this simply through instinctive experience, or is there something telling in the reflected light that gives it away?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all down to the quantum mechanical structure of the material and the physical arrangement of the atoms at the air-material interface. At its core is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens%E2%80%93Fresnel_principle" target="_blank">Huygens-Fresnel Principle.</a></p>
<p>For a &quot;mirror-like&quot; reflection, you need all rays of light that are incident on the substance to be reflected in the same, predictable way - this is what generates an image we can understand. If the rays get 'scrambled', we can't see any structured reflection - it's like looking at your reflection in a sheet of crumpled aluminium foil.</p>
<p>If the material can interact with the incident light, it will always absorb and re-emit photons 180 degrees out of phase with the incident light. The distribution of these radiators determines the shape of the emitted light. With a smooth surface like a mirror, this is a flat 2D rectangle of closely-packed point radiators - if you shine a plane wave light perpendicular to the plane (i.e. directly at the mirror), all of the electrons are excited with the same phase and so radiate in phase. Adding up all of these point spherical waves gives you (approximately) a reflected, counter-propagating plane wave.</p>
<p>If you shine an angled light on the (flat) surface, a given wave front will hit the surface at different times <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/161409/huygens-principle-during-reflection-comparing-wavelets-from-before-reflection" target="_blank">depending on its position</a>. As the light travels, its phase changes, creating 'lines' of differing phase on the material surface. The net effect of this is a reflected wavefront following the law of reflection.</p>
<p>The above is only true for flat (or approximately flat) surfaces. If there are microscopic protrusions on the material, all of the <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/155539/why-is-the-light-reflected-at-the-same-angle-from-mirror" target="_blank">mathematical tricks</a> used in deriving the law of reflection go out the window and you need to do some complicated integrals to tell what the reflected wave will look like. Effectively, it means that the textured surface does not reflect a plane wave when you shine a plane wave on it, so ray optics don't work and you can't resolve reflected images. This is what gives rise to &quot;shiny but not reflective&quot; substances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
