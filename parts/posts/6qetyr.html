		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand that the people keeping Pirate Bay alive don't care but, what is keeping the site alive? Are they moving the ''server'' location every month? I mean, for my pov over now the years, it's not so hard for some anti piracy groups or governments to shut down piracy stuff, so i just don't understand how PB does it when governments now seems to take a easy way to solve the PB issue by just forcing ISP to block the site in their countries while other piracy sites gets shutdown so fast, </p>
<p>So sorry for the messed up question, i just don't understand how it can be so hard for all the anti piracy places to shut them down completely when they can do all these others sites so quick? </p>
<p>(Also, i just wanna say, i'm not from some anti piracy place or anything, i'm curious to why they have issue shutting them down while i read all the time online about a piracy website getting shutdown and then i still see PB online somehow, so please don't take it as i want the site to be shut down, just curious to why it hasn't been that already :-) ) </p>
<p>Sorry again for wall of text :-P And thank you all for your replies! This is an interesting subject! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
