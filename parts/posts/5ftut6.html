		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Veggie Bacon and God_Mode's <em>FIRST</em> sentence (he deleted his comment, he was talking about owning a rolex, a boat/sports car) clarify it pretty well. </p>
<p>My take on it is only having and using the basic necessities. Not having expensive luxuries or uneeded items. </p>
<p>For example, having one pair of pants one pair of shoes, two shirts, two pairs of underwear and socks. </p>
<p>My uncle lived minimally while in the peace corps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A minimalist lifestyle is living with only the things that make you happy and removing the clutter that's distracting. For some people, this means having fewer 'things,' and for others, it's more of an emotional state. I try and balance the two. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The minimum you can spend in order to maintain your job/career with consistency. </p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>As a software developer in San Francisco:</p>
<ul>
<li>Van lease, where you live: $200/mo</li>
<li>Gas: $30/mo</li>
<li>Professional clothing: $30/mo</li>
<li>Gym (for showers, mainly): $30/mo</li>
<li>Food (2/3 meals provided by top 3 employer... 30 meals/mo): $30/mo</li>
<li>Hardware to keep laptop current: $20/mo</li>
<li>Cell plan/cell upgrades: $50/mo</li>
</ul>
<p>$390/mo living expense on a $7,500/mo post-tax income ($150k/yr).</p>
<p>Good luck?</p>
<hr />
<p>As a 10 year old orphan &quot;tour guide&quot; in Tajganj, Agra, India (near the Taj Mahal):</p>
<ul>
<li>Food $40/mo</li>
<li>Misc $7/mo</li>
</ul>
<p>$47/mo living expenses on a $400/mo tax-free income...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Minimalism varies from person to person, but at it's core it is living a life where your possessions are not things that have control over your life in any way.</p>
<p>Avoiding debt and therefor stress. Your possessions not dictating your happiness or sadness. The things you own, not owning you.</p>
<p>For some people this means owning 10 pairs of the same jeans and 10 of the same shirt and wearing the same thing every day, because choosing how you look causes you stress. For others it's just reducing the amount of random stuff that you own. It's simply reducing the impact of your possessions on the well-being of yourself, to whatever extent that means for you.</p>
<p>For me personally, lots of colors and conflicting patterns stress me out, so I tend to choose understated and simple items for what I need. I don't want dinner plates with 10 colors on them and a crazy pattern, I just want something simple. My bookcases are well organized with only a couple knick knacks with happy memories attached to them. Most of the stuff people gift me I tend to sell or give away because I don't need them, and finding places to store things indefinitely is a worry that I don't need.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look in your closet. Any outfits you haven't worn all year? Two years? Three? Why do you have them? You clearly aren't using them and they're taking up space collecting dust. Don't tell me how the day will come, the right moment will come for you to busy it out because we both know it probably won't. Just do yourself a favor and get rid of it. Donate it to charity if it's nice so someone else can put it to use or throw it out if it's ratty. </p>
<p>Once it's gone (and be honest, you probably didn't realize it was even there till you checked) you'll feel better seeing how much more space you have. Less clutter. More Feng Shui. Now before you go out and fill it up again because you just saw a new outfit you just have to have ask yourself how often you'll wear it in the next year. How long until it moves to the back of the closet and you forget about it? Do you really need it to be happy? Or will you be preoccupied by something else next week? </p>
<p>Now I'm not saying you can't have new things or nice things; if you get a lot of good use of our it then by all means. No one is saying you need to suffer through life. You don't need to join a monastery. But before you go and spend your money to fill your life with more stuff that you won't use, ask yourself if you really need it. Will it really make you happy in the long term? Or is it just a momentary distraction? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
