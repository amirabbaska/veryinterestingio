They get people to 'like, follow, share' their page and posts - once they hit the right number of followers, etc. they can then sell the page to the highest bidder. That person then wipes all the previous posts and uses the page to push their own stuff to a built in audience. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This info can then be sold in bulk, or they may use those contact methods to attempt to scam you since you have already demonstrated that you are a gullible person by accepting the friend request.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having friends means these accounts are more &quot;real&quot; so when they are used to boost likes on pages etc they are less likely to be reported as fake traffic. And having friends it'll boost the Posts its initial spread. show up on your friends pages and if the bot then tags you in the post it can show up on their friends of friends pages (aka your friends) etc, further boosting the spread.</p>
<p>People will usually make fake accounts and sell them to a service that offers likes/shares, or the services will make them themselves.</p>
<p>I don't think they use them to gather information about people, at least not primarily.</p>
