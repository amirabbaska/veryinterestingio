		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The closer you get to a star, the higher an object's equilibrium temperature will be.</p>
<p>Outside of star systems, space temperature is not entirely uniform. Some regions receive more energy than others, sometimes an ongoing phenomenon lowers the temperature (see also: the boomerang nebula)</p>
<p>On a much larger scale, there's fluctuations in the CMB (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Ilc_9yr_moll4096.png/1200px-Ilc_9yr_moll4096.png" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Ilc_9yr_moll4096.png/1200px-Ilc_9yr_moll4096.png</a>), which show that there is slight fluctuations in the CMB (basically the most distant and oldest effect we can see).</p>
<p>Whether any of this could be called a 'climate' is hard to say. Space has no weather, which seems to be a hard prerequisite.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In terms of a climate in space, it be more about, what physical stuff is in a region and what electromagnetic radiation is in that regions, etc. So there will be boring cold empty space that has a few particles but have random high energy particles from relativistic jets. Other areas you will have warmer nebulas of clouds, sometimes they might be ionised. High energy relativistic jets, will probably be quite hot, etc.</p>
<ol>
<li>Interstellar Medium/Gas hydrogen and helium, dust (everything else) and ionised version. Typically temperature increases as density increases along with other phenomena such as:
<ol>
<li>Plain space with a few particles per m\^3.</li>
<li>Interstellar medium gas clouds</li>
<li>Nebula</li>
<li>Sun.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Black hole effects.
<ol>
<li>It's going to be hot and crazy near a black hole.</li>
<li>Hot relativistic jets shoot out of the poles. These clouds/jets are more visible the closer you are, but we can detect very high energy particles that reach earth. But supermassive black holes can shoot visible jets for millions of light years. For reference that's longer the the whole mike way (200k light years). (Note these can be created by other phenomena than black holes).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Pulsars shoot out a very strong radiowaves at an angle that's rotation with respect to it's rotational axis.</li>
<li>CMB  is 2.72548±0.00057 K. But it varies by a tiny amount depending on where you are.</li>
<li>Dark Matter. You are only going to notice this by the impact on gravity in a region, but isn't likely to be evenly distributed.</li>
</ol>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly no</p>
<p>What we call space weather is better thought of as shotgun blasts.  They largely go outwards, away from the sun</p>
<p>Temperature is particles whacking into one another.  It's not movement; it's collision</p>
<p>People will correctly tell you that equilibrium gets hotter the closer you get to the sun</p>
<p>What they won't tell you is that if you were standing one inch from the sun and didn't have to cope with light, you'd still freeze to death in cold-ass outer space or get shredded by solar wind blasts, depending on which several seconds you were there</p>
<p>It's the difference between the highway and bumper cars.  Even if the highway is inching along slowly, temperature is not present.  </p>
<p>That motion isn't, practically speaking, temperature.</p>
<p>In the sense that it's not technically zero over time, yes, all locations have a temperature</p>
<p>But not in any human-relevant sense</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure how to answer this question but I will add one thing. Earths climate is heavily regulated by the oceans (and other large bodies of water), currents, and atmosphere. Other regions outside of our planet won’t have these, so I suppose the climate relies on solar radiation alone, which could vary wildly</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
