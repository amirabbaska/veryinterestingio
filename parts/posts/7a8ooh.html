		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can explain this by symmetry arguments! The force acting on a charge due to a magnetic field is a vector (like all forces) but the magnetic field is a pseudovector. Vectors change sign under a reflection transformation and pseudovectors do not. </p>
<p>Here's an intuitive way of thinking about it. Imagine we place a mirror on the floor and drop a baseball onto it. We know the force due to gravity will pull the ball down towards the mirror, but the mirror image of the ball looks like it is accelerating upwards toward the mirror surface. Thus the mirror image of vectors like force and velocity has the opposite sign of the original. </p>
<p>Now, place a current loop in front of the mirror that generates a magnetic field pointing towards its surface (like the &quot;vertical mirror&quot; in <a href="https://nukephysik101.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/parity-mirror.png" target="_blank">this image</a>). The magnetic field direction depends only on the current direction in the loop, which is NOT changed in the mirror image. Therefore, the magnetic field in the reflection of the current loop points in the same direction as the original current loop. </p>
<p>Now launch a test particle into the field generated by the current loop. Because force is a vector (odd under reflection) and magnetic field is unchanged in the reflection, the magnetic force cannot have any components parallel to the magnetic field because these components would not flip sign in the mirror image as a force must. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation by u/allofthephotons and here, as a more direct explanation:<br />
The magnetic field is just a convenient construction to reflect the force between charges that move. That is all.<br />
When charges move, relativistic effects change the appearance of the normal static electric force. Take an electron moving parallell to a wire carrying a current. The wire is neutral, but consists of negative charges electrons moving along one direction, and positively charged atoms standing still. The electron moving along the wire with the electrons will due to relativistic lorentz contraction see a positive charged wire. The electronstream in the wire is not contracted since it moves with the electron, but the stationary atoms are contracted. Therefore the wire appear positive charged, and the electron is attraced. It can only be attracted or repulsed as obvious from the normal static electric force equation. A little hard to explain with text only, and pictures will show this simply. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an example from Schwartz's Principles of Electrodynamics, based on relativity. (Have I just disqualified this answer as &quot;not intuitive&quot;? Carrying on regardless...)</p>
<p>Imagine an infinite, straight wire with a constant current that is composed of equal numbers of positive and negative charges flowing in opposite directions (so the wire's net charge density is 0).</p>
<p>Now add a particle with charge q moving parallel to the wire with constant velocity v (lab frame K). What's the force on the particle?</p>
<p>To answer, Schwartz transforms the problem to the rest frame K' of the particle. Applying the corresponding Lorentz boost to the wire's charge-current four-vector, one finds that in K' it has a non-zero charge density. The charge is therefore attracted towards the wire by an electrostatic field.</p>
<p>(There are two assumption/empirical facts here: 1) in the particle's rest frame, the force is given by the electric field as the particle sees it, and 2) because the charge and current distributions are time independent, one can calculate the electric field in K' by the usual integration-over-charge-density approach.)</p>
<p>Boosting back to the lab frame, one finds the answer to the question, which is that the moving charge feels a force perpendicular to its velocity.</p>
<p>If you now separately calculate the B-field for the current by the usual formula, you also find that the force calculated above satisfies F=q vxB.</p>
<p>Of course, the above is just one example (and would not be applicable if the particle were moving towards the wire instead of parallel to it, because assumption 2 would be violated.) There's a more elaborate induction process to get to the full relativistic apparatus. However, the above example does establish the existence of a force perpendicular to a charged particle's velocity and the magnetic field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright.  Let's see:  </p>
<p>The magnetic force is applied as a charge <em>moves through</em> a magnetic field  That means you have 2 directions defined:  The magnetic field and the particle's direction of movement.  </p>
<p>Thus, your force can be applied in a total of 3 directions:  The direction of the magnetic field, the direction of velocity, and &quot;neither&quot;.  Let's take them one at a time:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Direction of magnetic field:  This one, if we imagine two same charged particles connected by a string:  Having them perfectly at rest means they don't move.  However, if you move one, even slightly, they'll both go shooting off in the direction of the magnetic field, &quot;creating&quot; velocity, and thus, energy, from nothing.  So this one doesn't work.</p>
</li>
<li>Direction of velocity:  Same issue, here.  Two equally charged particles, connected by a string, perfectly at rest.  Start one moving, and they will begin to spin faster and faster forever.  Creating velocity, thus, energy, from nothing. <strong>edit</strong> This one is a bit less perfect of an example because they'd be creating velocity in opposite directions, and technically could be a net zero effect. Maybe imagine the two particles &quot;converging&quot; in open space.  Since their electric force interaction will be likely a net zero, adding magnitude (or subtracting) from both velocities will be creating energy.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, since it literally <em>cannot</em> apply force in either of those directions, it must be applying the force in a direction that is neither of those.  Thus, orthogonal to both directions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
