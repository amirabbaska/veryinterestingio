		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not too complex. Smells come from particles evaporating up from the object. Cold objects evaporate much more slowly -- and <em>some</em> molecules are more affected by this than others, so the blend changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a degree in Chemistry and am a chef by profession. The main reason is the aromatics in the food. Many of the compounds that create the smell of food comes from the aromatic compounds the food, most of which have a low vaporization temperature. During the initial cooking process a majority of theses compound are driven off, creating the smell of the food. Leftover having lost most of these aromatic compounds and having a lower refrigeration temperature  have a different smell. After reheating some of the original smell will return but not to the same level as when first prepared.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
