		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is due to the boundary layer effect.</p>
<p>All fluids and gasses have a resistance to movement/flow - what we call viscosity. Honey has very high viscosity, water much less so, air even less.</p>
<p>But the closer you get to the surface of an object, the more that resistance goes up. It's sort of like a multiplier effect. Right at the surface of the object, there is essentially no flow.</p>
<p>Dust ends up on the blades, and is never blown off because the air around the dust, right at the surface of the blade, does not move fast enough to dislodge it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A fan moves air by pushing it over the angled blades. As the air moves over the blades it gets pushed faster and faster until it's moving as fast as the blades. At the trailing edge of the blade, the air and fan blade are moving at almost the same speed. The air is moving fast, and the blade is moving fast in the same direction so the relative speed is near zero. If you were an ant at that point, you feel as if there was almost no wind. The dust particles in the air at this point would settle just as they would on a desk. That's why dust collects on the trailing edge of each blade, because the relative wind speed is zero just like it is above a desk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Static. As the blades move through the air they product a slight static charge, just like your car does when driving through dry air. The charged blades attract dust and once on the top surface of the blade, as that is not the leading edge, air does not strike the dust with enough force to dislodge it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I have observed when I lived in dry environments there was less dust than when we were in humid areas.  It would been that humidity plays a role in this as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You ever see the space docking scene in Interstellar? Where Matthew McConaughey has to match the rotational speed of the station they're trying to dock with? It's basically that, the dust is moving just as fast as the air in the same rotation, so it's basically, relatively, not moving at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
