		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So a lot of these answers are correct, yes we are a lot stronger than we realize. But the science on this is super cool and I can give some more specifics about it (I'm a personal trainer and have thorough understanding of neuromuscular physiology).</p>
<p>Our brain triggers our muscles to contract (as if they were draw strings) and thus move our bones, right? Well, inside of our muscle cells are little organelles called golgi tendons that limit the amount of electrical impulse our brain sends out and reaches the muscle nerves to trigger muscle contraction, thus limiting our muscle's contractile power. This means that each muscle has a most of the time &quot;cap&quot; that limits it from ever contracting too hard because -in truth, our muscles are a lot stronger than we know. If we didn't have these built in limits, we would accidentally break our own bones in half and tear our muscles in addition to other soft tissue damage due to excessive applied force.</p>
<p>So this limit keeps our strength naturally between 30-50% (numbers vary according to what educational association you are referencing) from non-trained and trained athletes. In moments where your body releases adrenalin and fight or flight is triggered, the golgi tendons essentially &quot;shut off&quot; and allow your brain to fully activate / trigger total muscle contraction. But you see, it's not just that our muscles not can fully contract at maximum strength that full power is achieved. It's also because our nervous system becomes more effective at utilizing all of the necessary muscles in a synergistic way that allow even greater strength to be achieved in multi-complex movements (think squats, presses, lifts, extensions, etc). </p>
<p>So yes, we get stronger because of adrenaline. But it's because multiple of our protective systems let their foot off the brakes and we can reach our full neuromuscular capabilities. That is why some girl who could maybe max out on a 250 lb deadlift can then apply an equivalent of 750 lbs force.. which may be enough to alter the position of a vehicle so as a person could get out from underneath it. There could be other factors at play there too, such as the position of the vehicle, center of gravity and threshold of force applied for movement. But in terms of physiology, our bodies are much more capable and amazing then most people ever will know or see. Much of this is due to natural selection of genetics... strength just isn't that required any more and hasn't been for thousands of years to procreate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human body is incredibly durable and much stronger than we normally assume, this is because when we're calmly exerting ourselves (like in the gym) we're aware of the stress the load puts on our body, and as such we are cautious to avoid injury.  With massive amounts of adrenaline that awareness fades to the background. It allows a person to use the upper limit of their capabilities, possibly damaging themselves in the process. Another factor is just how much was needed. Most people picture superman lifting the car over his head, when in reality even a fraction of an inch can give the needed escape room to survive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The problem is - you have to be completely unconcerned about tearing muscles, ripping tendons and breaking bones to use your full strength.   </p>
<p>Also, she didn't just pick it up like Superman, she raised part of it by enough for him to get free, which means lifting a lot less. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Article doesn't quantify what was &quot;lifting the truck&quot; exactly, but as her dad was just pinned under it and not crushed by it I'd guess most of the truck's weight remained on the wheels. It's usually relatively easy to pull the car upward and increase clearance a bit for the one stuck under it to get out, doesn't require actually lifting the car into the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are much stronger than they realize, its not just adrenaline, we often don't utilize our full strength because it can damage our bodies, but when you don't worry about that, humans can do some amazing things, even without adrenaline. You sometimes hear about weightlifters tearing their muscles from lifting too much, that same disregard for their discomfort or injury allows them to lift that much weight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
