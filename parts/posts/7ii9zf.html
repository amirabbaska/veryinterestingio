		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Locally, as in directly over and around the fire, it is capable of creating its own weather. It does this by creating immense amounts of heat, pulling air upwards. This leave a low pressure area that wants to be filled. New air fills this lower pressure area creating wind. This process feeds back upon itself, and when combined with steep canyons or other topographic features can create incredibly fast moving fires that move against the prevailing winds. </p>
<p>they don't commonly have an affect at a larger scale, fires are mostly influenced by weather, not visa versa. We get fires here when there are dry, powerful, Santa Ana winds that make a normally easily containable fire (car accident, cig butt, falling power lines,etc) move rapidly and spread uncontrollably. In rare cases the fires ash can contribute to cloud formation, helping firefighters put a stop to the fire if wind pushes these newly formed clouds over the fire. in the most extreme cases the fire's ability to create its own wind and storm clouds can create a fire tornado. </p>

<p>Edit: thanks to /u/sirkazuo for bringing up the ability of fires to create their own storm clouds. Scroll down to his response to this comment for good links. Added to post for correctness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
