		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, it seems barter system economies predate monetary ones all the way back to the point where chimpanzees have them.  Where males have been known to bribe females for sex with fruits and berries that are difficult to get.</p>
<p>In the case of humans, those who were able to get these things were then later able to trade them for things they needed.  Those who did not, were not.  Being able to get the things you need because you've accumulated stuff you don't; but that someone else wants/needs, is a solid social tactic.</p>
<p>It carries on today, say you want to marry a girl.  Kind of have to put a ring on it.   Basically a boast - &quot;I'm a good enough provider to get this much bling.&quot; Of course works the other way too.  Oscasio-Cortez' out might cost a ridiculous $3500, but i think mot guys will agree that she does look great in it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fancy title for it is memesis. It simply means, things only have value when someone else wants it. Rene Girard was the economist who really built on the idea.</p>
<p>I think it occurs because things have no meaning/purpose by themselves.</p>
<p>Human beings are the part of the universe that ascribes meaning/purpose to things. </p>
<p>But because we can't figure out the meaning of every single thing individually, we depend on the indication of others for the value of many things. </p>
<p>(Pair memesis up with consumerism (the idea that goodness comes from owning, having, and using material things) and individualism (things belong to only one person) we get a rather destructive capitalism ( where material things are hoarded as a sign of a  good life, vs a better type of capitalism where relationships, wisdom, inner strength and peace, and value are treasured instead).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
