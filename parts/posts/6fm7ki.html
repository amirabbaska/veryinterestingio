		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are trying to find out if the Trump campaign violated the foreign policy laws.  If they did, as the Nixon campaign violated burglary laws, the President could be impeached by the House.  He would then be tried in the Senate, and if he lost he would be removed from office.  This would &quot;really do&quot; something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Election has three major parts, and there's a fourth part that is slowly growing like a malignant plot tumor.</p>
<p>The First Part is: Did Russia intentionally interfere with American Media (Traditional <strong>and</strong> Social) in order to manipulate the results of our Presidential Election?</p>
<p>The Second Part is: Did the Trump Campaign cut a deal with Russia to get them to do this, in exchange for future favors if Trump won the election?</p>
<p>The Third Part is: Did Donald Trump <strong>know</strong> about his campaign staff cutting that deal?</p>
<p>If the first is true, then we need to take precautions against future interference by Russia.</p>
<p>If the second is true, then people committed Felonies. Suffice it to say, the American Legal System takes a poor view of <em>asking</em> for a Foreign State to interfere in our elections. I'm not familiar with the specific laws involved, but this could potentially end in Life-Sentences for those who cut the deal.</p>
<p>If the third is true, then Donald Trump committed a Felony. It <em>might</em> also be possible to argue that he committed Treason in doing so, having given aid to the enemy. We're not at war with Russia at the moment... but they are a state which we have had a rather <em>rough</em> relationship with for the past ~60 years.</p>
<p>This brings us to the Fourth: Is President Donald Trump attempting to interfere with the investigation?</p>
<p>This is one of the points where Donald Trump could be hanging himself. If he interfered with the investigation into Russia as it relates to his campaign <em>or</em> current staff, then he would be committing a Obstruction of Justice <em>using</em> Presidential Power. Obstruction of Justice is a Felony, and justification for an impeachment.</p>
<p>Now, here's where things start looking like Trump has tied a noose around his own neck. He admitted on an interview that he fired Director Comey to try and make his Russia Investigation problems <em>go away</em>. That means that the Fourth question is almost certainly True. However, <strong>this means nothing at the moment.</strong></p>
<p>The United States Congress holds the power to Impeach a sitting President. Congress is the ultimate arbiter of whether or not the President has committed a Crime. If they choose not to file Articles of Impeachment, there's nothing that can be done.</p>
<p>It's safe to assume that Republicans <em>will not</em> impeach Trump in the short-term. Trump is still valuable to the Republican Party, since he's their key to holding onto the Rust Belt and a few other regions. <em>However</em>, Trump is also becoming increasingly radioactive as his presidency goes on. In the future, the Republican Party <em>may</em> consider  Trump <em>too toxic</em> to leave in Office... and trade him out for Mike Pence.</p>
<p>It's also safe to assume that Democrats <em>will not</em> impeach Trump if they win the Midterms. Trump has a combination of Impeachment and Assassination insurance in the form of his vice president, Mike Pence. Democrats <strong>do not</strong> like Trump, but they are likely to prefer him to Mike Pence. This is because Mike Pence is actually <em>competent</em> and <em>patient</em> enough to get things done. Of course, this whole situation changes if Mike Pence is implicated by the investigation as well. If they could impeach the VP and the P, then the Democrats might very well do it <em>if</em> they get control of the Congress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>
<p>Exactly how and to what extent did Russia hack into/meddle with the Presidential election?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much did the Trump administration know about/benefit from/collude with #1?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did Trump try to impede a true investigation into #1 and 2?</p>
</li>
<li>Who is leaking all the not supposed to be leaked info re: all of this?</li>
</ol>
<p>2 &amp; 3 could possibly lead to impeachment, depending on the politics. If Trump is impeached, we get President Pence, unless he turns out to be guilty as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three primary things - the election, Trump's appointments and attempts to give security clearances to &quot;compromised&quot; people, and Trump's obstruction of justice into the investigation over the first two things. That can lead to claims of perjury, witness tampering, and obstruction of justice. </p>
<p>The investigation into the election is trying to find out if Trump's campaign coordinated and worked with a foreign power (Russia) during the election, which could lead to various campaign finance law violations, a crime against conspiring with others to deprive people of the &quot;right to honest services&quot;, crimes against public corruption, and violation of the Campaign Reform Act of 2002 that makes foreign spending to influence a federal election a crime (and any American assisting with that would be charged too).  </p>
<p>For the appointments (stemming from Michael Flynn), the Logan Act bars private citizens from obstructing foreign relations (but never really gets used) - it's more likely that there will be charges of lying to FBI investigators and perjury regarding testimony to Congress, and charges of being and unregistered foreign lobbyist or agent. General &quot;failure to be honest&quot; crimes related to the need to make full and honest disclosures before getting appointments to government positions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The investigations are about the campaign and whether things were reported legally.  That's all about whether people were following rules, and ultimately won't affect the President much (I mean, he's practically a saint according to his followers.  He really was right that he could shoot someone on fifth avenue and his followers wouldn't care).</p>
<p>The bigger deal is if he told FBI Director Comey to stop investigating National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.  That would be obstruction of justice, and it's the exact thing that made Nixon resign (when he was trying to get the Watergate investigation stopped).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
