		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A number of countries are themselves corrupt or benefit from the IOC/FIFA corruption so they have no incentive to shut it down. Other countries are refusing to play their game. Just look at the bidding for the 2024 Winter Olympics, in which all the western democracies backed out and left the IOC stuck choosing between Kazakhstan and China. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly: They aren't government organisations and so they aren't governed by the same rules around corruption. </p>
<p>Secondly: They're such huge machines that replacing them is very difficult. It's like having a systemically corrupt police force, you can't just shut it down and start again, it needs to continue operating while being fixed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I mean, there is currently a large wide ranging criminal charges against a number of (now former) high level FIFA officials in US court.  They aren't going to force them to shut down the organization, since the US doesn't really have the jurisdiction to do so.  However, they can go after individuals who committed crimes within US jurisdiction (on US soil or involving US based banks).</p>
<p>So far, 34 people have been charged with crimes related to corruption in bidding processes.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I honestly don't mean to be flippant about this, but it could be reasonably argued that modern sporting spectacles are just another &quot;opiate of the masses&quot; - so why bother?</p>
<p>Alternatively - as you point out organisations like that are or at least have been investigated for corruption, so could they therefore not have the ability to make such investigations disappear?</p>
<p>Plus we have to remember that many organisations like those tend to either have no central base of operations - no 'home country', or deliberately set up base in countries that lack adequate motivation or legislation to tackle the problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
