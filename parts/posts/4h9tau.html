		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I didn't even know until recently that for at least a decade there has been something of a controversy over whether the effects of anti-depressant medications on depression can be chalked up entirely to placebo or not, sparked mainly by work by Irving Kirsch who seems to be on a bit of a crusade against anti-depressants. I had taken it for granted until now that obviously they must have some active effect.</p>
<p>I've tried to make sense of the controversy by reading what I can of Kirsch and the responses but a lot of it goes over my head. It seems like it's generally acknowledged that anti-depressants usually have a very modest effect except in extreme cases where they can have a serious effect? It's hard for me to find much actual sources on this to read however which are not the standard stuff about the evils of big pharma trying to poison our brains.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that a fairly recent literature review (Jay something, major journal) showed that antidepressants are slightly superior to placebo in cases of severe depression but no better than placebo for mild to moderate depression.
A prominent psychiatrist colleague of mine has come to terms with this by saying that he is OK prescribing antidepressants to moderately depressed people even if the benefit is largely or wholly placebo effect, since the placebo benefit is still a benefit, more helpful than no treatment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to start off saying that the current antidepressant drugs are really not good enough. They are actually a little less effective than the first generation (tricyclics), but the difference is that the newer drugs (SSRIs, SNRIs, bupropion, etc.) are just way safer. There is a drastic need for better drugs, but it is an area that few drug companies want to pursue since it's costly and hard for a variety of reasons which I'll try and get into.</p>
<p>The main issue is that mood disorders are inherently subjective.  It not like other drugs with a very clear &quot;we killed this&quot; or &quot;this symptom is clearly gone&quot;. There is no magic thing to detect to say &quot;I am not depressed anymore&quot;-- it's all a person telling you how they are feeling. Clinical trials for antidepressant drugs have constantly evolving protocols for trying to best control for the placebo effect and find if a drug has a real clinical benefit, but it's very, very difficult. Imagine how different you feel on a given day.  Imagine how someone suffering for awhile feels when they are given attention and treatment for the first time. Also imagine how different and widespread someone's version of &quot;feeling down&quot; is, including everyone's individual willpower and how that differs person-to-person. The variability and placebo effect from these trials is almost always high, making the needed effect from these drugs to also be very high.</p>
<p>This tells you that, yes, a lot of people do improve just from the attention and overall focus on their depression that they experience some improvement of symptoms (placebo effect). But the effect from the drug is usually larger. Many argue that this increase above placebo is not enough, but really, it's an increase above placebo incorporating the wide variety of depression symptoms and  subjective feelings of a very large group of people. </p>
<p>Imagine someone with very severe depression. There is much less variability in their day-to-day symptoms, so the effects of a drug would be much easier to spot if the drug had an effect. This is what more modern analyses of clinical trials will show, that the drugs seem to really only have a great effect on those with severe symptoms. But the key here is that they do show this effect often.</p>
<p>To answer your direct question, psychiatry definitely acknowledges the use of antidepressants because they are often shown to be effective in patients, regardless if they are only marginally more effective. More importantly, treating mood disorders using psychotherapy to help the patient deal with the &quot;source&quot; of the issue or create better patterns of behavior with or without the help of the medication is best.  </p>
<p>I'm an advocate for these drugs when psychotherapy alone or other lifestyle changes are not doing the trick. But these aren't amazing drugs and we desperately need better ones (this applies to almost all psych and neuro drugs).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something else to consider is that the efficacy of an anti-depressant or a placebo is based on the average across individuals. So you could have no statistical difference between groups, but that does not necessarily mean that anti-depressants are not more effective for some people <em>within</em> the groups. For instance, I saw a very recent study that reported anti-depressants and mindfulness mediation were equally effective at treating depression. But that does not necessarily mean they would be equally successful for any given individual. Just that on average, across individuals, they had similar success rates. The causes and mechanisms of depression are complex and variable, and therefore it's doubtful there'd be a one-size-fits-all treatment. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Late to the party, but I literally attended a lecture dealing with this issue today so here goes. I'm gonna split my response into two parts with a TL;DR at the bottom</p>
<p><strong>Do anti-depressants have positive clinical effects for patients being treated for depression?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There were numerous studies displaying effectiveness of the newer generations of antidepressants like Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI's from here on out).</li>
<li>There's a lot of money involved in anti-depressants because they are a long-term treatment for a serious and fairly common (~6.7% affected each year in Australia)^1 disease. The Kirsch paper looked to answer the question of whether there was a publication bias - was contradictory data submitted to the FDA simply not being published?</li>
<li>His meta-analysis combined unpublished data he obtained from the FDA as well as the published efficacy studies^2. He found what many people in this thread suggest - antidepressants are only substantially more effective than placebo treatment for people with severe depression. However, many scientists took issue with the way he conducted his analysis. When more modern statistics were applied to his raw data, the difference in effect <em>WAS</em> substantial enough to warrant treatment.^3 Also, his analysis lumped in all of the drugs together. When broken down separately certain drugs (Venlafaxine and Paroxetine) perform well above the threshold for efficacy and others (Fluoxetine and Nefazodone) perform below. <strong>While Kirsch's data has important implications, it's far from disproving all psychiatric prescription options</strong></li>
<li>The Jay C paper^4 mentioned by someone else in the comment thread is an analysis of 6 studies looking at 2 SSRI's. To my mind that simply isn't large enough to be a good representation of the entire field.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Depression: The Chemical Imbalance Model vs. The Neuroinflammatory Model</strong></p>
<p>The longstanding theoretical model for depression has been that a lack of serotonin or noradrenaline (also known as norepinephrine in the US) in the synapses in your brain prevents proper signal sending by neurons leading to depression. SSRI's treat this by blocking the re-uptake of serotonin by your neurons leading to more serotonin in the synapse, better brain function and better mood. There are a couple issues with this model:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unexplained long period before the drugs start to work. Other medications which work on the brain like aspirin can function within minutes to hours. Why do antidepressants typically take weeks to establish function? There is (to the best of my knowledge) no good explanation of this that is based on chemical imbalances in the brain.</p>
</li>
<li>There is no scientifically established baseline for what a 'good' chemical balance in the brain is, let alone what would constitute a 'bad' chemical balance.^5 This is despite decades of study and techniques which can fluorescently label and monitor such chemicals in the brain</li>
</ul>
<p>The evidence usually given for the chemical imbalance model is that the SSRI drugs work, and we have proven extensively that they do modify the chemical balance of the brain. However, this is kind of flawed reasoning. The fact that aspirin cures headaches is not proof that headache are caused by a lack of aspirin. It could be that other chemical actions of SSRI's are what cause their antidepressant effect - more on this below</p>
<p>This brings us to the neuroinflammatory model. Special cells in your brain, called microglia, are responsible for protecting your brain from any pathogens which get in there and cleaning up the debris from any dead cells. There's a substantial body of evidence to suggest that depression (at least for a large portion of patients) may be linked to the brain's immune system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cytokines are chemicals which are secreted by immune system cells as part of their function. There is an association between levels of these cytokines in the brain and long-term depression.^6 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chemical markers of inflammation (like cytokines) have been showed to be increased in post-mortem studies of people who suffered from depression.^7</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cytokines can cause depression-like symptoms including sleep changes, social withdrawal, fatigue and impaired psychomotor function^8</p>
</li>
<li>There are studies dating back a long time (I'm getting lazy and CBF finding them now but it's not hard) which link early antidepressants like monoamine oxidase inhibitors to inhibition of inflammatory cell functions. Similar studies have been done to link SSRI's to decreased immune function as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, is this to say that the chemical imbalance model is shit and the neuroinflammatory model has all the answers? Not really, the brain generally and depression specifically are incredibly complex. We're making progress all the time, but much remains to be discovered and understood. The point I want to make is that the anti-depressant function of SSRI's and other modern antidepressant drugs may simply be the result of a side effect on the brain's immune system rather than anything to do with chemical reuptake in neurons (their actual function). This would explain why they have much lower clinical efficacy than many modern drugs, and offer options for future research into much more effective antidepressants. I hope someone actually made it through this wall of text, my hands are tired.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR Some modern antidepressants <em>definitely</em> do have a positive impact on patients with depression, though data indicates not all of them do. However, the reason for this effect may be different from the conventional (and advertised) theory on depression.</strong></p>
