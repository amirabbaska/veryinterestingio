		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Atmospheric scientist here. I can explain what people mean when they talk about the &quot;quiet period&quot;.</p>
<p>The last time the U.S. was hit by a major hurricane (defined as category 3 or higher on the wind-based <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php" target="_blank">Saffir-Simpson</a> scale) was <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/h2005_wilma.html" target="_blank">Wilma</a> in 2005. The U.S. has been hit by destructive hurricanes since then, including Ike, Irene, and Sandy, but these were all either category 1 or 2 when they made landfall. So the &quot;quiet period of major hurricane activity&quot; that you are referring to is the 11 year period after Wilma during which no hurricane made landfall on U.S. soil <em>while at category 3+ intensity</em>. Matthew has also ended a 9 year period with no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Category_5_Atlantic_hurricanes" target="_blank">category 5 storms in the Atlantic basin</a> - the previous cat 5 storm being Felix in 2007.</p>
<p>Tropical cyclone activity is very complex. It is influenced by planetary-scale oscillations in climate - e.g., <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/impacts-el-ni%C3%B1o-and-la-ni%C3%B1a-hurricane-season" target="_blank">ENSO</a> (El Nino/La Nina), the <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/what-mjo-and-why-do-we-care" target="_blank">Madden-Julian Oscillation</a>, and some others. Hurricane Matthew is not <em>in itself</em> an indicator that we are going to see an increase in tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic in the near future (this year or coming years). You would need to look at the overall conditions that favor hurricane formation (low wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures, overall heat content in the upper ocean, etc.). The relationship between hurricanes and climate variables is receiving a lot of attention, especially in the future as climate change fucks shit up.</p>
<p>That's about the best explanation I can give. After all I don't study hurricanes, I study air quality. Now who wants to hear about ozone formation?!?!? ^Anyone?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to the National Hurricane Center:<br />
The 1968-2015 average is 11.8 named storms, 6.2 hurricanes, 2.4 major hurricanes.<br />
The 2006-2015 average is 14 named storms, 6.3 hurricanes, 2.6 major hurricanes.<br />
It looks to me that the last 11 years have been exactly what you'd expect from North Atlantic hurricane formation. So what exactly makes you think the last 11 years have been &quot;super quiet&quot;?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a couple of years after hurricane Katrina hit, the southeast still saw a few hurricanes that hit pretty hard. Hurricanes Ivan, Gustav, and Rita come to mind. I was kind of young and don't really remember much about it, but Gustav was worse where I lived than Katrina. Maybe they didn't get as much media coverage, but they still happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that the frequency of hurricanes has always been predicted to either remain the same or even decline in climate models, while the intensity of the most intense storms should go up â€” see e.g. the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch10s10-es-13-tropical-cyclones.html" target="_blank">AR4 IPCC report here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most recent published modelling studies investigating tropical storm frequency simulate a decrease in the overall number of storms, though there is less confidence in these projections and in the projected decrease of relatively weak storms in most basins, with an increase in the numbers of the most intense tropical cyclones.</p>
