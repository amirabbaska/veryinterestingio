		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons: summer days are longer near the poles compared to the tropics, meaning more time for activity; and springtime sees an absolute explosion of food resources (insect and plant population growth) so the birds that fly back north get access to it, whereas the birds that would stay down south continue having to compete for a standard amount of resources.</p>
<p>Basically, seasonal variation makes for some months with an overabundance of food (ie spring) and some months with a dearth of food (ie winter). They fly south to avoid the lack of food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question. </p>
<p>The other comment about long summer hours in the north is a pretty good point. Where I live we get about 18 hours of sun on the longest day of the summer. Of course that means we only get 4 hours of sun in the shortest day of winter, but hey, plants can't grow in the snow anyway.</p>
<p>While people have this idea that the north is a sort of ecological wasteland, its really not. That is an old idea tied to agrarian lifestyles.  ie: if it's not good farmland, it's useless. That isn't true. </p>
<p>The north, the boreal/taiga forest and tundra, are rich in flora and food, and this is evident in the extremely large animals you'll find, like moose, polar bears, grizzly bears, brown bears, wolves, cougars, musk ox, walruses, seals, elk, and so on. For avians, there are large species too, like trumpeter swans, eagles, snowy owls. </p>
<p>Big animals need lots of food, so their presence in the north tells a tale.</p>
<p>Even the mosquitoes and flies get into the act. There are huge black swarms of them at times, and in certain places.</p>

<p>For an enterprising and hungry animal, the north is a table full of food. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theyâ€™re basically chasing new sources of food. If they stayed in one place all the time they would eat all of the bugs/fish/algae/etc. and their population would experience a die off due to lack of food. By continually moving North and South during the year they eat a little here, once things get scarce they move along, and by the time they return to that area their food supply has replenished. They also have breeding grounds they return to for nesting, and they stick around there long enough to hatch their eggs and get their offspring mobile before beginning another migration. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some birds <em>do</em> stay where it's warmer all the time.</p>
<p>In Rochester, MN there's a man-made lake called Silver Lake. It stays warm all year round, and the town ended up with <a href="https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/121512/Daniel%20Eckberg%20Thesis%20sp10.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank">a resident population of huge Canada geese</a> who decided it wasn't worth migrating.</p>
<p>Then there's the grackle population of Texas. They're supposed to be migratory birds, but huge flocks of them hang out near the grocery stores of Dallas and Austin all year round.</p>
<p>So it's a tradeoff birds make depending on specific circumstances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If all of the birds stayed near the equator, then eventually they would have to compete for food and other resources (which means less chance of survival). One of my favorite teachers explained evolution as always &quot;following the path of least resistance&quot; meaning that if a species exhibits some extremely strange behavior, it is because survival was harder the other way<em>. So even though migration is taxing on the birds that go south, it would be even harder for them to survive if they tried to stick around all winter.<br />
</em>Or they are trying to attract a mate</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
