		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clingstone peaches are a variety where the pulp sticks to the seed, or &quot;stone.&quot;  Freestone peaches are the variety that pull free of the pulp.  There are many different types, but those are the two main categories.</p>
<p>Edit: For further clarification, the differences in the the two main varietals is found in the amount of water soluble pectin (a natural binder) found naturally in both chains.  Clingstones have more water insoluble pectins that bind the &quot;stone&quot; to the flesh while the pectin found in Freestones is more soluble leaving the flesh less tightly attached.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They were bred that way.  They are two different categories of peach, with many different types of each category below that.</p>
<p>Clingstone peaches flavor and texture hold up better for canning and commercial processing, and freestone varieties are easier to eat and therefore more popular to sell in grocery stores.  </p>
<p>Freestone peaches picked before they are fully ripe can be a bit clingy still, but a cling varietal will never ripen into a freestone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference between a freestone and a clingstone is when they’re harvested. Peaches harvested earlier have clingstones; peaches harvested later in the season are freestone. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of varietals on the market. Different varieties, even if grown in the same region, will mature at different times. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
