		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typical non-english disclaimer: sorry for destroying your language; I am french Canadian.  </p>
<p>Edit: In this example, I am referring to a 5V usb cellphone charger. However, this applies to most <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zrPuH.jpg" target="_blank">chargers</a>.</p>
<p>A wall charger is basically three components (before someone start to bash on me, I understand modern switching setup may have different designs, but understand this is ELI5).  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>A step down converter (convert 100-240V to something like 7-9V)  </li>
<li>A AC-DC converter (Wall electricity to battery like electricity)  </li>
<li>A regulator  </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, you have 3 components, with different roles that work together.  </p>
<p>Electricity coming from the wall (also called &quot;Main&quot;) has to be converted from its original state, which is &quot;vibrating&quot; at 50-60 hertz and could be anywhere from 100V to 260V (main is actually not regulated, so it may vary a little during the day, and depending the area you are). To give you a rough idea what 60hz is, it's the ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ sound an old neon makes.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is much easier to work with smaller voltages than high voltages, specially when confined in the small area of a wall charger. Since we want to end with low voltage, we start that way to simplify the rest of the circuit. That is the job of the step down converter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the step down converter has lowered the voltage to something, say, 7-9 volts, we want to turn the AC (vibrating) electricity to DC (continuous). This is usually done by a single inexpensive part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once we have low voltage DC power, we simply need to regulate it. This is where the regulator comes in. The job of this part is to control the flow of electricity in order to maintain a constant voltage  (5V in our case) across load. This means that regardless if your phone is connected or not, the output of the wall charger will &quot;always&quot; be 5V.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, to answer your question, if you leave your charger disconnected, your regulator simply keep a 5V on it, wasting a ridiculously tiny amount of electricity (1-5 cent a year depending the pricing of electricity in your area). Some smart chargers may have a sleep mode, turning themselves off completely unless connected. Regardless, a properly designed wall charger will never suffer any damage from staying disconnected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people have asked what was the whistle that could be heard when the phone was full or disconnected from the charger. This is what we call &quot;coil whine&quot;. Basically, a switching regulator works by pulsing electricity through a coil, which create an magnetic field. Under very low load, the pulse becomes &quot;slower&quot; (simplified), which makes the coil vibrate in a frequency we can hear. High quality manifacturers will fix that by gluing the coil during assembly, or using a higher frequency regulator. Regardless, this is not an indicative of a failing device, you can still use it without any issue.  </p>
<p>BTW, this is my first comment on ELI5, I hope it's clear enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wall adapters and chargers are almost always AC to DC adapters. What they do is take the electricity in the wall and change it from whatever periodically-changing voltage is standard in your country (AC) into a constant voltage (DC) of a certain amount. A simple way to do this is to change the voltage with a transformer and then force it to always move in the same direction. A more complicated (but more efficient) way to do this is to store it as a magnetic field for a very small fraction of a second and then bring it back as the correct voltage. In either case, the final voltage is regulated by capacitors which store energy and try to keep the voltage steady.</p>
<p>Well, that's the ELI5 version of it.</p>
<p>Anyway, theoretically an AC to DV converter circuit shouldn't draw any energy out of the capacitors which keep the voltage steady when there's nothing plugged into it, but in reality it's not so simple. The components that make up the circuit are imperfect which means it will always use a little bit of energy when plugged in. In addition, many power bricks have a LED on them which shows that it's plugged in, meaning that you always have some tangible amount of power being used.</p>
<p>TL;DR: It will always use a small amount of power when plugged in, but you won't harm the adapter by doing so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your wall power will be brought in to the converter, pass through a step down transformer, rectified using a bridge rectifier, filtered and the resulting DC voltage will be regulated to 5vdc then stored in the output capacitor. </p>
<p>The resulting power is potential.  If there is no current draw the unit will not be using the power, it just sits there at the ready. No harm is being done at this point. The components are barely working until current is pulled. </p>
<p>But there is usually a led installed on these power bricks which will pull come current. Negligible amounts but some all the same. </p>
