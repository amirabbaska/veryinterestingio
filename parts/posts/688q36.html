		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>-0 K. No, that's not a typo.</p>
<p>So every answer that you've gotten here concerning the Planck Temperature or the motion of atoms is, bluntly, dead wrong. This is because temperature <strong>does not</strong> correlate directly with motion; that approximation only works on the lower end of the temperature scale, and is a result of the way in which we typically measure temperature. Bear with me cause this gets <strong>weird</strong>, but is the correct answer (inb4 muh 5 year olds).</p>
<p>The <em>actual</em> way in which temperature is defined is through the interrelationship between a piece of matters' entropy (a measure of how &quot;disordered&quot; or &quot;useless&quot; it is, for lack of a better word), and its energy (which would include its motion). Don't worry about precisely what entropy is (that is honestly and ELI5 in-and-of-itself, and involves one of the more sorcerous scientific fields that confuses the hell out of everyone who studies it), just take it on faith that it's just a measurable thermodynamic quantity. If you're familiar with calculus, the actual definition is;</p>
<p>T=dU/dS ~ ΔU/ΔS</p>
<p>where U and S are the energy and entropy, respectively, and ΔU and ΔS are the <em>changes</em> in those quantities as you increase the temperature (or, more accurately, temperature is caused by how those two changes occur alongside one another).</p>
<p>Starting at the low end of the temperature scale, as you increase an objects temperature, you gradually increase its entropy <em>and</em> its energy, but the entropy increase actually starts to diminish as you get to higher and higher temperatures. This is why temperature increases, mathematically; for constant steps of dU, the dS gets smaller, and so you're dividing a given number (say, 1) by another number that's getting smaller and smaller with each step you take. Thus, there is a given state where you add some finite amount of energy, and the entropy change is near zero. At this point, you're approaching a temperature of infinite, as the dU is basically not changing, while the dS is getting smaller and smaller, approaching zero.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/578/024/a8c.jpg" target="_blank">Now lets get weird</a>; give it more energy, and the entropy will <strong>decrease</strong>. Thus, you'll have the same dU, divided by a <em>negative</em> and very small dS, giving you a temperature approaching <em>negative infinite K</em>. Give it even more energy, and the dS term (while still negative) continues to get smaller and smaller in magnitude; thus, as you heat the object more and more, the temperature decreases in magnitude. Eventually, you reach a state where the entropy decrease becomes arbitrarily large, thus you get a finite dU divided by a really big dS, which will approach -0. As a result, the hottest possible temperature is -0 K, and the ordering from coldest to hottest is as follows;</p>
<p>0 K &lt; 300 K &lt; ∞ K &lt; -∞ K &lt; -300 K &lt; -0 K</p>
<p>This has shown up in both advanced thermodynamics and quantum mechanics, and has also been <a href="http://physicscentral.com/explore/action/negative-temperature.cfm" target="_blank">experimentally verified.</a></p>
<p>It's important to note that this is a screwy scale that makes a lot of the math we use fall apart, but this is largely due to the fact that our entire concept of temperature, and how we measure it, is actually hilariously complicated and flawed (although still very useful, because you don't see those negative temperatures in your day-to-day existence).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems that the highest possible known temperature is 142 nonillion kelvins (10e32 K.). This is the highest temperature that we know of according to the standard model of particle physics, which is the physics that underlies and governs our universe. Beyond this, physics starts to breakdown. This is known as Planck Temperature.</p>

<p>At that point the light wave coming off the object would reach what we think is the smallest possible size. after that you are in blackhole country.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are also two things known as heat (or enthalpy) of fusion and vaporization.</p>
<p>If you heat water in a pot on the stove, that water will never exceed 212 Degrees F (assuming pure water at one atmosphere of pressure.) Additional heat added to the pot will be spent converting the water to steam. The amount of heat required for this transition is known as the 'heat of vaporization.'</p>
<p>(There are situations where you can 'superheat' water or other substance so that it exists at a temperature above its boiling point, but those are outside the scope of this conversation.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
