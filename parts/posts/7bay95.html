<blockquote>
<p>Sort of. Any system which is linear, meaning that the sum of two solutions is, itself, a solution, will exhibit constructive and destructive interference. The field equations for gravity aren't exactly linear, so two waves that meet will interact non-trivially. However, we see gravitational waves specifically when studying small perturbations of the gravitational field, under which the field equations are very close to linear. This type of approximation is called &quot;linearization&quot;.
In short, the behavior of gravitational waves is very close to that of electromagnetic waves, except for small non-trivial interactions.</p>

Gravity waves and gravitational waves are two different things. I just saw people mentioning them interchangeably, and thought I'd make a note of it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity waves are small. <em>Very</em> small.</p>
<p>While a gravity wave has a huge wavelength (somewhere between tens and hundreds of kilometers all the way up to the width of the entire universe), its amplitude, or the amount that it moves up and down, is so small that you need extremely sensitive detectors to notice it.</p>
<p>To detect them at all, the scientists at LIGO used extremely sensitive lasers and mirrors. These mirrors are quite possibly the smoothest objects in the entire universe. The lasers are fired through two 4 km long tunnels that run in perpendicular directions. The whole observatory is precise enough to measure a change in the distance of the lasers that is less than a ten-thousandth the charge diameter of a proton. <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/facts" target="_blank">This is equivalent to measuring the distance from Earth to Alpha Centauri to within the width of a single human hair.</a></p>
<p>Now, since they are waves, two gravity waves intersecting <em>would</em> cause periods of larger movement called <a href="https://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Atmosphere/tornado/beat.html" target="_blank">constructive interference</a> and destructive interference. Sadly, <strong>doubling a wave that is roughly one ten-thousandth the size of a proton is still not much.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are these gravitational waves affected by gravity? Does it matter if they go through our sun for example, or what about a black hole? If gravity is the curvature of spacetime, do they follow it like a photon would or do they do kind of their own thing?</p>
<p>I guess what's confusing me is the part where they are caused by black holes colliding, so they kinda come from beyond the event horizon as that's where the mass causing them is located... </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
