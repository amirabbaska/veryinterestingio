<p>Does the number of times new cuttings are taken have any effect downline? How long have reliably documented lines been maintained? </p></div></div>

<p>Started with 1 seed, took 5 clones and then 5 clones of those clones and so on.</p>
<p>After around 10 generations I started to see mutations like extra growths, weird looking leaves (extra points or less points than a normal leaf) etc.</p>
<p>Some of these mutations were better than others and I bred those strains specifically and noticed the mutations got better/worse as the next clones grew.</p>
<p>Can't speak for other plants etc but Cannabis definitely can have mutations via continued cloning over multiple generations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Since seedless edible bananas are a genetic variation that is propagated from cuttings, and are one of the oldest domesticated plants, these would likely be in the running.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Citrus clones are interesting in this regard. Most citrus, especially culinary types, are closely related. Being highly self-fertile, it would be relatively easy to make a land race that looked and tasted the same; as opposed to apples, which for uniformity sake, a cultivar is much more practical.</p>
<p>However, citrus often take a long time to first fruit when propagated from seed. Often a decade or more. When citrus grafts are used the graft is part of a tree much older than the root stock, and has already matured to first fruit. This means the grafted trees start bearing fruit in one to three years, opposed to one to three decades.</p>
<p>Another interesting clonal plant that humans use is the German iris. The root, known as Orris root is used in perfumes and artificial fruit flavors like grape and raspberry. Some cultivars of it, that are still grown commercially today in Europe, are thousands of years old and go back to Roman empire and ancient Greek times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Because there was only one original tree any seed from the fruit it produces are hybrids and don't taste the same so cuttings are used instead.

<p>Asexual propagation is still subject to genetic mutation. </p>
<p>PS: Cuttings are not artificial. They can happen in nature, a bird can chew off a piece of stem or a branch, some drops down and continues to grow. Similar with a larger animal brushing past and breaking part of the plant off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
