		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I watched a documentary a while vack that interviewed someone doing a study on yhis.. or maybe it was a radiolab? Id love if someone knows what im talking about..</p>
<p>Anyway they scanned folks with an fmri and read controcersial statements to them. Their responses mirrored that of a person undergoing a physical attack.</p>
<p>If anyone has more info id greatly appreciate it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is known as the backfire effect.</p>
<p>If you provide someone with information that contradicts their known belief they can become more confident in their own belief. The brain registers this in the same way that it registers pain. This actually activates the fight or flight response, which is a reason people can become physically aggressive or flee the conversation when there is a disagreement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read a study once that found it takes 5 to 10 times the effort, and required different means of reinforcement, to convince someone that something they &quot;learned&quot; was false.  The study said it didn't matter if they thought the original fact was important or not... people still had the same unlearning bias.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a whole boatload of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_mechanisms" target="_blank">defense mechanisms</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias" target="_blank">cognitive biases</a> that are related to updating (or, indeed, avoiding to update) beliefs in the face of conflicting information. People are quite good at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias" target="_blank">favoring information that confirms their beliefs and ignoring contradictory data</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance" target="_blank">Cognitive dissonance</a>, the state of being aware of conflicting thoughts and having to resolve the conflict somehow, is uncomfortable and stressful, and the brain avoids it as much as possible. One of the main defense mechanisms is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmentalization_(psychology\)" target="_blank">compartmentalization</a> where we just put conflicting beliefs into separate mental boxes and avoid thinking about them simultaneously. Other well-known coping mechanisms include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial" target="_blank">denial</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimisation_(psychology\)" target="_blank">minimization</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection" target="_blank">projection</a>.</p>
<p>There's actually a fascinating neurological condition, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia" target="_blank">anosognosia</a>, where due to brain damage a patient may lose awareness of their body and argue against all evidence that their paralyzed limb, for instance, functions completely normally. When asked to do something with a paralyzed arm, like pick up an object, they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation" target="_blank">confabulate</a> a reason why they don't want to do it right now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Definitely look into confirmation bias - we tend to, through many different methods, accept the information presented to us that aligns with our beliefs and reject the information that does not align with our beliefs. Even if we’re shown evidence. It’s thought that this is (partially) because we’re lazy as hell and don’t want to take the time to actually think about something enough to change our minds about it.</p>
<p>A little more general than what you’re talking about, but there are definitely lots of pop psych articles and books about it that are easy to read and comprehend</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
