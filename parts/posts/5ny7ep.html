		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They weren't all introduced at the same time, and therefore have to compete with each-other for market share.</p>
<p>Originally there was only flat-head, this is because you can make a flat-head screw and driver very easily. Before there were different types of screws, they called the driver a &quot;Turnscrew&quot;</p>
<p>Then somebody thought to themselves &quot;If there were two slots, like an X then the Turnscrew would be a bit harder to make but wouldn't slide out of the screw all the time. (this guys name was probably Phillips, not actually sure though)</p>
<p>This idea worked quite well and so there were now two standards. They both co-exist because X is definitely better to work with, but the slot is always going to be cheaper and easier to make.</p>
<p>Eventually a third person decided that the way that Phillips pops out if you apply too much torque is sub-optimal, so they came up with Robertson (Square type) This system managed to catch on quite well, but not become very widespread. This type is a little more expensive to make the screws than Phillips, but a little cheaper to make the drivers too.</p>
<p>Now we have three competing standards. All of which have their strengths and weaknesses. All of which are able to take a viable slice of the market and compete with each-other.</p>
<p>The other standards you've mentioned all came into the market in a similar manner, but I'm telling the story of the big three types because it's way simpler to explain the concept that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest screw head, the flat head, allows your tool to slide out at the slightest misalignment. Phillips heads solved that problem, but introduced another: the screws strip easily when the driver cams out due to excessive torque. Newer designs have different balances of torque protection, size, manufacturing ease, etc.</p>
<p>You also have a bit of this going on:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of reasons, and many other answers have hit the high points. In general, &quot;sophisticated machinery&quot; means &quot;it's more expensive to make.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Flathead&quot; screws were created first because they're the easiest to make and didn't require sophisticated machinery.</li>
<li>&quot;Phillips head&quot; screws were created later because it takes more sophisticated machining to create them. They're easier to screw in than flat heads, but can be subject to &quot;stripping&quot; that makes reuse impossible.
<ul>
<li>They are, by design, subject to a problem called &quot;cam-out&quot;, that means the screwdriver might slip and stop applying force. In good Phillips screws, this stops you from over-tightening the screws. In cheap Phillips screws, this makes it impossible to properly tighten them without stripping.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;Robertson&quot; screws were created to deal with the stripping problems of Phillips heads, but take more sophisticated machinery to create.</li>
<li>Torx and Hex screws are alternate ways to try and address the problems with Phillips heads, and also require sophisticated machinery. (I think it's possible Torx was trademarked
<ul>
<li>Robertson, Torx, and Hex are more resistant to &quot;cam-out&quot;. That means you're less likely to strip them, but you can also over-tighten them without a more sophisticated screwdriver designed to prevent over-tightening.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A few other head types exist and are called &quot;security bits&quot;. The goal here is either to make a screw few people will have a screwdriver to turn, or in some cases make it very difficult to unscrew the screw without causing damage. These are for applications like public restroom stalls, where you don't want vandals to unscrew your screws. Common security bits have tri-wing, square, and triangular heads, but many tighten-only screws have drivers that look sort of like bottle openers.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the reasons so many heads exist are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some screws are really cheap to make, and the cheapest possible solution will always exist even if it's very bad.</li>
<li>Some screws were designed to be easier to use than the cheaper ones, but are more expensive and have varying problems with over-tightening or stripping.</li>
<li>Some screws are designed in the hopes that you don't have a screwdriver for them, so you don't mess with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's sort of why a lot of car mechanisms use different screws on one part. The manufacturer is trying to make it so the average person with a cheap toolset won't be able to properly disassemble and reassemble the mechanisms. But the licensed, &quot;qualified&quot; mechanic's shop will have all of the necessary tools. Don't ask me why they tend to replace all of the screws with inferior, half-broken ones. That probably has to do with the &quot;cheaper&quot; reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different tools for different jobs.</p>
<p>A standard screw is simplest and works will with hand tools.</p>
<p>A Phillips screw is good with a machine driver, because it is less likely to slip.</p>
<p>A Torx screw is less likely to slip than a Phillips, so it is better when a screw has to be really tight, but it is harder to align initially.</p>
<p>A hex screw is good when you are selling assemble yourself furniture and way to provide a single cheap tool that can do all the work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The older ones are simpler to make the screw and the tool.</p>
<p>As machining methods have improved we've been able to design more complex screws/drivers to overcome the flaws in the old designs.</p>
<p>The old designs are still used because they are very inexpensive to make and there are no licensing fees associated with the design.</p>
