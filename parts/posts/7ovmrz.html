		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your feet are cold, but that doesn't mean your body is cold, and the only temperature your body cares about is your core body temperature. So you made your core warmer than it likes, so it sweats, even your feet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anyone at all curious about OP's question, core temperature regulation, navy SEALs, or all three, will enjoy this video.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTKPWpx89No" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTKPWpx89No</a></p>
<p>They test Stew Smith's ability to regulate his temperature in a tank full of ice water (they keep dumping more bags of ice in).  He's able to maintain his core temperature (vs extremities) much more effectively than average test subjects, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4RSA75h.png" target="_blank">as they monitor it via thermal imaging</a>, and they speculate on whether he learned to do this as a SEAL, or whether he already had this ability and it's part of why he was able to become a SEAL.</p>
<p>They also have him run a short obstacle course before and immediately after they freeze him in an hour's worth of ice water.  He actually does better afterward (slightly slower but his shooting is more accurate).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone else said, core body temperature. Actually your head temperature also has a major effect. Wool socks is the best solution. Actually had to explain this to a coworker today who was talking about how he had frozen sweat on his feet after a day of hunting in -20 weather. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is an interesting metabolic response to cold hands and feet being warmed called the Lewis Hunting Response (or Reaction). LHR can be used by outdoors people to mitigate against the effects of cold... I use LHR for winter kiteboarding with bare feet and hands - essentially immersion till they are freezing, then rewarming, then I am good to go.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
