<p>edit:  There are a lot of great replies and I learned a lot about the stock market and the economy in general. It seems the biggest thing I learned is that there isn't a convenient answer but a complex network of interrelated forces beyond any one person's control. Still reading and soaking it in!</p></div></div>
