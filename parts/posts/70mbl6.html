<p>An example: Let's say that we have a curtain of said liquid. If I stand on one side of it, and quickly am to walk to the other side, and looked through the curtain, would I then see a past reflection of myself, one which stands on the other side of the curtain?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As has been said, light in a medium can be slowed down dramatically, with the most famous examples being in Bose-Einstsein Condensates (BECs).  I just want to add a little niggling issue, which is that you can't see light at all take a path that isn't into your eye.  Hollywood has us primed, for example, to think we can see laser beams, but in reality the only way you can see laser beams is to be directly in its beam or if the room is so filled with crap (i.e. dust, chalk, mist, etc.) for the laser light to hit that enough light is being scattered OUT of the beam and some of it scattering out into your eye.</p>
<p>So we think lasers look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scienceabc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Green-Red-laser-beam.jpg" target="_blank">https://www.scienceabc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Green-Red-laser-beam.jpg</a></p>
<p>which really only happens in a smoke filled room.  And, for example, military grade &quot;laser-based&quot; weapons (skip ahead to about 1:13):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLwqWBtmUEc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLwqWBtmUEc</a></p>
<p>don't look like anything.  The ship just bursts into flames.</p>
<p>The reason I bring this up is because the goal of &quot;seeing something interesting while not physically sticking your head into the Bose-Einstein Condensate/laser path&quot; is at odds with the goal of &quot;keeping light within the fancy medium&quot;.  Which is not to say no light escapes such experiments (it does and can be detected with finely tuned instruments), but rather that a &quot;visually interesting&quot; show to the human eye, means you're doing the experiment REALLY poorly (and, in fact, it may not even work).</p>

<p>Yes, this can and does happen.  It's really not a whole lot different than hearing a radio echo of a radio transmission.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no theoretical limit to how slow you can make light. Researchers have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_light" target="_blank">slowed, and even temporarily stopped</a> light using exotic materials such as Bose-Einstein condensates.  So in principle, with this material, you could indeed walk around a piece of it faster than light can propagate through it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
