		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cognitive psychologist here: The basic idea is that you have a specific amount of attention your brain can pay to things. If you do not fill up your attentional resources yourself by choosing to focus on certain things then things in the environment will. If you think of a time where you were really engaged in your work that nothing in the environment (bar something crazy) would have distracted you then you were in a state of &quot;flow&quot; and your attention tank was completely full. This happens most when you have to put a lot of attention into something thus you are consciously controlling, and focusing all your attentional resources on the task. When you are lying in bed trying to fall asleep, you are using very little of your attentional resources meaning any noise or distraction in the environment, or any random thoughts you have will easily get your attention. Some people struggle with this as they just start to think about many things and find it difficult to sleep.</p>
<p>Putting background noise like TV shows on helps to control your mental resources as now you are leaving less room for those intrusive, anxious thoughts. More of your tank of attention span is being taken up by either listening/watching the TV show OR by your brain working in the background to block out the noise so you can sleep. This blocking task focuses your brain away from anxious thoughts and can calm some people. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a noise wakes you up in the night, it's not the noise itself that wakes you up, per se, but the sudden change or inconsistencies in noise that jar you. White noise creates a masking effect, blocking out those sudden changes that frustrate light sleepers, or people trying to fall asleep. &quot;The simple version is that hearing still works while you're asleep,&quot; </p>
<p>Of course, not everyone needs [white] noise. In some people, the masking effect of white noise can do the exact opposite of what it does for most people--actually increasing sensitivity to underlying sounds.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While white noise is indeed monotonous and can mask out other noise, the sound of TV is quite different. There can be music, talking, silence, sudden changes in rhythm, or anything really.</p>
<p>I've found that there are certain people who particularly require the sound of TV or the sound of traffic to fall asleep, and other types of sound, like white noise, won't do it for them. It's not just any kind of noise that some people need, but very particular kinds of sound.</p>
<p>My theory is that those who need TV to fall asleep may have grown up in homes where parents would watch TV late into the night while the child slept. So they came to associate the sound of TV with the comfort of being home and their parents being around as a source of comfort. To them, silence would mean that no one is home or that the parents are sleeping - leaving them vulnerable and unprotected against whatever a child may be afraid of. Then this gets carried over into adulthood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For me, silence is deafening and feels unnatural. Even in the country, in a quiet place there is always some noise. A cricket, a frog, the breeze through grass, a bird chirping... there's always something. </p>
<p>I personally sleep with the tv on as it helps me to distract myself into sleep. If I don't have some sort of noise around me, I think too much too easily, and then I can't relax. I also have issues from childhood trauma that mean I find complete darkness and silence at night frightening. I'm sure the reason is unique for everyone...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always go to sleep with re runs of old shows playing (cheers,  friends, Frasier and a few actiony ones too ). It's not really a &quot;calming&quot; thing  so much as a distracting thing. </p>
<p>I've seen every episode of those shows so many times, that even with the screen covered or off i can picture what's happening by the sounds/dialogue. It's kinda like falling asleep watching tv, but it's in my head and there's no light from the screen to keep me up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
