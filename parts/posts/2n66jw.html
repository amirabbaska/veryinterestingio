<p>Science is all about experiment and then creating the framework to understand the math behind it, sure, but it's not like we're capable of near-lightspeed travel yet, nor do we have tons of huge gravity wells to play with, nor did we have GPS satellites to verify things like time dilation with at the time.</p>
<p>All we ever hear about are his <em>gedanken</em> thought experiments, and so there's this general impression that Einstein was just some really smart dude spitballing some intelligent ideas and then made some math to describe it, and then suddenly we find that it consistently explains so much. </p>
<p>How can he do this without experiment? Or were there experiments he used to derive his equations?</p></div></div>
