		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because there are no laws that govern the entirety of the internet. There are laws in countries that limit what the people living inside of its borders can do with the internet, but those laws dont apply if you arent in that country. All pirate bay has to do to stay operational is to find a country that doesn't care about copyright and doesn't care enough about the world stage to extradite them. Russia or SE Asian countries usually do the job quite well. The best part is that the owners dont even have to live in those countries, they just have to host the servers in those countries and the likely hood of an investigation finding anything is near zero. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are relatively cheap to start up and maintain but very expensive to investigate, gather evidence against and shut down permanently (see above).</p>
<p>The government whose jurisdiction in which it is hosted probably doesn't see enough financial/political incentive to warrant even discussing an investigation.</p>
<p>If you think copyright piracy is bad consider tens of thousands of Canadians have been buying illegal marijuana online for years. No dark web, no VPN, no crypto currency. Some sites have even been featured on TV news! Some have been raided but another four take it's place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The PirateBay specifically uses <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a> as their front-end. So you communicate with Cloudflare, not ThePirateBay web servers directly. </p>
<p>Anyone who wants can download the entirety of the TPB site and host it themselves. So when one TPB back-end &quot;mirror&quot; is shut down, the IP is simply updated in Cloudflare to point to another back-end mirror hosted somewhere else. When that is shut down, another springs up. It's like playing whack-a-mole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically because they evolved their site to become unstoppable. Their storage requirements are so small that anyone with a computer can run a copy of their site in it's entirety and become another mirror if one decided to do so. They even changed their logo showing the Hydra head to make this point. Their site is unstoppable but that doesn't mean they guys that started it got free without repercussions. </p>
<p>Documentary where you can understand how they got cought and some had to run away to different countries. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly if content makers, especially film and music peeps just put stuff out at the same time globally and at a reasonable and realistic price, the need for piracy would drop. There's been numerous studies that show access to content is the chief reason for piracy. </p>
<p>I'm not just talking current content either. Old films, old albums, indie, mainstream and everything in between. I know it's a legal minefield with distribution deals, copyright laws and what not, but instead of ignoring the issues and complaining about piracy, they should all look at the regulations, lobby the appropriate governing bodies and get this shit streamlined. As it is the horse has already bolted, so the longer they wait to act in a positive fashion, the harder it will be to catch it, if ever. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
