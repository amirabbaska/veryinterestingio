		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If i drop a ball on the ground, every atom that composes the earth is instantly impacting the strength which with the ball is pulled to the earths mass.</p>
<p>A relationship between a single atom on the other side of the planet and the ball dropped is formed as if in an instant.</p>
<p>If you have spiral arms of a galaxy, the strength which with the arm is pulled to the center is a summary of every atom of that galaxy.</p>
<p>I could go on for hours talking about these absurd effects at a distances far larger than light can cover but somehow is instantly calculated by mass and gravity.</p>
<p>How is gravity not faster than the speed of light?</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the responses everyone, this was awesome.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very perceptive question.</p>
<p>You have touched on one of the fundamental flaws of Newtonian gravity: the fact that it is &quot;non-local&quot;.</p>
<p>We know that the speed of light must be constant in all frames of reference, and yet Newton's formulation of gravity requires that gravitating bodies <em>instantaneously</em> know where everything else is, as you mention in your question.</p>
<p>So one of the motivators of general relativity was to develop a <em>local</em> theory; i.e. one in which the effects of gravity on a body are simply the results of some feature of its IMMEDIATE surroundings.</p>
<p>And so we describe gravity as the effect of <em>curved</em> spacetime.  We imagine that all masses cause a curvature in spacetime around them, and this curvature distorts the paths of other bodies in the vicinity.</p>
<p>So the &quot;gravity&quot; felt by a body is simply the effect of the curvature of spacetime in its immediate region.  This removes the issues of non-locality since no information needs to be transmitted at higher-than-light speeds.</p>
<p>I hope this explanation helps, feel free to ask follow-up questions.</p>
<p>Edit: I've mentioned this a little lower down in the comment chain, but it is an important point which belongs here too: <em>changes</em> to curvature propagate at the speed of light.  i.e. if, through some truly epic disaster, the sun suddenly popped out of existence, we would not encounter the effects until about 8 minutes later.  This is due to the fact that <em>information</em> cannot travel faster than light (in a vacuum).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is not instantaneous. It propagates at the speed of light.</p>
<p>When you hold a ball, it <em>already</em> wants to fall. Gravity has been affecting it all along. The atom on the other side of the planet had <em>already</em> been pulling on the atom in the ball. The only thing that changed when it fell was that you let it go.</p>
<p>If the atom on the other side of the earth were to suddenly disappear, the atom in the ball would not feel it until 0.042 seconds later (speed of light fast). It would get a <em>little</em> lighter in your hands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ball starts falling immediately because Earth has been around already before you dropped the ball. The galaxy has been around for a long time as well.</p>
<p>If you have a ball floating around in space and make a planet magically appear next to it, the ball would <em>not</em> directly fall towards it. The delay would be tiny (the speed of light is fast), but not zero.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your initial premise is wrong, the pull of the earth is not instantaneous. Say the sun disappeared, we would not see this for 8 minutes as the light has not reached us but importantly we would remain orbiting the point where the sun was for 8 minutes because gravity can only propagate out at the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i always thought of it like: the speed of light is actually the max speed of spacetime. so everything within spacetime is limited to that speed. the curvature of space can move at max speed because it is massless and spacetime imposes something like friction to mass because it distorts it, which requires more energy to move faster (infinte to get to the speed of light). when mass is pure energy and no longer mass it is light and thus rides along the max speed of spacetime because it has no resistance. this is just how i think so in sure ill be criticized for not having sources. so gravity really is just a ripple in spacetime which is what defines the speed of light and not the other way around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
