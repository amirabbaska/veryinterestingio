<p>Edit: I suppose I shouldn't have used the word &quot;legal.&quot;  I guess I was more just wondering why it's allowed to happen.  It seemed unfair that the tickets are released at a retail level, available to the common public, but they allow bots to swoop up all the tickets before a typical consumer even has the chance to click purchase.  That being said, my question has been sufficiently answered by many of you.  Thanks for the responses!</p>
<p>Edit 2:  For all of the smart asses on here... Yes I understand buying and selling is how commerce works.   But before the Internet there used to be laws against buying and reselling event tickets.  Now it seemed as though people are allowed to eat up all the tickets with a bot and do whatever they want with them.  I was wondering why this is allowed whereas traditional scalping was not.  Most people understood what I meant and provided more than adequate answers. Hence why I marked it as explained.  I don't need anyone else responding that &quot;buying and selling is how the economy works.&quot;</p></div></div>
