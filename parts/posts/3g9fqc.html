<p>Edit: I suppose I shouldn't have used the word &quot;legal.&quot;  I guess I was more just wondering why it's allowed to happen.  It seemed unfair that the tickets are released at a retail level, available to the common public, but they allow bots to swoop up all the tickets before a typical consumer even has the chance to click purchase.  That being said, my question has been sufficiently answered by many of you.  Thanks for the responses!</p>
<p>Edit 2:  For all of the smart asses on here... Yes I understand buying and selling is how commerce works.   But before the Internet there used to be laws against buying and reselling event tickets.  Now it seemed as though people are allowed to eat up all the tickets with a bot and do whatever they want with them.  I was wondering why this is allowed whereas traditional scalping was not.  Most people understood what I meant and provided more than adequate answers. Hence why I marked it as explained.  I don't need anyone else responding that &quot;buying and selling is how the economy works.&quot;</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, everything is legal that isn't prohibited.</p>
<p>So, you have a business that decides that the original venue/ticket seller has underpriced tickets (that is, consumers will be willing to pay more than face value for the tickets, and even at those prices, they'll all sell.</p>
<p>So, they do the same thing you'd do: they get in line and buy the tickets.</p>
<p>They're using technology, which is faster than you typing stuff by hand, so in the time you buy your four tickets, they've got 250 computers buying 12 each.  After 5 minutes, the ticket brokers have bought all of the tickets (well, a few humans got some too).</p>
<p>Then, they sell the tickets.</p>
<p>There's nothing illegal about buying stuff in bulk.  There's nothing illegal about selling stuff for any price you'd like.</p>
<p>Those are fundamental rights in any society that has any kind of free enterprise.</p>
<p>Scalping is illegal in some markets if done &quot;near&quot; the venue, which is actually really weird.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Where I am based (Canada) it is completely legal to scalp tickets. Last time I was in Vancouver, I actually stumbled across a literal &quot;Ticket Resale Shop&quot;... like a store front.... this was baffling to me.</p>
<p>Ticketmaster actually got into a lot of shit a while back for assisting re-seller companies with inventory. I believe there was a class action law suit filed a few years ago.</p>
<p>Basically TM would supply TicketsNow(Resale site) w/ X amount of great tickets, take the profit off the face value sale to TicketsNow, and generate more profit off the resale. This is SHADY AS FUCK IMO. Basically selling to resell for more $.</p>

<p>It's horrible, and ruins the ability for fans to actually enjoy the experience without having to pay outrageous prices as well as causing issues regarding reprints, ticket delivery failing, printing issues, etc. </p>
<p>FYI - If you buy tickets from a scalper, and have them mailed and they dont arrive, you are SOL. If you lose them, you are SOL. if the tickets are reprinted you are SOL. Basically if you didn't by directly from the official seller and something happens to your tickets.... you are SOL.</p>
<p>EDIT - I am currently at work and will be a bit before I can answer any questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Houston has a huge livestock show and rodeo with concerts from some of the biggest names in country and other genres. Back in the early 90s, they tried to address the problem of scalpers by limiting the number of tickets each person in line could buy. One bright spark hired the homeless to stand in line and buy the tickets. Great idea except that dude gave the line sitters CASH for the tickets they were supposed to buy. </p>
<p>It didn't even take a full hour for those men to realize that the one guy couldn't stop them from taking the money and leaving. It's not like the scalper put any effort into paperwork for his day labor. </p>
<p>HPD didn't do much other than laugh about it. That's pretty much what the rest of Houston did, too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The ticket prices at the end of the day are dictated by the standard laws of supply and demand. There is a strictly limited supply of the product -- the venue only has a certain number of seats available -- so demand alone determines the final settling price of the product. If demand is unusually high, you don't get to buy more tickets; you just wind up paying more for the same number of tickets.</p>
<p>The vendors sell their tickets at below-market price mostly as an incentive to convince the resellers to do exactly what they are doing. That way, the vendor (a) doesn't have to waste money advertising, (b) can concentrate their efforts on lining up acts instead of marketing the tickets, and (c) guarantees that they sell every ticket they want, rapidly and with a highly predictable total revenue for the gig.</p>
<p>If this process were made illegal it would NOT make the tickets cheaper. It would simply adjust who earned the extra revenue. Less would go to the middleman, but prices would remain the same. If the retailer wanted to go through the hassle of marketing and take on the risk of possibly not selling out their tickets, they could do what Ticketmaster and the others do; they prefer it this way.</p>
<p>You're actually not getting screwed over; you're just paying your money to a different seller.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
