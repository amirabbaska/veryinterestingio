The seam of the scrotum is where what otherwise would have become a vagina binds together.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because that's where the labia would be if you were a female. Instead of the division growing wider and deepening, as in any invagination, it heals up that bad boy with a layer of skin. Plus it ejects the ovaries analogue into that bad boy and gets em working.</p>
<p>Edit: don't add &quot;invagination&quot; to your vocabulary. I said it in front of a group of microbiologists and there were at least two (including my boss) who acted like I just said &quot;pussy&quot; in front of them. Not worth</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My daughter has CAH (Congenial Adrenal Hyperplasia).  She genetically female but born mildly intersexed.  Enlarged clitoris, partially fused labia, and a mild urogenital sinus.  You could completely see, at birth, how both sets of genitals form.</p>
<p>Fortunately, an easy surgery at about a year took care of the sinus and moved the vagina closer to the front.  Everything else was left alone. The clitoris is over-sized, but within spec.  She has ovaries and a uterus so she should be just as fertile as any woman.  From a gender standpoint, she acts completely female.  If she changes her mind, I have no beef with that.  The larger, lifetime, issue is that she's salt-wasting and cannot produce cortisone.  Easily medicated, just a lot of work and testing.</p>
<p>At sexual maturity, she can choose if she want's any cosmetic surgery done.  As it stands, she should be able to have normal sex and give birth when she's an adult.  I haven't seen what's down there since the time of diapers, but my wife says everything appears generally normal.</p>
<p>When she was born, her labia majora looked like scrotal skin.  That went away after she got on hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before the 5-6 week mark, all embryos have undifferentiated structures that will become internal and external sex organs. Gonadal steroid hormones released starting at 5-6 weeks (and a host of complex factors pertaining to this process) dictate how those undifferentiated structures will develop into male or female internal and external sex organs. Thus, a developing human starts as “a blank slate” with undifferentiated structures, and although only the X gene expresses first, it isn’t exactly right to say “all humans start as female” (as sexual differentiation hasn’t occurred yet). Simply put, genetic code aside, all mammals including humans start as a “blank slate” and remain this way for about the first 5-6 weeks of gestation.
