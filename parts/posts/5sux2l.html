		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The placenta is actually only formed by the blastocyst  (very early fetus) so is 100% fetal DNA.</p>
<p>The placenta acts as an exchange for maternal nutrients to the embryo. The blood vessels of the mother bury into the placenta and pass very closely to the fetal blood vessels which allows for the exchange over the vessels. This allows the mother to give all yhe oxygen, nutrients and immunity to the baby while it is in the womb. The mother also has a reduced immune system during pregnancy which prevents most possible immune reactions.</p>
<p>However,  sometimes a mother can be &quot;sensitised&quot; to the fetal blood. This happens when mother who has a specific blood type, called rhesus D negative, comes into contact with blood that is rhesus D positive. The mother's immune system will create antibodies to the D positive blood (because her body has never encountered D positive blood and treats it as an &quot;invader&quot;, like your body would treat a bacteria). The exposure to the Rhesus D positive blood most often happens during a first child birth. If the same mother were to have a second child that was also rhesus D positive, her immune system would recognise the same &quot;invader&quot; as last time and will create antibodies to fight it. These antibodies are small enough to cross over the boundaries between the maternal blood vessels and the fetal blood vessels. Once the antibodies are in the fetal circulation, they attack the fetus' red blood cells which carry the Rhesus D positive marker.</p>
<p>To stop that from happening, a rhesus D negative mother needs an injection after giving birth to stop her body making antibodies against the blood she may have been exposed to in childbirth</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the mother becomes pregnant a protein called glycodelin is released in huge quantity around the growing child. This acts as an immunosuppresent since as you say, half the DNA of the foetus is foreign.  Immunosuppresents function to minimise effects of the immune system by restricting its activity. Glycodelin has been shown to actually induce apoptosis (programmed cell death, basically a 'tidy' way of getting rid of a cell in a managed way) in activated T cells, which are one of the components of the immune system. </p>
<p>There may be other factors at play too, but this is my field and I know this effect to be significant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has actually been a question that has long perplexed medical researchers...and the truth is, it still isn't fully known. But fairly recently (2012) it was discovered that when the embryo implants in the uterus, it sets off a process that ultimately turns off a key pathway required for the immune system to attack foreign bodies. As a result, immune cells are never recruited to the site of implantation, and therefore don't attack and cannot harm the developing fetus. </p>
<p>A central feature of the body's immune system's defense against foreign tissues and pathogens is the production of chemokines as a result of localized inflammatory response. These chemokines recruit various kinds of immune cell, including T cells, which accumulate and attack the 'intruder'. The chemokine-mediated recruitment of activated T cells is an integral part of the immune response. During pregnancy, the foreign antigens of the developing embryo/fetus and the placenta come into direct contact with cells of the mother's immune system, but fail to evoke the typical tissue rejection response (what causes some organ transplants to fail, and the reason for the need for anti-rejection meds). </p>
<p>Professor of Pathology and lead investigator in several studies in this area, Adrian Erlebacher, MD, PhD, along with his research team, found that the T cells, poised to attack the fetus as a foreign body, were unable to perform their intended role. This prompted them to wonder if there were some sort of barrier or obstruction preventing the T cells from reaching the fetus. They turned their studies to the decidua, a specialized structure that encases the fetus and placenta, and there they found the answers. </p>
<p>The onset of pregnancy causes the genes responsible for recruiting T cells and other immune system cells to the sites of inflammation to be turned off in the decidua. As a result, T cells are not able to accumulate inside the decidua, and are therefore unable to attack the placenta and fetus. Implantation of the embryo changed the packaging of certain chemokines in the nuclei of the decidua's stromal cells. The change in the DNA packaging &quot;silences&quot; the chemokine genes, and as a consequence the chemokines are not expressed and the T cells not recruited. </p>
<p>They further posited that inappropriate regulation of this process could cause inflammation and the accumulation of immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface, which could then be the source of complications including preterm labor, spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), preeclampsia, and a condition known as hyperemesis gravidarum. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
