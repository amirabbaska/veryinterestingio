		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While some movies show the intestines as a totally untethered tube that could spill out, they're actually loosely attached by mesentery, a sort of fatty sheet with intestine running along the free edge. You can't completely pull them out; it's actually fairly tricky at times to work around them in place. (As a medical student, holding back part of the bowel was one of the ways you got to assist in surgery.) The large intestine is even more firmly attached, and has a predictable setup.</p>
<p>It's hard to describe well, so here's some images:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surgeon here.  Obviously, this is a simplified explanation.</p>
<p>Regarding the bowel specifically, the small bowel is composed of three portions.  The duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum.  This in turn connects to the colon, which can be subdivided into the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid.  This then becomes the rectum.  All of this is a continuous tube starting at your mouth, and going to your anus.  The inside of this tube can be considered to be &quot;outside&quot; the body.</p>
<p>The duodenum arises from the stomach, and is firmly adhered to the retroperitoneum by fascial attachments and to the pancreas, which it &quot;hugs&quot; like a C shape.  The jejenum/ileum then arise at a point called the ligamend of trietz, with is another point of attachment.  This portion is relatively more mobile, and is suspended within the abdomen by a structure called the mesentery, which contains the vasculature, lymphatics, and nerves.  The mesentery is sort of like a curtain, with with the bowel itself being a tube, like this, ===O.    </p>
<p>Going further, the ascending and descending portions of the colon are attached to the retroperitoneum by fascia and connective tissue, with the transverse and sigmoid being more mobile.  These are also attached to the body by mesentery.  </p>
<p>All bowel can be mobilized to move them out of the way to access the kidneys and other structures of the retroperitoneum, but the bowel remains connected to the body via the mesenteric structures.  The mesentery is divided to remove diseased portions of bowel, the ends of which are then reconnected to restore continuity, or brought out as an ostomy if necessary.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To really really simplify what the above medical professionals have said (without going into anatomy):
You basically just make sure there arenâ€™t any twists in it and gently shove it back in. The intestines wiggle around (peristalsis) anyway. </p>

<li>Vet student- I was pretty amazed at how simple it is when I was taught how to do an exploratory laparotomy. Also yes, veterinarians do 4 years of medical school like human doctors :)</li>
