<p>This is because the oil spreads out to form a very thin film on the surface of the water, but of varying thickness. In some places it is literally a molecule thick, whilst in other places it is much thicker. When light passes through the oil some of it is reflected back off the different layers of oil, whilst some carries on and is reflected off the surface of the water lying below. Because the light waves have now traveled different distances before being reflected they mix together producing a spectrum of colors - because the thickness of the oil layer varies. The light spectrum occurs because, having traveled slightly different distances, some of the waves are now 'out of phase' and cancel each other out, producing dark spots, whilst others add together, producing lighter spots.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It only does this when interacting with another liquid, most commonly water. The molecules in the gasoline are no polar, making them hydrophobic (repelled by water).  Because of this, the gasoline floats on the water in a thin film. Different widths of this film reflect light differently, leading to swirls of rainbow color depending on the thickness of the gasoline. Another post haws already been made on thin-film interference that explains the phenomenon quite well.</p>
<p>Another place you can see this thin film interference creating rainbows of different thicknesses of liquid is in a bubble. In a bubble, water is trapped between two walls of hydrophobic molecules. If you look closely, you can see the layers of liquid settling.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>white light is many colors,  one color would be monochromatic. if you look at this oil stick under a one color light you will see one color. but normal every day lights and the sun are many wavelengths/colors overlapping. the oil layer acts as a thin reflecting mirror. the layer thickness is important. light of different colors propagate through the oil at slightly different speeds and refraction angle which produce a spectrum, a separation of color. the light is absorbed and emitted by all the molecules in the layer of oil. it is simpler to just look at the surfaces mathematically and it works out the same. </p>
<p>a really good explanation of this is Richard Feynmans QED (quantum electro dynamics) videos on YouTube. there are 4 and they are about 1.5 hours long each. the quality is bad but the explanations are great.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
