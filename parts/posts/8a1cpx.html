When you wake up the chemicals are still present before gradually going away so it makes it harder to contract your muscles after just waking up.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Since a lot of replies are asking which chemicals, it is a combination of the neurotransmitters GABA and Glycine. And since there was some confusion, I also wanted to clarify that these chemicals are located inside your brain, not within your muscle tissue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tl;dr: Time for a brief (and hopefully not panic-inducing) public safety announcement. This presentation is often benign, but arthritis is common (morning stiffness in the hands is textbook rheumatoid arthritis)...see your doctor if you have concerns.  </p>
<p>I’m noticing a lot of comments pointing in different directions, but towards relatively benign conditions (carpal tunnel, etc). While this is often (usually?) the case, I’d just like to emphasize the need to be cautious (albeit not obsessive) where symptoms are concerned; if you are concerned about swelling, redness, pain, or restricted motion in your hands or any other joints in your body...talk to your doctor. Particularly if you also have “constitutional” symptoms (eg. unrelenting fatigue, multiple joints affected, unexplained weight loss). </p>
<p>One of the classic features of “inflammatory” arthropathies (eg. psoriatic or rheumatoid arthritis, where there is an autoimmune process) versus “degenerative” arthropathies (eg. osteoarthritis) is that mobility is more restricted in the morning, and improves throughout the day (“movement is lubricant”). </p>
<p>Often, the first joints to be affected in rheumatoid arthritis (the most common inflammatory arthritis, which has an overall prevalence of 1% but a MUCH higher prevalence in certain demographics) are the small bones of the hand. The earlier these conditions are recognized and treated, the better they can be managed long term and the less long-term disability. </p>
