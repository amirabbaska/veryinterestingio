		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anything that affects the &quot;language&quot; part of your brain will also affect sign language users.  Sign languages operate/reside in the same part of the brain as a spoken languages -- even though the method of reception (visual) is different, language is language as far as that part of the brain is concerned.  Obviously, some disorders that may relate directly to speech/sound vs sight/movement would be different.  Clanging, and the aphasias you mentioned, I believe manifest themselves in sign language users (albeit the modality is different but the underlying effect is the same).</p>
<p>As for muttering: yes, folks mutter to themselves in sign language in much the same way as spoken language users do: diminished or minimal moments or partially formed signs.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>American Sign Language interpreter here: I haven't worked with patients (it requires particular certification and licensure in my state to work professionally in medical settings), but from my observational hours, internship experience and time with mentors (these hours are 200+ hours and mentorship is heavily encouraged in the interpreting field to prepare budding interpreters) the short answer is yes. Patients produce word salad and other symptoms as would a hearing person. Hearing voices is a strange one that hearing people often will play up in movies, etc but those symptoms manifest in deaf people as well. They might not refer to them as voices but as confusion or distortions in their thinking.</p>
<p>Again, I do practice professionally as an American Sign Language interpreter but have little experience in mental health interpreting. If you have further questions, I'll try my best to answer them from the interpreter perspective.</p>
<p>Thanks for asking this question. Glad to see discussion about American sign language and deaf people.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes to all of these. In hearing people clanging is words that have similar sounds. In sign language it is signs that have similar movements. They also can have word salad where they just sign a bunch of signs that don’t go together such as “dog day person money”. They have no meaning, just random signs. Deaf person’s signing can be “slurred” especially after things like waking up from anesthesia. Wernicke’s and broca’s area are a language center in the brain, not just a spoken language so yes sign language can be affected by those as well. Another phenomenon is that people who are schizophrenic sometimes will not cross one side of their body. For example some signs move from one side of the body to the other and they will make the movement all on one side of their body. They will never cross the midline. If there is a terminology for this, it’s escaped my mind right now.  Deaf people also do have auditory hallucinations (hear voices) as well. This is because auditory hallucinations are from an internal stimuli (in their brain) and not an external stimuli (an actual noise).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I met someone who could sign due to deaf family members but had developed an expressive dysphasia for some reason I can’t remember. Despite what people are saying ITT, this particular patient was able to communicate much more clearly when signing, and she chose to sign rather than speak when talking. </p>
<p>Partly this is because her dysarthria didn’t affect her hands, so words themselves were clearer, and partly I think it was easier for her to deal with/easier for others to understand the grammar of British Sign Language than it was English.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look up a book called Talking Hands. It absolutely blew my mind! It alternates between discussing the way sign language works in the brain, the evolution of it and things just like you're asking about, and about a Bedouin group that developed their own sign language because of a high instance of deaf people. So many people in the population are deaf that everyone speaks sign language to the point where even two hearing people may lapse into a signed conversation with each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
