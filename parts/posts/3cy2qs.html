		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood taken from dead people is actually very usable.  The first experiments were done by taking blood from a dead dog and putting that blood into a living one -- if it were done within ~6 hours, the living dog suffered no ill effects.</p>
<p>Taking blood from cadavers was done in the Soviet Union, but it didn't catch on in America because of the general public's feelings toward it.  It also raises the question of consent -- would a patient be okay with blood from a dead person?  Would the deceased's family consent?</p>
<p>It's just a sticky situation with current mentalities -- similar to the issues that plague cadaver research.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for the organ and tissue donation industry. Blood banking is separate from us but most of our regulations are based on the blood banking industry.</p>
<p>If cadaveric blood is usable- the bigger issue is getting it. We have to draw blood on all of our deceased tissue and eye donors. We do it using a spinal needle and a 60cc syringe and usually draw from their subclavian or femoral vein, and sometimes from their heart.</p>
<p>Two issues because the person is dead: 1) no pulse. It's  nothing for us to sit there and donate a pint of blood because we have a beating heart and our blood is moving through our veins, there is internal pressure that will force it through that awful needle and into the bag. Once you die, your blood stops flowing and starts pooling in your body, that's lividity, or the red-purple patches on dead bodies. So, oftentimes, we have a very difficult time getting blood out of the cadavers heart, especially if they were dehydrated when they died- their blood is pooling in their capillaries, and our &quot;little&quot; syringe does not have enough power to pull it up. 2)Blood clots. It starts clotting at different rates for everyone and the medications a person was on when they died can affect how viscous their blood is. </p>
<p>Next. Consent. It's easy when you're alive because you can answer  for yourself. When we do organ, tissue, or eye donation, we have to contact a family member to authorize the donation, even if you've signed up at the DMV. Then, we need a Donor Risk Assessment Interview (DRAI) completed by the family. It's a ton of questions very similar to those asked when donating blood, but a bit lengthier. If an organ donor doesn't have this, it's fine, and the organs are listed as &quot;high risk.&quot; For tissue and eye, it's necessary because tissues have been deemed as life-enhancing, not life-saving and so the risk-benefit analysis doesn't make high risk tissues a necessary risk. So, we would at least need the questions required for blood donation answered.</p>
<p>Next: Timing. It can take us a long time to get ahold of the family of  the deceased. They are going through a lot of trauma and sometimes, donation is the last thing on their mind. And all that time it takes for us to reach them, the body is typically put in a morgue cooler, which is not good for blood viscosity. Our paperwork takes at least an hour to complete, to where we can then send a tech out to wherever the body is, <em>hopefully</em> draw enough blood, and then ship it to processing.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, Contamination. Once your immune system dies your microbiome immediately starts taking over and you start decomposing. Blood can still be used for serology testing at this point or even if it's come in contact with other bodily fluids, but I doubt it would be safe to transfuse it into a live person after a certain timeframe- which would need to be validated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am curious to know if part of the reason why you would not want to take blood from dead people is due to the circumstances around death. People who die are often pumped full of drugs to help them cope / deal with pain. They may be on prescription drugs for whatever they died from, too - say, heart failure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question!</p>
<p>In order to extract a cadaver's blood, you'd need a pump to do the job for you as the donor's heart is no longer beating and maintaining blood pressure. I suppose if live-donor blood reserves ran low, and if artificial blood doesn't take its place any time soon, this would become a necessity.</p>
<p>If you've yet to read Dune, by Frank Herbert, I recommend you do! He creates a society where water is so precious that all bodily fluids from a dead body is extracted and assimilated into one's own reserves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all about the machinery. It's really hard to extract a usable quantity of blood from a recently deceased individual. This is mainly because the person's heart is no longer beating. Blood effectually &quot;pools&quot; where it is. </p>
<p>While it's a good idea to use blood from dead people. It's just not feasible to extract all the blood or a usable quantity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
