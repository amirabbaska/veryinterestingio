As described in the article, time crystals change their state when &quot;exposed to an electromagnetic pulse&quot;. Since minerals like Quartz also change state when exposed to a electromagnetic pulse, how are they different? Is it just the arrangement of the molecules in the crystal that are different? or is it purely the result of the state change that is different? Does anyone know if the two are linked in some way(the piezo and time crystal effect)?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Time crystals start to oscillate (i.e. form the time crystal) when they get a &quot;kick&quot; from the EM pulse - they are inherently non-equilibrium structures. Piezos (all dielectrics, really) don't really change state when exposed EM field. They polarize to minimize the electric displacement field inside by reconfiguring their bound charge, which leads to changes in bond lengths, but this is a equilibrium configuration that vanishes once you get rid of the electric field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
