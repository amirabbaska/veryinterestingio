		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once upon a time, citizens were expected to return to their lives and careers after serving in Congress.</p>
<p>The same with Presidents.</p>
<p>Many were lawyers, merchants, craftsmen, farmers, and all had means outside of government. They were given a stipend for their service but not a salary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Private careers and outside business interests are two very different things. Federal Legisllators don't typically maintain a second job outside of their legislator job, because they simply don't have enough time to do both. However they would retain any licenses they have, like a law license for example. In terms of business interests, this primarily means investments. As long as they aren't using their power to improve the outlook of their investments, it's not a conflict of interest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the constitution doesn't say they have to give them up. And the Supreme Court hasn't ruled that it's a conflict of interest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They generally don't. I can't think of any example where they do, in fact. However, legislators are different than persons in the executive branch, because they can't do anything (or at least not much officially) unilaterally. But the emoluments clause and anti bribery statutes do apply to Congresspersons. See Jim Trafficant, for a simple example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
