		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you have an evolutionary incentive to do so.</p>
<p>Your ancient ancestors had an omnivorous diet of fruits, nuts and meat where they could find it. Imagine you see that the inside of a carcass you're eating is rotten and full of maggots. Gagging is your brain telling you to eject the contents of your stomach to avoid poisoning yourself.</p>
<p>This is also the reason why you feel the need to vommit when someone else does. You may have ingested the same poison. After all, if that ape is near you then they're probably in your group. And you're probably eating the same thing they are. Therefore better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Sure...you may lose the contents of your stomach, but it's better than death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to /u/SovietWomble 's point, it may be a conditioned response in some cases.</p>
<p>Think of Pavlov's dogs. Pavlov would ring a bell and give his dogs food. When he gave the dogs food, that would drool. Eventually, after ringing the bell and giving the food, they started to drool when they heard the bell.</p>
<p>The same principle can apply to gagging in some cases. From my own life: oatmeal. I used to eat oatmeal without a problem, but I would eat it slowly and it would get cold. The cold oatmeal made me gag. This happened a lot, and now the smell of oatmeal makes me gag.</p>
<p>Maybe more poignant. I brush my tongue after brushing my teeth. This makes me gag (since I'm sticking the brush far into my mouth). Now, I gag when I finish brushing my teeth even if I skip brushing my tongue.</p>
<p>Evolution makes us gag reflexively to some things, per /u/SovietWomble 's explaination, but we may be conditioned to gag at other things.</p>
<p>Sorry that's not super ELI5, I'm not great at this yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our idea of 'disgusting food' is unique, not universal. While the idea of a meat-lovers pizza will get many people's saliva flowing, others will gag in disgust to the same image. </p>
<p>It will be interesting to find out how much gagging is a response to cultural programming, and how much of it is rejecting poisonous foods. We seem to have different constitutions in regards to which foods really nurtures us.</p>
<p>tl'dr We gag because something in us rejects what we see. It's either our nature or our culture. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
