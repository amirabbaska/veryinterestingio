		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen them both ways. </p>
<p>In general, doors that open to hallways are put in so they don't swing into the hallway. It's a safety issue; you don't want to hit someone. </p>
<p>Having the entrance a push makes it easier for you to enter the bathroom without contaminating the door if you are going in to wash something off of them. </p>
<p>Push doors have the hinges and lock on the inside, so you can't be locked in.</p>
<p>Many public bathrooms also tend to have drinking fountains, closets, or other utilities near them; having the door open outward makes the wall there dead space. This is more important in a corridor, less so in a bathroom section which is likely just a corner anyway. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh! I can answer this! </p>
<p>I recently started a job in HVAC engineering (kids, avoid this industry if you have a mechanical engineering degree). Typically the air that's pumped into rooms (supply air) gets there via diffusers. Once the air is there it needs to get out of the room so it can either reheat or cool down again. That's where returns come in. Returns are typically just an opening in the tile ceiling, or in the case or a restaurant just an opening on the back of the HVAC unit.</p>
<p>A tenant space is designed to have neutral or slightly positive pressure. That way opening/closing doors isn't a hassle, among other reasons. If it's slightly positive it'll keep cold air from getting in during the winter months when an outside door is opened.</p>
<p>Bathrooms are a bit different since that air is smelly and gross and no one wants that air getting into their space. An exhaust fan that vents to the roof is put in the bathrooms. The return air in the bathroom does not even mix with the other return air. The exhaust fan's cfm (cubic feet per minute, the unit of measurement used to describe the volume of air put into the space in a certain amount of time) is typically 50-100 depending on the size of the bathroom. The supply cfm to the bathroom is typically 35-80. This puts the bathroom at a negative pressure, which keeps the nasty are inside the bathroom. </p>
<p>What does this have to do with doors? Well when you enter the bathroom and you push the door IN that pulls the clean air into the bathroom while pushing the dirty air into the bathroom. When you leave and you pull the door, same effect. It's all about keeping the dirty air within the bathroom.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is why don't all restaurant bathroom doors have that foot handle where you can pull it open with your foot. Makes it so much easier.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm not 100% correct, as expected. It actually has to do with the egress of the door swings and other accessibility concerns. Neat!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here’s how to use the bathroom in the most sanitary manner:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do not use the urinal to pee. Urine splashes back on you.  So stand as far back from the urinals as possible and just let loose like a fire hose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The better option for maximum sanitariness is to use the stall.  Kick open the door.  Seat down?  Don’t touch it.  Stand as far away as possible again.Pee all over it.  Then kick the flush.  Or don’t flush. Don’t worry about breaking anything because fuck everyone.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands for 2 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>Dry your hands with the paper towels, use towel to open door, throw your filthy towel on the ground.  </li>
</ol>
<p>You are now the cleanest most sanitary person in the world.  Enjoy your day touching knobs and money and hand rails that are all perfectly germ free.  Not like that gross bathroom with piss everywhere and dirty towels on the floor</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a common safety requirement to arrange the doors that way to prevent an inaccessible obstruction stopping someone from exiting the building. Imagine if a cart or something was placed in front of a bathroom door that opened outward and then a fire alarm went off. Those in the bathroom wouldn't be able to open the door and the cart would be on the other side of the door!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
