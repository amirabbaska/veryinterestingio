		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I took a master's in biomedical engineering and one of our professors who taught blood compatibility had actually worked on a lot of the early heart and lung machines. The two organs are indeed usually replaced together because the new artificial lung needs a good pressure difference to drive the blood through that you wouldn't want the patient's heart to have to maintain. </p>
<p>He told us about the detrimental effects of the systems and I'll try to summarize. One is that the pumps lyse (&quot;pop&quot;) the red blood cells. Another is platelet (&quot;scab&quot;) accumulation on the device. Basically, the only thing blood won't try to scab up on is immunocompatible flesh.</p>
<p>These problems can be mitigated by constant fresh blood infusion and swapping out the machine, but infection is also a constant risk. The devices he worked on were used to treat acute, but not chronic, lung failure while the lungs would heal to take the job back over. IIRC, roughly one week.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do, but it's not perfect.</p>
<p>When someone's lungs are failing, we can place them on what's called veno-venous ECMO (extra corporeal membrane oxygenation).  It basically takes blood from your veins, puts oxygen in and takes carbon dioxide out, then pumps it back to your heart so the heart can deliver it to the rest of your body.  And people can wait several days, or even weeks waiting for a lung transplant.</p>
<p>We also know, however, that these people usually have much worse outcomes than people who don't require ECMO before transplant; Lung transplants even without the higher risks usually last 5 years on average due to chronic rejection.</p>
<p>Since there are only a limited number of organs, we want to make sure that if we transplant the lungs into a person they have the best chance of lasting as long as possible. If someone dies with a lung transplant shortly after surgery, we not only lose the patient's life, but potentially the life of someone else who dies before they could receive an organ.</p>
<p>Heart outcomes off of ECMO are even worse.  If someone's heart is failing we can place them on veno-arterial ECMO, which is taking the blood out of the veins and putting it directly into the arterial system, and in this way bypassing the lungs and heart.</p>
<p>Outcomes after this type of ECMO are, unfortunately, poor.  If your lungs and heart have failed, there's a good chance some, if not many, of your other systems are failing as well, including your kidneys and liver.  You're usually not awake and moving if you're on ECMO as well, so your muscles deteriorate very quickly, and recovery even if you get a transplant is very prolonged.</p>
<p>And of course, if your heart and lung have failed, requiring emergency anesthesia and ECMO, we have to make sure your brain survived the ordeal.  Stroke and head bleeds are major concerns and risks after initiating ECMO, as the circuit needs a good amount of blood thinner active to prevent the system from clotting.  Even if we keep your heart and lungs bypassed, it doesn't mean that you're not brain dead.</p>
<p><strong>TL/DR</strong> Complicated topic, but we do pump oxygenated blood to people using ECMO. The transplant results are disappointing as usually other things are failing along with your heart and lungs.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Extra-Corporeal Membranous Oxygenation (ECMO) is probably what you're trying to describe. It comes in several forms, including Cardio-Pulmonary Bypass (CPB) is a form of ECMO used in Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery. CPB in CABG surgery has become a mainstay, because it allows for temporary cardioplegia (stopping of the heart). The various forms of ECMO have revolutionized our abilities to manage the critically ill patient, where less invasive methods such as medications or balloon pumps have failed. In theory, they can buy time for lungs to heal in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) or for the inflammation to pass in the most refractory of asthmatics; it can bridge the gap to getting heart and lung transplants. However, research at least so far has shown mixed results on whether people actually live any longer while getting ECMO therapies.</p>
<p>ECMO therapies also have huge downsides. The first is that it requires significant amounts of blood transfusions. Blood passing through the ECMO machines tends to clot or otherwise be lost, which requires more transfusions. ARDS patients receiving ECMO in one recent review lost an average of 1800ml of blood/day of ECMO. </p>
<p>In addition there is on going hypoperfusion of the brain, not to mention other organs like the kidney. In general these patients will end up needing some sort of kidney replacement therapy such as dialysis. There can be permanent brain damage, sometimes nicknamed &quot;pumphead,&quot; which is basically like having a stroke.</p>
<p>The ability for blood to clot becomes problematic too. On the one hand because the blood is not moving through normal vessels, is getting slightly chilled by the outside air, and is slightly acidodic because of the buildup of CO2 (one of the rate limiters of ECMO), it all means that blood is more likely to clot. This consumes the clotting proteins and platelets, meaning the blood returned to the body is less able to clot and you get easy bleeding. In addition, there is addition of citrate compounds, which help decrease the risk of clotting in the machine but bind to calcium leading to low levels of calcium. All this requires replacement of the clotting factors and platelets, usually by apheresis platelets or platelet packs and fresh frozen plasma, crypoprecipitate, and factor concentrates.</p>
<p>These are the major reasons, and there are other relatively minor reasons (they can't be awake because of the hypoperfusion of the brain, they require a nurse perfusionist assigned to them 24 hours a day, etc.), ECMO is far from an ideal solution to getting people oxygenated blood. Yes, it may work in certain scenarios, but it has tremendous downsides and really is only used as a means of last resort to buy the patient a little more time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it is just your heart failing there are devices available to significantly prolong your life including VADs (heartmate II, heartware, etc) and a total artifical heart (Syncardia).  In their simplest form they are propellers/rotors in a housing that spin and push blood along, taking it from the left ventricle and returning to the aorta and in doing so take some of the load off of the heart.  People on these devices don't have a pulse (as the heart is not ejecting much)!  The Syncadia actually replaces your ventricles and is more complicated.</p>
<p>Thousands of people have had these devices implanted and many have made it years as a bridge to heart transplantation or eventual death.  Downsides are that these devices are very expensive, like $60K-150K.  The driveline for the device comes through the skin in the abdomen and is a potential source of infection.  You have to carry batteries around and wear a little fanny pack as well.</p>
<p>For lungs it is more complicated.  I see ECMO mentioned and although there a lot of inaccuracies in this thread the basic idea is right.  There have been cases of 100+ days of ECMO support, but nothing like the years of support that VADs can offer.  People can go home and lead normal lives on VADs - with ECMO you are in the hospital.</p>
<p>The artificial surface area (tubing, oxygenator) that comes in contact with the blood is much greater for ECMO compared to VADs and so the anticoagulation required is orders of magnitudes more which means more bleeding/complications.  Oxygenators don't last very long and must be changed.  ECMO support also runs into the thousands per day.</p>

<p>Under the Complications heading, it explains that the process is not benign, and it is only relatively safe for several hours. It can cause clots, burst blood cells, and a bunch of other problems. So, basically, it would kill them if we used this for more than several hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
