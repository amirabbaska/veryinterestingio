		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heh, finally my job is useful.  I design vacuum chambers for a living.  The short answer is no, we cannot achieve a perfect vacuum.  Even the best pumps, like cryopumps, which actually condense gas molecules onto the pump surface, cannot get every single molecule.  Even if you could capture all molecules all materials outgas slightly, meaning they emit gas particles.  So you will constantly have molecules entering the chamber.  We use special cleaning methods, low outgas materials, and even bake hardware to try and reduce this but it still happens.  We cannot even create a vacuum equal to that in outer space. Hope this helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best we can do right now is about 100 molecules per cubic centimeter. In interstellar space, it reduces to about 10 per cubic centimeter. In extragalactic space, it's about 1-3 molecules. </p>
<p>Even if we were able to achieve something 'perfect', the existence of virtual particles would still pose a problem.</p>
<p>Virtual particles are quantum related particles that pop in and out of existence rapidly. They are not controllable in any way, and are present in every part of reality regardless of its content. So, basically, no. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Barring issues such as cosmic rays passing through the vacuum chamber or odd vacuum fluctuations, essentially perfect (read immeasurably low pressures) are created by the experiments at Cern working on low energy antimatter experiments. Since any remaining matter from residual gas would annihilate the stored antiprotons and positrons, researchers conduct experiments in sealed vacuum containers cooled to temperatures below 4 K (liquid helium). Depending on what models you use, antiproton and positron lifetimes when held for months on end set an upper limit of the pressure as 10^-17 mbar, which is about 5 orders of magnitude better than what can be achieved in excellent vacuum chambers kept at room temperature. The amounts to less than one atom per cubic meter, and since the chambers are smaller than this (~100 cm^3), there are essentially not atoms free in the volume of the chamber.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>But you know, you only need to know 39 digits of pi to calculate the circumference of the universe to within the width of a hydrogen atom....   you rarely need absolute perfection outside of thought experiments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
