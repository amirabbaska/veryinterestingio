		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's a shortcut, a simplified system created by scribes who had to write a lot by hand. So these scribes (some of them were monks) discovered that instead of raising the pen from the paper over and over again to write a new, separated letter, it was easier and faster to keep a continuous line that flows tying one letter to the next. </p>
<p>This system, called cursive, works great for some of the Latin letters, but not for most of them which had to be adapted. This is why A, B, E F, G, H, I, L, M, N, Q, R and sometimes S look very different in cursive from their uppercase versions.</p>
<p>This cursive system was later adapted by printers as the lowercase fonts.</p>

<p>At first it was only cursive for paper and big uppercase for sculptures/incisions. Lowercase was created when printing was invented, since printing cursive was impossible but uppercase and lowercase letters still needed to exist. Therefore changes were mode for clarity, as an r done like an R probably would've not looked right</p>
<p>The names uppercase and lowercase exist because the stamps for those respective letters were stored on the upper case or on the lower case</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, let's talk about the words 'uppercase' and 'lowercase'. These words come from the early history of printing, when a person called a <em>typesetter</em> would assemble each page of a book letter by letter. Each letter was a profile on a piece of lead, called a <em>sort</em>. The sorts were kept in boxes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting#/media/File:Metal_movable_type.jpg" target="_blank"><em>typecases</em></a>, which had compartments for each letter. There would be a typecase for each <em>font</em> (also called a <em>fount</em>), which was a <em>typeface</em> at a specific size, at a specific weight (bold, medium, <em>etc.</em>), in a specific shape (upright, italic, <em>etc.</em>). A typeface is what we nowadays call a font on computers. There were actually two typecases for each font, and they were kept one on top of the other. The one on top was called the <em>upper case</em>, and contained the 'majuscule' letters; the one on the bottom was called the <em>lower case</em>, and contained the 'minuscule' letters. So the proper names for 'uppercase' and 'lowercase' are 'majuscule' and 'minuscule', respectively.</p>
<p>Now, on to your actual question.</p>
<p>Letters are just simple drawings that have phonetic meanings. (In other words, the symbols represent sounds.) The nature of the symbols is affected by the thing the symbols are written on. For example, one of the earliest writing symbols we have is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform#/media/File:Early_writing_tablet_recording_the_allocation_of_beer.jpg" target="_blank">cuneiform</a>, which was written by making marks with a stylus in a piece of clay. The shape of cuneiform marks is strongly determined by the shape of the stylus.</p>
<p>This is important, because the majuscules and minuscules were originally two forms of the Latin alphabet that were used for writing on different materials, and the same thing applies to the Greek alphabet.</p>
<p>Majuscule letters were originally <em>inscriptional</em>, which means they were carved into stone. The Roman emperor Trajan had his military victories depicted on a carved stone column called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan%27s_Column" target="_blank">Trajan's column</a>; at the base of this column is some writing, in the style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_square_capitals" target="_blank">Roman square capitals</a>: this style is common on Roman monuments, but Trajan's column is one of the best known examples. These letters were designed by a scribe painting them on to the stone with a brush; a stonemason would then carve out the painted areas. The motion of the brush created little flairs at the beginning at end of each brush stroke; these flairs are now known as <em>serifs</em>.</p>
<p>However, Romans writing out documents would use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_cursive" target="_blank">Roman cursive</a>. Roman cursive, like all cursive writing forms, is basically a bunch of shortcuts in writing the 'proper' letters.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Roman culture continued to hold considerable sway amongst the barbarians. The same writing styles were preserved, until the Carolingian Renaissance under Charlemagne (Charles the Great) in the Frankish Empire (now France) in the 800s. Charlemagne was a great believer in literacy, and despite never learning to read himself, ordered the creation of a single style of handwriting to be used across his empire, to prevent documents from being misinterpreted. The end result was a pairing of these two writing styles into the majuscule and minuscule letters of a unified alphabet. The minuscule letters, being easier to write quickly, were use normally, but the majuscule letters, with their grand and elegant forms, were used for proper nouns and emphasis. Over the succeeding thousand years, different nations would slowly adapt these letter forms and the relationships between them to their needs: the Italians developed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanist_minuscule" target="_blank">Humanist minuscule</a>, which later became the italic script; the Germanic peoples developed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter" target="_blank">blackletter</a> scripts; the Irish developed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insular_script" target="_blank">insular script</a>. This development continues today, with hundreds of typefaces released each year by type designers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A little bonus information:
We are using upper- and lowercase to make reading easier since the 9th century AD. </p>
<p>Regarding your question: look at the Roman Cursive. The Latin alphabet is inspired by it. But why looks r so different than R until today? For efficiency reasons. Let’s take the word ride. Imagine you have to write the word ride over and and over again with a feather. Once you get used to it... it’s okay. Now write Ride Ride Ride. The R takes way longer than the r. </p>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
