<p>Well, first thing is, you can't &quot;misspell&quot; Chinese per se. Maybe you can get the strokes wrong or have missing strokes (Like writing 日 or 由 when you actually wanna write 田), they can be two totally separate characters.</p>
<p>Or, you can just use the wrong character (since Chinese has limited sounds, a lot of words share the same pronunciation, like 鸡蛋 (chicken egg) and 鸡弹 (literally &quot;chicken bomb&quot;, but just FYI this isn't a thing, just an example) are pronounced exactly the same, but if you wrote the latter the teacher would probably underline it, because that isn't a thing.</p>
<p>Grammar wise, I guess the order of the words matter? Like in English.   “Home I am&quot; is grammatically incorrect, and it's similar in Chinese.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Singaporean who has been learning (Mandarin) Chinese as my second language from young, so maybe I can help. It's my first time answering a question on ELI5 so I hope my explanation is easy to understand.</p>
<p>You might know that Chinese uses logograms, which are like pictures instead of stringing letters together to form words as in English. Just as how pictures are drawn using lines, logograms are also formed by drawing lines.</p>
<p>In English, a misspelled word is one with, well, a wrong spelling, like spelling 'word' as 'ward'. I think you can agree that the letters 'o' and 'a' are both circular and thus may look similar to a person who is unfamiliar with the Latin alphabet, but they are different. Now, take a look at this three Chinese characters. 己 已 巳。They all look the same, yes? But they are really different--you can see that the vertical line on the left does not protrude out of the middle horizontal line which leaves some sort of gap or cave, or it's only drawn halfway, or it's drawn fully which closes up the gap or cave. The first character has the meaning of 'self', the second of 'already', and the third of 'snake' or '9am to 11am'. They look the same, but their meanings are vastly different. &quot;My friend is in hospital word one.&quot; Huh???</p>
<p>With respect to ungrammaticality, Chinese does have grammar (surprise!?). Just as in English where a word order wrong make your sentence nonsensical may, the same thing applies to Chinese. If you were to swap the positions of the first and third characters of the sentence 我吃饭。 to get 饭吃我。, you would have said that &quot;The rice eats me.&quot; instead of &quot;I eat rice.&quot; A person who speaks a language with an Object-Verb-Subject sentence structure may find it hard to get used to the Subject-Verb-Object sentence structure in Chinese, and may potentially use words in the wrong word order which leads to ungrammaticality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Chinese, we have what we called <a href="http://www.languagerealm.com/chinese/chinese_measure_words.php" target="_blank">measure words.</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Unlike English and most European languages, Chinese does not distinguish between singular and plural, so nouns are simply abstract in number, with context determining whether something is singular or plural.
But when you have to specify a certain number of something, you combine the number itself with a measure word, followed by the noun.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In English, you ask &quot;How many people?&quot; In Chinese, it would be 几个人 (jĭ gè rén)? </p>
<p>几 is how many and 人 is person/people while 个 is the measure word for people. A lot of people who are learning Chinese for the first time tend to omit measure words.</p>
<hr />
<p>Also another common mistake would be the usage of number 2: 二 (èr) and 两 (liǎng). Using the previous example, if I was to answer &quot;Two people,&quot; 二个人 would be incorrect. The correct answer would be 两个人.</p>
<p>二 (èr), is when you want to refer to the digit, for example when you are count from 1 to 10 or when you are telling someone your phone number.</p>
<p>两 (liǎng) is used when quantity is involved. Like the example I showed above, two people- 两个人.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chinese here. One thing that people actually do and is wrong grammatically is speaking an incomplete sentence. When a sentence is really long, sometimes it would miss crucial elements, like objective or subjective. sometimes it is very difficult to tell that if a sentence consist of two or three sentences. I remember doing a lot of those questions in the Chinese equivalent of SAT/ACT but I can't really think of an example right now.</p>
<p>most &quot;typos&quot; would consist of using a character of the same pronounciation but different writing. It is somewhat easy to tell, unless it involves some less used characters.</p>
<p>the most common type of mistakes is the misuse of idioms. Unlike English idioms, Chinese idioms are usually based on some ancient text and consist of 4 characters. For example, &quot;空穴来风&quot;/empty cave causes wind means a rumor is not unreasonable. but some people think it just means the rumor is unsubstantiated, and they'll use it wrong. there are hundreds of idioms like that, and some have even changed meanings during the years. This is by far the most common &quot;typo&quot; or grammatical mistakes in Chinese imo. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
