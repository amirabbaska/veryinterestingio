The body reacts the same way to a dead virus as it does to a live one. Washing probably cleans all that dead stuff off too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Then:</p>
<p>Imagine taking a steak and a bucket of white paint. Red is dirty, white is sanitized. Paint the steak. No matter how well you paint, if you bend or fold that steak enough times, youâ€™ll eventually see more red.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Antibacterial hand soap only kills 99.9% of bacteria if you wash your hands for at least 30 seconds. Part of the issue with triclosan is that people don't wash their hands long enough, so the more resistant bacteria persist and reproduce. Also, the scrubbing is to make sure that all the oils on their hand are washed away to avoid bacteria avoiding the antibacterial agent by hiding within them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are approved surgical foams and gels that are alcohol-based which take the place of the First Scrub as an alternative to the 3-5 minute wash at the sink with medicated, antimicrobial soap. </p>
<p>The aim is to reduce the load of organisms on the skin and prevent regrowth during the surgical procedure. If hands are visibly soiled, of course it is recommended that the surgical team member wash the grime off first, preferably before entering the hospital.</p>
<p>Sterile gloves are not leak proof or puncture proof. They are known to fail during procedures and often leaks/punctures are undetected during cases, even with double gloving, they're not 100%. The more effective the antimicrobial activity of the pre-scrub, the better. Alcohol-based hand-rubs have many positive attributes and are readily found at the scrub sinks. </p>
