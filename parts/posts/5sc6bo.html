		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just for an easier example, if i have a bunch of magnets stuck together, each magnet being an atom, and i separate the magnets, the magnets dont get cut in half. The bond between the magnet simply is removed. That is essentially what happens with cutting a material. </p>
<p>Edit: Wow guys, thanks for the upvotes! As for people questioning about why paper therefore doesn't bond back together, that is because many other particles get in between the paper pieces, preventing them from completely bonding back together. There are ways to bond materials back together, but those involve energy being used, and vary depending on material. Also, definitely check out the other results that explain much more in depth how this works, this is just a quick analogy for those who want a simple example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's a lot of questions. Let's do them one by one.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes. I know it's &quot;intermolecular&quot; not &quot;intramolecular&quot; I messed it up and you're right if you corrected me.</p>
<p><strong>How does cutting something work?</strong></p>
<p>Individual molecules are connected by bonds called <del><em>intramolecular</em></del> <em>intermolecular bonds</em>. These come in a wide variety of types, some more permanent than others. In the case of something like a metal (or any single element bonded to itself many times over) this means there shared electrons forming a permanent bond between any two atoms of the material. In the case of more complex molecules, this means there are weaker bonds holding the material together, either through polymerization, hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, or London Forces (although the last three happen most often in liquids and are fairly temporary bonds comparatively). </p>
<p>Paper is a polymer. You can see the general structure of the main component, cellulose, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Cellulose_Sessel.svg" target="_blank">here</a>. The structures shown in brackets in the previous diagram repeat throughout the material, and connect to a structure of the same type at the ends that cross the brackets. If you expand the idea of what a polymer is to be anything with a repeating unit, then most things can fall into that category (metals are a repeat of the metal atom unit; glass is the repeat of the Silicon Oxide unit). You might notice on the cellulose that it only had connections at either end of the molecule (where it crossed the brackets); other materials can have many more connections between their repeating units (for example, glass can form more <a href="http://www.pslc.ws/macrog/images/glass01.gif" target="_blank">3-dimensional structures</a> that loop back onto themselves, and iron forms a fairly regular <a href="http://previews.123rf.com/images/molekuul/molekuul1301/molekuul130100056/17236567-Iron-Fe-ferrite-metal-crystal-structure-Unit-cell--Stock-Photo.jpg" target="_blank">metallic structure</a>). However, when the material is forming, different <em>grains</em> can form. In polymers like paper and plastics, this means that there are distinct layers and &quot;strings&quot; of polymer can form. In materials like metals or glass this means that several different areas will crystallize independently forming areas that are uniform but which run into areas that are different yet uniform with themselves (you can see the idea of &quot;grains&quot; <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uG35D_euM-0/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> where each area that's shaded uniformly is uniform with itself, but not necessarily oriented the same as the areas directly next to it). </p>
<p><strong>What causes the separation?</strong></p>
<p>Either way, when you cut a material, you're exploiting the fact that there are imperfections in it. In the case of paper this means that you're cutting &quot;between strings&quot; of polymer and occasionally breaking a bond between two pieces of a single polymer string. Picture a big plate of spaghetti, if you push a knife down the middle of the plate, some of the noodles are going to move out of the way and some of them are going to get cut. That's what's going on when you cut paper, except imagine that your paper is about 400,000 noodles wide.</p>
<p>Metals will tend to break along grain boundaries. It's possible to break it where you want instead of the grain boundary, but if you were to just chisel at a metal you'd tend to break along the grain boundaries. When you cut it with a more precise tool (such as a saw) you're relying on the fact that the connections holding any single atom that you're not directly influencing are stronger than the connections holding onto the atoms you are directly influencing. If you extend the Iron structure I linked to earlier further out and imagine you're cutting a swath out of the middle of it, it's easy to see how there are more connections holding the rest of the atoms together than are holding the atoms you're cutting away.</p>
<p><strong>Why are some materials sharper than others?</strong></p>
<p>The issue here isn't <em>sharpness</em> so much as <em>hardness</em>. Hardness isn't particularly well-defined scientifically, although we know it depends on bond strength and geometry. </p>
<p>Bond Strength: </p>
<p>This is the cumulative force holding together the material. It includes all the <del>intramolecular</del> intermolecular forces we discussed earlier. Iron is stronger than paper in part because iron bonds many more times to itself than paper bonds to itself. The energy it takes to remove a single iron atom is much larger than the energy it takes to remove a single cellulose repeating unit because the iron is better held in place. Bond strength also involves the chemistry of the molecules that are bonding.</p>
<p>Geometry:</p>
<p>Triangles are strong. That's why we use them in <a href="https://mathspace-production-media.mathspace.co/media/upload/images/8-Geometrie/8th-geometry-warren-truss-bridge.jpg" target="_blank">bridges</a> so often. A force on any point distributes the force to the two adjacent sides. Thus, if a grain boundary ends in an edge similar to a triangle, it's going to be able to withstand much more force than a grain boundary that doesn't. It's very hard to get a paper polymer boundary that is triangle-shaped, but it's pretty easy to get an iron boundary that is.</p>
<p>If material A has better bond strength and geometry than material B, then material A is harder and will cut through material B. How much harder A is than B determines how many times you can cut through B before your chunk of A is useless as a cutting tool. (When your A and B come together, A does cut B, but B does some damage to A as well, this is why knives dull with use).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>1) I understand that when I cut things, I am simply breaking the bonds between the molecules. Why then, can't I hold those pieces back together and have them refuse at some point.  Is the gap I created simply too far?</p>
<p>2) Why don't I ever accidentally, given the number of things I cut over my lifetime, ever cut an atom in half and blow up my town?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing is happening at the molecular or atomic level.</p>
<p>The paper is held together by intermolecular (electrostatic) forces. Pretty much every bulk piece of matter, other than metal or crystal, is held together this way.</p>
<p>When you cut with the scissors, you are pulling apart weak bonds between molecules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Top answer is not for 5yo and most of the stuff here is wrong. My attempt:</p>
<p>Paper (and other materials) are made of small chains called molecules. They are bound very closely together with electrical forces. These forces can give up and those molecules separate from each other when you apply some force like with a scissors. </p>
<p>You cannot simply &quot;glue&quot; the pieces together by touching sides because you need them to be incredibly close together so the electrical force is strong enough to hold them together again. You you could, it would work.</p>
<p>And, when you rip paper apart, you're separating these molecules the same way. The only thing scissors do, is help you apply a stronger force along an exact line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
