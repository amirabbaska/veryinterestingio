It just means that there is no known analytical solution for 3 or more bodies. We can still do numerical simulation to an arbitrary degree of precision -- limited only by our computational resources.</p>
<p>The general technique is to calculate the two-body solution on every possible pair of bodies in the simulation, and sum the effects on each body for a given time-step. The number of calculations is proportional to <em>n^2</em>, so it becomes time-consuming very quickly. Various methods are used to approximate the result with less complexity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Basically, once you get enough bodies, you can make good predictions about the general large-scale properties of a system. The path of an individual star might be chaotic, but if you have a system of two hundred billion stars, then this starts to all cancel out, and you can actually start to treat things like a type of fluid (a &quot;collisionless&quot; fluid). This is basically what we do with real fluids - we treat a system of a large number of molecules with some large-scale bulk values. So in these simulations you can't usually say &quot;this is what will happen to the Sun&quot;. But you can say &quot;this is how the stars will form a spiral arm&quot;, even if you can't predict exactly <em>which</em> stars will be part of a spiral arm at any point in time.</p>
<p>There are so many stars (and so much gas and dark matter) that unless a pair of stars happen to basically bump into each other, each star actually feels a gravity force that only changes quite smoothly. So you can do these things with computer simulations and get pretty accurate answers.</p>
<p>Overall, it's actually very similar to weather and climate models. There is a lot of chaos in there, but overall you can actually made decent predictions, especially if you aren't concerned about the tiny details.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Stars and solar systems in a galaxy aren't interacting much, they are way too far apart. Of course, this doesn't really apply to stars in the bulge (the &quot;center&quot; of the galaxy), but when it comes to the disk it is a valid assumption. So it effectively becomes a two-body-problem with a star and the galaxy center.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rotation of a spiral galaxy was thought to be like a whirlpool, with the particles closer to the center having a much faster angular velocity than the stars at the outer boundaries. It was direct doppler shift measurement not too long ago that proved the stars on the galactic rim edge had the same angular velocity as those towards the center. The spiral galaxy is rotating like a solid disk, the spiral arms shaped by gravitational wave pulses. This is what caused the need for the &quot;dark matter&quot; construct.  </p>

<p>In astronomy and physics, it's been calculated versus observed for over 100 years now, theoretical versus empirical. The galaxy rotation was being modeled with Newtonian mechanics. There is a possibility that Newtonian mechanics don't work over very long distances and sizes as it doesn't work for very small distances and sizes.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Galaxies rotate faster than should be possible. The centripetal force should rip them apart (or at least throw most of the stars on the outside away into intergalactic space). We can observe this using the Doppler Effect. The Doppler Effect allows us to observe a change in light based on if an object is moving closer or farther from us. (The Doppler Effect is when a wave looks stretched out or compressed because the source is moving away or closer to us.) If the Doppler Effect is used with a high resolution photo of a galaxy we can observe its rotation, star cluster collisions not following the paths we would expect the matter to go, and large differences between the amount of rotation and the mass of the galaxies. In star cluster collisions the matter did not directly attract and go the paths we expected. This could be explained by a particle that does not interact much trailing behind them. The differences between what we have observed with galaxies and what we measure could be explained if there is large amounts of dark matter in a halo around each galaxy. Estimating the amount of mass is just as easy as the rotation with the right tools. We just need the light it produces, we did not find enough mass to keep to keep the galaxy together.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are long-term unpredictable. We can still predict them in the relatively short term because any perturbations from the true interactions of all n bodies are dominated by the behavior seen from the strongest and most recently relevant interactions.  Over a long period of time these systems will behave chaotically and are unpredictable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
