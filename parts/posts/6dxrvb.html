		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the leftover color when you're trying to balance a system that involves elemental types of damage.</p>
<p>Red has a strong association with fire and heat, and likewise Blue has a strong association with cold, ice and water. Electricity tends to be another very common damage type and is generally tied to the color Yellow -- signs warning about electrical dangers even tend to be bright Yellow.</p>
<p>If you're trying to deal with simple primary colors that leaves you with Green, and a common damage type that's left over once you've made your way through Fire, Ice and Electricity is either Poison or Acid, so those often get relegated to Green.</p>
<p>In short, it's often Fire=Red, Water=Blue, Lightning/Air=Yellow, Poison/Acid/Radiation/Earth=Green.</p>
<p>The concept of using sickly-green or greenish-yellow colors to represent acids and poisons goes back further than that, though. There's a TVTropes article about it: </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Acid=bile=bilious=green.</p>
<p>People have been throwing up for a long time, and have understood  that stomach bile -- which is green/yellow -- is acidic.</p>
<p>edit: I should have put &quot;acidic&quot; in quotes. There's a bunch of literary references going wayyy back that refer to bile as both green and acidic, I'll see if I can dig them up. We're talking a link between poetry about jealousy/vengeance and modern video games, not medical accuracy. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a common trope in movies, long pre-dating video games or D&amp;D as has been suggested here. I don't know how it started, but Disney movies used green to signify evil or danger as far back as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inspired by /u/blubox28 i did some further digging and found the origin story for the Joker in Detective Comics #168 from 1951.</p>
<p>It shows the &quot;Red Hood&quot; (the Joker before he became deformed) falling into a vat of &quot;chemical wastes&quot; which is... <em>green</em>.</p>
