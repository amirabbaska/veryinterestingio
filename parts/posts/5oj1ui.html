<p>Without getting into debits and credits, and the intricacies of double-entry bookkeeping, the prepaid gift card balance is recorded as a liability, more specifically as an unearned (or deferred) revenue line item in the balance sheet. You owe the customer something in exchange for their cash. </p>
<p>While you have collected the funds from the customer, you have not delivered to them whatever good or service you will sell to them (i.e. Revenue) - at least until some point in the future - so it represents potential future sales that you will (likely) make. Pretty simple, really. </p>
<p>The complexity comes up if an individual card (or many cards) gets old and there is indication that it will never be redeemed (think about a lost card...). In this situation, the issuer of the card (seller of goods or services) will make an estimate of the amount of their unearned revenue (gift card) balance that is probable will never be redeemed (sometimes referred to as 'breakage') and recognise that portion in revenue in the current period - essentially free money that they collected a long time ago. The estimates can be complex based on historical redemption patterns and should involve thing like statutory expiration. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an excellent article on exactly how it's accounted for:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.double-entry-bookkeeping.com/deferred-revenue/accounting-for-gift-cards/" target="_blank">http://www.double-entry-bookkeeping.com/deferred-revenue/accounting-for-gift-cards/</a></p>
<p>Basically the payment for the card is entered as a debit under cash, and then an credit entry for the gift card liability is entered.</p>
<p>When you use the gift card, you have a debit against the gift card liability and a credit applied to revenue.</p>
<p>the link above gives some more details about outstanding./unused balances and how some vendors handle it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We had a major electronics retailer (Dick Smith Electronics) go belly-up last year. As the administrators moved in there was a huge backlash when it was announced that customers would not be able to redeem their gift cards as the purchase of the cards was considered a &quot;financial loan&quot; to the company, making a purchased gift card holder just another creditor who had to get in line to be reimbursed. Also want to mention that the store was founded by an exceptional and amazing Australian who sold the chain twenty plus years ago and it was a real shame to see his name tarnished by the new owners. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As said already, the gift cards are recorded as a liability (promise to perform) and revenue is reported when they are used.</p>
<p>The fun part (to use made up numbers) is (a) if you can estimate that 20% of gift cards are never used, you can record 20% as profit right away and (b) you can estimate that 95% of gift cards over 5 years old are never used, and record the other 75% as revenue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on company policy. If done correctly they will record it as an unearned revenue. The company policy comes into play regarding the liability. It can be based on a policy similar to accounts receivable and bad debt. Or they can just leave the liability on the books permanently. Or they can say after a certain time has passed so much is now recorded as a revenue.  This does not mean that your individual gift card is void (that is actually in most states now I believe), it just means the company's general account decreased and moved to a revenue account. </p>
