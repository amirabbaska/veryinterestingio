		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Artificial intelligence is a massive field. Asking how AI works is like asking how animals work. Don't let the down votes dissuade you, though. It's an interesting, expanding field.</p>
<p>If you have 25 mins to spare, this is a nice video on the topic: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILsA4nyG7I0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILsA4nyG7I0</a></p>
<p>Edit: it's worth pointing out that neural networks as discussed in this video are just one field in AI, but I think this a nice introduction to the whole field. Feel free to tell me I'm wrong (with useful links to share!)</p>
<p>Edit 2: might as well throw in a link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/carykh" target="_blank">carykh's channel</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say that you have a set of marbles that are of different weights from 10 to 50 grams (totally made up values here, no idea what a marble actually weighs).  Now let's suppose that you want to find only the marbles that weight between 18 grams and 20 grams.  Of course, we don't want to do this by hand since we have a lot of marbles so instead what we'll do is make something that can make the decision for us.
In this case, we create a path by cutting a groove into a piece of wood that all of the marbles can fit down.  Now, we put in a trap door that only marbles that weight 18 grams or more can fall through and into a new path.</p>
<p>We're half way there!  Now the problem is that the marbles that are too heavy will fall through so we need another trapdoor to only catch the marbles that weigh 21 grams but allow the others to flow through into a bucket at the end of the path.  This bucket will now contain only marbles weighing between 18 and 20 grams.</p>
<p>We would test it by having a test set of marbles where only red ones should end up in the bucket and any other color is incorrect.  After the testing, we would make adjustments to the trapdoors so that only the correct marbles get through. This is called training.</p>
<p>So, in computers, machine learning is exactly this where the trapdoors are nodes that have certain weights applied to them.  If the input passes a certain threshold (the marble is in the right weight range), then the node passes the value onto a certain pathway for further execution.  If we find out that the output isn't what correct, then we go back in and work on the nodes / weighting (trapdoors) so that it works with values that we know to be correct.</p>
<p>This is a very broad topic and this is a super simplified answer which I hope clarifies it for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two broad categories for AI: Decision problems and search/optimization problems.</p>
<p>Examples of decision problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given this state of a chess game, which of the available moves should white make?</li>
<li>Given this huge body of medical data and this patient's symptoms, what diseases is he likely to have?</li>
<li>Given this huge body of historical weather data and the current weather, what's the weather going to be tomorrow?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot of different systems that are used to try to make these decisions.  For games with turns, like chess, it's usually based around evaluating the state of the game at each move to give a score for each player, exploring all of the possible paths the game could take, and choosing the move that maximizes the score.</p>
<p>For things like the medical example, imagine picking two types of data and plotting them in a scatterplot.  For example, age on one axis and BMI on the other.  People with diabetes are generally older, fatter people, so we expect to see diabetics in the top right.  Of course, there are a lot more variables with medical data, so in reality it would be some 50-dimensional scatterplot or something.  There are then lots of different approaches to try to cluster data or draw lines between different groups.  See: decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), and clustering.</p>
<p>Examples of search/optimization problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solve this Sudoku puzzle</li>
<li>Given this road data of the entire world, find a good driving route between LA and NYC</li>
<li>Given the entire internet and this search text, find web pages that are relevant</li>
<li>There's going to be a convention with a lot of talks.  Given this convention center and its rooms and their capacities, and all of the talks and their lengths and projected attendances, figure out how to put it all together.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sudoku puzzle is the only one with a definite &quot;right&quot; answer.  You write a search algorithm that methodically tries all numbers in all open boxes, <em>forward propagating</em> to see if what you've done is still possible, and <em>backtracking</em> when there's a conflict.</p>
<p>The driving one is a little fuzzier, but you can still tell that an answer is at least correct.  There are various graph search algorithms, but they're all based around the idea of exploring all possibilities outwards from the start, focusing attention on the ones that are doing &quot;well&quot;, and throwing out ones that are clearly not working.  See: A*, Dijkstra's algorithm.</p>
<p>Web search is really complicated. Early search engines just looked for pages containing your search text, which allowed people to put a bunch of invisible text on the page to increase result rank. Google made a key observation: pages relevant to the search don't just contain the text, but other pages link to them as a reference. So when you search &quot;dog&quot;, you're not just looking for pages that contain &quot;dog&quot;, you're looking for pages that sites about dogs link to. And that's why Wikipedia is usually a top hit. Google's full algorithm is much more complicated and a tightly-guarded secret, but that's the gist of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the following: </p>
<p>During soccer practice, we learn to kick balls into a net. Success is getting the ball into that net. Failure is everything else. </p>
<p>How do we learn? </p>
<p>Motivation. A coach celebrates our successes and berates your failures. Other pupils internalize this and behave similarly. Getting cheered on feels good. Getting booed feels bad. </p>
<p>So we keep trying. </p>
<p>We kick at the ball, and look where it lands. And we try again, and again, and again. If we lack progress, our coach will give us tips. If we improve, we get promoted. If not, we get rejected and asked to leave. </p>
<p>The coach's tips are like a computer program: we tell the computer how to score success. Us humans have senses to track the ball: a computer program has similar ways. </p>
<p>Why is this intelligence? </p>
<p>Because we update our behaviour based on evaluating rules we get taught, against a changing situation. </p>
<p>A programmer gives a computer rules, too: if this, then that. Fairly simple, but not intelligent. The program chooses from predefined behaviour based on changing situations: it doesn't change its behaviour. </p>
<p>Allowing a computer program to change its behaviour, is what makes it intelligent. There are 2 ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>allow it to adjust known actions based on its senses; </li>
<li>allow it to create new senses and new actions. </li>
</ul>
<p>For instance: you kick the ball. It lands to the right of the net. You adjust by aiming the next ball further to the left. </p>
<p>A computer can be programmed to do the same. Left and right are input parameters, which the computer remembers and simply increases or decreases. </p>
<p>We must however also give it a way to evaluate the success of the adjustment. Did it aim far enough to the left, or not? Or too far? We have senses; a computer can be given a success function, that does the same. </p>
<p>Evaluating that success function and adjusting input parameters to increase success allows us and a computer to get better at a task, without changing how we perform it. </p>
<p>But there's circumstances that existed before we learned to play soccer: </p>
<ul>
<li>we are human; </li>
<li>we walk upright;</li>
<li>we have working legs and eyes; </li>
<li>we are capable of learning. </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of those doesn't match reality, our soccer game will get played differently. </p>
<p>A computer is not limited in the same way. It is, however, limited. So we program in features like memory, watching, evaluating, etc. But we don't give it legs (unless we're building a walking / running robot). </p>
<p>Those features are set: even a learning program won't change those. It requires them to learn in the first place. </p>
<p>But unlike a human, we don't need to restrict computer programs to walking / running / kicking, using just 2 legs, eyes, and a sense of balance. A computer can be allowed to spice things up: </p>
<ul>
<li>what about just 1 leg? or 3? </li>
<li>what about whiskers instead of eyes? </li>
<li>what about guide rails? </li>
<li>what about a funnel? </li>
</ul>
<p>My examples are limited by my imagination. A computer doesn't have to be limited: we can literally let it try anything, as long as that ball gets into the net. And we can let it continue to try, and discard failures, and improve upon successes, without tiring, for months on end. </p>
<p>We can let programs rewrite parts of their own programming. Not all of it: they'd destroy themselves. But just its actions and its success functions. </p>
<p>See, in some programming languages, a function can be composed from sets of rules and behaviours. Those can be mixed, blindly, like allowing a million monkeys to write books for a million years, and aiming to wind up with Shakespeare's MacBeth. </p>
<p>But just like we can adjust our aim based on our senses, a computer program can be allowed to adjust its function composition based on the success and failures of its attempts.</p>
<p>We just have to give it the tools and let it run. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
