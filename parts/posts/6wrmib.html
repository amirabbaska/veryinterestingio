		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yemeni goatherders noticed their goats eating coffee beans and acting up, so they tried them, too. Like a lot of veggies, man figured out roasting can help the flavor, or that it tastes good with a broth. When they felt its effects it was then used to stay awake for night prayers. Check out the great travel-ethnobotany book The Devil's Cup for a really cool history of coffee</p>
<p>Edit: There's been some speculation that the origin was Ethiopia, a theory which has its sources, too, and is close enough to the Arabian peninsula connection most historians pin the origin to. Also, shout-out to Kaldi, the herder who legend says was the one who noticed it; I believe those sorts of legends </p>
<p>Edit 2: Thanks for the gold kind caffeinated stranger!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The history of many foods that are...errr...challenging is largely lost to history. But the easiest explanation is that happy accidents happen. The story of the goat eating coffee beans is apocryphal, but it's probably not far off from the truth. Either the goat or some other animal ate it and a human noticed, or a human was really desperate and tried eating the beans with interesting results. Over time, experimentation led to better ways of processing to get desired results. Drying (as in the case of coffee beans) is a natural because that's one easy, primitive way to store something past its growing season. It's possible that someone tried drying the beans by roasting them over fire, which would have brought out more flavor in the beans than just sun-drying. And coffee is born.</p>
<p>Chocolate needs to be fermented to make it palatable. Again, this is a natural progression. Most organic matter will ferment unprovoked in the right conditions. Chocolate likely began as an accident, and someone liked the results of the accident (or thought the chocolate had potential as food) and started experimenting as well as introducing the foodstuff to other members of the community who also experimented. Those who first consumed chocolate (in Mesoamerica) drank it in unsweetened, fermented form, so it would have been bitter and strong, but Europeans started adding sugar to it and brought chocolate back to Europe. </p>
<p>There are lots of other fun examples mentioned here by other users--in <del>South and Central America</del> Mexico corn was nixtamalized to free up nutrients and make it more digestible (also consider that before corn even became corn as we know it, it went through thousands of years of breeding--initially, it was a wild grass that was extremely labor-intensive to harvest and prepare, so part of the history of any of these foods is intensive breeding and selecting for traits that we--humans--find palatable).</p>
<p>I always think of artichokes too. A spiny thistle that many of us now find extremely enjoyable. How many thousands of years of breeding did it take to get the artichoke into its current, delicious, but still labor-intensive, form? Fascinating stuff to contemplate. My takeaway is that humans are hungry and clever. If it can be eaten, omnivores will find a way.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thank you for my first ever Reddit gold, kind stranger!</p>
<p>EDIT #2: Nixtamalization originated in Mexico. Thank them the next time you enjoy a street taco (which I hope is often).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cocoa beans are surrounded by pulp, and coffee beans are found within a &quot;cherry&quot;. Both of these are edible and consumed by animals. So there were reasons to nibble on them even if you discount the bitterness of the beans.</p>
<p>Humans have also been eating and processing foods for a long time, we've probably tried eating damn near everything on this planet at one point or another. Neither are particularly toxic nor require advanced processing, so they're pretty edible as things go. There may be specific events that lead to cultivation of these, but it's no more strange than the fact that we eat olives or beans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We live in an age of food surplus that man as a whole has never known. Famine and hunger were common problems in our past. People have literally tried to eat every imaginable form of life on our planet in order to avoid starvation.
There is even a protocol for experimenting with unknown plants to see if they can be ingested. Touch your skin, then more and more prolonged interaction until likelihood of toxicity or allergy may be discerned.
The question for me is how many natural foods have we destroyed or forgotten as we moved into a factory farm system?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't see it mentioned here, but for coffee, the legend is that an 8th century Ethiopian goat herder named Kaldi noticed his goats were energetic after eating coffee cherries. He showed the effects of the fruit to a Sufi monk, and the disapproving monk threw the berries into a fire. Kaldi observed a pleasant aroma and thus, roasted coffee was born. Many coffee roasters will name a house roast after Kaldi.</p>
