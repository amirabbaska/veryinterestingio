Does this mean that gay marriage is just recognized federally or do states have to recognize gay marriages also even if they do not want to?</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for all the great responses so far. Keep them coming! Here is a follow-up question: considering that some states have a strong opinion against gay marriage, what can we expect to see these states do in response to this? Are there ways for them to effectively restrict same sex marriage without violating the ruling?</p></div></div>
