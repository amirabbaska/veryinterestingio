		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Was it actually &quot;legalized&quot; or did the supreme court just say it cannot be denied to gay couples? Does this mean that gay marriage is just recognized federally or do states have to recognize gay marriages also even if they do not want to?</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for all the great responses so far. Keep them coming! Here is a follow-up question: considering that some states have a strong opinion against gay marriage, what can we expect to see these states do in response to this? Are there ways for them to effectively restrict same sex marriage without violating the ruling?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without reading into the actual documentation of the Court... which is brutally tough on the eyes... the short answer is - Gay Marriage is now a Constitutional &quot;right&quot; or (rather) the right of marriage has been extended to same-sex couples.</p>
<p>What does that mean?  No State or the Federal Government can make a law that prohibits same sex marriage directly, nor can they create laws that discriminate against same sex couples attempting to get married.  If they were to do so, a court case would follow which would use this decision as a precedent and ultimately result in an overturning of the law.</p>
<p>It wasn't so much &quot;legalized&quot; as incorporated into the already existing rights that every American citizen has via the Constitution.  This is a higher level of law than Congress can make, and certainly higher than the States can.</p>
<p>So the States don't really have much choice, they can keep fighting but the Supreme Court has ruled and they have the final say on these things.</p>
<p>On a side note - This does <em>NOT</em> mean that Churches have to marry a same-sex couple.  This covers the <em>Government/Legal</em> institution of marriage, not the religious one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>Gay marriage is now legal in all 50 states, and cannot be banned. It would take a constitutional amendment to reverse this decision, which will never happen because gay marriage is supported by the majority of the public.</li>
<li>Any gay couple that was married in a state must now be recognized by all other states.</li>
<li>This doesn't mean churches have to do gay marriages, but it does mean that the government must issue marriage licenses to gay couples.</li>
<li>This will afford gay couples all of the same rights that straight couples currently get, like insurance benefits, power of attorney, being able to see your spouse in the hospital, both parents being able to be listed as the legal guardian, as the father or mother, etc.</li>
<li>States that haven't prepared for this eventuality will need to update their paperwork to account for couples of the same sex. Forms that say &quot;husband and wife&quot; will need to now be gender neutral or say something like &quot;husband/wife and husband/wife&quot;. It's not that complicated, other states have done it already and it shouldn't take long, but I wouldn't be surprised to see some stubborn people try and drag it out as long as they legally can.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not American. Wondered how does this interaction work. Is the church completely independant or does it fall under the law? In my country there's official civil marriage and unofficial &quot;church one&quot; that is just a tradition. Is it the same in the US and can the church decline or are they forced under the law?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Question:</p>
<p>Before this ruling, if a gay couple got married in a state, and then moved to a state that did not accept gay marriage, would their marriage have been nullified? How did that work?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It means no state that allows people of the opposite sex to marry can create a law or policy that denies a couple because they are the same sex.</p>
<p>It means that the marital status of same sex couple must be recognized at all level of gov't, and in every state.</p>
<p>It means any existing laws that does so is null and void.</p>
<p>It also means that states who had same sex marriage bans struck down for technical reason cannot create new laws.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are there ways for them to effectively restrict same sex marriage without violating the ruling?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am sure some will try.  My best guess is individual clerks who issue marriage licenses will try to claim it violates their religious freedom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
