<p>Thanks to everyone for the excellent questions! 2.5 hours and I don't know if I've made a dent in them, sorry if I didn't get to yours. Commercial plug: most of these questions are addressed in my new book, Artificial Intelligence: What Everyone Needs to Know (Oxford Press, 2016). Hope you enjoy it!</p>
