The data, from the <a href="http://cms.web.cern.ch" target="_blank">Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)</a> Experiment, are now in the public domain under the CC0 waiver. The datasets include over 100 TB of data from proton collisions at 7 TeV, making up half the data collected by the CMS detector in 2011. The data are provided in the format that is used by CMS scientists for performing physics analyses. We have also provided 200 TB of simulated data (<em>Monte Carlo</em>) generated with the same software version that should be used to analyse the primary datasets. <a href="http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/cms-releases-new-batch-research-data-lhc" target="_blank">Read more about the data release.</a><br><br>A year and a half ago, when we first launched the CERN Open Data Portal, we conducted an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2nxwkb/a_few_days_ago_cern_launched_an_open_data_portal/" target="_blank">AMA about the first release of open data on the portal and about open science in general</a>. Today, we want to talk to you not just about our motivations for making such large datasets available openly and the challenges involved in doing so, but also about how our data are being used for research as well as in education.

It disseminates the preserved output from various research activities, including accompanying software and documentation that is needed to understand and analyse the data being shared.<br><br>&gt; The portal adheres to established global standards in data preservation and Open Science: the products are shared under open licences; they are issued with a digital object identifier (DOI) to make them citable objects in the scientific discourse.<br><br><strong>About CERN</strong><br><br>&gt; <a href="http://home.cern" target="_blank">CERN</a> is the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, located in Geneva, Switzerland. Its flagship accelerator is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which has four main particle detectors: <a href="http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html" target="_blank">ALICE</a>, <a href="http://atlas.cern" target="_blank">ATLAS</a>, <a href="http://cms.web.cern.ch" target="_blank">CMS</a> and <a href="http://cern.ch/lhcb-public" target="_blank">LHCb</a>.<br><br>For updates, news and more, head over to our unofficial home on reddit: /r/CERN!<br><br><strong>CERN projects you can join</strong><br><br>- <a href="http://cern.ch/lhcathome" target="_blank">LHC@home</a><br>- <a href="http://www.higgshunters.org/" target="_blank">Higgs Hunters</a><br><br>---<br><br><strong>EDIT</strong>: Thanks for all your questions, all!
