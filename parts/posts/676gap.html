		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You may give yourself a cue to remember something.  The cue itself is a separate memory.  You may have mentally concentrated more on the cue so you wouldn't forget, than you did on the thing you were trying to remember.  </p>
<p>Example: you have laundry in the washer, and you decide to get started on mowing the yard, but tell yourself to remember to go back in the house and move the laundry into the dryer after you run the lawnmower through one tank of gas.  </p>
<p>Several times as you mow, you think ahead to how much mowing you have left to do, and each time you do, the thought goes through your head that the first time you run out of gas, you must attend another task, and the first step of that task being to go back into the house, that's the part that crosses your mind, and it gets more fixed in your memory.  </p>
<p>Finally, you do run out of gas, you go back into the house, and... you can't recall what it was you were going to do when you got there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once read that the brain changes out a whole set list of pre-conceived notions that come with each room. So let's say, you enter the kitchen. Your brain knows things about that place, ie., you've hit your hip on corner, that hot burner, the threshold is loose, etc, muscle memory takes over for this particular spot in the house. </p>
<p>Now let's say you have reminded yourself to do something once you got in the kitchen, but you were in the bedroom. Your brain shifted gears on you, so that memory that you had in the bedroom became wiped out with the memories that were in the bedroom. Now all your brain is focused on is kitchen brain. That's why when you walk back to the first room it helps you to remember why you came to the current room.</p>

<p>Obviously you know something must have been there, but you can't be quite sure what. </p>
<p>Your brain knows information is missing, but it doesn't have all the existing information necessary to recreate that memory. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every discrete part of a memory is a different part of the set of feelings and experiences you have. </p>
<p>Remembering something isnt actually done till you know what it was you tried to remember.. </p>
<p>Lets say you wanna remember the name of an actor. While the actors face is crystal clear in your mind.. the name just cant come up. </p>
<p>That's because they are located in different places. But the face of the actor will activate the name-memory because you learnt his name in association to his face.</p>
<p>This discrepancy btw.. not remember and immediately remembering is soley on the basis of how strong the correlating pathways are. Degenerating the longer you forgoe re activating them.</p>
<p>This is why memory works so well when you re-read something a little while later. And also why you learn better by re-reading something later. Instead of trying to categorize everything while you read, you only strengthen the categorization on a later time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would like to begin by saying that there are still a lot of unknowns regarding how memory works. There is currently no concrete answer that can be given to answer your question with absolute certainty. There are however various theories regarding this subject. I will try to answer your question using what is known as the Tip of the Tongue (TOT) phenomena.</p>
<p>If you're from an English speaking country or perhaps heard it in a movie or some other place you might have heard of the expression: &quot;It's on the tip of my tongue&quot;. Different languages might have similar expressions. This phenomena applies specifically to lexical access, which means it applies to word retrieval from memory. I'm sure you're familiar with the strong sense you know the word you're looking for, maybe you even remember some parts of it, but for some reason you just can't think of the word. </p>
<p>There's quite a bit of academic study into this phenomena but also still a lot unknown. The exact cause of this phenomena is still unknown but there have been plenty of theories offered in order to try and explain it. I will avoid going through all the theories but try to give you an overview of the two main idea's (1, 2) regarding Tip of the Tongue. </p>
<p><strong>1) The direct-access view</strong> states that when you experience a Tip of the Tongue moment that the memory strength for the word you're trying to recall is not strong enough to be actually recalled from memory. There is however enough strength for a signal in your brain to be sent that triggers the Tip of the Tongue moment e.g. the strong feeling you actually know this. The idea is that you as a person have direct access to the memory of the word if you wish to recall it.</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the theories says that the inability to recall might occur due to incorrect responses coming to mind first and blocking the recall of the actual word you want to recall. This is the so called <em>Blocking hypothesis</em>. Another theory called the <em>incomplete-activation hypothesis</em> states that due to for example a lack of sufficient cue's you are unable to recall the word. Cue's/information can have to do with the way you learned the information or associations you build with the word or what letters the word is composed of or the way it's structured. There are many way's we use cue's to trigger memory recall. A basic example of a (visual) cue is that you learned what an apple or train looks like by seeing examples of trains. The visual cue of seeing an apple or train allows you to recall the word. There are several more theories for the direct-access view but I hope you get the general idea.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2) The Inferential view</strong> states that when you try to remember a word that retrieval from your memory depends on the cue's/information that is available to you and accessible in your memory associated with the word. When you recall a word your brain pieces together all the puzzle pieces it needs to find the word in your memory. These puzzle pieces can be cue's you learned yourself in order to recall the word. This is not limited to visually seeing an example. If your brain is incapable of accessing most or all of the required parts to recall the word from your memory you experience the Tip of the Tongue effect. You could say your brain can not Google Map it's way to the location of the word memory. </p>
<ul>
<li>One of the differences with the direct-access view is that this disregards the idea that the word you're trying to recall is actually present in your memory. You encounter cue's/information in the world that activates a level of recognition, your brain gets a strong sense based on the cue's/information presented it should have an associated word in memory. A strong level of recognition but an inability to find the word memory is what leads to the Tip of the Tongue effect. This is called <em>Cue familiarity theory</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope I sufficiently explained the information to make it understandable. I can not say for certain or generalise that this applies to all types of memory retrieval and the experience/feeling you actually know a certain piece of information but I thought it was a great example to give you a sense of how it works in the area of word recall and the research that is out there. You can use the keyword Tip of the Tongue to look for more information as there's tons of information out there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
