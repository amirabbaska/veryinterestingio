		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You may need a thicker or thinner pillow to maintain a neutral anatomic position while sleeping on your back.  This is based on the thickness of the muscle and fat on your back and shoulders, as well as the angle of your cervical spine.  This neutral and anatomic position can help with breathing while sleeping.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit 4: All the way at the top so you can read it first.
Disclaimer: I am not a <del>doctor nor chiropractor</del> medical professional. While I do have some medical experience, I am in no way qualified to provide medical advice. I am simply sharing what training I've received and my personal experiences either with customers or what I've felt myself. I am doing this of my own free will at the low low price of... wait for it.. free. Yes that was a salesman joke. Now all comments I've expressed are opinionated. Please research this topic yourself before purchasing a mattress. Trust but verify. </p>
<p>I currently work at a Colorado based Mattress Store. While you don't need a mattress or a pillow, it does wonders for hip, neck, back, and shoulder pains. </p>
<p>A properly fitted mattress provides about 2/3rds of your support. The mattress in conjunction with the pillow provides the remaining 1/3rd. I feel that this support is necessary IF you want the best nights rest possible. You can still sleep without it but not optimally. The way it was explained in my training is as follows. </p>
<p>A mattress that is actually fitted to your sleeping habits and body, reduces how much your muscles have to work throughout the night to maintain the natural S curve of your spine. If your muscles work hard throughout the night maintaining this position you tend to wake up with a tense back and/or back pain. The part the pillow plays is also quite important. An improperly fitted pillow typically causes neck pain due to similar reasons. The neck muscles work and are stretched throughout the night from the lack of support. </p>
<p>Please note that this a very general statement and that every person is different as well as the mattress they sleep on. Many people will say that they sleep absolutely amazing on their current mattress that is 40 years old (no exaggeration, true story). However, I used to think that Motorola Razr was the best phone ever. Then I tried something new, the Samsung Note. To be clear, my point is that just because you feel something is the best you've ever experienced doesn't mean you can't experience something better. </p>
<p>Bonus (A few general mattress rules) :</p>
<p>If you are a side sleeper try to avoid firm mattresses. They place a lot of pressure on your shoulders and hips with very little give. This leads to more tossing and turning throughout the night (even if you aren't completely awake/aware). </p>
<p>Adjustable bases, sometimes called hospital beds, are used in hospitals for a reason. They reduce pressure on your body by forming a S curve to help match your spine's curve. Also, they raise your feet above your heart causing increased blood flow to facilitate healing. Why do you think doctors tell you to keep certain injuries elevated? </p>
<p>In regards to pillows, most stomach sleepers need a thin pillow. Side sleepers often need the thickest. The reason for that relates to your shoulders. The pillow needs to be about as thick as the distance from your neck to the edge of your shoulder so that the neck is in line with spine. Back sleepers are often  needing something in the middle. Although almost every customer claims to need the fluffiest fluffernugget of a pillow we have. Very few of them will listen otherwise. So we sell it to them. The customer is always right. No matter how ridiculously wrong they are. </p>
<p>Edit 1: A lot of people have asked about the best pillow for someone who switches between their stomach and side throughout the night. There isn't a specific pillow or really even a best one. What works for me may not work for you. However this is what I personally do:</p>
<p>What worked for me, and <strong>might</strong> work for you is this. I purchased a thin pillow that I was comfortable with on my stomach. Now, most side sleepers end up having an arm underneath the pillow essentially &quot;increasing&quot; the thickness of the pillow to match a so called side sleeper pillow. This worked for me. My arm made up for the missing padding. Again, this is what is good for me. </p>
<p>Edit 2: There has been a fair amount of skepticism regarding the increased blood flow portion of this comment. The medical field is slightly outside my area of knowledge. However, while I am not currently retracting this statement, I am going to research a little more in depth. Hopefully I come back with a more satisfactory explanation. </p>
<p>Edit 3: Wow. Um. Gold. Huh. I really appreciate that! Truly! </p>
<p><em>obligatory first gold comment followed by lame pun</em></p>
<p>Edit 5: There's been a lot more interest on this subject than I expected. I've answered most of the questions at least once, some more. If I haven't addressed yours, the answer may be in another comment. Tonight however, I'm turning in. I may be able to answer some tomorrow morning. Past that, I feel like the subject was been pretty well exhausted. I do wish I every a excellent night's rest! Good night! </p>
<p>Edit 6: Editing the edit. I get it, a lot of people don't like chiropractors. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a physical therapist in a spinal cord injury unit.  Pillows have the same purpose as pressure relief with our spinal cord injury patients.  In the back of the head, there is a boney prominence called the occiput.  If you lay on something hard, the blood in the skin between the occiput and the hard ground surface occludes  and the skin in that area slowly dies if you lay there for long periods without allowing blood flow to be restored.  The entire weight of the head is concentrated on that one small area and so it needs to be supported to prevent occluding blood.  This same event occurs with the hip bones in spinal cord patients as they cannot move their legs to relieve the pressure (thus they use their wheel chairs to recline and adjust gravity pressures through their legs or they lift themselves off the chair to restore blood flow - every 15 minutes).   You will get pressure sores which are the skin between the bone and the surface necrosing.
Basically pillows serve to support the head to allow blood flow to that skin throughout the night and also support the neck musculature while we sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
