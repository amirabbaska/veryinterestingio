		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a problem with your question - &quot;die's instantaneously&quot; isn't the right way to word things, since dying is a process and a spectrum.</p>
<p>What is death, and when is the &quot;macro-organism&quot; considered dead? Both very good questions, without simple answers. A simpler definition would define death as the loss body's ability to maintain the biologic functions necessary for life - a poor definition IMO, since it argues that death is the absence of life.</p>
<p>Before modern medicine, death was the lack of breathing and a heartbeat/pulse. However, with CPR, electrical defibrillation, and medications, we are able to continue oxygenation of the organs, and potentially return a stable heart rhythm. This definition is no longer valid in the modern era.</p>
<p>The modern medical definition separates death into brain death and cardiopulmonary death (the heart and lungs). Death of an organ is defined as <strong>&quot;irreversible damage causing the cessation of function of that organ&quot;</strong>. Death of other organs is possible, but can be (at least partly) medically managed, or does not lead to the immediate cessation of functioning of the organism - e.g. one can live without renal function on dialysis, and complete loss of function of the liver would be a slow &quot;death&quot;.</p>
<p>So instead, let's frame the question differently - how long after the complete interruption of oxygenation do different organs and cells survive? </p>
<p>The most sensitive organ in the body is the brain. A general estimate is that the brain can survive for up to 10 minutes without oxygen, before there is widespread irreversible damage. This timing can be affected by many different factors - e.g. a low body temperature (hypothermia) extends survival, because it decreases the oxygen demands of the tissues. When dealing with hypothermic patients, &quot;you're not dead 'til you're warm and dead&quot;.</p>
<p>Back to the brain, giving a range for hypoxic time until brain death would be safer - I've seen sources give as little as 3 minutes; 10 minutes, as above, seems to be average; and longer is possible in certain scenarios. But the cells of the brain do not die evenly. Neurons (the &quot;most important&quot; brain cell) are the most sensitive to hypoxia, while other cells of the brain can survive longer. Neurons of one specific area (CA1 of the hippocampus, Sommer's area) is most sensitive, and irreversible damage to these cells usually occurs after 3 minutes of hypoxia. During autopsy, looking at these cells can be a helpful clue that significant hypoxia occurred prior to death.</p>
<p>For other organs and tissues, the time from hypoxia to organ death varies; kidney and liver will survive for about 20 minutes, skeletal muscle for an hour and a half, and skin may survive for a few days. The cornea (part of the eye) remains healthy enough for transplantation up to 18 hours after death.</p>
<p>As for bacteria - it probably depends on the type of bacteria. It also depends greatly on the conditions where the body is left. In a warm, moist, oxygenated environment, some species of bacteria will not only survive, but will thrive and multiple - causing putrification of the corpse. These bacteria (or at least their offspring) will survive until the corpse is rotted away to a point were there is no food left for the bacteria. If it is too dry, the bacteria will die, and the body will become mummified. If the body is embalmed, the embalming solution will kill the bacteria.</p>
<p>TL:DR Death is a complicated concept, and is better thought of as a process, rather than a single event. There are different definitions of death, but modern medicolegal definitions define cardiopulmonary death and brain death separately.</p>
<p>Different organs can survive for different amounts of time without oxygen - the brain is the most sensitive organ to hypoxia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IIRC there are more &quot;not you&quot; cells in your body than there are cells with your DNA. We usually consider a person dead when their brain cells have been deprived of oxygen long enough to be irrecoverable. </p>
<p>That being said, the sack of organisms that comprise you don't much care how the overall macro organism is doing and, if they can, opportunistically take advantage of any situation that benefits them. Septic shock is usually caused by body waste entering the blood circulatory system, but those organisms that are now killing you would be totally innocuous if kept in your digestive tract.</p>
<p>So you die with your brain, your cells die as they are then deprived of oxygen or nutrients, but the greater biomass that is you is more than happy to cannibalize the rest of you and keep going in the greater biosphere if possible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bacterial population will never die but the species present will evolve after all remains are disappeared.</p>
<p>Cell death begins when circulation stops. The body's oxygen stores (bound to hemoglobin in blood and myoglobin in muscle) will be largely depleted in a few minutes. At that point cells switch to anaerobic metabolism which is very wasteful and inefficient. Also produces much acid from glycolysis, acidifying cytoplasm. This buggers enzyme systems. Low pH inhibits ion pumps and this where the dying picks up speed. As ATP is depleted, ions enter the cells down their concentration gradients, spoiling the membrane potential, taking the cell closer to its environmental composition. Such cells are moribund and will soon die. If death was peaceful (no agonal struggle) in a warm place, the process of cell death would be largely complete in most organs within an hour. Brain function would have ceased within a few minutes, fat cells much later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
