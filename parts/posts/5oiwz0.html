Eventually, the convention became more standardized, and Q remained only when directly before a /w/ sound, which is represented by U/V in Latin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its called a digraph. Qu makes the /kw/ sound in the English language. You can thank Latin origins and the Greeks for that. There are a lot of words that have Q without a U after it, but they are mostly in Semitic languages.  Qatar, burqa, qabab.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a french variation for the same sound produced by the Kw cluster. We just don't see it written that way in english because the german/old norse heritage didn't have that sound. It was a latin character that sounded a bit like a K, such as in the word Plaque, but otherwise wasn't used until the french invasion. </p>
<p>In theory, Qu could be thought of as it's own letter, since it's really only used in that one way, Kind of like the Æ (Strong I sound) that we don't use anymore. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This spelling convention originated from Latin / French (which originated from Greek), and through a series of phonological changes over time, the letter <q> only appeared before the letter <u> to represent the /k/ sound. Then, behind other vowels, the letter <u> in this digraph became silent.</p>
<p>Now, QU as a digraph represents the /k/ sound before certain vowels in French, in particular: que, quelle, quoi (which is &quot;kwah&quot; but the &quot;w&quot; sound comes from the &quot;oi&quot; NOT the &quot;u&quot;), or quinze. When English acquired words from French and Latin which utilized this QU digraph, the unfortunate tendency was to pronounce what should have been a silent <u>. Hence words like &quot;quadruple&quot; and &quot;quotation&quot; are pronounced /kwadrupəl/ and /kwoteʃən/ in English but in French they are /kadʀupəl/ and /kotasjɔ̃/.</p>
