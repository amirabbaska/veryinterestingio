The position of Neptune was predicted using the unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus by Urbain Le Verrier, and was observed shortly after that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rutherford predicted the neutron in 1920. He was wrong about its composition, but it was nonetheless discovered in 1932 (though first generated in 1931).</p>
<p>The neutrino was predicted by Pauli in 1930, coincidentally also called the neutron in the theoretical literature. The neutrino was detected in 1956.</p>
<p>General Relativity was formaly presented by Einstein in 1915 with many predictions. Specifically, light bending consistent with GR was first observed in 1919, gravitational redshift was observed in 1954, and frame dragging was finally confirmed in 2011.</p>
<p>Richard Feynman offered a theoretical proof that gravitational waves could be detected in 1957 (this had been in debate since 1893), and they were finally directly observed in 2016.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The value of the speed of light was discovered while they were observing Jupiter moons. When the Jupiter was close to earth the moons were ahead of schedule and when it was further from the Earth the moon orbits were behind the schedule. They were able to calculate the schedule of Jupiter moons using newly discovered Newton's laws of gravitation and calculus.</p>
<p>I will let Richard Feynman do describe it better than I can: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9F8Wn4vf5Y" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9F8Wn4vf5Y</a> See at about 3:50</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
