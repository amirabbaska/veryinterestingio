		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's still just one drain for a sink. The overflow is just getting water to the route it would if the drain wasn't plugged.</p>
<p>For a toilet, if the drain is plugged the flow of water is going to be stopped (or slowed) entirely. An overflow drain would end up just as backed up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apparently, overflow-proof toilets already exist. <a href="http://www.penguintoilets.com/" target="_blank">Sauce</a>. As a justification, sinks and bathtubs are designed to be plugged purposefully, and the overflow drain prevents this intentional blockage from causing a mess. In contrast, a toilet is not designed to be intentionally plugged.</p>
<p>EDIT: There's also already an overflow-sensing shutoff system. <a href="http://aquaone.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Toilet-Guardian-Specifications-Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">Sores</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question.... A secondary pipe that is ran alongside the main toilet drain or even molded onto the side of the entire pipe would solve this issue. Problem is if toilet paper were to get into the smaller overflow drain unclogging that might be a bit harder. But having a backup would be the best thing... Source?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Toilets are different than sinks in that they have an integral trap in them.  You can usually see how what you flush has to go up and then down the drain.  Having an overflow for a toilet would bypass this trap, and nasty sewer gas would come out all the time. </p>
<p>Sinks have a separate trap installed underneath them.  The overflow uses the same piping as the main drain, but is really only meant to be used if the stopper gets left in accidentally.  If you have a clog, it will still flood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea of having a overflow channel is a good idea. Most of the older style toilets get plugged in the start of the s shape. The overflow channel could drain behind the usual location of the blockage.</p>
<p>One note though, the new toilet design is WAY better and gets blocked far less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
