		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not about mass, but span being significant in relation to the size of the Earth.  There is no &quot;critical&quot; point.</p>
<p>The moon has its own gravity that affects us on Earth, to a <em>small</em> extent.  The sun also creates tides, but to a lesser extent.  Tides flow to a new &quot;sea level&quot; when the body of water stretches far enough to experience significantly different gravity at different points.  </p>
<p>The Great Lakes are not really wide enough for a noticeable tide, but it is still measurable, 5cm from max-min you could ever get.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All bodies of water experience tides - changes in water level due to gravity - but most are far too small for this change to be measureable. On smaller bodies of water, the water level is much more significantly impacted by the weather (which makes measuring tides much more difficult). So there's no hard cutoff, only our ability to measure. </p>
<p>The Great Lakes are near the lower limit for measuring tides. <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/gltides.html" target="_blank">According to NOAA</a> the largest tide in the Great Lakes is less than 5cm. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It actually has nothing to do with mass but with surface area, technically every liquid will experience the tide but for most it is so insignificant as to be unmeasurable.</p>

<p>tldw: Tides happen because the Earth is (effectively) a continuous ball of water. And while the moon's gravity is insignificant at any one point, over the span of the entire globe the tangential pressure is enough to <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Rmp8F93.png" target="_blank">'push' the tides out along the Earth-moon line.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All bodies of water experience tidal <em>forces</em>; but in order to produce the sort of ocean tides with the dynamics we’re familiar with it would have to (a) be large enough to contain waves with a resonant frequency of twelve hours (half a lunar cycle), and (b) cover enough of the earth’s surface to experience a Coriolis effect. So several hundred kilometers at a minimum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The net forces due to the moon's gravity are largely parallel to the surface of the Earth. So it's more about pulling water sideways than up/down. As such, a body of water needs a large surface extent for large tides to develop. Consequently, large tides are also caused in places where such a flow is channelled (or, perhaps, funnelled) into a smaller area.</p>
