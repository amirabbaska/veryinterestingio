		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If vitamin D had such a direct impact on height, you could take vitamin D supplements (which do work to replace sun-derived Vitamin D for people who don't produce enough themselves) and it would increase your height. It doesn't.</p>
<p>A deficiency of vitamin D can prevent proper bone development, but outside of those conditions it doesn't &quot;control&quot; height or growth speed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You need <em>enough</em> vitamin D to grow healthy bones, but having more than you need doesn't lead to even longer bones. People from northern countries can still produce vitamin D (having pale skin helps) and also receive it from food like oily fish.</p>
<p>More generally, while it's true that malnutrition leads to stunted growth, getting more food than you need basically just leads to people getting fatter. Vitamins that dissolve in water just get excreted if you take in more than you need, while vitamins that dissolve in fat can sometimes cause health problems if you take too much.</p>
<p>Some Northern European countries do show higher rates of osteoporosis though, which may be related to vitamin D. The height differences between regions are largely genetic - diet doesn't explain men being 2 inches taller in Bosnia than the US! There are identifiable genetic characteristics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_I-M170" target="_blank">e.g. see here</a> that are associated with height and occur differently across countries. It's hard to say exactly why these differences occur, but it might be because of temperature (it's easier to stay cool if you're smaller/warm if you're larger), physical demands of hunting large animals vs farming (tall people are stronger but need more food) or sexual selection (preference for tall mates varies regionally).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're tall because of their diets. The Nordic countries have been eating well since World War II, and their diets consist of a good mix of vegetables, fish, meat and fruit, plus lots of high-protein staples. School kids in the Nordic countries are served hot, balanced lunches every day.</p>
<p>Vitamin D is not the sole contributor to height. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
