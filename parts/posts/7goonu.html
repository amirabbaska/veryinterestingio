<p>Regardless of this, if there is universal expansion in some way and the direction that the universe is expanding is every direction, would that mean that the universe is expanding like a sphere?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a 2D example. Take a semi-inflated balloon. Glue a bunch of pennies on the surface of the balloon. The 2D surface of the balloon is an analog to our universe. If someone starts blowing up the balloon even more, each of the pennies is moving away from each other, and the surface area of the balloon is expanding. From our 3D perspective, we can see the shape of the balloon. But if your entire universe is the 2D surface of the balloon, it doesn't really have a shape. It just is. And somehow, it's expanding. </p>
<p>You can take the same principles, and add another dimension to be our universe. The planets and stars and galaxies are all of the pennies glued to the surface of the balloon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people say that the universe is expanding in all directions, they don't merely mean <em>at its edges</em>. The universe is expanding everywhere all at once. Galaxies aren't really moving apart from one another, the space between them is expanding. If we removed that expansion from their velocities they would be practically standing still.</p>
<p>All of the images that you see of the Big Bang show a spherical explosion, but that's greatly simplified for the masses. Remember that what is inside that &quot;sphere&quot; is <em>everything</em>. It's the whole universe. It's impossible to look at it from the outside because there is no concept of &quot;outside the universe&quot;. The idea of what it looks like from the outside is meaningless.</p>
<p>Why do all those animations show a sphere then? Well, in part because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle" target="_blank">Cosmological Principle</a>, which says
that the universe looks the same no matter the direction we look, and the natural way to depict that is with a sphere (and because <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/112805/why-is-everything-spherical/" target="_blank">sphere shapes are very common in space</a>), but that's not the way that real explosions work. Even the most perfectly packed explosions don't generate perfectly spherical shockwaves.</p>
<p>Importantly, there would be no way for us to tell if the universe is shaped like, say, a giant chicken, because spacetime has no edges. We could be hip deep in chicken guts, but if we never see any feathers, we'd assume it's guts all the way down.</p>
<p>TL;DR - The universe isn't expanding at its edges because it has no edges, and the concept of what it looks like is meaningless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The universe is (theorized to be) infinite in extent, so it's not really 'spherical' in shape. it may be easier to think of expansion as a 'reduction in density over time.'</p>
<p>The observable universe, however, is an expanding spherical volume. But this doesn't represent any sort of true physical boundary, so much as the volume of universe from which light has had time to reach us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. But yes, and no. Content can expand in any direction regardless of the shape of the container, so the type of expansion should not be proportionate to the shape of it. </p>
<p>We tend to think in spheres when it comes to the universe because when it comes to space exploration, Earth has always been the starting point, or rather our solar system, we can only explore what is going on up to a certain distance in any direction from a 360 degree starting point, this is why the famous image of ''the visible universe'' is actually in shape of a circle. </p>
<p>There is another theory going on, in which the universe is shaped like a doughnut, instead, the cross section is still circular, but if you keep going and going and going, you will eventually end up in the place you started. Problem with that theory is... what IS in the middle of the doughnut? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
