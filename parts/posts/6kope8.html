		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>first, a branch grows off of the main trunk. then, as the tree ages, the main trunk gets thicker by adding layers on the outside. so a knot is what used to be a small branch of the tree that got cemented inside the trunk as the trunk got larger. </p>
<p>the knots are harder for multiple reasons.
-they feel harder to a saw blade because their grain is running in a different direction
-their grain is often more tightly packed than the rest of the wood, due to the tree &quot;growing into itself&quot;
-there is often more sap in the knots and this is just what i've found, and have no idea why </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Edit: as to why its harder, i dont know 100% but id bet its got something to do with the grain in the wood changing and possible friction from the expansion of the diameter of the branch itself</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This image from Giuseppe Penone artwork shows the young tree branches incorporated into the mature tree. Those branches become knots in the tree when cut into boards. They are harder because they are older, denser, and contain more resin.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the tree a knot is either the base of a side branch or a dormant bud. A knot (when the base of a side branch) is conical in shape (hence the roughly circular cross-section) with the inner tip at the point in stem diameter at which the plant's vascular cambium was located when the branch formed as a bud.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
