		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Camouflage is mediated through two channels: i) hormonal and ii) neuronal.  Hormonal pathways operate on the order of hours-days, whereas neuronal pathways are rapid (8 seconds in the fish I observe).  I am not familiar with octopus in general, but with flatfish, the mechanisms driving their camouflage remain persistent over time given a stable environment.   Octopus are capable of adding a three dimensional component to their crypsis (mimicking seaweed texture, etc.) which is muscular, and I imagine would experience fatigue like any other muscle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes they would, and good question! Octopus and cuttlefish camouflage is controlled by their muscles, so it costs them energy like using any other muscle they have.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that camouflage is always relative to the environment that an organism is in. Let's say an octopus at rest is yellow in colour and is in a yellow environment. They would not have to change their color at all because they already blend into the environment perfectly well.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think people answering questions are missing the boat. To me, OP's question is asking &quot;Does an octopus get tired while <strong>maintaining</strong> a camouflaged state.&quot; </p>
<p>Some answers partially hit on this, by saying some octopus defenses require muscular use which would imply fatigue over time to hold the change to their skin texture.</p>
<p>I haven't yet heard if there are some defense mechanisms that act more like &quot;e-ink&quot; where it takes energy to shift the skin pattern but no energy to maintain once it's changed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cool fact. Cuttlefish can also polarize their skin causing what would be invisible flashes in the water. Other cuttlefish (maybe even other squid and octopus) can see this and it is a great way for one to warn the others of near by danger without the predator knowing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do creatures possessing this active camo ability have the ability to recognize themselves and therefore know that they do or don't blend in to their environment or is it a response that occurs when they're scared regardless I'd the background they are against.
Tl;dr Would a yellow cuttlefish use its active camo when it's startled even when it's already blended into a yellow background?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
