		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Personal genomics is a reality now in humans, with 8 million people expected to buy direct-to-consumer kits like 23andme and AncestryDNA this year, and more and more doctors using genetic testing to diagnose disease and determine proper treatment. Not only does this improve health outcomes, it also represents a trove of data that has advanced human genetic research and led to new discoveries.</p>
<p>What about dogs? My lab at <a href="https://www2.vet.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell University</a> focuses on canine genomics, especially the genetic basis of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10460" target="_blank">canine traits and disease</a> and the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/44/13639" target="_blank">evolutionary history of dogs</a>. We were always a bit in awe of the sample sizes in human genetic studies (in part from more government funding but also in part to the millions of people willing to buy their own DNA kits and volunteer their data to science). As a spin-off of our work on dogs, my brother and I founded <a href="https://embarkvet.com/our-story/" target="_blank">Embark Veterinary</a>, a company focused on bringing the personal genomics revolution to dogs.</p>
<p>Embark's <a href="https://embarkvet.com/careers/" target="_blank">team of scientists and veterinarians</a> can pore over your dog's genome (or at least 200,000 markers of it) to decipher genetic risks, breed mix, inbreeding, and genetic traits. Owners can also participate in scientific research by filling out surveys about their dog, enabling canine geneticists to make new discoveries. Our first new discovery, the genetic basis of blue eyes in Siberian Huskies, was <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article/?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007648" target="_blank">published this month</a> in <em>PLOS Genetics</em>.</p>
<p>I'll be answering questions starting around 2:30 ET (1830 GMT), so unleash your questions about genomics, dogs, field work, start-ups or academia and AMA!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to your research and the existing body of literature, would you say dogs are directly descended from <em>Canis lupus</em>, or from a shared common ancestor that has since gone extinct?</p>
<p>As a followup, if it's the 2nd one, are some wolf subspecies worthy of classification as another species (Himalayan/Indian wolves in particular) if they are found to have diverged at a similar time?</p>
<p>Also, have you ever done any coyote genetics work, particularly with Dan Bogan's NYS coyote project?</p>
<p>I'm a CALS alum currently in grad school for an MSc in conservation bio and I am wondering if a lack of coursework in population genetics will be an issue when applying to PhD programs or if I'll just have to take grad-level courses in it to catch me up. Currently my school doesn't offer grad-level population or conservation genetics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
