		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you look at scales above the size of superclusters, space seems to expand at the same rate in any point of the observable Universe, as far as we can tell. This means more precisely that uniform expansion is a good fit for the available data and introducing inhomogeneities does not actually help reproducing that data better, so for the sake of simplicity (or Occam's razor if you want) we state the Universe on cosmological scales is homogeneous, a fact which is part of the Copernican principle.</p>
<p>However, there is no reason for this to hold to arbitrarily large scales. Perhaps the Universe along with its expansion rate <em>is</em> inhomogeneous over lengths much larger than the radius of the observable Universe. There is really no way for us to know experimentally, but it is also not an idea to be discarded - some theoretical models of cosmology generate this type of inhomogeneous &quot;bubbling&quot; universes, an interesting example being eternal inflation.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is some indication that the universe is flowing in a particular direction  -  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_flow" target="_blank">Dark Flow</a> which happens to be in the same direction as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Attractor" target="_blank">Great Attractor</a>.  However this flow is not caused by the Great Attractor.   The source of the flow resides outside of the observable universe.  This dark flow is believed to be a remnant of some influence prior to inflation.     </p>
<p>Here's a good space time video on it:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The crucial thing to understand is that the measure of expansion is not speed but a &quot;rate&quot;. Meaning that over a given distance, for every unit of time that passes, space expands by a certain amount: ~72 km/s per megaparsec (a parsec is about 31 trillion km).<br />
This means that the actual speed of separation between two points in space depends on the initial distance between those points: over twice the distance, the speed is twice as large. Over very large distance that speed can exceed the speed of light.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
