		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually when engineers say something will last for X years, it means that the thing has 95% (for example) chance of still working after X years. It doesn't mean that as soon as the X years have passed the satellite will stop working. This is something people often don't understand when they are talking about planned obsolescence. </p>
<p>For satellites there are a couple of limitations on the lifespan on top of stuff just breaking up. First is the propulsion. In geostationary orbit you need a bit of propellant to correct for perturbations caused by the moon and the sun gravitational pull as well light pressure. When the propellant runs out the satellites are placed into a graveyard orbit so that they are out of the way of other satellites. Sometime thrusters perform better than expected, or the rocket is extra precise in its launch so you end up having spare propellant and you can extend the mission. </p>
<p>Another thing that happens as satellites age is the degradation of solar panels and batteries. The solar panels lose efficiency when they are struck by radiation and cosmic rays.</p>
<p>Lastly sometime the mission duration is tied to the money needed to operate a satellite. To extend a mission you need money to pay the people in charge of the mission. The ground equipment can be very expensive too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A very narrow field in the radio amatuer hobby is talking to dead satelites. Occasionally when the batteries wear out on a satellite, a few of them still work when they are in the sun and sufficiently angled as they tumble to run on solar panels alone. The oldest one I know of is the Transit 5B-5 (Military Navigation) from 1964.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>Everything should last longer than planned or you've failed in your mission.   </p>
<p>The &quot;expected lifespan&quot; is the minimum.</p>
<p>Lasting far longer (Meteosat-7, Spirit, Opportunity and later Curiosity Mars Rovers) are real exceptions to the case, but every electronic device we launch into space on a rocket is expected to function beyond it's listed lifespan.</p>
<p>It's considered to have been worth the massive amount of money spent to make it if it functions properly up to that expected lifespan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what /u/electric_ionland has written,</p>
<p>When researchers say things like: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The satellite was supposed to stay in geostationary orbit for only 6 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They don't mean that at 6 years they expect it to come down, or at 6 years+1 day they expect it to fail. </p>
<p>It more precisely means that they anticipate 6 years of relatively consistent function and funding for the project (including personnel). It also means that after 6 years, the goals of the project can be considered &quot;met&quot;. </p>
<p>This is key because you always need to present a scientific justification for putting a satellite (equipped with specific sensors and capabilities) into orbit, so you need to be able to plan out what you're going to do with it. An anticipated 6-year lifespan means that they can plan experiments and analysis of data for 6-year (or less) experiments, but any project that requires 10+ years would be risky. For example, if they want to collect data on a specific comet or distant planet - the planetary body and satellite sensors need to be aligned during the timeframe of anticipated function. For multiple measurements, they need to be aligned multiple times. Or if you need weather data for X years in order to validate the &quot;fit&quot; of your statistical weather model, you need to ensure that you'll get X years, not X-2. If you'll only get X-2 years, you need to adapt your model or find an alternative data source as this is not one that can be counted on to give sufficient power. Logistics for &quot;competing&quot; projects need to be planned out so that the right measurements are made and data goes to the right people in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>In addition, they factor in anticipated technological advances on the ground. For example, a geosynchronous satellite launched 20 years ago may only be able to relay low-resolution static images, while a satellite launched today can relay high-resolution video. So the old tech may not have failed, but has outlived it's usefulness. </p>
<p>Funders (ex. governments) and leadership are willing to consider proposals launching a new satellite only after (1) the first one was actually useful, and (2) the agreed-upon timeline for technology upgrades is reasonably met.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Engineers make stuff really tough so it can survive those extreme conditions, and sometimes they make it tougher than it needs to be for the planned operational lifespan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
