<p>Then the second person measures the momentum, leaving the particle in a state of well-defined momentum, and totally spread out position.</p>
<p>The second measurement destroys the results of the first one, so that you don't know them both simultaneously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One physicist would measure, say, position x=1.230012312390000m, and the other physicist would measure, say, velocity v=1570.0002340103490923409134013490 km/s.</p>
<p>However, the key point in quantum mechanics is that if the two physicists were to <em>repeat</em> the experiment on an <em>identically prepared</em> electron, they would get <em>different</em> results! Quantum mechanics allows for measurement outcomes with different probabilities. Sometimes, one physicist gets this value, and sometimes another that value, even though the electron was prepared identically. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the <em>spreads</em> (uncertainties) of the measurements of position and momentum are connected by an inequality, which says that they cannot be arbitrarily small simultaneously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simultaneous measurement of multiple, non-commuting observerables, such as position and momentum, is not prevented by the uncertainty principle. [<a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.1287" target="_blank">1</a>, section 3, <a href="http://www.kevinaylward.co.uk/qm/ballentine_ensemble_interpretation_1970.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>; <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003491663902641" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="http://www.statintquant.net/siq/pdf/margenau_measurement_quantum_II.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>; <a href="http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130717/srep02221/full/srep02221.html" target="_blank">3</a>].</p>
<p>The uncertainty principle prevents something different. If you measure the position and momentum of a million particles as precisely as you would like, and let them go, and then some time later measure their position and momentum again, then the statistics of the second measurement will be such that the product of the standard deviation of the position and momentum is not less than hbar/2. That is, knowing everything about a particle now does not allow you to perfectly describe the position and momentum of the particle in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of answers here are touching on the observer effect, but the uncertainty principle doesn't need require the observer effect to hold. An electron is a wave packet, and part of being a wave demands that certainty in position undermines certainty in momentum and vice-versa. This is just the way an electron is. If the wave packet is scrunched up, its position is more certain, and if it's spread out, its momentum is more certain. If someone creates an experiment that measures position very precisely, the experiment must force that wave to be scrunched up, which causes momentum uncertainty. You simply can't force the wave to be spread out and scrunched up at the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
