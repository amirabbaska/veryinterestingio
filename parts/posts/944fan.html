		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Game Genie's worked a little different depending on each system because each system treated cartridges a little different.</p>
<p>In general a Game Genie was designed to sit between the console and the cartridge and when the console asked the cartridge for data the game genie could secretly change it before passing it back to the console.</p>
<p>So for example you have a game where you start with 3 lives. That number 3 exists somewhere in the data or code on the cartridge. Let's assume the number 3 is stored at the 5000th byte of the cartridge's data bank. On the Game Genie you'd enter a code like &quot;50 00 99&quot;. This would tell the genie that every time the console tried to load the number from address 5000 to send back a value of 99 instead of what was really there. Now when a new game starts you have 99 lives because that's the number the console recieved.</p>
<p>While that code is obvious in its meaning the genie usually used scrambled codes in a known way, so for example you might actually enter the code &quot;90 05 09&quot; and it would get unscrambled into the more meanful code.</p>
<p>Different consoles had different ways of working. On the NES the cartridge was linked directly into the CPU bus in such a way that it could control <em>all</em> memory, not just the cartridges (this allowed NES cartridges to enhance the original hardware, not just provide game data) by routing any memory access through the cartridge pins first. This means that the cartridge could even override the data in the consoles built in ram. </p>
<p>So Game Genie codes for the NES might do things like &quot;hold&quot; a byte. What this means is that it essentially kept a value in RAM locked - attempts to change it wouldn't work. So you have a place in ram where health was stored and when health reached 0 you are supposed to die. The game genie could just hold that value at 99 and now you are invincible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In normal operation (no Game Genie) the console will ask the cartridge what the rules of the game are (how many lives you get, how high you jump, etc).  The cartridge will then provide those rules and values to the console, which proceeds to create the game on your tv.</p>
<p>What the Game Genie does is what for the console to ask for certain information, at which point it jumps in and gives the console a wrong value.  The console can't tell the difference between the cartridge and the Game Genie, so it just accepts this erroneous value.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you get down to any software, whether that is a video game or even the operating system running your phone or PC, they all use memory.  Memory is a collection of circuits that all have the same purpose, and that is storing stuff.  Kinds of storage range from volatile memory, which is memory that loses its value when powered off, to long term storage like hard disks and solid state drives.</p>
<p>I'm guessing how they work, but this is probably how I'd attempt to do something like this if I were to write a game genie (or a trainer program).  You'd probably get a copy of the game, and then you'd do something called &quot;disassembly&quot; on the program.  From there, you reverse engineer the game to some extent to figure out where certain values of the game get modified.  When you load a game from a CD, or even just long-term storage like your hard disk or solid state drive, what happens is the code gets copied into a part of the system's memory.</p>
<p>So, for instance, if you're playing a game like Final Fantasy, and you want to modify your character's strength value, what you'd probably need to do is dig into the code and find the function (a chunk of code that gets ran to achieve a certain result) that modifies your character's strength.  Then you'd do something called &quot;code injection&quot; where you modify the code that will next be called to instead call your function where it sets the character's strength to whatever you wanted it to be.  You'd then make it so that your code returns to where it was previously executing (running) as to not crash the program.</p>
<p>When you next get into battle in your game, and your character attacks the enemy, what's going to happen is the game will likely do some random number generation to figure out if you hit, if you critically striked, if the target has damage reduction, and so on, then it'll take your character's strength, and use that as a multiplier of some form, and calculate the damage inflicted to the target.</p>
<p>The next time you say the game, your character's information will be saved, and the changes made by the game genie will be made permanent and you won't need to load the cheat again.</p>
<p>By the way, if you're curious, this it totally off topic, but this is a software exploitation technique.  It has been used in some fairly notorious software vulnerabilities.  Having your program be easily manipulated to do things it normally doesn't do is not a desirable effect for the person developing the software.  If you did something like this to a game you're playing online with other people, giving you an unfair advantage, it obviously is cheating.  There are all kinds of safeties put into place now to prevent data manipulation on game servers to prevent this very thing.  It's probably also the reason why you don't see game genies for modern games anymore, the developers got smart and figured out redundancies to prevent players from cheating :)</p>
<p>This is just my two cents, I don't know if that's actually how game genies worked or not, but it's my best guess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
