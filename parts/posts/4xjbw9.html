<p>It looks like a team from Duke were able to train subjects with paralysis using VR headsets each day to slowly allow them to recover some(?) movement/sensation. </p>
<p>Even if it was a small amount it is stil really impressive, but what I don't understand is &quot;how&quot; this works? </p>
<p>Does this only work for certain types of paralysis? (i.e. if the spinal cord is severed surely there is no chance of any repair without surgery/physical treatment?)</p>
<p>If this works, could it be rolled out without the need for a treatment team? i.e. an app + headset would allow anyone who fits the criteria to benefit?  </p>

<p>It seems that the improvement in function and sensation was an unexpected side benefit. I think in most paralyzed people the spinal cord is not severed, just damaged.</p>
<p>It's not clear whether there would be a benefit to just doing the VR training, or if they need to use the exoskeleton to see these improvements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a neuroscientist.. but I am a molecular biologist who got a spinal cord injury about nine months ago and have been doing research into this.
The short answer is: no one knows.
The long answer is: seven out of eight of the patients in this study were ASIA A -- meaning complete -- paraplegics. Think no sensation or motor activity below the level of lesion. This is usually caused by a complete severing of the spinal cord. The dogma is: there is pretty much no regeneration capacity of the central nervous system. Doctors would not expect this to happen. These patients went from being completely wheelchair bound (for years with no improvement) to being able to use a walker. I think our understanding of the nervous system and the methods we can use to get it to heal are very limited. This is a great step in the right direction. It shows the potential is there! It must be an amazing new hope to all those with a complete SCI who hear the doctors say that: this is it, nothing we can do. </p>
<p>Also, I think this is a <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160811101008.htm" target="_blank">good summary</a> of the article with some context and some hypothesis on the mechanism.
One of the authors suggest that even in patients that have complete paralysis, some small number of fibers remain intact. The hypothesis is that with VR, patients can be trained to use them for walking, etc. There is no evidence to support this hypothesis, though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stroke rehabilitation is an ideal candidate for VR therapy. Neural pathways in your brain that controlled your body, become damaged. You have to learn how to walk, and use your arms again.</p>
<p>The most common therapy is mirror-box therapy (psychological), and physiotherapy (physical). Both have good results. VR therapy would come under psychological, if a user thinks &quot;move arm&quot;, and the virtual arm moves, this is a positive feedback response and helps encourage the development of the neural pathways.</p>
<p>Here's a video of my crappy VR stroke rehab system I made for a university project <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGF9glShH6U" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGF9glShH6U</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
