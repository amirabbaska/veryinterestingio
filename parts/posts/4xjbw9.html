<p>It looks like a team from Duke were able to train subjects with paralysis using VR headsets each day to slowly allow them to recover some(?) movement/sensation. </p>
<p>Even if it was a small amount it is stil really impressive, but what I don't understand is &quot;how&quot; this works? </p>
<p>Does this only work for certain types of paralysis? (i.e. if the spinal cord is severed surely there is no chance of any repair without surgery/physical treatment?)</p>
<p>If this works, could it be rolled out without the need for a treatment team? i.e. an app + headset would allow anyone who fits the criteria to benefit?  </p>
