		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a star out there, called <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2125615-oddball-star-could-be-home-to-long-sought-superheavy-elements/" target="_blank">Przybylski's</a> star, that is currently defying any explanation as its spectral signature indicates it is regularly being supplied with short-lived transuranic elements, including  elements with atomic number ranging from 89 to 103, such as actinium, plutonium, americium and einsteinium.  It might be the case that these elements are produced by the decay of extremely heavy elements including ^298 Fl, ^304 Ubn, or ^310 Ubh.</p>
<p>Some speculate that the presence of those elements suggests <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/astrowright/2017/03/16/przybylskis-star-iii-neutron-stars-unbinilium-and-aliens/" target="_blank">extraterrestrial intelligence</a>.  Aliens dumping 'impossible' elements into a star to let everybody know they're there.  This was proposed as a method of communication by Carl Sagan decades before the discovery of this star.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question: What's the heaviest element fused? Is it off the periodic table? For example, I see that the periodic table goes up to 118 but that just implies it's the heaviest thing we've synthesized/discoverd right? Could there be an element with for example an atomic number of 500 that was fused due to the extreme conditions?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stellar synthesis ends the instant a star begins fusion to iron - which is the first fusion product in which the reaction produces a net loss of energy (endothermic) resulting in a dramatic collapse in photon pressure and the  loss of hydrostatic equilibrium (the balance between nuclear reactions creating outward pressure, and the inward pressure of gravity). A few moments (compared to a stellar lifetime) after a star begins to fuse iron it will supernova (any star large enough to fuse beyond carbon, nitrogen and oxygen is large enough to super nova). During the sudden collapse of the stars outer shells there is a rapid increase in pressure triggering supernova synthesis; the fusion the products of which yields every heavy element in the periodic table. The outer shells of the star impact an almost incompressible core, creating a shockwave that bounces off into space, seeding the rest of the galaxy with heavy elements. It's nice to think that, if you're wearing a wedding ring, then that gold/platinum/palladium you are wearing was created in the tiny instant during a supernova.</p>
<p>Edit: tidying grammar and clarifying timescale for which iron synthesis is &quot;short&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
