		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;decay&quot; you mentioned is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere#Shortening" target="_blank">shortening</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere" target="_blank">telomere</a>. The enzymes in your cell that duplicate the cell's DNA so it can be distributed among two offspring cells work by first splitting the DNA double helix in half, then synthesizing a matching strand for each of the resulting strands. (This works because each of the strands in your DNA encode, fundamentally, the same information.) The problem here is that the enzymes can't just start duplicating at any random point, they can only make an existing matching strand longer. This problem is solved by so-called primers: another enzyme that <em>can</em> create matching strands out of nowhere does exactly that, and then the regular duplication enzymes can start their work. However, the enzymes creating the primers can't actually create DNA, they can only create RNA, which is very similar to DNA, but not 100%. Because the cells can't work if there's random RNA in the DNA, the RNA needs to be replaced with DNA at some point. Fortunately, the enzymes that do the regular duplication can do this: when they encounter some RNA they just &quot;eat&quot; it and replace it with DNA. (This works out because there are always multiple enzymes working at the same time in your DNA; if one enzyme hits the point where another has started it replaces the primer and then just stops.)</p>
<p>You might have noticed the problem already: what about the very beginning of a DNA strand? The primer there can't be replaced because there's no other enzyme working before it. And indeed, this is a problem the body has, but fortunately your body has a workaround: at the start and end of every individual DNA strand there is some data that doesn't code for anything, so there is no problem if it gets deleted.</p>
<p>A nice analogy I heard is that of a copier that copies a page nearly perfectly, but always skips the first and last line. A solution would be to just put some meaningless text there that doesn't matter if it gets deleted.</p>
<p>This bit of meaningless DNA is called a telomere. If a cell divides, the daughter cells will have the same DNA except for the telomeres, which will be slightly shorter compared to the parent cell. Now obviously, there would be a problem if the cell divides too much: eventually the telomere will disappear entirely and the DNA replication process will start damaging genes that are important for normal cell function (including cell division). This limit is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayflick_limit" target="_blank">Hayflick limit</a>, and it lies at about 50 divisions: after that, a cell will stop dividing.</p>
<p>Now the problem you mentioned comes into play: if the cells stop dividing eventually, what about if you have a child? Clearly there needs to be some way to &quot;reset&quot; the telomeres so the cells in the child's body can divide as normal. And indeed, such a thing exists, in the form of an enzyme called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase" target="_blank">telomerase</a>. The telomerase is able to create DNA out of nowhere, and it uses this ability to reset the telomeres to their original length. In the human body, it is most active in the precursors of sperm cells and egg cells. (EDIT: Some people mentioned that I didn't explain how exactly this works: starting at some point during fetal development, a sort-of cell line of stem cells is created that is kept alive, by means of telomerase, throughout one's life. In males, the cells continuously divide, forming new stem cells, and at every point some of the stem cells turn into differentiated sperm cells that get released as sperm. In females, a similar process happens, with the difference that the process is mostly finished at birth and the differentiated egg cells are kept alive without dividing until they're needed. Regardless, telomerase activity applies in both cases (although not as much in females, because the telomeres don't decay as much in the nine months of fetal development), and the original question asked about the &quot;process of cell decay&quot;, not about details of how sperm and egg cells differentiate.)</p>
<p>You might be asking &quot;why doesn't the body do this all the time?&quot; The thing is that the Hayflick limit is also useful as a mechanism against cancer: cancer is, at its core, cells dividing uncontrollably. Once the cells reach the Hayflick limit they will stop dividing and the tumour can be removed by the immune system. So why do we still die from cancer? Cancer cells tend to mutate in a way that the telomerase is always active, meaning they will never reach this limit and keep dividing. Also, another big point is that even though carefully activating the telomerase in regular cells <em>could</em> keep us alive longer, there is no evolutionary reason to do so: once someone stops being able to reproduce natural selection doesn't matter anymore: they have either reproduced or not, but they certainly aren't going to in the future, so it doesn't matter whether they die or not. <del>Hence, there is no evolutionary pressure for a long age.</del> (EDIT: Some people in the comments mentioned genes for long age may actually help the next generations due to social effects, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_hypothesis" target="_blank">grandmother hypothesis</a>. This means that at some point it becomes a balance between effort expended to stay alive and benefit for the next generations, because the more generations there are the weaker one individual's effect will be. Thanks to /u/ELaskanator and /u/skeletorch for pointing this out)</p>
<p>An important thing to note is that it's not 100% clear whether shortening of the telomeres actually <em>causes</em> aging: <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(03\)12384-7/fulltext" target="_blank">there is a correlation</a> between telomere length and a long life, but the exact mechanisms aren't understood perfectly. There are most certainly other reasons for aging other than short telomeres. So you should take all of the above advice regarding aging with a grain of salt and you should most definitely not start activating your telomerase everywhere to live a long life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a PhD student studying aging. This answer may get buried, since this thread is so popular, but hopefully not.</p>
<p>Many people are writing about telomeres. Those who write that their role in aging is overstated are correct. Delete telomerase (the enzyme that lengthens telomeres) in mice, and what happens? Nothing. For five to six generations. That's how long it takes for the telomeres to get short enough to have any effects. Yet mice still age. Humans do have shorter telomeres and longer lives, but our adult stem cells can extend their telomeres whenever they want. So telomeres aren't the answer.</p>
<p>More people in the field are appreciating the role of epigenetics. Consider that humans have about twenty thousand genes, but only a few thousand are turned on in any given cell. That's what makes a brain cell different than a liver cell, although they have the same exact DNA. Which genes are turned on or off is governed by chemical modifications on DNA and and the proteins that keep it wrapped together. These are known as epigenetic marks. Think of them like bookmarks for which genes to read and which to ignore.</p>
<p>There is an increasing amount of data that show as we age, our epigenetic marks get screwed up. In the extreme case, this can cause a brain cell to turn on a liver gene, or vice versa. More generally, it means our cells aren't functioning as efficiently as they did when we were young, when the epigenetic state was set correctly.</p>
<p>So what happens during fertilization and early embryo development? You guessed it -- all the epigenetic marks are wiped clean and totally reset. (Expect for a very few, called imprinting, which is a fascinating area of ongoing research.) As tissues and cells differentiate, &quot;master regulator&quot; genes that determine cell identity kick in to set the epigenetics as &quot;brain cell&quot; or &quot;liver cell&quot;.</p>
<p>A surprising study from the Belmonte Lab at the Salk Institute last year showed that by expressing the most fundemental &quot;master regulators&quot; (sometimes called Yaminaka factors) at very low levels in mice, you can &quot;clean up&quot; the epigenetics without changing cell identity, leading to improved health and possibly increased longevity in aged mice. Super interesting stuff.</p>
<p>There also is a lot of research aimed at reading your epigenetics to predict your &quot;biological age&quot;. Steve Horvath at UCLA has shown you can accurately predict a person's age (with an error of  only 3-4 years) based on their epigenetic marks. He has also shown that your &quot;epigenetic age&quot; is a decent predictor of how likely you are to die. In my opinion, this is the closest science has gotten to date to developing a Death Clock. Again, super interesting stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay I'm going to tell you something that almost all these posts and even most science journalism gets wrong:</p>
<p>The cells in your body can divide as many times as they want, if they choose to. </p>
<p>First, let me explain this deal with telomores: telomeres exist yes, and they shorten with every cell division, but to think that a cell will stop dividing just because its telomeres shortened too much is like saying that you will give up on your car as soon as the tire threads wear out too much: in principle you can <em>choose</em> to stop using a car as soon as your tire threads wear out, just as a way to keep track of how much you used your car, but just like you can replace your car tires any goddam time you want, your cell can also replenish its telomeres any time it wants. </p>
<p>So why don't all cells keep replenishing their telomeres? Simply because they don't have to. Your body has determined a clear ballpark limit of how long it has to survive, and the preprogrammed cell division hierarchies make sure that any cell has enough telomere length needed by that lineage to do its function for that lifetime. Congruently, germ cells are programmed to not keep dividing continuously and again have enough telomere length to go till the sperm/egg stage. After that, the telomere lengthening program of the newly fertilized zygote will take over making sure that the cell progeny from that point forward have sufficient amounts of telomeres in their cells. </p>
<p>So suffice to say that telomeres are never a problem in letting cells divide as many times as they want. But does it mean that cells can keep dividing infinitely long if they take care of the telomeres? Not exactly. There are bunch of other problems that we know of (and probably a bunch we haven't even figured out yet) with cells that keep dividing all the time or living for too long. </p>
<p>One of the primary other problems with long-lived or constantly dividing cells is the accumulation of misfolded proteins and other &quot;junk&quot; inside them. &quot;Misfolded proteins&quot; is just a way of telling that when proteins are made they can become useless and undegradable, and hence just float around as junk inside your cells. Over time, if a cell lives for long or keeps dividing, these junk stuff can accumulate into stuff like plaques and cause diseases like Alzheimers. Finding how to reverse this kind of ageing problem is one of the most important to solve for disease research now.</p>
<p>So how does the body make sure such aggregated junk doesn't affect cells that lead to your progeny? I will give two mechanisms I know of, both of which I'm pretty sure are somewhat documented, but might not be the entire story in this regard:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When cells divide, they can selectively send junk aggregates to one of their daughters, keeping the second daughter pristine. Such asymmetric cell division can ensure that cells that lead to production of progeny are cleaned up during the lineage divisions.</p>
</li>
<li>Our cells might inherently have ways of removing these aggregates, and these methods are in place in the germ cells, but not the cells that never lead to germ cells such as neurons. I don't remember seeing solid evidence in this regard, but I'm willing to bet a good amount of money that this really is the case: our neurons accumulate such aggregate plaques, but the recent research trends suggest that this happens simply because the differentiation pathway in these cells just don't care about taking care of themselves after a certain number of decades, simply because the original evolutionary constraints did not intend for the creature to live this long anyway. Which kind of brings us to an important point below:</li>
</ol>
<p>We need to remember that a short lifespan is kind of good for a species in general: if you can live and reproduce within a short amount of time, you can evolve faster, and hence keep on top of any constraints placed on your species by the environment and other organisms. So the evolutionary preference for any species is that its beings live for shorter amounts of time. Only when there are great evolutionary benefits achieved by living longer (such as in humans, the grandmothers taking care of their grandchildren), will an organism begin to switch on &quot;developmental programs&quot; that can let it live longer. We have examples of such programs all throughout the animal kingdom and also have the fact that most organisms can just expand their lifespan like a light-switch if their environment becomes unfavorable for reproduction. So we have all these ageing mechanisms because it used to be in our species' interest that we don't live for too long. If evolutionarily speaking, we were to benefit by living for 300 years, then I'm pretty sure that our cells and bodies would have done that very easily with almost no extra modification (meaning we wouldn't need any new novel mechanism to do so). Which is what I meant when I originally said that our cells can live and divide however long they want if they just choose to do so.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the emphasis on telomeres is missing the truth of the matter, and overstating the importance of the role that telomeres play.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a machine that makes other machines. Each new machine that is made has all new parts and functions exactly as it should. But every time our first machine (mother machine) makes a daughter machine, its parts accumulate a little more wear and tear, and it doesn't function as well. </p>
<p>Now these daughter machines do not have the ability to make any kind of machine, like the mother machine does. They can only make their own daughter machines that perform specific tasks. All of these machines operate in the same factory, and these tasks are vital to keeping the factory working. These machines with specific tasks tend to get worn out pretty quickly, so you need to make lots of them. This means that most of the machines that a mother machine makes are destined for these tasks.</p>
<p>Each mother machine can only make 30 - 50 daughter machines before breaking down completely. Occasionally, mother machines can make new mother machines, but this requires special materials and the new mother machines are sometimes not as good as the original. Eventually, you start running out of mother machines, the factory can't perform it's tasks very well, and it has to close.</p>
<p>To make sure there will always be factories around, even after the original one closes, they do something rather clever. They make specific types of machines that have the ability to start a whole new factory from scratch. To do this they have a designated pool of mother machines that only create these special machines.</p>
<p>These special mother machines face the same constraints as other mother machines, and so as they age they produce worse quality daughter machines. This is why young factories produce healthier new factories than older ones. And why really old factories tend not to be able to produce any new factories at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: an enzyme known as Telomerase prevents shortening of the telomere during cell division. </p>
<p>Not exactly ELI5 but my understanding is that it's because the sex cells in humans are what is known as haploid, meaning they have half the chromosomes as an embryo/zygote/fetus/human, take your pick. And their primary purpose is to pass genetic material to future generations when combined with the reciprocating sex cell, think sperm+egg=baby.</p>
<p>Now human sex cells, as well as other rare cells are as you stated undergoing thousands of iterations and with each cell division there is a shortening of the chromosomal end known as a telomere. This process is what you're describing when you say 'cell decay.'</p>
<p>With regards to specific cells there is an enzyme known as telomerase which can actually reverse the shortening of the telomere and thus the cell does not &quot;age&quot; as it were. </p>
<p>However that does not mean there isn't an increased risk for some kind of transcription/translation error in the individual's sex cells which would prompt possible genetic mutation and result in an abnormal fetal development. This tends to have a higher incidence in people who have children at a later age.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
