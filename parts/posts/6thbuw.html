</blockquote>
<p>Color is its own unique quantum property, similar to electric charge or spin.  As you mentioned, it is not related to the human perception phenomenon &quot;color.&quot;  Color as it applies to quarks can be distinguished as &quot;color charge&quot; as it is essentially the equivalent of electric charge but for the strong interaction instead of the electromagnetic interaction.  Electromagnetism has only one kind of charge (electric charge) but the strong interaction has three -- each separate type of color charge gets its own name (red, green, and blue).</p>
<p>Electric charge can also be negative, and similarly the three color charges can be negative -- those are commonly called &quot;antired,&quot; &quot;antigreen,&quot; and &quot;antiblue&quot; because antiquarks carry negative color charges.</p>
<p>The strong interaction is very different from the electromagnetic interaction also because the force carriers are themselves charged -- gluons can carry both a color charge and an anti-color charge, which causes them to interact very strongly with each other and with quarks (unlike photons which do not have any electric charge either positive or negative).  That fact is responsible for a lot of the unique properties of strong interaction dynamics.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When referring to quarks, colour has nothing to do with the colours we see. At all.</p>
<p>The name is simply because a property of quarks, the colour charge, is loosely analogous to the primary colours. As in there are three colours/charges and they all combine to give no charge/white light.</p>
<p>Colour charge is a concept first devised in 1964 to explain quarks in certain Hadrons seeming to violate the Pauli exclusion principal. It is somewhat similar to electric charge, but with three types of charge rather than the usual positive/negative.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to say something which I maybe shouldn't. The whole &quot;color charge&quot; thing as usually presented is completely heuristic, or to put it bluntly, kind of wrong. I don't know any way of representing the actual math of QCD in such a way that &quot;red*blue*green=white&quot; and &quot;red*antired = white&quot;.</p>
<p>In contrast, I do know how to represent the math of QCD so that the color charges assigned to gluons in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon#Eight_gluon_colors" target="_blank">this Wikipedia section</a> make sense. But then if I apply that same mathematical representations to the baryons (3 quarks) and mesons (2 quarks), I do not get the &quot;red*blue*green=white&quot; and &quot;red*antired = white&quot; mentioned in the last paragraph, I get rather complicated superpositions of colors. For example, mesons (2 quarks) must actually be</p>
<p>&quot;red*antired + blue*antiblue + green*antigreen = white&quot;</p>
<p>rather than being represented by just one color-anticolor pair at once. Here, this is a quantum superposition of three two-particle states. But that's complicated and messy and laymen don't want to have to think about quantum superpositions, so the simpler heuristic was developed. Writing out all of the &quot;colors&quot; for a 3 quark state would be even more complicated than that.</p>
<p>So instead of faithfully representing the mathematics (involving group theory, representation theory, etc), we come up with cute pictures which look nice when giving talks. But going beyond the two cases considered here, I'm not sure if the simplifications used for these cases are helpful at all. </p>
<p>In fact, even for mesons and baryons, the heuristic doesn't tell you &quot;how many&quot; white states you can get for a given bound state, which is one of the most elementary questions you can ask.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
