		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants (and seeds) sense temperature in a number of ways, though it is not precisely known how seeds 'count' how many days/hours they've been at cold temperatures. However, as others have pointed out, t is known that plant hormones such as jasmonic acid, abscisic acid and gibberellins all play an important role in either inducing or repressing dormancy and germination.  </p>
<p>Some of the ways plants sense temperature changes may give us some clues as to how they might 'count' how long they've been at a certain temperature. For instance, plants actively adjust the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in their membranes to maintain fluidity and functionality of said membrane in response to decreasing (or increasing) temperatures. By decreasing the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids (i.e. adding more unsaturated fatty acids) the membrane will remain fluid at lower temperatures.</p>
<p>Now, if you think of a seed as a bank and each structure (organelles, membranes, etc) within the seed as a separate bank account, with transactions between accounts being represented by biochemical pathways and money being the separate chemicals and molecules involved in these pathways, it could be that by draining one 'account' continually over time (like the account that produces the precursor to unsaturated fatty acids) in order to increase the amount of 'money' allocated to another 'account' (the membrane), it could be that the plants eventually realize, &quot;Oh shit, its been cold a long time, maybe we should germinate the next chance we get because this really sucks.&quot;</p>
<p>On the note of hormones: they, like fatty acids, have to come from somewhere; often they have to go somewhere as well. Source and sink. So, if the enzyme that produces the hormones from whatever precursor molecules and the enzymes that move these hormones from the source to the sink are both more active at lower temperatures than the enzyme that senses this hormone at the sink, it's likely that the hormone will build up within that sink (a tissue, organ, etc). Excesses in certain hormones at a given location past a given threshold can lead to genetic reprogramming; it can turn genes on and off. So, if the sink enzymes are not active, and the concentration of the given hormone continues to increase over time, it could then activate genes that cause germination. On the other hand, if the temperature isn't low enough (and therefore the sink enzymes can effectively process this hormone in some way) or the duration isn't long enough (and therefore the concentration of the hormone doesn't reach a particular 'gene activation threshold') the genes may never turn on and lead to germination. </p>
<p>tl;dr No one really knows exactly how seeds do it, but hormones and membrane fluidity could be a potential signal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought you cool a seed down and then put it into a warm and moist &amp; dark place.</p>
<p>The cool -&gt; warm will make the seed realize it is &quot;spring time&quot; and that will help with the germination speed.</p>
<p>I germinate seeds by submerging them in warm water for a day and then placing them in a paper towel under a dark cup. That is then placed on my laptop power brick, since it is slightly warm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think that the extent that we currently understand seed stratification is simply that plants of many taxa are sensitive to environmental cues as part of their molecular clock, and require these cues for specific components of development, such as germination or hypocotyl extension, but the network of cue and response I think reminds undeveloped. It could be that a drastic change in temperature cues a shift in cellular division orientation and thus a seed germinates. Sounds liked a great masters proposal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like other organisms, plants have an internal clock that senses the period of light/dark cycles and other ways of sensing the environment.  Different kinds of plants have adapted differently. The ones that require exposure to prolonged cold before germinating appear to produce more of a plant hormone that stimulates germination when it's cold. There is presumably a threshold that allows germination to proceed in the right conditions after that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its an evolutionary adaptation. basically plants that would germinate sooner were more likely to be killed by winter or an early spring cold snap. so most of the plants that survive the season and reproduce are ones that waited for a certain period of cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
