The character and their shirt moves, but the background layer does not, resulting in what you've described.</p>
<p>The reason for doing this is that its a cheaper/faster/easier way to animate clothing with those types of patterns. The alternative is redrawing the whole thing each time the character moves slightly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's done because it's cheap, lazy and easy compared to actually animating a plaid textured shirt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
