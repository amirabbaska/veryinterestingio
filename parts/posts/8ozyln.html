		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you move your eye or blink the images from your eyes are just blurry or dark and therefore quite useless for your brain to interpret. So the brain use the information from the view before and after the eye movement to fill in the blanks. So if you move your eye to the clock as the second hand is moving your brain does not see the second hand moving and interprets it as if it have been standing still during the entire time you moved your eye. So the first second looks longer because your brain makes the wrong assumption.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will try to explain this step by step.</p>
<p>First, you are looking at something that <em>isnt</em> the clock. Your brain is focusing on making that image make sense and be clear, with detail, color, etc.</p>
<p>Then, you move your eyes to the clock. It takes a few milliseconds for your eyes to actually move there, and once they land on the clock, your brain has to &quot;stabilize&quot; the image, which takes a few milliseconds as well.</p>
<p>What happens here is that because of those few fractions of a second it took for you to move your eyes and find the details of the new object you're looking at, your brain just decides to fill that space with the new thing you're looking at, instead of making everything blurry and unclear. So, when you look at a clock, your brain is filling your vision with the second you first observed, instead of the blurry eye-motion that it would've been. This makes that first second look/feel longer. It <strong>is</strong> longer. Your brain is literally telling you that it is longer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, it has to do with a phenomenon called &quot;saccadic masking&quot; where the brain selectively blocks visual processing during eye movements so that neither the motion of the eye (and subsequent motion blur of the image) nor the gap in visual perception is noticeable. You can &quot;observe&quot; this phenomenon yourself by looking at your eyes in the mirror; look back and forth from eye to eye and you'll notice that you cannot see your eyes move, even though you know they're moving and an observer would be able to clearly see your eyes moving.</p>
<p>The process works like this: in the beginning milliseconds of your eyes moving, a signal is sent to your brain to start this process of masking and your brain starts receiving significantly reduced information from your eyes. When your eyes move to the clock, your brain also receives the message, &quot;hey, a little bit of time just passed there and we didn't send you any information&quot; so what the brain does in response is actually backwardsly fill in the period of time that you &quot;missed&quot; with what your eyes refocus on. So, when you refocus on the clock, your brain receives basically &quot;extra&quot; visual information of the clock with the second-hand at whatever time it's at which can make a second seem extra-long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your eyes fill in the blank time that it ignores while your eye moves. The reason it ignores that time is because otherwise our eyes would blur like a video shot by a shaky handed camera man. To avoid the blur your brain has 3 choices. Completely blind you while your eyes move, continue to show you what you were looking at prior to moving, or extend the time you see the thing your eyes moved to look at. And of the 3 your brain chooses the last one because being blind is a disadvantage in nature, and if you look toward something its best to have as much time as possible to process whats going on before its to late. If im picking berries and a wild animal comes to attack me its better to see them quicker and longer then the berries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
