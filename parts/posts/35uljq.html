<p>The other person is constantly and randomly roaming</p>
<p>Foot traffic concentration is the same at all points of the park</p>
<p>Field of vision is always the same and unobstructed</p>
<p>Same walking speed for both parties</p>
<p>There is a time limit, because, as /u/kivishlorsithletmos pointed out, the odds are 100% assuming infinite time.</p>
<p>The other person is NOT looking for you. They are wandering around having the time of their life without you.</p>
<p>You could also assume that you and the other person are the only two people in the park to eliminate issues like others obstructing view etc.</p>
<p>Bottom line: the theme park is just used to personify a general statistics problem. So things like popular rides, central locations, and crowds can be overlooked.</p></div></div>
