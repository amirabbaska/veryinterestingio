<blockquote>
<p>Most birthmarks are probably due to defective migration of cells during fetal development. Once these cells start to multiply, they produce tissue with the characteristics of their cell type though they are not where those cells typically are located.</p>

<p>^(But also Rule 4 says explanations aren't meant to be geared toward actual five year olds... So.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll give this my best shot - my daughter has a Port Wine Stain (PWS) birthmark that runs from her eyes up over the top of her head following what I believe are called the trigeminal nerves, and ending on her lower neck behind her ears. This is a result of Sturge-Weber Syndrome, a rare disease. Basically, there was a mutation in utero in a gene called GNAQ - causing a protein that, instead of switching off, remained switched on, leading to excessive growth of blood vessels under her skin and on the surface of her brain.</p>
<p>I'm sure I screwed that up somehow.</p>
<p>Not everyone who has a PWS birthmark gets Sturge-Weber, and even fewer have the birthmark bilaterally (both sides of her head/brain. So she is a rare case than most.</p>
<p>Because of the extra blood vessels, areas of her brain that should receive a normal amount of blood flow are receiving more, and other areas not enough. Parts of her brain have already atrophied (died) and she will most likely experience more as she grows up. This leads to a high likelihood that she will experience seizures and stroke-like episodes, although she has been fortunate to have had no seizures we are aware of this far. We also take her for laser treatments on the birthmark - it was a deep purple color at birth and kind of looked like she was wearing a superhero mask. After two years of treatments you can hardly notice the difference between areas where the birthmark was and the surrounding skin. She just has cute pink eyebrows :-)</p>
<p>Having known nothing of birthmarks 2.5 years ago, I feel like I've come a pretty long way in a short time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tbh, nobody really knows what are the causes of birthmarks. </p>
<p>Vascular birthmarks are not hereditary.</p>
<p>Birthmarks are less common in Asian people, compared to individuals from other parts of the world.</p>
<p>However, people from some countries, like in Spain, Italy and more, believed that birthmarks are caused by the unsatisfied wishes of the mother during pregnancy period.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To put it simply, our bodies weren't made perfect, we're asymmetrical; no two muscle group will be of equal mass and size, no two nostrils will be of equal diameter.
Our cells produce a dark pigment known as melanin, some cells produce too much melanin at a particular spot. (This is a birth mark). </p>
<p>Some cells lack this pigment, due to your autoimmune system destroying the pigmented cells (melanocytes); leading to a condition known as vitiligo. </p>
<p>Edit: The second paragraph discusses something extra (not related to a birthmark)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One type of birthmark is a <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001388.htm" target="_blank">Stork Bite or Strawberry Mark</a>. It's a type of vascular birthmark that's often associated with brain and spinal conditions like spinal bifida and other conditions like <a href="https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/what-is-eds/" target="_blank">Ehlers Danlos Syndrome</a>. I have <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Chiari-Malformation-Fact-Sheet" target="_blank">Chiari Malformation</a> and Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. Like many others with Chiari and EDS, I have a stork bite on my neck. Its caused by stretching of the blood vessels while the fetus is developing, and can keep growing past the birth date. Unfortunately, they're not sure exactly why or how the correlation exists, but I think it's an interesting subject.</p>
<p>White birthmarks are due to a lack of melanin, in the spot where the mark is visible. I have two white birthmarks that do not tan like the rest of my body. So if I've been in the sun, they're more noticeable because of the contrast of tanned and white skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
