		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, your body sucks more at things the older you get. Your liver isn't as efficient when it comes to metabolizing alcohol because you have less enzymes. In addition to that, your body composition changes the older you get. Older people tend to have a higher fat content, which makes it more difficult to process alcohol.</p>
<p>Shameless plug: If you or anyone else in this thread feel like you have a problem with alcohol check out r/stopdrinking. It helped me tremendously. 189 days sober today.</p>
<p>Edit: Having endured enough hangovers for several lifetimes over, I recommend a hot shower, Pedialyte, ibuprophen, and phở.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, everything gets worse as you get older.  When you're in your early twenties, you can eat total crap and not gain weight.  You can drink hard with only a mild hangover.  Be generally lazy but then be physically active in spurts, not suffer for it.  Crash your bike, fall off the roof, generally knock yourself around without serious injury.  By the time you're in your fourties, you're gonna suffer a much worse hangover when you drink.  You'll put on a lot of weight much more easily when you eat too much.  You'll be stiff and sore for days after you finally start going back to the gym again.  And instead of walking away from epic wipeouts with just a few scratches, you'll get injuries from activities like &quot;slept in a funny position&quot;, and &quot;picked up a box the wrong way.&quot;  Basically, as soon as you're done growing, your body immediately starts to slowly fall apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most replies are fortunately serious, but I want to mention that in my experience it’s because “younger” people can spend half of the next day in bed. As an adult you need to get up and go to work or care for kids even if you had your last drink at 3 am.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to add, you may get a worse hangover, but you learn how to deal with it and prevent it better. When I was 20, I didn't know when to stop drinking b/c I didn't know my body. I didn't know that 1 rum drink made me sicker than 3 vodka drinks and a beer chaser. I didn't know how to control my drunk self and get me to 2 pints of water and good sized snack before I passed out.</p>
<p>Your body gets worse but your brain gets smarter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Up until the point where I quit, I found that hangovers actually got LESS severe in a lot of ways as I got older. Probably partly due to me having a hangover nearly every day, but the KIND of hangover I got completely changed.</p>
<p>I didn't get headaches or nausea any more, but I got severe anxiety, confusion and shaking instead. I found that drinking a lot of water generally fixed that, so I wonder whether your ability to remain hydrated changes as you get older.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
