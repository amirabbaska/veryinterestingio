		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Prior naval officer. The mass and density of materials is a big issue here. Ships are absolutely massive. For comparison, travelling at only around 20-40 MPH is very fast in shipping. It takes a lot of force to move, turn, maneuver or stop a ship in water. For efficiency and stability, ships are long and narrow. In order for them to turn they need to change the pressure of water passing along their rudder(s). Rudders don't work in the front because boats need the curved bow to cut through waves and maintain a steady course. </p>
<p>Like a car's tires gripping the road, the ship's pointed bow and subsequent long hull help keep the boat stable and on course. For an easy example, small vessels like PWC (Jet Ski's) the hull shape provides stability and the propulsion mechanism (jet) in the rear of the turns to aim the vessel. If the jet were on the front of a Jet Ski, the complicated structure of those moving parts would be meeting the force of water in the front and increase drag, and if the propulsion tried to &quot;push&quot; the front of the vessel to one side it would be &quot;dragging&quot; the front to one side. Again, the shape of the hull here forces engineers to make the front of a vessel sharp to guide the vessel and cut through wave action and the rear is wider for stability and to allow &quot;sliding&quot; while changing the course. </p>
<p>Rudders are like airplane wings that generate lift. The rudders of large ships need the direct power of the propellers to generate this lift. When large ships use backwards propulsion they lose quite a bit of control due to the shape of the hull and the rudders no longer receiving wash of water across them (when large ships dock without the aid of multiple tug boats an able shiphandler can use forward thrust from one propeller for the &quot;lift&quot; and control the ship while a higher RPM on the other propeller  backwards can halt forward momentum or reverse a ship). If you wanted to make a rudder that was able to change course for a massive ship using the passive water flow from just 20-40 mph you would need the rudder to be unrealistically large, and the speed of the ship and the density of water makes moving it much more difficult. </p>
<p>Aircraft want aerodynamic fuselages for stability. Because of the density of air compared to water, this basically reverses the general shape of aircraft compared to ships: aircraft are wider and thicker in front with long, less massive tails. While ships need to float without any movement, aircraft must fly using constant lift. Putting propellers more forward in the aircraft helps maintain the shape and density distribution and forces the air across wings and the fuselage, helping to generate the lift. It's much easier for a relatively light aircraft to change course with a small change because of the speed the air is travelling across the wings and stabilizing flaps compared to a huge ship fighting dense water. </p>
<p>There is some variation to placement, wings, jets, etc with different sized aircraft but hopefully this explains the physics more thoroughly than some of the answers here. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The propeller is using Newton’s third law to force the water back this propelling the ship forward. If the propeller was in the front then the the water would hit the hull as it’s being accelerated and this would be counterproductive. I’m sure you could build something that works it’s just not the most efficient design </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With smaller ships and boats in particular the prow tends to rise out of the water as the ship crests large waves this would cause problems with propeller(impeller?) at the front. It would also tend to pull the ship down as in re-entered the water bringing more water on deck in rough seas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Some interesting points that aren't in other comments here: Propeller at front of ship leads to water sealing issues. A propeller in front is more aerodynamically stable, cools engine, generates lift at low speed, which are more important for planes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I suspect the best answer is that when you can't see the bottom, you don't want your valuable screw to the the first thing to hit a reef, a sand bar, or some other sunken obstacle.</p>
<p>Bows can be reinforced to take the impact, but it would be impractical to have an armored screw.</p>
<p>If a ship's bow gets stuck on a reef or sand bar, you still have the means to pull yourself off.  Can't do that if the screw is hung up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
