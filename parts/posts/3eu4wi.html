		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skin cells are very, very small. <a href="http://images.sciencedaily.com/2014/04/140424125245_1_900x600.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is a close up of some wrinkly skin and still the cells are not distinguishable. So when you scratch off hundreds of them that really isn't that much at all. When you make a small mark on your skin that mark might cover an area of 200x2000 cells so roughly 400 thousand cells (and that'd be a pretty small mark). However if you spend some time you can scratch or rub off many many more and get rid of that mark. All you have to do is rub off the top layer and as many layers down as the ink has absorbed (which isn't likely to be that deep).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The skin cells that slough off are from the top, stratum corneum. Ink can seep between cells and stain deeper layers, those layers aren't ready to slough off yet, but still can be stained with ink.  I'm talking very superficial layers.  Tight junctions prevent ink from staining the stratum spinosum and stratum basale.
The following is from a microscopic section from a tattooed cow's ears (bangs tattoo), so not the best, ignore the deeper layers with ink, but the top purple layer is the epidermis and you can see it has several layers.  At the surface you see a lighter pink layer, that's the stratum corneum and will flake off, you see it grossly as white flakes (keratin). It's pink here due to the eosin stain of the section. If you look closely you can actually see some of the pink flakes of keratin. </p>

<p>Wish I had a better pic, but this is the only histo I have on imgur</p>
<p>EDIT:  if anyone is interested, here's the album that explains where tattoo ink goes (on mobile so hopefully the link is works):  <a href="http://imgur.com/a/CgsnR" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/CgsnR</a></p>
<p>EDIT 2: this isn't as high quality but you can see the flaking in this other histo image I took (there's a tick attached to this skin section): <a href="http://imgur.com/3myf9Gh" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/3myf9Gh</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your skin's top layer is like a conveyer belt in which cells at one end produce cells that push the older cells towards the surface. when you scratch off skin cells you are scratching off the dead and mostly dead skin cells that act like ,  &quot;human shields&quot; to the progenitor cells. This layer of protection is thicker on your palm and heel, and I think parts of your toes. That is why it feels so , leathery-deadlike. </p>
<p>A sharpie or pen goes down further. The further it goes the harder it is to get off. If you want a tatoo you have pass this layer into the dermis, because otherwise anything on the conveyor belt ultimately gets sloughed off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The skin is primarily made of three layers. The epidermis (Outer), dermis, and hypodermis(Inner). The epidermis is completely dead tissue that provides a waterproof layering. These are the &quot;skin cells&quot; we are referring to. If say a sharpie stains your finger, the ink soaks into the lower layers. So you must wait a couple days for the stianed epidermis to fall off, and the stained dermis to become the epidermis, and then fall off.</p>
<p>EDIT: It also depends on the staining agent, sharpie is obviously less permanent than say iodine or something. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
