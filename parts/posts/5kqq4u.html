		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think your question is very specific to right after the winter solstice, because the Sun actually rises and sets between days at varying rates, as <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/usa/new-york" target="_blank">shown here</a>. The Sun traces out a sinusoidal pattern in the sky over the course of a year, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-exposure_photography#Solargraphy" target="_blank">shown here</a>. In a similar vein, the sunrise and sunset is a sinusoidal pattern, where the greatest rate of change occurs at the equinoxes, so you can expect up to 3 minutes of change per day near the equinoxes at mid-latitudes. Meanwhile, at the equator, there is very little change, and in the arctic circle, sunrise and sunset can change as much as half an hour per day up to having only one day with a sunset at the North Pole.</p>
<p>To answer your actual question about the difference of sunrise and sunset gaining time though, it actually has to do with solar noon, or culmination. The time at which the Sun gets to the highest point in the sky gets later and later in winter because the Earth's orbit is an ellipse and is going faster since it is nearest to the Sun in winter. This can be read about more <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/why-dont-sunrise-and-sunset-times-change-symmetrically.426655/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/38270/why-is-the-solar-noon-time-different-every-day" target="_blank">here</a>. Basically, the difference between sunrise to solar noon and solar noon to sunset is roughly the same, but solar noon itself changes. Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a cool effect due to the fact the Earth is not on a circular orbit. Instead, it is elliptical, which means it travels faster around perihelion (January) and slower around aphelion (July).</p>
<p>We must also consider the fact that, with respect to background stars, the Earth spins on its orbit 366.25 times per year, with the trip around the sun effectively subtracting one day and giving the usual 365.25. That means that a day with respect to fixed stars (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time" target="_blank">sidereal day</a> ) is slightly shorter than an apparent day at 23 hours, 56 minutes. </p>
<p>So, if the Earth wasn't moving on its orbit, 23h56m after you saw the Sun in one location, it would be seen in the same location. The reason it shifts is because the Earth has moved ~1 degree (well, 366.5/360 degrees, or 4 minutes) <em>around</em> the Sun. So the Earth has to turn just that bit more for the Sun to reach the same point it was yesterday.</p>
<p>Now, if the Earth was on a circular orbit, all would be fine, and every 24 hours the Sun would return to the same location in the sky (negating seasons). BUT, it has an elliptical orbit. This means the speed around the Sun varies over the year, so as you get towards perihelion, the Sun actually appears to move slightly faster around the earth. But we set a day from the <em>average</em> spin of the Earth.</p>
<p>Hence near perihelion the Earth is moving faster, and after 23h56m+4mins, the Earth hasn't quite spun enough to make up for it's speed on its orbit. The effect of this is that the apparent position of the Sun compared to the average position seems to move forwards. As sunset and sunrise are roughly equidistant from when the sun is highest, sunrise seems to stay still while sunset races away.</p>
<p>At aphelion the opposite happens and after 23h56m+4mins the Earth, which is travelling more slowly than usual, slightly over-rotates with respect to the Sun. Hence the position of the Sun appears to be moving backwards during the (Northern) summer months.</p>
<p>I hope that makes some sense. The entire effect is quite confusing, but it's why we get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma" target="_blank">Analemma</a>'s, and it's why the sunrise and sunset seem to move around, especially around perihelion, when Earth moves fastest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Here is a good picture of it: <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap101231.html" target="_blank">https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap101231.html</a></p>
<p>Close to the solstices the sun is at the top (summer) and bottom (winter) of the figure 8 pattern. As the sun &quot;turns the corner&quot; from our perspective it is moving more laterally than up and down for several days. During that time the sunrise/sunset times don't deviate too much. Look at your chart right around Jan 8, you will see the sunrise/sunset times start to make bigger changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am assuming that you meant &quot;Spring Equinox&quot;. The closest approach of the earth to sun happens in Northern Winter, Jan. 4; Because the Sun is at the nearest focus on the orbit but the earth's rotation is petty constant, the observed solar transit is sped up before the winter solstice and retarded with respect to a clock after. This effect is greatest from fall until spring.</p>
<p>This is also why the switch from daylight to standard time is not symmetric to length of daylight. The equation of Time, and that figure eight on some globes tells us that we can extend daylight savings lime in the fall and retard it in the spring because the sunset is as much as 20 minutes late in the fall and we can wait until early March to begin daylight savings time because the sun is slow by that amount even though the length of day is more in March than it is in November.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
