		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Putting together the information here</p>
<p>One of the main processes in bananas (and all fruit) ripening is the amylase dependent conversion of savoury or flavourless starches in to sugar (specifically glucose). Amylase is a common enzyme (also present in your saliva) which converts starch to sugar and is an important part of your digestion.</p>
<p>There are essentially 2 ways something will taste sweeter.</p>
<p>1) There is more sugar present </p>
<p>or</p>
<p>2) Your tastebuds can access the sugar more rapidly</p>
<p>Freezing and then defrosting fruit essentially lets both of these things happen. Freezing causes water in the fruit cells to crystallise and expand. This destroys the cell walls and is the principal reason defrosted fruit is soggy and limp. However it also means that the cell contents (all those sugars) are now in the juices that are running off the fruit and if you taste the juice you'll find it is very sweet. You can experience this at the most extreme if compare the difference in sensation between holding a mouthful of orange juice in your mouth or holding a slice of orange (without chewing).  In the case of a banana there isn't much excess of liquid to run off so those exposed cell contents will largely stay within the fruit pulp/body rather than running off.</p>
<p>The other thing that happens while the fruit is defrosting is that all the amylase and starches in the cells are now able to diffuse (a little) through the defrosting fruit pulp. The amylase is no longer confined to the cell it started in, where it may have completed its starch converting job, and is free to find any remaining starch that may have come out of other nearby cells. This means that some of the remain starches will be converted to some extra sugars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Why is a frozen and thawed banana so much sweeter?</strong></p>
<p>Fruits like banana contain water. When you freeze them, the resulting ice crystals breaking the cellular structure of the fruit. The result is that thawed fruit is mushy. Subsequently as they warm up again, a lot of the juice leaks out and you're left with less flavor. </p>
<p>Harold McGee pointed out in his book “On Food &amp; Cooking” that in some cases frozen fruit is better in taste. Many fruits and vegetables never reach their optimal point for taste once they are harvested. If picked too early, fruits like pineapple, melon, most citrus, and most berries will not continue to ripen or reach an optimal quality and sweetness.</p>
<p>&quot;In many instances, the food you take off the shelf in a grocery store has been harvested under ripe to avoid damage during travel time. This means that it hasn't yet reached its peak nutrition. Furthermore, the minute it was picked, its nutritional content began to deteriorate. The food is then loaded on a truck, boat or plane, travels for days and waits on a shelf for you to choose it. After, which it may sit in your fridge for a few more days before being eaten. Over this period of potentially weeks, the food may lose up to 50% of its nutritional value.</p>
<p>Frozen foods on the other hand are picked when they're ripe and frozen immediately. And while the quick freeze process does affect some vitamin content, it essentially freezes, or locks most of the nutrients in place. Next to the fresh produce that has been sitting around for weeks, there's no doubt that frozen foods can contain more nutrition, particularly during the month that local produce is not in season and travelling far distances.&quot; (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjsOOT347cA" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p><strong>how does this change its nutritional value?</strong></p>
<p>It depends on the water content of the fruit. When water freezes, it expands, so when the water in the cells of the fruit freezes, it breaks through the cell membranes. This can be seen when you freeze and then thaw a high water content food such as strawberries; you'll be left with a squishy mess when you defrost them.</p>
<p>So the amount of damage depends on the water content. Melons will be affected more than strawberries which will be affected more than bananas, which are affected the least because they are only 75% water. As an example, nuts would hardly be affected at all.</p>
<p>So you do diminish the nutrient content of the bananas used in banana ice cream, but not anywhere near as much as the bananas used in banana bread (cooking does far more damage than freezing, including the causation of autoimmune reactions).</p>
<p>A way to get around this nutrient damage issue is to chill the bananas but not let them freeze, and then mash them into ice cream. Or just eat them cold as is! This would result in a cold fruity treat (but make sure they are ripe before chilling them). In practical terms, most people just throw frozen bananas through a Champion juicer (the best machine) or a Vitamix (which takes some muscle but it can be done, just be sure to run the Vitamix only as much as needed to turn the bananas into ice cream or you'll warm up the ice cream too much).</p>
<p>Bananas are known for their high potassium.  In fact, a large bananas has over 450 mg of potassium.  Fresh bananas are a bit different than buying bananas frozen in the store.  Because commercially frozen bananas are usually blanched before they are frozen, you lose a little bit of the potassium.  Blanching is a process that takes the fruit and boils it for about a half of minute and then immediately cools it in ice.    It is not the freezing of the banana, but rather the blanching process that is thought to reduce the potassium content.   Interestingly enough, potassium is a mineral that is not affected by the freezing process.  So if you are taking your own fresh bananas and freezing them to throw in a shake or smoothie you are all good.  However, you may pull a brown banana out of your freezer, but the potassium will remain intact.</p>
<p>If the only way you eat bananas is as ice cream, then you're obviously missing out on some nutrition. But if you eat most of your yearly banana intake unfrozen, and you're not cooking the other foods you eat, then you can probably afford to trade some nutrition for a tasty dessert if it helps you stay on your raw food diet.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dietitian here. One important feature of fructose is that it's sweetness measurement increases the colder it gets and decreases the warmer it is. Additionally the warmer it is increases aroma. Think apple pie. Nutritionally the fructose is unchanged, it just tastes sweeter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you freeze+thaw the banana the cell walls burst, so the sugar and good stuff is everywhere instead of just where you chew it.</p>
<p>This applies to other fruits too, and is also the reason fruit is soggy after a freeze/thaw cycle.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
