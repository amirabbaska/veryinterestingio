<p>Our Universe is exponentially expanding (actually, it has just started to, but it's a minor point) and thus is approaching what is known as a de Sitter spacetime, due to the effect of dark energy. Distances grow exponentially:</p>
<p>(distance after time t) = e^(Ht) (distance now)</p>
<p>(some rough approximations here) where H is called the Hubble constant.</p>
<p>A de Sitter spacetime can host black holes, but only up to a certain size. At this maximum size, the black hole's event horizon and the cosmological horizon become indistinguishable, and one obtains a spacetime known as the Nariai solution. This maximum mass for the black hole is</p>
<p>M = 3^(-3/2) * 2 * c^(3)/(GH)</p>
<p>the funny factor 3^(-3/2) comes from a funny calculation, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0205177v1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> if you're curious. Now, if I didn't get anything wrong that's about</p>
<p>M ~ 7 * 10^(52) kg</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>current mass limit = maximum growth rate * age of universe</p>
<p>As growth rate increases, so does radiation pressure pushing away the mass surrounding the black hole.  If the growth rate gets high enough, the cloud of gas the black hole is consuming will be blown out of reach, meaning there is a maximum rate of sustainable intake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some practical limits to the growth rate of black holes which means there is a maximum size we expect to find in the universe today.  Beyond a certain size black holes will absorb all the gas in stable orbits around them and blow off the rest due to the high energy x-ray emissions.  </p>
<p>Current estimates suggest <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28647-black-holes-have-a-size-limit-of-50-billion-suns/" target="_blank">50 billion solar masses is the largest black hole that could form</a> from absorbing mass in this way.  However it could happen that two very large black holes collide and form a black hole with an even larger mass than this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
