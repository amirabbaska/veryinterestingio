		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea of psychopathy was popular in the 40s and50s as a diagnosis for people exhibiting a certain set of personality traits. Hervey Cleckley described a psychopath as someone who was a master deceiver, manipulator, etc. yet was able to function relatively normally in society, hence the title of his 1941 book, The Mask of Sanity. By his definition, you either were or you weren't. There were a series of traits one had to meet to earn the diagnosis which can be found with a little googling. </p>
<p>Psychopathy is not a current psychological diagnoses however, and has not been for a number of years. The concept of a psychopath is primarily perpetuated by the media, but holds no real weight in the psychological community as the pertinent symptoms refer to a family mental illnesses called externalizing disorders. Nobody has been diagnosed as a psychopath in many years. This is not to say that these traits are not present in individuals today, rather that more specific acute diagnoses can be made now. The mental illness that most closely resembles psychopathy in the current DSM is anti-social personality disorder. This is also a have it or you don't disordee, but different diagnoses exist for people displaying varying dehrees of anti-social behaviors</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Great question! I think this might be simplified by offering a bit of context. The term &quot;psychopathy&quot;, unlike many others in psychological and psychiatric research, does not have an agreed-upon definition. It is probably simplest to broadly divide its use into two main areas - (1) clinical psychology and psychiatry, in which it has a chequered history as a diagnostic label and (2) non-clinical psychology research (perhaps most prominently criminology) in which it has an equally controversial history as a personality trait, dimension or characteristic.
In (1) - the clinical field - others on here have rightly pointed out that psychopathy was never fully accepted by the medical establishment as a valid diagnostic category. The so-called &quot;bible&quot; of psychiatry the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM, currently in its fifth edition) has never recommended psychopathy as a diagnosis to be dished out in real life work, and has instead created a category called Antisocial Personality Disorder. Antisocial PD is not, however identical to psychopathy because it is slightly more focused on identifying people with a propensity for criminal behaviour. In the case of (1), psychopathy (which an alternative to the DSM called the International Classification of Diseases or ICD, currently in its tenth edition, allows as an alternative name for Antisocial PD) is thought mostly of as a categorical thing - you either get the diagnosis of Antisocial PD or you don't.
Meanwhile in (2), researchers have busily been examining psychopathy as a personality dimension, of which we all might have a certain degree. Most famously, Robert Hare created a measure called the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, which became the basis for the pop psychology book &quot;The Psychopath Test&quot; by Jon Ronson. Another pop book worth a read for entertainment value is &quot;The Wisdom of Psychopaths&quot;, by the Cambridge University psychologist Kevin Dutton. He very much encourages us all to examine the degree to which we all have psychopathic traits - an ability in particular to stay calm under pressure and act decisively for example - which he points out can be a very helpful thing if you're a surgeon or special forces soldier for example.
When it comes to your papers, I would suggest that the best approach is to bear all this context in mind and look closely at what the authors mean exactly by &quot;psychopath&quot;. How have they measured or &quot;operationalised&quot; the concept? It may be that drawing on the history of (1), they are talking about people who have been diagnosed by psychiatrists with a mental illness. In this case, there is plenty to argue with and debate. More likely, they might be talking about people who exceed a cutoff or threshold on one of the popular inventories from (2), such as the Hare checklist. In this case, there is also a lot to argue with! Spectrums versus categories is a crucial debate in a lot of psychological fields and it sounds like you're on the right track with your thinking. Good luck!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Psychiatrist here. Psychopath is not a medical term, it has zero medical significance whatsoever. It seems like you may be thinking of antisocial personality disorder? All psychiatric illnesses exist on a spectrum (severities of various traits), but they are not defined as disorders until you demonstrate that they significantly impair your functioning in some way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a spectrum. I have ASPD and I don't have any violent tendencies or thoughts, in fact I really don't like conflict at all. What that means for me is I don't have empathy, I don't feel guilt, and I really, really don't know how to connect to people in a genuine way. I don't have a desire to make friends or maintain them, the only people that I'm interested in are new sexual partners and that's for a limited time usually. If anyone has questions I'll try to answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Honestly it depends on what you mean by psychopath. The popular culture definition and the clinical definition have some similarities but are largely different. </p>
<p>With the advent of the diagnostic and statistical manual 5 there is no more psychopath or sociopath (never studied version 4 so not sure if it's in there). There may however be a coding in the ICD 10 ( an international coding and diagnostic tool). Now what we know as a psychopath or sociopath is referred to as &quot;anti social personality disorder&quot;.</p>
<p>From the clinical perception a person would not be diagnosed as &quot;slightly&quot; or &quot;sort of&quot; having anti social personality disorder. On a general basis any diagnosis is that you have it or you don't, with some exceptions for autism spectrum disorder. There are some major exceptions to this though.</p>
<p>The first exception is specific to personality disorders. The practitioners and instructors that I interact with often refer to people having &quot;traits&quot; or &quot;tendencies&quot;. Now I haven't come across any examples of this in research, it just seems to be widely accepted shorthand in my geographical area. Basically what they are saying is that the person has some key behaviors that coincide with a specific diagnosis yet they don't meet the full criteria of diagnosis. For instance when we are watching a case video in class they will often comment with &quot;client seems to have certain borderline traits with a primary diagnosis of disruptive mood disregulation disorder&quot; or something similar.</p>
<p>The second exception is how the DSM 5 functions. For certain disorders you can and sometimes are required to affix certain verbiage to a diagnosis. These &quot;specifiers&quot; can be subclasses of symptoms or severity. While a diagnosis for anti social personality disorder does not require this a clinician could still specify the severity as mild, moderate or severe. Severity specifiers are based out of how many criteria the patient meets beyond the bare minimum and to what extent the patients life is impacted negatively.</p>
<p>The last exception to the &quot;either you have it or you don't&quot; functionality is what they call &quot;unspecified personality disorder&quot;. This basically means that their is definitely a problem but the clinician would have to shoe horn in a diagnosis. So a therapist could see a client has some diagnostic criteria for anti social personality disorder but dosnt meet all the requirements.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that in the back of the DSM 5 it shows a new model that's not implemented yet for diagnosing personality disorders. My personal opinion is that it looks a lot like they will be moving to a spectrum approach for personality disorders.</p>
<p>TLDR: the answer is yes and no. All human behavior can be looked at on a spectrum but diagnosis is a little trickier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
