		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Who&quot; is a subject. It does things in sentences.</p>
<p>&quot;Whom&quot; is an object. Things are done to it in sentences.</p>
<p>E.g. &quot;Whom did you see today?&quot; vs. &quot;Who saw you today?&quot;</p>
<p>It's the same as the difference between &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me;&quot; &quot;I&quot; is a subject and &quot;me&quot; is an object.</p>
<p>As far as I know who/whomsoever means the exact same thing as who/whomever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Who = subject (person/thing doing the action)
Whom = object (person/thing receiving the action)</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know who stole my applesauce.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know whom you told to steal my applesauce.&quot;</p>
<p>Notice in the second sentence, &quot;you&quot; does the action of telling someone to steal. The person being told to steal is &quot;whom&quot;.</p>
<p>We don't care much about this in English anymore, but in other languages (German for example), the difference is crucial.</p>
<p>You'd be surprised at how many things we say incorrectly. We accept them even though they might be totally illogical. I only became aware of them from learning other languages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
