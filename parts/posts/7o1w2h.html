		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Half a dozen or so.</p>
<p>The number you're asking about is the &quot;basic reproduction number&quot;, abbreviated &quot;R0&quot; (pronounced &quot;R nought&quot;) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number" target="_blank">Wikipedia link</a>).  R0 &quot;can be thought of as the number of cases one case generates on average over the course of its infectious period, in an otherwise uninfected population&quot;.  </p>
<p>There are many, many different viruses that are included in the common cold complex, but rhinoviruses are the classic cold-causing viruses.  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2014/oct/15/visualised-how-ebola-compares-to-other-infectious-diseases" target="_blank">This graphic</a> shows many different R0s, with &quot;Rhinovirus (Common cold)&quot; shown on the bottom row at about 6. </p>
<p>That puts rhinoviruses in a fairly typical range for diseases that are quite contagious. A handful of diseases, like measles, are much higher; many diseases, including some that are very capable of widespread transmission (influenza) are much lower. So long as a disease has an R0 over 1 it has the potential to persist.</p>
<p>Obviously R0 is not a single, fixed value; it depends on a huge number of environmental factors, on the population that's being infected, and so on, so this is just a vaguely useful rule of thumb rather than a hard and fast law.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well there is a simple bit of statistics to estimate how many people you pass on a disease too, if the total number of people that is sick remains roughly the same over a longer period of time than the average number every person passes the disease on too is 1, if the number of people that are sick quickly decreases it's less than 1 and if the number of sick people quickly increases it's more than 1. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming a non-changing amount of people having the cold, the average person having the cold leads to 1 other person getting the cold, thus passing on the illness to one. However, he or she will pass on the virus to quite a few more, as most of the time somebody won't get ill from the virus before your immune system takes it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I didn't see this asked unless I missed it ...</p>
<p>If there is hundreds of different kinds of Rhinoviruses, would we be able to eventually catalog all of them?</p>
<p>And if we did manage to finally get all of them in some kind of catalog, could science potentially and finally create some kind of vaccine against all of them? Or would cold viruses eventually learn to change/evolve to be stronger and come back worse?</p>
<p>Also I am curious...how did a cold virus even get created? I'm curious how the first cold essentially started, was it because of unsanitary situations like clean water, bathroom hygiene etc?   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
