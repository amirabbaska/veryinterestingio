<p>It's not that I have problems with its being staged, as such. Well-staged fights, as in movies, may be fun to watch. But what bits of pro wrestling I saw do not look well-staged <em>at all</em>. They are rather.... pathetic is the word. What am I missing?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a big fan of pro-wrestling. It's easier to understand if you think of it as real-life super heroes. Pretty much everyone who is a fan knows it's scripted (trust me, we condescendingly hear it every time we mention it's an interest). </p>
<p>The appeal of wrestling vs. 'real' fighting (MMA, UFC, Boxing, etc.,) is that it's a year-long affair. For instance, WWE has two televised weekly events and 1 monthly pay per view. This allows for long-term character developments and for there to be a battle of good vs. evil. Good vs. evil is huge in wrestling - WWE usually pits the boss against the small guy who has to 'overcome' the evil bosses continued harassment - like handicap matches, backstage attacks, new powerful signees etc., </p>
<p>Of course, the 'promos'/interviews are all scripted. And, you have a variety of styles. Some will take on the role of a super athlete, some will be a comedy routine, some will mimic B-Roll horror movies, some act like royalty/celebrities, etc., All of that leads to Saturday Night Live-esque skits (some jokes, some serious) that fans like myself find quite entertaining. </p>
<p>If you doubt the acting talent, just remember that The Rock started his career in wrestling and is now Hollywoods top paid actor. I'm not saying that everyone will love the Rock, but that seems to suggest that the WWE has an emphasis on getting genuinely interesting people on the microphone. </p>
<p>Lastly, you have the wrestling itself. I like to think of it like a mix between amatuer wrestling, UFC, and gymnastics. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh22y0T-2O0" target="_blank">Here's my best attempt to convince you</a> that wrestling has some pretty cool stunts. In wrestling terminology, this is what's called a &quot;spot.&quot; It's one of the 'big sequences' of moves in a match. Most of the match is normally ad-libbed - but some sequences are planned out before hand, usually the riskier/more dangerous shit. If you watch wrestling 'critically', you can quite easily see/hear moves being called out between the guys in the match. Great wrestlers can make the ad-libbed part move smoothly. Bad/inexperienced ones botch it. A fan appreciates both the good and the bad and aren't exactly looking for every match to be a 5* match. It's like watching something like American Idol and expecting everyone to not suck. So watching the poorly done matches can be just as interesting as a great one. </p>
<p>Also: plenty of these guys have martial arts/amateur wrestling experience. So while they're not actually making the holds be damaging, they're doing semi-real moves that if they put a little more pressure on <em>could break someones arm.</em> A good pro-wrestler can make it look a lot like an actual hold - it's the bad ones that you usually see in &quot;LOL WRESTLING!!!&quot; videos on youtube. </p>
<p>EDIT: Saw a few recommendations from fellow fans that I thought that I'd add to the comment</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYvMOf3hsGA" target="_blank">Wrestling isn't Wrestling</a> a well-done/humourous explanation of the development of a wrestling character. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmMRBnU-Vac&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m49s" target="_blank">Awesome sequence by Sami Zayn &amp; Cesaro</a>. </p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgSzYxmQDqA" target="_blank">A quality full-length match between two of the best in the business, Shinsuke Nakamura vs. Sami Zayn</a>. It's a more 'technical match' with nods to fighting sports. I'd argue it's more of a pro-wrestling fans wet dream than a casual fans, but since it's what a pro-wrestling fan sees as a quality match it's worth posting. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>100 or so years ago, pro wrestling was real sport, but beginning to become fixed. Now originally, that just meant more and more fixed fights, to avoid boring lengthy draws that were all too common and which the crowd didn't like (to explain: at that point pro wrestling, at least in the USA, had close ties to carnival wrestling and the associated chicanery). </p>
<p>Once it became sufficiently fixed, however, since the wrestlers were often &quot;in the know&quot;, outlandish things could be introduced to further titillate the crowd, for example, a wrestler who would jump off the ropes and land on his opponent. No one would have seen it done before, because it wouldn't have worked in a real match. So how would the crowd know it wouldn't work &quot;for real&quot; if they'd never seen it tried? They wouldn't, and were thus amazed at the display of athleticism and gymnastics and how it devastated the opponent. The people in charge of the show didn't care about authenticity, they wanted to sell tickets!</p>
<p>The pro wrestling you see today in the WWE is the culmination of 100-odd years of steadily less and less realistic wrestling (with the purpose of selling tickets), which has got to the point that it makes no claim whatsoever to be, or attempt to resemble, legitimate competition, and nor does its viewer base desire it to. Since it was so gradual, instead of a mass exodus in disgust, the wrestling savvy fans who wanted to see something real, or at least resembling real sport, were by degrees slowly replaced by people who cared less and less about sporting competition or the art of wrestling, and more and more about excitement and drama. It's now got its own enclave, its own place in our culture, somewhere between sport and theatre, but is still constantly evolving, so who knows what it might look like in another century!</p>
<p>I hope that helped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;Professional wrestling. The question you have to ask yourself about professional wrestling is a simple one. If professional wrestling did not exist, could you come up with this idea? Could you envision the popularity of huge men in tiny bathing suits pretending to fight? Could you sell this to a promoter? &quot;I'm telling you, Sid, millions of people will enjoy watching this. The guys'll be huge, we'll put them in little suits, and they won't really fight.&quot; </p>
<p>Professional wrestling is the only sport where participants are just thrown right out into the audience, and no one in the crowd thinks anything unusual is happening. If you're watching a golf tournament and Jack Nicklaus goes flying over your head - first of all, I would say you're watching a very competitive tournament.</p>
<p>And how about the professional wrestling referee? There's a great job. You're a referee in a sport with no rules of any kind. How do you screw that up? The referee is kinda like Larry of the Three Stooges. You don't really need him, but it just wouldn't be the same without him. They must get these guys from the same place the Harlem Globetrotters get their refs. There must be this whole school where they teach you to just kind of run around and not notice anything. They sit you down, show you a film of the rub-out scene from St. Valentine's Day Massacre, and if you don't see anything illegal going on, you're hired.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest thing to understand is that it is not designed to simulate a real fight at all. It does not even pretend to be a real fight, it is story telling through mock combat. It's a stage show. </p>
<p>Sometimes what is on display is just raw athleticism like in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVV9mNc7AGg#t=04m24s" target="_blank">match</a>. Where it is two wrestlers just putting on a show of how athletic they are.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is the raw spectacle of the event like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hMp65SzyTU#t=01m20s" target="_blank">this</a> very famous scene.</p>
<p>And other times it is about the story. That is harder to get across unless you know the people in the match. But Wrestling has told some amazing stories in the ring.</p>
<p>The only tick to enjoying pro wrestling is to forget is is suppose to simulate a real fight. Everything else is great.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
