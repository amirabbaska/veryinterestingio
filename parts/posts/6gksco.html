		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is no. Race is a social construct which doesn't exist in the physical world. The idea of race as more than a cultural concept is pretty much rejected scientifically. Here's the American Anthropological Association's <a href="http://www.americananthro.org/ConnectWithAAA/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2583" target="_blank">statement on race</a>.</p>
<p>America's last President had a &quot;white&quot; mother and a &quot;black&quot; father and was raised by his &quot;white&quot; grandparents in Hawaii. Yet he is considered to be black. Why? Racism, which resulted in the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-drop_rule#Twentieth_century" target="_blank">hypodescent</a>. </p>
<p>What makes someone whose genetic heritage is 1/8 African a &quot;black&quot;? Nothing, other than the  &quot;one-drop&quot; rule which has absolutely no bearing in science.</p>
<p>What &quot;race&quot; are these <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WpblcdxKc28/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">babies</a>?</p>
<p>If you arrange humans into groups based on how they are actually related, those groups won't correspond even approximately to common notions of &quot;race.&quot;</p>
<p>Evidence from the analysis of genetics (e.g., DNA) indicates that most physical variation, about 94%, lies within so-called racial groups. Conventional geographic &quot;racial&quot; groupings differ from one another only in about 6% of their genes. This means that there is greater variation within &quot;racial&quot; groups than between them.</p>
<p>In formal terms, phenotype (outward appearance) was supposed to be a good predictor of genotype (deeper biological similarities). However, today we know that phenotype is a LOUSY indicator of genotype. Worthless, in fact. Ethiopians are more closely related to certain Mediterranean Europeans than they are to Pygmies, even though both are &quot;black.&quot; Australian Aborigines are as distantly related to Africans as it's possible for two living populations to be, yet they are both superficially &quot;black.&quot;</p>
<p>DNA testing has determined genetic-relatedness. Because of their isolation, Australian Aborigines have drifted further genetically from Africans than any other set of genes. Look at Google Earth and you'll see how this occurred.</p>
<p>However, this geographic and temporal isolation doesn't suddenly make them a &quot;race&quot;. Those genetic differences amount to 1/15th of the differences extant within any racial &quot;group&quot;. </p>
<p>The observers who seize on these minor variables, to classify human groups, while ignoring the far more dramatic variables within groups demonstrably don't do so out of any objective desire for the &quot;truth.&quot; </p>
<p>It's [pattern seeking] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia</a>) behaviour. </p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> </p>
<p>I am sort of amazed at the traction that this throwaway comment has engendered. The reactions here are quite extraordinary. I'd like to point out that the vast majority of the posters who have disagreed with this post have done so in a respectful and honest way. Most of these counter-arguments are founded, in some way,  in observable data. I find hope in this thoughtful discourse, and am happy that it seems that some of the fundamental flaws in this discredited construct are being critically examined by those who disagree. </p>
<p>Many posters called for this post to be locked, but this is a mistake, because simply silencing different opinions can never be a good plan. The value of forums such as this  one for human progress is inestimable. It helps strangers with differing perspectives from all cultures understand why others might think as they do. </p>
<p>This is what Reddit does when it is at its best. I am proud of the conversation and the contributors here. Let's not ever stop debating in this way. There is no way that I can respond to all of the comments in my inbox. It's not that I don't care or am dismissive, but there is work that needs doing.</p>
<p>Whoever gave me the Gold is a mensch. I have no idea what it does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's not go too far in the other direction.</p>
<p>Of course races exist. Chinese people look different from Sudanese people who look different from Finnish people who look different from Colombian people. Further, these differences are biological: your skin color, hair color, etc, are determined by your genes. Additionally, it's fair to say that there are cultural distinctions that go along with racial groupings.</p>
<p>What is NOT true is the underlying assumption that our commonly-used racial groupings indicate genetic relatedness. Most biologically relevant groupings are &quot;clades&quot; - groups that include a common ancestor and all of its descendants. Every member of a clade is more closely related to everyone else within that clade than any of them are to anyone outside of the clade. Human races are NOT clades. Far from it. It is untrue to claim that all black people are more closely related to all other black people than any of them are to a white person or an Asian person. In fact, the vast majority of human genetic variation is found within sub-Saharan Africa. If you were to pick two random African people, the odds are good that one would be more closely related to a random Mongolian or Native American than he would be to the other African.</p>
<p>Our races are loose conglomerations of people based on superficial phenotypes, NOT on an understanding of how populations are related to each other. Again - that's not to say that they don't exist at all. It's just important to know what they actually are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I found this <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/48/chaos/what-both-the-left-and-right-get-wrong-about-race" target="_blank">Nautilus article</a> about the genetics of race, but it's not really something that you can ELI5.  Here's a quote that summarizes the conclusion of the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The near impossibility of a definitive, scientific approach to interrogating genes, race, and IQ stands in contrast to the loose claims of pundits or scholars who assert that there is a genetic explanation for the black-white test score gap. That said, the consideration of genetics in racial analysis is not always pernicious. The ability to control for genotype actually places the effects of social processes, like discrimination, in starker relief. Once you eliminate the claim that there are biological or genetic differences between populations by controlling them away, we can show more clearly the importance of environmental (non-genetic) processes such as structural racism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I highly recommend reading through it even if it's a bit challenging to learn all of the genetics terms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The real meaning of the word human is &quot;an animal belonging to the genus Homo&quot;, and there used to be many other species of this the genus besides Homo sapiens. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
