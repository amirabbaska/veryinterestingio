		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is very unlikely. Oil forms when organic matter of the right composition (with as high a H:C ratio as possible so with as little cellulose as possible)  is buried rapidly at a depth where the geothermal gradient will allow the chemical transformation to oil &amp; gas. </p>
<p>There are thus 2 problems with Mars: 1 - While there is still some (but less and less) controversy over whether martian oceans existed, whether they were intermittent and how long they lasted, there is little controversy over the fact that they must have been quite shallow. This is a terrible constraint on the preservation of organic matter, in that storms may agitate bottom sediments and expose them to scavengers, bacteria and oxygen. Sucks for preservation. 2 - No plate tectonics means that basin development was slow, if indeed it was a thing. This makes it hard for whatever organic matter there may have been there to get buried deep enough to reach critical temperatures for the right chemistry to occur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If Mars ever had life it was in the shadows and partially under ground. No magnetic field means no protection from cosmic radiation. The Martian Radiation Experiment, or MARIE was designed to measure the radiation environment of Mars using an energetic particle spectrometer as part of the science mission of the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft (launched on April 7, 2001). It was killed by cosmic radiation from a solar flare. Outside of the Earth's magnetosphere is a dangerous place for a living organism to be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
