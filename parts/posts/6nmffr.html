		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know how blurred the lines are between indie and alternative music, but certain bands fall into 'indie rock' but under the umbrella term of alternative music, and others just 'alternative rock' which you wouldn't think of calling indie.
I used to think 'alternative' was the US name given to these kinds of bands and 'indie' was more associated with British music, but Radiohead (UK) is referred to as alternative rock while The Strokes (US) is considered indie.
Why would the likes of Radiohead, Oasis (and other Britpop bands), Nirvana, Muse, Chillis etc usually not referred to as indie bands yet Arctic Monkeys, Arcade Fire, The Smiths etc. are?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple definition is that &quot;indie&quot; is short for independent and means that the band is (or was) signed to an independent record label (or the &quot;independent&quot; subsidiary label of a major record label). </p>
<p>Alternative stems from an older generation of music. Back in the 80s there mainstream popular rock music that was one of either three traditions, a cartoon-y hair metal, the more generally more dance-y new wave bands or the resurgence of &quot;traditional american rock&quot; like Tom Petty or Billy Joel. Alternative was the stuff in the underground that wasn't that, and in that time period wasn't very popular. Then, in the early 90's Nirvana blew up bringing tons of alternative bands into the mainstream. So lots of random bands got signed to major label record deals.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this gets complicated by &quot;indie&quot; music hitting the mainstream sometime in the mid 2000s (arguably with the wild success of Arcade Fire) and a lot of Indie bands got signed to major label contracts and thus couldn't technically be &quot;indie&quot; but kept getting called that. So, that eventually meant that the label of &quot;indie&quot; could refer to a certain ethos, or sound style not just the status of the bands record label. </p>
<p>So the reason Radiohead is alternative is because they were signed to a major record label starting back in the early 90s post Nirvana grab-bag. The same is true of Muse (and The Chili Peppers, though I actually think they may have had a major label deal before Nirvana hit the mainstream). The Strokes were &quot;indie&quot; because they were signed to Rough Trade (I think?) when they became successful. Arcade Fire used to be on Merge (an indie record label) but is now on Columbia (a major). The Smiths were on Rough Trade   and the Arctic Monkeys were on Domino (an indie label) before signing to a major. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I realize that most people who answer on ELI5 tend to have worked in the field for a while but Ill tell you my observations. I think that both terms &quot;indie&quot; and &quot;alternative&quot; have been bastardized and no longer used correctly. &quot;Indie&quot; music, short for independent used to imply that the particular artist was not signed to a record label and released their music independently. However, as more and more of these artists have been signed to record labels the term feels like it is just used to describe &quot;hipster music&quot;. On the other hand &quot;alternative&quot; music came about in the late 80's as a term to describe music that was different than most of the music coming out at the time but as other artists imitating their style or with a similar sound also got popular their style got their own names (ie Grunge). Because of this most new genres of the past 30 years could have been called &quot;alt&quot; at some point, and it feels like a term iTunes and other music distribution services use to describe music that they don't know what to call it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is just my random take on it, but I assume it helps to look at the names themselves -  &quot;alternative&quot; means &quot;non-mainstream&quot; i.e. sounding different to whatever is currently popular, whereas &quot;indie&quot; means &quot;independent&quot; i.e. not from a major record label. The music that falls under &quot;alternative&quot; in my experience tends to be more edgy and progressive (but still quite popular), and &quot;indie&quot; stuff is more light-hearted and catchy, and can be anything from unheard of to world famous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are cliquish.  They will create artificial divisions in things that are basically the same - EDM, techno, happy hardcore, whatever are all substantially more similar than different, but particularly younger people need to find tribal affiliations in terms of liking and disliking different musical subgenres.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
