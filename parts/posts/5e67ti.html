<p>With tech being made in more compact ways (Sleek books, Really Slim phones) why cant they create a Technology or the Technology  to make a Battery Compact but <strong>Can</strong> last for more than a day or two.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I suspect this will be an unpopular opinion here, but the main factor standing in the way of decent battery life is design trendiness.</p>
<p>I'm still currently using a Samsung Galaxy S5. Stock, it comes with a 2800 mAh battery. The stock battery is invariably too small for me, so the same day I got the phone I got a ZeroLemon battery, 8800 mAh. It's not a battery case; it's basically a stock battery with two other batteries stuck to it and a case that fits around the whole phone. It's like having an OtterBox.</p>
<p>All of this basically adds up to a battery life that's what I feel is appropriate. On a normal day I'm still over 50% when I go to bed. This is fine and works well, but due to my job and hobbies I have a lot of &quot;non-normal&quot; days where I actually have to charge the phone during the day to make it to the end of the day: the screen is on a lot or the phone is searching for service all the time because I'm in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it's not a battery <em>case</em>. You take the back off the phone, remove the battery, replace it with the new one, and replace the back with a different piece that comes with the battery. I can't emphasize enough how much better this is than an external, secondary battery. I tried a few of those on previous phones and they were pretty annoying. There are extra layers of plastic, so they take up a lot more volume per unit of power, extra circuitry, and the efficiency loss due to charging one battery with another degrades the performance even more. </p>
<p>Honestly given the size and shape of the phone I'd prefer that there was a battery on the back the size and shape of the current phone itself. I think that would be probably about four times the volume of my current ZeroLemon battery, giving a life of about a week.</p>
<p>This of course will never happen. The reason it won't is that nobody in the design field is even willing to propose an aftermarket battery that makes the phone so heavy and large. It's not &quot;sexy.&quot;  These people seem to be in an arms race to drive the phone to thinner and thinner dimensions. I couldn't care less about having a phone the thickness of an ordinary pencil; I just want to be able to go off-grid for a few days and not have to worry about charging.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Growing technology is the problem. As battery technology improves, hardware components develop which needs even more battery power. With more power to draw from, phone manufacturers put faster processors, higher resolution screens and more sensitive cameras. The end result is the same battery life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Batteries got a lot better when we switched from nickel-cadmium to lithium ion batteries about 15 years ago. That change allowed for a much larger amount of energy to be stored in the same area. The problem now is that we've perfected Li+ battery technology and there's not much more we can do with it. Some sort of alternative energy storage medium will be needed to go much farther, but most people in the tech industry are thinking that's at least 5 years out.</p>
<p>As a rule, storing energy is really tough. Storing energy in a compact, portable form for use on demand? Even tougher.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
