		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you mean on really old CRT screens, the whole picture was drawn by a single point flying across the screen very fast, horizontally, then stepping down a vertical level and repeating. When you turn it off, the inputs driving that beam go to 0v. The outputs of that beam are at high voltage so take a little while to drain, causing the beam to sort of sit on one line, which eventually shrinks to a point, before the power source of the beam dies too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The image in a CRT monitor is formed by shooting electrons at the screen. However, all electrons are shot at the center of the screen, and are diverted to their correct position by coild creating a magnetic field. As power is lost (which takes a bit of time, because the power unit has capacitors, which acts as reservoirs for electric power, to smooth out the current), these coils get weaker, and the electrons are diverted less and less, and eventually just hit the center of the screen, but by then, the monitor is usually shut down anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is no longer really a thing, because the kind of display - really old-school tube-based TVs - no longer exist.</p>
<p>The only reason you are likely to see it is that some people designing displays like how it looks (they're old, and their grandparents had such a TV), and so they program their computers to display a zoom-out animation before turning off the power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
