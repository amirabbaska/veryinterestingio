		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since there is nothing to push back against the cloth, the only physical forces governing the movement would be the three laws of motion. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion</a> (this is always true, but I mean the actual results are simple enough that it's easy to understand exactly how it will act)</p>
<p>If the ship isn't accelerating the cloth wouldn't move at all. If it ship is accelerating the cloth will point away from the direction of acceleration. If there is a quick change it will bounce around a bit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the Apollo astronauts planted a flag on the moon it had a wire frame in the upper seam to keep the flag extended out.  Planting the flag in the lunar regolith involved a twisting motion of the flag pole, and this imparted a pendulum motion on the lower part of the flag that some less informed people took to be the flag waving in a breeze, and was <em>evidence</em> that the landing was faked.  Of course, it wasn't faked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a small correction to all the other answers, but mostly they're correct.  The flag will not move unless the ship is under acceleration.</p>
<p>Except, every move that cloth makes is stretching some fibers somewhere.  It acts like a spring in many different ways.  When the ship stops accelerating, the tension will be released and the cloth will relax and crumble to a slack position.  It may oscillate as it finds a rest state.</p>
<p>There is also likely to be vibration from any working machine on the ship, or any living thing, even if they're only breathing.  That can cause the flag to move.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is some ambiguity here, so I'll try to go through it.</p>
<p><strong>If the spacecraft is in space, and is &quot;in motion&quot; around a body, but <em>not</em> accelerating by its own engines</strong></p>
<p>The flag will remain stationary in whatever configuration it was in.</p>
<p><strong>If the spacecraft is in space, in motion, the flag is affixed, and then the spacecraft accelerates with its own engines</strong></p>
<p>The flag will realize a moment of fluttering as the acceleration acts on the craft, then the flag pole, then the parts of the flag. Afterwards, it will remain perfectly straight (assuming the engines push <em>perfectly</em> in the same direction, and no lateral movements occur).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
