		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you may be refering to is the Pitch Tone of the message. High pitch notfication sounds are going to sound higher than lower pitch ones.  When i get an amber alert, it uses a stock notfication sound not my normal one which is a higher pitch however it will not bypass my volume settings so that might be throwing you off</p>
<p>Also phone speakers can go higher then what they are limited to, The reason makers lock it is because it begins to become distored and thats not good for business.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Amber alerts are designed with a few things in mind.
One of those important things is to amplify the importance of a message being broadcast. in order to do so, the audio for the broadcast is fitted to the most sensitive spectrum of the average humans' hearing. this means that regardless of technical volume, the messages sent for an amber alert, or another alert, would be heard as louder due to their being within the most sensitive spectrum of the human ear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you're talking about the 'emergency alert system' tone (which is what my phone plays for amber alerts anyway) that sound is just two sine waves mixed together.  A sine wave is a pure sound consisting of just one frequency at a constant volume.  This will sound louder than music, which is a complex combination of many different frequencies.  Plus with music, the dynamics change over time, so the perceived average sound volume will be less than the maximum level the device is capable of playing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a related question, why do I get an amber alert because a child 400 miles away from me was driven away with his or her biological father.  Is there some specific reason to believe most of these fathers are going to be driving straight through my town?  Have most of these fathers been charged with abuse or at least driving under the influence?  It all seems like the amber alert is becoming the allegorical &quot;boy who cried wolf&quot; if half of them are in no real danger at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
