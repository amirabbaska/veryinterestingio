		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a common misconception that a mayfly (Ephemeroptera) only lives one day. They have four phases: Egg, nymph, subimago and imago. Most of their life is spent as a nymph under water. They live for up to a year before they emerge to the surface and &quot;hatch&quot; into an adult subimago. After hanging out for a bit, they molt one last time and become an imago. From there they mate and die - that last part is what lasts a day. For all intents and purposes, they probably evolve at about the same rate as other insects.</p>
<p>Comparing the fossil record of both Ephemeroptera and Homo Sapiens, I could make an argument that factors other than the generational cycle time is driving evolution of the species; some species simply &quot;break out&quot; - perhaps due to an interaction with the environment. It's believed that evolution is not necessarily linear, but is full of fits, starts and breakthroughs. As far as species go, mayflies are rather primitive and are quite similar to their ancestors from 300 Million years ago. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the answers are focusing on speed of evolution in relation to generation time. No one is mentioning that mayflies live way longer than a day. In some species the adult stage may only last one or a few days, but the juvenile aquatic stage lasts months or even years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would be more accurate to say it increases their <em>potential</em> to evolve faster.  </p>
<p>Rates of evolution depend on a series of factors, most prominently selection pressure, mutation rate, and reproductive rate. Without a strong selective pressure, and mutations that satisfy it, faster reproduction alone will not give rise to faster evolution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, short reproduction cycles have faster results, but the winged part of the mayfly lifecycle is not the whole lifecycle, like many other insects it is only the final stage, if you want really fast evolution check-out bacteria and virus, they are really fast...    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
