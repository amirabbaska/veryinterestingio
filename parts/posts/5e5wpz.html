		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plant fibers swell when wet, and shrink when they dry, somewhat like sponges.  Among the last stages in making paper is rolling it between giant metal rollers, while it's still damp, but in the process of drying.  This pushes the fibers together, helping them interlock better so that it's stronger when it dries and shrinks down, and gives it that smooth texture.  When you get it wet again, those fibers swell back up again, and &quot;unlock&quot; from one another, like hair on a damp day.  When it dries back out, unless you roll it back flat while still damp, those fibers will stay unlocked and frizzy.  Paper that's gotten wet and dried again will also be less strong and easier to tear than paper straight out of the package.  </p>
<p>There's also various chemicals that are added to the pulp to help the fibers stick together and not be quite as absorbent as it would otherwise be, and when you get it wet, some of those chemicals are diluted or washed away.</p>
<p>You can think of it like having naturally wavy hair, and making paper is like washing your hair, ironing it flat, and filling it full of product to keep it that way.  All it takes is a good drenching, or even just a humid day, and your hair is back to being all crazy-wavy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cellulose and hemicellulose fibers that paper is made of has lots of hydroxyl groups. A hydroxyl group consists of hydrogen and oxygen.  These groups form hydrogen bonds with each other, which holds the paper together.
When paper gets wet via water aka H2O the water forms competing hydrogen bonds with the cellulose and hemicellulose.
When you dry the paper the cellulose and hemicellulose hydrogen bonds come back... but not quite the same as before. You know have wrinkled paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read on here that a piece paper is like a giant group of forks, stacked up and lying in orderly rows next to each other. Once you bend the paper (or flood the group with water) the forks fall of and tangle with the others next to them. When the water's gone or you unfold the paper the forks are still there but they're all in a heap and are no longer ordered :) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
