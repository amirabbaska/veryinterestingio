		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read that light is detectable at a depth of 1000 meters, but photosynthesis is only possible at 200 meters. The verbiage used by the article I read was &quot;significant light is only present at above 200 meters,&quot; but does &quot;significant&quot; mean the energy of the photons at that depth is diminished or simply that the frequency of photons hitting the sensors is decreased? </p>
<p>Is photonic energy simply absorbed by the ocean to the point where photons can no longer exist? Or does the &quot;wave&quot; of light energy dissipate into the ocean like a sound or shockwave would? </p>
<p>Moreover, are there other methods of gathering information through the medium of water that are more effective than light? For example, is the effective range of SONAR greater than that of, say, a light source? What about low wavelength vs high wavelength light?</p>
<p>Sorry if it seems like I'm asking for a 101 in photons and electromagnetic energy, never learned this stuff in physics. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one seems to be answering your question with photons:</p>
<p>Think about light from the sun as a hail of lots of photons.</p>
<p>Each photon travels until it hits something. Some things can “bounce” photons off them, some things just suck in the photon.</p>
<p>Lots of photons from the sun make it through the air and start travelling into the water. But seawater has stuff floating in it that absorbs photons. For each metre of water, some photons will hit something, and some will make it through without hitting anything.</p>
<p>If you look for photons 300 metres deep in the sea, you will only find the very lucky photons who made it through 300 metres of water without hitting anything, and hardly any photons are that lucky.</p>
<p>Edit: I just thought of a good analogy – it’s like a crazy guy spraying a machine gun around in a forest. Bullets stop when they hit a tree, but some bullets can go quite far before they hit a tree. If you can get a mile away from the crazy machine gun guy, your chances of getting hit go down to practically zero.</p>
<p>Edit 2: please stop accusing me of being an American.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Roughly speaking, every metre of water will reduce the light by a fraction. Let's say that after 10m half the light is gone. After 20m, only a quarter would be left. After 100m, only a thousandth of the light would be getting through. (Number pulled out of my thin air.) In practice, presence of creatures/debris/different pressures/etc will affect it, but broadly speaking it will decrease exponentially with depth.</p>
<p>Sonar is a wave in the water itself. As it propagates differently, it does not decay exponentially in the same way, allowing it to potentially propagate far longer distances. How it does propagate is rather complicated, and dependant upon a lot of variables, especially the frequency. Most frequencies would not work, sonar uses frequencies specially chosen for how well they function at the task.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's something that nobody seems to answer: water isn't completely transparent, it's just very, very translucent. Even if the water was completely free of particles, after about 200-300m you wouldn't be able to see any light. Only a true vacuum can transmit 100% of the light that passes through it. And a true vacuum doesnt actually exist anywhere in nature that we know of. We can get close in a laboratory, but that's it. Even deep space sucks up light, because all of it has a tiny tiny bit of matter floating around in it, like a couple atoms per square foot or something. But that's enough to reduce light, if you look at it with enough space between it and you. That's one reason why, incidentally, that some stars appear brighter than others. If outer space didnt diminish light whatsoever, the entire sky on average would be aapproximately as bright as the sun. Any physical matter sucks up photons, given enough of it. It just takes about 300m of water to see that it's not actually transparent.</p>
<p>As for photosynthesis, it's a process that requires a minimum threshold of light to make it happen. Without that minimum amount of light, there isn't enough energy to break/create the chemical bonds that are required for that process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Same thing happens in space too. Space isn't completely empty, and over a large enough distance, the light can be obscured.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
