		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting that you should mention Bikini atoll.  Although it was devastated by a nuclear blast, it is now one of the healthiest reefs in the Pacific.  It has a high concentration of rare species and an amazing number of sharks and other large fishes, as well as things like giant clams.  Certainly the islands were damaged by the radiation, and the persistent radiation is probably harming the remaining life.  But more importantly is that the radiation has deterred people from coming to the area to fish.  However bad radiation is, fishing is far worse, as are the wastes released by human habitation.  You see similar effects around Chernobyl, which hosts large mammals that are difficult to find in the surrounding region.  Honestly  there are times that I think the best thing you could do for an area, environmentally speaking, is to dust it with radioactive waste.  Not that nuclear waste is great for wildlife, it just does an excellent job of scaring off the people.  It'd make a good movie villain plot, anyway.</p>
<p>You can read more about Bikini atoll here from the ICUN, an organization which tracks conservation and plays a big role in managing endangered species on an international level.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The after effects of nuclear weapons are greatly exaggerated.  A major exchange would probably destroy most existing human culture due to infrastructure disruption (without modern shipping almost all of us would starve in a few months) but our species has survived ice ages before so it's unlikely that we wouldn't survive another one.  You wouldn't be able to live in the bombed areas for a long time but most of the world is empty land, look at this <a href="https://www.kompulsa.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/U.S_Population_Density_By_County.png" target="_blank">picture of the us</a>, we probably wouldn't be able to live in the red parts, but that's not even a majority of the land space.   </p>
<p>When people talk about nuclear war destroying the world, they're talking about destroying the world as we know it.  It probably wouldn't kill everything on the planet, just all the one's responsible with some collateral damage as well but it wouldn't be a total loss.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure on the impact on the environment or why it is not killed us all but you can see the effects in what is called &quot;Low-background steel&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Low-background steel is any steel produced prior to the detonation of the first atomic bombs in the 1940s and 1950s. With the Trinity test and the Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, and then subsequent nuclear weapons testing during the early years of the Cold War, background radiation levels increased across the world. Modern steel is contaminated with radionuclides because its production used atmospheric air. Low background steel is so-called because it does not suffer from such nuclear contamination. This steel is used in devices that require the highest sensitivity for detecting radionuclides&quot;</p>

<p><em>&quot;It comes down in rain,&quot; Wiesner replied.</em></p>
<p><em>The President stared out the window at the rain falling on his precious Rose Garden. &quot;You mean there might be radioactive contamination in that rain out there right now?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Possibly,&quot; Wiesner said.</em></p>
<p><em>After Wiesner left the office, Kennedy quietly sat in his chair for several minutes, looking at the rain falling on the garden. &quot;I never saw him more depressed,&quot; recalled Ken O'Donnell.</em></p>
