		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This has been proven in animal models and strongly suggested by human studies (it's difficult to find volunteers to deliberately get infected for study). From the Business Insider article <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/cold-medicine-can-make-a-cold-or-the-flu-worse-2015-1" target="_blank">Your Cold Medicine Could Be Making Things Worse</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In one study of people with the common cold, researchers found that those who took fever reducers shed more of the virus than people who didn't. And a recent study of people with one strain of the flu found that the more doses of fever-reducing medicine someone received, the longer they stayed sick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A confounding factor is that rest is really important for recovery. If symptoms keep you from sleeping well, taking symptom suppressors before bed will speed recovery because of the better sleep. Or, taking symptom suppressors during the day and then NOT resting because you feel OK enough to be active will slow down recovery because you are not resting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read, once we get a cold, that's about it.  We must wait for it to run its course.  The reality of it is that the cold is a very minor sickness and actually, all the symptoms we experience are a great overreaction by our immune system.  The science community is not sure why the body reacts so strongly to colds, but suspect it's kind of a &quot;better safe than sorry&quot; approach from our bodies (though there are some people that are asymptomatic when it comes to colds).  </p>
<p>Cold medicines don't shorten colds, but, as you mentioned, only reduce the severity of the reactions.  It doesn't really &quot;hinder&quot; anything concerning recovery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert but my understanding is yes when it comes to fevers. I have two children and I've heard from a few sources (including doctors) that reducing fevers for the sake of just reducing the number isn't necessary and if the temp is not dangerous and my child isn't suffering, it's best to leave it alone because the temp helps the body fight the infection. I don't know if it really makes a significant difference in how long you'd be feverish for. </p>
<p>For other things, like congestion and coughing I'm not sure that the symptoms actually help in fighting the infection. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you mean a virus then generally no, a virus just has to run it's course and be done.  Other than that, depending on the illness the medicine could be preventing a severe overreaction to an infection (high fever which is dangerous) or preventing our body from efficiently eliminating the infection (taking anti-nausea/diarrheal with gastroenteritis can slow the rate at which the virus/bacteria are expelled from our system).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
