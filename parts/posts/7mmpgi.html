		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually worked on <a href="https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/12/f46/Seawater_desalination_bandwidth_study_2017.pdf" target="_blank">this report</a> that was just posted by DOE. It's part of a series where we look at how much energy different sectors would use (in this case seawater desalination for the United States) if the technology were to improve beyond the current baseline. The report also has interesting analyses on some &quot;what if&quot; scenarios for if desalination was used to provide drinking water to the entire U.S., water stressed regions, etc.</p>
<p>Seawater desalination is not used widely in the U.S. compared globally - there are only 2 large plants (one that opened late 2015 in Carlsbad, CA and one about 1/2 its size in Tampa, FL; both of these plants operate using reverse osmosis). Also the technology is slower to advance - reverse osmosis which has been around a long time is still the most effective today for larger plants which are not located right next to large power plants (for that case they might be able to use a thermal method like multi-stage flash desal which is used in the Middle East (in addition to RO). Because when desal and power plants are co-located, they can share things like intake/outake structures, the desal plant can use the power plant's cooling water to dilute its concentrate stream, and it can make use of waste heat as a power source. Also in the Middle East electricity is generally much cheaper for RO plants.</p>
<p>Technology wise for desalination, RO is already pretty efficient, but the desal community thinks there is room to improve the energy consumption from about 2.5 kWh/m3 for that step (for 50% recovery of 35,000 ppm feedwater). But when you compare it to brackish, surface, or groundwater treatment, yes it is much higher.  The numbers will vary widely depending upon salinity and recovery.</p>
<p>Basically it is pretty complicated. These plants are huge - they require a ton of water, are very expensive to build, require a lot of permitting and time, and by the time they are built often the technology can be kind of out of date. For example, the one being planned for Huntington Beach, CA has been planned for about 7-10 years I believe and they are having issues with permitting the intake based on concerns from the community.</p>
<p>The report I linked above focuses on energy specifically. Also see <a href="https://eta.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/publications/lbnl-1006424.pdf" target="_blank">this one</a> if you want some more numbers and background info. </p>
<p>ETA: If you want some comparison numbers to the 2.5 kWh/m3 for RO which is just for the desalination step (not the whole plant).. From the 2nd report I linked: from a 2013 report, it was estimated that conventional extraction, conveyance, and treatment of surface and groundwater for public use ranges from ~0.12 kWh/m3 for New York state to ~2.6 kWh/m3 in Southern California. And for brackish water RO, a few numbers referenced in the first report are 0.79 kWh/m3 (2500 ppm feedwater) and 1.32 kWh/m3 (7000 ppm feedwater) (both 75% recovery). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would recommend reading this <a href="https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/survival/wilderness/convert-salt-water2.htm" target="_blank">article</a> for a more in depth read but the main reason is simply cost. It can cost 2.5 to 5 times as much to desalinate water as it does to bring frshwater from elsewhere and it can cost even more depending on technology available. The two main ways to desalinate water is either through distillation, heat it up into steam and collect the mineral free steam as it cools, or through reverse osmosis, by using pressure to force the water through a filter which holds any minerals. While at least distillation is easy to accomplish in your backyard we are talking about providing water for countries here. Providing that much water required special treatment plants, a way to deliver a large amount of water from the sea, and energy to desalinate it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider California: Apart from a few cities in the central valley and north coast located directly on rivers, water doesn't come easy for anyone. San Francisco built a 200+ mile aqueduct to transport water from Yosemite National Park, where they dammed up a national treasure to collect their water - and that's one of the simpler projects. Los Angeles built a 400-mile gravity-only aqueduct that siphons off practically all of the snowmelt that flows east of our largest mountain range. The Central Valley Project combines dozens of massive reservoirs, pumping stations, and hundreds of miles of aqueducts to deliver water mostly to farmers in the south Central Valley. The State Water Project adds a few more massive key reservoirs, and a monumental 700-mile aqueduct. The two largest reservoirs in America were built on the Colorado River, and hundreds of miles of aqueducts built through the harshest desert and mile-tall mountains to bring its water to farms and cities.</p>
<p>Yet despite all these hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure costs, these are considered the cheap sources of water. San Diego is interesting because we get water from a number of different sources, including a brand new desalination plant. Despite the extent and complexity of the conventional water systems that are required bring water to us here, water from that desalination plant costs over twice as much.</p>
<p>That water is drought-proof, yes, but reservoirs add a large degree of drought resistance already. In the last drought, it took 4 years of sub-par precipitation including some of the driest years ever seen before we saw urban water use restrictions. (Agriculture saw cutbacks sooner, since they use 80% of all water). That degree of existing drought resistance raises the question: How much are you willing to spend day in and day out, every year, to ensure that water cutbacks are never seen? If you were willing to double what you pay for water, great! The problem is solved. But most people are not - especially when the alternative is 20% cutbacks about 1 year in 20.</p>
<p>So really, it is incorrect to call this an engineering problem, because the engineering is solved; it's an economic / social science problem about how we choose to allocate our resources to balance our needs for water security against our need for affordable water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s hard to make salt water into fresh water. Think about how corrosive and bad for metal salt water is, then make an enormous factory (made of metal) to filter and pump it. </p>
<p>Separating the water from the “other stuff” which is salt as well as organic matter, trash, sediment etc is exceptionally energy intensive. We have a problem with energy right now so this becomes very expensive. </p>
<p>Lastly, once you make all of this fresh water you have a big pile of salt. Way too much to sell as sea salt (organic and artisanal, gluten free. Whole Foods loves it) so you throw it back into the ocean, making the water around your plant saltier. This is bad for the environment and makes your job harder. </p>
<p>Consider that we CAN do this, the problem is making enough fresh water to be helpful without absolutely destroying the environment or going bankrupt. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is. Desalination technology has progressed a lot in the last 20 years. Israel is the world leader and provides almost 80% of it's drinking water through desalination. Nuclear plants on the coasts can even be set up to desalinate water, generating power to do it plus excess power for the power grid. </p>
<p>However, it's also really expensive. Until recently it was only economically viable in places like Israel who had the financial resources to invest in such a system long term. California is also investing in desalination but really they should have been doing it 20 years ago. There's no way they can build enough plants to meet <em>actual</em> demand over the next decade. Their pilot plant in the Huntington Beach area is set to go online and has a cost of $1B.</p>
<p>It requires a lot of energy to desalinate water. It raises the cost of the water as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
