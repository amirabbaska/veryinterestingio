		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you are sick you get increased mucus production. The mucus covers the surfaces inside your throat and is usually not an issue. However if you have too much it can start to flow and clump up. When you cough you push these clumps up the throat and it mixes with the rest of the mucus. This is why there might not come anything out. Making sure to clean out as much mucus as you can will help your breathing and reduce the coughing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of points in addition to those mentioned. There is continuous production of mucus in the lungs. There is a  ciliary (little hairs on cells) action that moves this up into the throat to be swallowed or expelled. Then there is mucus production in the nose that can drip posteriorly.
In addition to mucus, however, remember that when you have a cold or the flu there is usually viral infection and inflammation. This inflammation, the body's response to infection (and other insults), directly irritates the tissues and causes coughing presumably to accelerate expulsion of the insulting agent and mucus. This irritation can persist beyond the initial insult.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another reason for coughing is to expel air from your lungs. Breathing in is an active movement caused by your diaphragm flattening and your rib muscles lifting, breathing out is a passive movement, the relaxing following breathing in. So if your airways are inflamed and swollen when you have asthma or a chest infection the air that you have inhaled cannot leave as easily as it went into your lungs. So you cough to force the air out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
