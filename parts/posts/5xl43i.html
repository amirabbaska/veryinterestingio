		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are problems with PTSD and substance abuse that result from being in active war zones.  There's the problem that military certifications aren't always transferrable to non-military jobs.  So an army paramedic can't just become an ambulance driver.  They have to go through redundant training (time and money) to be &quot;qualified&quot; to do the job they already do.  The VA in too many places aren't staffed or funded or managed well enough to be able to help people in a timely manner.  It's always a big campaign issue that's never really solved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, certification.</p>
<p>When I was in, I maintained servers, worked on equipment worth billions in operations and in support of the entire Pacific Rim. I was a system administrator as well and could debug accounts as well as work on the circuits to connect two persons on a line through multitudes of different cryptographic and plain systems - from the highest of Classifications to Unclass bullshit.</p>
<p>None of that is transferable. They all want college degrees or certs from COMP-TIA. Don't have it? It doesn't matter what the fuck that training paper says you can do when you get out.</p>
<p>I went from that straight to unemployment while looking for any civilian job. If I wasn't charismatic and able to talk my way into work when I really need to, I'd be homeless as well.</p>
<p>Now I Scuba Dive. I went from facilitating international rendezvous over secure circuits and globally administrative duties... to working at a tattoo shop, then an arcade, now Scuba Diving and doing college.</p>
<p>None of your skills are marketable. Nobody gives a shit.</p>
<p>They tried to remedy this with TAPS - when you get out they make you take a class for resume writing. Guess what?</p>
<p>No civilian certs? You have a really long piece of toilet paper unless you want to go back into government work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vet checking in. Combat MOS for those wondering.</p>
<p>Many of these comments are somewhat right, but a big piece of the puzzle is missing.  Yes, PTSD sucks ass, but most of us manage/channel/and/or don't have it.  Most vets haven't seen combat, contrary to some of these posts.  The worst a lot of people have seen/heard is a mortar impact.  The training, while getting better (IMHO. I received a lot of &quot;life experience credits&quot; for a Bachelor's coming from a combat MOS), still has a lot of catching up to do as pointed out.  It is <em>extremely</em> hard to adjust to civ life after being in for some people, especially after multiple tours overseas.  This is where I believe the missing piece is. Institutionalization.  Having such routine, discipline, and structure attached to everything is difficult to part from.  Going from that to being able to grow your freedom beard (or, should I say &quot;allowed&quot; to emphasize the point) is kind of mind blowing.  Purpose and duty to mundane and boring AF is a brutal change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like everyone is saying, all the amazing shit you did in the military doesn't count towards anything in a civilian job unless you can express it on a resume properly, and lots of vets can't.</p>
<p>Here's a couple pro-tips for vets.</p>
<p>Have you ever signed for anything (of course you have) then you &quot;successfully managed and maintained equipment valued at (whatever cost...HMMWVs are about a quarter million bucks BTW)&quot;</p>
<p>Ever had to teach a class (you probably did) then you've &quot;successfully trained and prepared x number of personnel&quot;</p>
<p>Ever lead a detail or held a leadership position? Then you &quot;supervised x number of employees&quot;</p>
<p>Shit like that.</p>
<p>I put all this crap on my resume and got a job before my terminal leave was even over so I think I'm decent at spinning the army crap into relateable BS.  Then when you get the job work your ass off, civilians are fucking lazy and everyone is used to that so if you actually fucking work you're automatically in the top percentage of quality employees</p>
<p>Edit:  if anyone wants, inbox me and I'll help you spin your military shit into something real too</p>
<p>And another pro-tip for like everyone...print your resume on different color paper.  Like a subtle difference than plain white, nothing crazy but when there's a stack and the guy sees one that's slightly more blue or whatever he might pull it out first.. which is good</p>
<p>Edit. . . again:  Rip my inbox.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beyond the mental and medical issues veterans face, most military career fields have little to no documentation that the public or private sector accepts that the individual has the training and can do the job they are applying for. Have been on the receiving end of this since i got out in mid 90's. Did a hitch in Air Force as avionics maintainer- and was told i needed to go back to school for four more years at cost of 80-90 thousand per and also pay for the Airframe and Powerplant Licence before i could touch an aircraft.Did second hitch in the Army as Combat Engineer/Diesel and Construction Maintainer- as was told the same crap upon exit even though i SPECIALIZED in construction equipment(CAT) i &quot;didn't know SH*T&quot; and would cost top much to train- pay my own way- and NO GI Bill wouldn't cover it all- so no good job- no schooling - GI Bill wasted- and here i sit doing what work i'm &quot;qualified&quot; for..... plumbing manufacturing- got my training records- cost Uncle Sam 800,000 plus for all that training- and i pull down less than 30k a year. Just think of what most combat vets learned- without a skill usable in civilian left , the leadership they learned is not wanted or appreciated by most employers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
