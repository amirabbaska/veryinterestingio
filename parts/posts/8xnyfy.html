		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi reddit! I'm Dr. Laurie Santos, the Director of the <a href="https://caplab.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Comparative Cognition Laboratory at Yale</a> and the <a href="https://doglab.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Canine Cognition Center at Yale</a>. My research explores the evolutionary origins of the human mind by comparing the cognitive abilities of human and non-human animals, in particular primates and dogs. I focus on whether non-human animals share some of the cognitive biases that plague humans. My <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/laurie_santos" target="_blank">TED talk explored whether monkeys make the same financial mistakes as humans</a> and has been viewed over 1.3 million times. I was voted one of <a href="https://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2007-10/popscis-6th-annual-brilliant-ten" target="_blank">Popular Science Magazine's &quot;Brilliant 10&quot; young minds</a>, and was named in <a href="http://nation.time.com/2013/09/05/the-hottest-seats-in-class/#ixzz2eKG2OtfO" target="_blank">Time Magazine as a &quot;Leading Campus Celebrity&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>My new course, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/nyregion/at-yale-class-on-happiness-draws-huge-crowd-laurie-santos.html" target="_blank">Psychology and the Good Life</a>, teaches students how the science of psychology can provide important hints about how to make wiser choices and live a life that's happier and more fulfilling. The course recently became Yale's most popular course in over 300 years, with almost one of our four students at Yale enrolled. The course has been featured in numerous news outlets including the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/nyregion/at-yale-class-on-happiness-draws-huge-crowd-laurie-santos.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/yale-s-most-popular-class-is-teaching-students-how-to-lead-happier-lives-1155185731525" target="_blank">NBC Nightly News</a>, <a href="https://www.today.com/video/meet-yale-professor-who-teaches-a-course-on-happiness-1191222851857" target="_blank">The Today Show</a>, <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/laurie-santos-how-to-be-happy-interview" target="_blank">GQ Magazine</a>, <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/01/happiness-101-college-courses-are-a-mental-health-stop-gap.html" target="_blank">Slate</a> and <a href="http://www.oprah.com/inspiration/laurie-santos-happiness-research" target="_blank">Oprah.com</a>. I've also developed a shorter version of this course which is <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being" target="_blank">available for free on Coursera</a>.</p>
<p>I'm psyched to talk about animal minds, cognitive biases or how you can use psychological sciences to live better. I'll be on around 4 or 5pm EST (16/17 UT), AMA!</p></div></div>

I personally try to minimize the use of TCAs and SSRIs when it comes to managing cases, instead relying heavily on training and behaviour modification, and would be curious to hear your input on such.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
