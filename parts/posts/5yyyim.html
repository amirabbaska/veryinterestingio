		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some parameters that might be different:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brightness. A TV that's not bright enough will be difficult to watch in brightly lit environments, like a sunlit room.</li>
<li>Contrast. The difference between the brightest and darkest color the TV can display. Higher contrast means deeper blacks and brighter whites.</li>
<li>Color reproduction. How accurately the TV shows colors.</li>
<li>Transition time. The time it takes a pixel on the TV to switch colors. Too slow and fast movement will look blurry.</li>
<li>Input lag. How long it takes between a signal being received by the TV to actually being displayed. It's relevant if you play games on the TV, the lower the input lag the more responsive the game will feel.</li>
<li>Power use and reliability.</li>
<li>Features. A newer, fancier TV is probably going to have a lot extra features like automatic brightness control or connecting to the internet to watch YouTube or Netflix on its own without having to attach a computer. </li>
</ul>
<p>There's probably more but that's what I can think of right now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something no-one else has mentioned is materials/components, and quality standards. You can purchase cheaper materials and components, and make a tv that will work just as well as one built with much more expensive parts. But a cheap tv sacrifices reliability, lifetime, and predictability in quality standards. And two tv's built right next to each other can have unpredictable quality issues, like dead pixels. So they test the tv's, and the ones that are marginal are either rebranded and sold for a lower price, have features disabled and are sold as a lower model, or saved for events like black Friday. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A major improvement is the elimination of burn-in. If you have an older model and leave the same image on the screen, you'll see the remnants of that image once you switch to a different picture. </p>
<p>This is the reason for &quot;screen savers&quot; on a computer, to avoid burning your stationary desktop icons onto your screen for hours. </p>
<p>This was fixed quickly-ish on screens intended for computer use, but it took much longer to address for TVs since it was less important. If you use an older TV for a computer screen or watch a program like news with a stationary display in one part of the screen, you'll have problems. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people have mentioned the definite advantages but there can also be downsides to technology maturing. As prices come down on established technology some companies have to cut corners to remain profitable. This can lead to subtle changes in the quality of materials used in a product.</p>
<p>As the machines that make the products age they also become less accurate and harder to maintain in top condition. The higher end manufacturers will change their machines every X years, these machines are then either moved to production facilities in lower wage countries, that often have less well trained/experienced staff, or sell them to lower tier manufactures, also often in lower wage countries. </p>
<p>This can result in a price drop for consumers but also in products with a worse fit/finish and a drop in overall quality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;720p, 32 inches&quot; describe the display panel, and only vaguely. The panel has other properties like how fast the pixels can change colors, color accuracy, expected life time, and tons of other junk. BUT there are other components inside the tv such as a power supply, image processor, some more things, and then the circuit boards that actually run and control things.</p>
<p>Those different components have to be designed by engineers. A bad design could take a quality screen and not use it to its full potential, possibly burn it out faster, or have terrible energy efficiency. A good group of engineers can design a tv that uses a cheap screen and makes the most of its capabilities, makes the tv easier to use, and make it last a really long time. Those beast mode engineers don't come cheap.</p>
<p>Also, those components in the tv are made up of small pieces (capacitors, transistors, and on and on...). These pieces come in different qualities and tolerance ratings. If you pay more money for these pieces then you get longer lasting parts, have less variation in how well they operate, and less chance of getting a bad part.</p>
<p>Some other things you're paying extra for:</p>
<ul>
<li>the processor used in the tv</li>
<li>strong construction</li>
<li>visual design (people pay for beauty)</li>
<li>the quality of programming (a lot of those fancy image-enhancing features are done by a processor that runs code someone had to write. Better code = better quality)</li>
<li>to be cool like everyone else, since the marketing professionals tell you that.</li>
