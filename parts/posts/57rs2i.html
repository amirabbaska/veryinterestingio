Do they ever collide? Or is the gravitational attraction way too small?
But since gravitational fields are infinite they should collide at some point even if it took them something like 1*10³³ years or something.</p>
<p>Edit: WOW. Frontpage. Never expected so much attention. Seems like people wonder as much as I do. :D</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This can be solved using conservation of energy. The total initial energy is the gravitational potential energy:</p>
<p>E<em><em>i</em></em> = -Gm^(2)/r<em><em>0</em></em>.</p>
<p>The energy at time t is the sum of their relative kinetic energy and their potential energy at that point:</p>
<p>E<em><em>f</em></em> = mr'(t)^(2)/4 - Gm^(2)/r(t), where r(t) = |<strong>r**<em><em>1</em></em>(t) - </strong>r**<em><em>2</em></em>(t)|, and the extra factor of 1/2 comes from the reduced mass and the fact that we're looking at the <em>relative</em> kinetic energy.</p>
<p>Now you can set these equal to each other:</p>
<p>mr'(t)^(2)/4 - Gm^(2)/r(t) = - Gm^(2)/r<em><em>0</em></em>.</p>
<p>One factor of the mass cancels, and you can simplify to:</p>
<p>r'(t)^(2) = 4Gm(1/r(t) - 1/r<em><em>0</em></em>).</p>
<p>So:</p>
<p>dr/dt = 2sqrt[Gm(1/r - 1/r<em><em>0</em></em>)].</p>
<p>This is now a separable differential equation which can be directly integrated for the desired result:</p>
<p>dt = (2sqrt[Gm(1/r - 1/r<em><em>0</em></em>)])^(-1) dr</p>
<p>= (2sqrt[Gm(r<em><em>0</em></em> - r)/(r<em><em>0</em></em>r)])^(-1) dr</p>
<p>= (2sqrt(Gm))^(-1) sqrt[r<em><em>0</em></em>r/(r<em><em>0</em></em> - r)] dr.</p>
<p>This integral can be solved analytically, and somebody worked it out <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/14700/the-time-that-2-masses-will-collide-due-to-newtonian-gravity" target="_blank">here</a>. Somebody there also pointed out that you can get this result directly from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion#Third_law" target="_blank">Kepler's third law</a>.</p>
<p>Using the given numbers and the equation derived in the first Stack Exchange comment, I get an answer of about <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=pi%2F(2sqrt(2\)\" target="_blank">3*10^(29) seconds</a>+(1+lightyear)%5E(3%2F2)<em>(gravitational+constant+</em>+2+*+100+gram)%5E(-1%2F2)).</p>
<p>So they always collide assuming Newtonian gravity (no expansion of space, no effects of GR), but it will take a very long time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>10 cm diameter is a heck of a big marble. Also it's 524 cubic centimeters and just 100 gram, ie. a density of 0.19 g/cm^3 - lower than any pure solid I can think of. More comparable to porous insulation materials like mineral wool. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Never. The expansion rate of the universe is 8.55×10^^-19 ^m/s /m. At 1 ly, that rate is 2.64 cm/s, with an acceleration of 2.26×10^^-20 m/s^^2
Essentially, v(t)=bx(t) + v<em>0</em> where b = expansion constant, or a (t)=b ^dx/ dt.</p>
<p>On the other hand, gravitational acceleration is a (t) = g×m/x(t)^2 , or 6.67×10^^-11 *0.1/(3.086×10^^16 )^^2 = 7.0×10^-45 m/s^2</p>
<p>Since the acceleration due to gravity shrinks as the two marbles move away, and the acceleration due to universe expansion increases as you move further apart, and the acceleration due to gravity is less than the expansion due to the universe, the marbles will only get further and further apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
