Do they ever collide? Or is the gravitational attraction way too small?
But since gravitational fields are infinite they should collide at some point even if it took them something like 1*10³³ years or something.</p>
<p>Edit: WOW. Frontpage. Never expected so much attention. Seems like people wonder as much as I do. :D</p></div></div>
