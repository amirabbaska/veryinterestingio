		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the most common methods of obtaining absolute ethanol is by  taking the 95.4% azeotrope and adding a third component such as benzene. This third component, called the entrainer, gives rise to a new lower-boiling ternary azeotrope (water/ethanol/benzene) that can be used to trap the water. You want to add just enough benzene to trap all the water without leaving any large amounts of benzene behind. Then you use one final distillation step to pull off this ternary azeotrope, leaving behind pure ethanol. You still end up with traces of benzene in this process, so I don't recommend drinking the final product. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can salt out the water with magnesium sulfate, aka Epsom salt. The crystals will convert into the hydrate form and will remain insoluble in the ethanol, turning from crystals to clumps in the bottom of the flask. Using a hydrometer, determine the mols of water remaining in the solution and add equal mols of magnesium sulfate crystals. Run it through a coffee filter and you've got absolute alcohol. Water from the air inside the storage container gets in that mixture so leave a small cake of salts in the jar and filter upon it's time of use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Independent distiller here. I don't know how to do flags, but I have a B.S. in micro/chem. No one's yet mentioned molecular seives which can be purchased from ebay. They have a higher affinity for water than alcohol and a terrifically large surface area. </p>
<p>As a man who makes ethanol for a living, I can certainly tell you from experience what drinking 100% ethanol is like. The thing that you have to remember is that the azeotrope forms because of molecular affinity between water and ethanol. When pure ethanol encounters water it very quickly attempts to return to the azeotrope phase.</p>
<p>As you are essentially a big sack of water, this makes drinking pure ethanol a very bad experience. Imagine the ethanol moving throughout your whole mouth without you motivating it. It touches your tongue and then cascades all the way around your mouth and back to your throat almost immediately and has a higher affinity for water than your teeth or pores do. It's very good at seeking out every nook and cranny of this soggy wet epithelium. When it gets to your nerves, it's just insanely high proof ETOH.</p>
<p>I can do a shot of 95.6%. I'm a manboy and am tempted by danger. It's unpleasant. I couldn't physically swallow 100%. It was all I could do to get it out of my mouth as fast as humanely possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quicklime (CaO) will react with water and not ethanol, you can find food grade lime and put it on a fire to make food grade quicklime. Mix it into high proof ethanol and filter it out (or distill) and you'll have pure ethanol. Just be careful, it gets hot when mixed with water, it can get hot enough to light the ethanol on fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The azeotrope's location changes as a function of pressure. I believe there's a way to get purer ethanol by distilling to 95% at atmospheric pressure and then distilling again at a different pressure where you're then &quot;past&quot; the azeotrope.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
