<p>For large skyscraper type buildings, the very top of it will be some kind of atrium with a large concrete ball hanging from the top. So as the building moves, the ball will move in the opposite direction, keeping the building in the same place. Wish I could provide more info but I'm drunk and about to smash some Denny's </p>

<p>There are multiple ways, and each building is different. </p>
<p>With an earthquake, what you want your building to do, is to absorb as little of the energy/waves as possible, and to expel any with as little damage as possible. </p>
<p>One way, for example, is not to have basements, less mass for the building to absorb energy. </p>
<p>Another is to loosen up the steel connections in the structure, so that the energy won't transfer as much thought out the building. Steel, btw, is ductile, meaning that, to an extent, it's flexible and will return to its original position and strength after bending (ie expel energy). There will also be things like expansion joints where energy can be released. </p>
<p>One weird example is when they might build a large concrete bathtub in the ground, and then build the building in that, so that the building has no real connection to the ground itself, limiting the energy absorption in the actual building. </p>
<p>In general, you'll never make a building stronger than an earthquake, but you can try to tune it, so the energy absorption is less (avoid resonance with an expected earthquake frequency) . And then tune it so that the energy is expelled in controlled and safe places </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how a house of cards has strength vertically, meaning you can stack multiple layers on top of each other but if you introduce any vibration or wind they collapse.  That happens because they don't have lateral resistance or &quot;shear value&quot;.
If you take a cardboard box that is still flat and has not been folded into box form, you can push the corners together and it will squeeze together easy right?  So now if you fold the box and flaps together and try to squeeze it there is resistance to it deforming.  If you take six cards and tape them to each other forming a cube, you get the same resistance to deformation.</p>
<p>This can be achieved with plywood &quot;cards&quot; nailed to the structure, metal frames, or metal X shaped structures within a square attaching at the corners.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earthquakes, along with wind, apply a horizontal load or shear force to the building.  Buildings are designed against shear force by different methods, most commonly with the use of shear walls and cross bracing, which keeps the building stiff.  Another design method that has been used is to build the building like a tube structure where the building is modeled as a cantilevered structure; in this type of building, the exterior walls act as the shear walls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thought you might want some info om how they make old buildings earthquake resistant. I spent some time in the SF Bay Area and learned a few things about it. It's basically making the building stronger and more flexible. They call it &quot;retrofitting&quot;. It varies by building but basically involves reinforcing the structure with things like beams and making it flexible. They way they do that with brick walls, for example, is coating the inside with fiberglass so the walls can move but remain intact. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
