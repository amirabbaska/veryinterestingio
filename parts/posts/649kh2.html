		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I'm wondering about this now too, and the explanation in the paper seems to be unhelpful since it just makes it sound like massive bodies are just somehow really good at math...</p>
<p>So maybe someone can verify: it sounds like what they're saying is that since the affecting gravitational field is <em>in motion</em> it creates a vector to its current position, i.e. part of the orbital path is determined by momentum, which, assuming the velocity of the sun is constant, causes the movement to follow the true position of the sun.</p>
<p>How far off am I?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question. As long as there is no change in acceleration between the Sun and Earth, the gravitation field &quot;anticipates&quot; where the Sun will be and the Earth is attracted to the Sun's instantaneous position. If there is any 3rd-order motion (changing acceleration) the motion will not be &quot;anticipated&quot; and the Earth will be attracted to the position the Sun would have been had there been no changing acceleration. This discrepancy creates a &quot;lag&quot; which is actually the source of gravitation waves. In this case a grav wave will travel between the Sun and the Earth at the speed of light to account for the discrepancy. <a href="http://www.mathpages.com/rr/s6-08/6-08.htm" target="_blank">Source</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>No math in this answer.</p>
<p>Both the earth and the sun are moving through space at the same speed. </p>
<p>Imagine if the sun suddenly stopped dead, relative to the rest of the universe. The earth would continue to move around where the sun was going to be. This is because the Earth not only has momentum around the sun it has momentum ALONG the path the sun was moving along.</p>
<p>The earths orbit is not a circular orbit but a series of loops moving in the same direction as the sun moves through the universe.</p>
<p>I hope that helps...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
