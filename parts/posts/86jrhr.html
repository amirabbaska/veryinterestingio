I have dug up fossils on six continents, with most of my work in Wyoming and Ethiopia.

I teach first year science students and it seems that the geologists are the ones who generally show the least interest in learning maths and stats.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Dr. Currano! I have a question about plants and climate change. I know that during times of global warming weâ€™ve had tropical plants much closer to the poles. Even with a warmer climate, how did these plants handle the extreme changes in the length of day throughout the year? Today related taxa live in regions that have close to a 12-hour light cycle. </p>
<p>Thank you! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
