		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marine Biologist here, to answer your question the most truthful answer is &quot;we dont know&quot;. Thats due to a lack of research, species specific responses and difficulty of accessing the deep sea. But that's not very fun or elaborate.</p>
<p><a href="https://montereybay.noaa.gov/research/techreports/trkochevar1998.html" target="_blank">An interesting report here</a> covers most of the bases. It seems in most species, bright light exposure temporarily removes the ability to respond to light stimuli. After some time to re-acclimate, the fish respond normally again. That would obviously vary with species, intensity and exposure time etc. </p>
<p>The only true permanent damage stems from UV exposure which wouldnt be emitted by ROV sub white lights. </p>

I know when I go deer hunting I can wear LED headlamps and it doesn't bother the deer in the wee hours of the morning whereas if I was wearing a Halogen lamp they would avoid me like the plague. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many deep sea creatures do not rely on sight as heavily as we do and can often not even have this sense, sharks can detect minute electric currents produced by their prey and many other creatures may also use out of the ordinary senses such as this, as you get deeper in the ocean visibility becomes minimal so sight wouldn't be the best option for them</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
