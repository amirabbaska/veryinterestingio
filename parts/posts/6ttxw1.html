		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems that many infamous people in recent history (i.e. past couple hundred years) are referred to by three names, like John Wilkes Booth, Lee Harvey Oswald, and now the suspect in Charlottesville. Is this done to protect those who would otherwise have the same name were we to not include the middle name as a point of differentiation? If so, when/where did this practice start and how formal of a practice is it in journalism, law enforcement, etc.?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Al Capone, gangster, is referred to by two names. Same goes for Jeffery Dahmer, Jim Jones, Charles Manson, Saddam Hussein, and Elizabeth Bathory. Hitler and Stalin just get one name. Sometimes people just go by three names, like Jamie Lee Curtis, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Neil Patrick Harris. As far as I know, none of them are considered infamous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just to be specific. The people you listed are all criminals, and they were ID'd in the news by all three names because their three names together are less common than two. </p>
<p>E.g. There were plenty of John Booth's when Lincoln was killed, but far fewer John Wilkes Booth's.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is one reason.  The last thing you want is for someone with a vigilante mindset to find someone in their locality with the same first and last name and then &quot;take matters into their own hand&quot;.  They want to avoid mistaken identity.</p>
<p>The other reason is that in the United States it is pretty uncommon for people to go by their full first, middle, and last names.  So if there is an alleged perpetrator named &quot;James Fields&quot; and he gets wide enough publicity as &quot;James Fields&quot;, every other James Fields ends up with a bit of a smudge on their reputation, even among people who know that they had nothing to do with the infamous actor.  In other words, they get &quot;Oh...your name is James Fields, like that guy from Charlottesville&quot;.  OTOH, if the media refers to them in an uncommon way that seems unnatural, like &quot;James Alex Fields Junior&quot;, then it creates a bit of a separation between the alleged perpetrator and everyone who shares the name.  Basically, it's an attempt to avoid &quot;ruining the name&quot; rather than an attempt to avoid &quot;mistaken identity&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cant say for sure, but i refer to myself with my middle name/initial all the time.  For 2 main reasons, on paper and emails, it looks more professional, people tend to take it a bit more seriously.  Also my first and last initial is K, so I add my middle initial to remove all doubt that my i tials are not KKK.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
