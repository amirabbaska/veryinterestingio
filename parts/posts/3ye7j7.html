<p>Ten years ago I actively told students to never look at Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Now, I think it's often a good starting place. Indeed, on some major topics, like say a US Civil War battle or a biography of a politician it is reasonably comprehensive.</p>
<p>So now I say, sure, start with WP, but then branch out by looking at many sources...including, yes, books!</p>
<p>By the way, a lot of people are claiming here that Wiki uses &quot;authorities&quot;.</p>
<p>Sort of.</p>
<p>They often defer to general wisdom on a topic, not the actual authorities. In the Chronicle of Higher Education there was an essay by a historian who complained that he had written several books on a particular topic and then tried to correct the Wikipedia entry and was continually uncorrected by the moderator who said that &quot;what you propose has not been made authoritative yet.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Unfortunately this doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>So I completely agree with your responses in the matter that Wikipedia is great for a overview of the topic but look elsewhere for better informative sources. Thanks for all the replies!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Longtime Wikipedia Editor here.  There's a few important reasons why you shouldn't use Wikipedia directly for information when it really matters:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Editor bias</strong>.  I'm an Editor, yes.  You can be an Editor, too.  <strong><em>Anybody</em></strong> can be an Editor.  All it takes to be one is to simply make the edits, which literally anybody can do.  At worst they have to make an account first, but most articles can be edited without even a login. So who gets to decide who does most of the editing on an article?  Honestly, nobody.  Whoever shows up and decides they want to do it, and does it without making too many other people mad, generally gets to edit that article. Now you usually won't get something like a person who believes the moon landing was faked handling the article on the first moon landing (too much outrage), but it's almost guaranteed that the group of Editors handling the article on George W. Bush all voted for him (if they could) during both elections.  Why?  Simply because they care about the topic more than most people who didn't vote for GWB.  To their credit, most aren't going to deny reality, but things are still going to have a bit of a light bias simply because that's how people are.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Rapidly changing articles</strong>.  Let's look at the George W. Bush article again.  Over the last 6 years there has been an ongoing &quot;edit war&quot; over the nickname &quot;Dubya&quot;.  On any given week the George W. Bush article may mention that &quot;Dubya&quot; was his nickname, may not mention it, may have it buried in the middle of an unrelated paragraph, may have it at the very top, may try to spin that entire discussion off into a separate article... you get the idea.  This is over something as simple as his nickname.  You can imagine how fast more important information might  change or be altered.  Now not every article changes that rapidly, but there's no telling what article is going to be stable and which one is going to be edited a lot.  Things as mundane as articles on classic TV shows can have <strong><em>incredibly</em></strong> intense fights going over what is written in them.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Vandalism</strong>. This is almost the same as the last point about how articles can change rapidly.  The difference with vandalism is done to screw up the article on purpose.  It could be something as simple as replacing an entire section with the words &quot;retards LOL buttz&quot;, but sometimes it's very very subtle, like removing a single word from a sentence to change the entire meaning (e.g. &quot;this was not determined to be true in the 2015 court decision&quot; becomes &quot;this was determined to be true in the 2015 court decision&quot;).  Most times other Editors will catch this and fix it, but there's so much vandalism on Wikipedia that you are bound to see it somewhere.</p>
<p>4) <strong>Bad summaries of sources</strong>. Now this one is a little harder to explain, but it's probably the biggest reason why you shouldn't rely on Wikipedia articles directly.  To be as simple about this as I can, sometimes what the Wikipedia article says a source meant is completely wrong.  The article might say, for example, that cancer patients who drank coffee during treatment were 5% more likely to go into remission; if you read the actual study though, it says that the margin of error in the study was 10%, <strong><em>so the 5% difference is meaningless</em></strong>.  </p>
<p>Now this isn't a problem for the majority of articles, and most times this happens it is done by accident - I mean, some of these studies and research papers are <strong><em>really</em></strong> dense and difficult to understand.  Sometimes though this is done on purpose, either to vandalize the article or to push a specific agenda.  <strong>In either case, this is the biggest reason why you should only use the sources you find in a Wikipedia article, rather than the article itself.</strong>  Even if it's unlikely, when it does happen it can completely screw up your information.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Here's a piece of the story:
MESSER-KRUSE: Well, I tried to change what I thought was the most glaring inaccuracy in the page on the Haymarket. The page described the actual Haymarket bombing. It described the eight-hour movement leading to it. It described the trial that came from that event.</p>
<p>And in that article, the description of the trial began, saying the prosecution did not offer evidence connecting any of the defendants with the bombing. Well, my research has all been about showing what exactly went on in the trial, and there was an overwhelming amount of evidence. Now maybe it's not evidence that we today would find worthy of convicting these men and sending them to the gallows, but there was undoubtedly multiple kinds of evidence.</p>
<p>There was 118 witnesses called to testify, many of them involved in the anarchist movement themselves. There was forensic, chemical evidence. There was even some embarrassed admissions on the part of some of the defendants. So I thought that description in particular needed to be changed.</p>
<p>And I tried to simply delete that reference, and when I did so, within minutes, that page was restored, and I was instructed by whoever this volunteer editor was about some of Wikipedia's ongoing policies that prevented my making these changes.</p>
<p>CONAN: And you tried it again, and basically what they said was they don't rely on primary sources like transcripts of the trial but rather on the preponderance of secondary sources.</p>
<p>MESSER-KRUSE: That's right. So I was told that I needed to come up with some published sources that supported my point of view. Simply referencing the coroner's records or the trial transcripts or other sources that I'd uncovered was not sufficient.</p>
<p>So I actually bided my time. I knew that my own published book would be coming out in 2011. So I tried again and was told that I needed to represent a majority viewpoint, not a minority viewpoint, namely my own, and that Wikipedia was about verifiability, not necessarily about truth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wikipedia is not an appropriate source to cite because it's not an authoritative source.  All the information on Wikipedia is (supposed to be) taken from other sources, which are provided to you.  If you cite Wikipedia, you're essentially saying &quot;108.192.112.18 said that a history text said Charlemagne conquered the Vandals in 1892&quot;.  Just cite the history text directly!  There's also a residual fear that anybody could type whatever they wanted and you'd just accept it as fact.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is perfectly fine for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting an overview of a subject</li>
<li>Finding real sources</li>
<li>Winning internet arguments</li>
