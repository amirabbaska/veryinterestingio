		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're in a crowded, noisy auditorium. You need to shout loudly just to talk to the person next to you. Even when the speaker goes up to the podium, they can't be heard above the noise of everyone speaking. However, once the speaker gets everyone's attention, everyone starts to quiet down until it's silent enough that everyone can hear the single speaker talking.</p>
<p>The same thing happens in our eyes. Our eyes are capable of looking at a extremely wide range of brightness from direct sunlit days down to moonlit nights. While we can quickly adjust from going from dark to light, our eyes have the downside that going from light to dark takes a long time. </p>
<p>When our eyes are adjusted to light, a percentage of the chemical sensitive to light (rhodopsin) is getting recycled. This recycling can stimulate the nerves that see light, providing the noise in the auditorium. If something is bright (loud) enough, you can notice it over the noise. However, when there is nothing bright enough (if you go from a bright environment to a dark one), you just notice the &quot;noise&quot; from the chemical recycling which can look like noise from high ISO photos. This appears to us in black and white because our most light sensitive photoreceptors in our eye can only sense brightness, not color.</p>
<p>After about 15 minutes, the light sensitive chemical recovers completely, resembling the time it takes to quiet down a noisy auditorium. Now, your eyes are the most sensitive to light. There still may be some noise since the blood flow through your eye can accidentally cause enough pressure so that the light sensitive cells think they see something. This also contributes to the noise you see in darkness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who see noise constantly through the vision.</p>
<p>A quick relief would be to watch a video featuring only static video noise. This will &quot;relieve&quot; you from the noise for some seconds. As I, and a friend of mine has said afterwards: &quot;It's like seeing full HD.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't advice you to look at it for over 10 seconds or so. Best suited on a big screen with fullscreen :)</p>
<p>Edit: For those that wonder what video I and my friend were watching:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're seeing could be Visual Snow. It's a poorly understood condition but research is ongoing. Recent research points to hypermetabolism in the right lingual gyrus as the cause; Basically the  right lingual gyrus (A part of the brain responsible for aspects of vision and perception) is working too hard.</p>
<p>I recommend having a look at the wiki article, it has a great example image that is very accurate, at least personally.</p>
