		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here are some rough numbers to give you a feeling for the energy scales that are involved in nuclear reactions:</p>
<p><strong>1. The decay of one atom of uranium-235 releases about 200MeV or about 3*10^(-11)J.</strong></p>
<p>For one atom, this is a huge amount of energy, about a million times more than the energy of a photon of visible light. Nevertheless, while this more than enough energy to rip apart chemical bonds in your body, it's far from enough to create much of a bang on a macroscopic scale. To see why, let's compare this energy to something we know for sure can rattle things around, such as a nicely sized ball of TNT:</p>
<p><strong>2. The explosion of 1kg of TNT releases 4MJ (4*10^(6)J).</strong> </p>
<p>In other words, you would need to split ~1*10^17 atoms of U-235 to get as much energy as you could get from blowing up 1kg of TNT. However the comparison becomes much more favorable for uranium when you make the switch form atoms to mass. When you consider that each atom of U-235 only has an atomic mass of ca. 235amu, you see that: </p>
<p><strong>3. The fission of ~5*10^(-8)kg of U-235 releases as much energy as the explosion of 1kg of TNT</strong>.</p>
<p>This mass, which can be expressed in more convenient units at 50 micrograms, is actually smaller than the mass of one human eyelash! Nuclear energy certainly packs quite a punch...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energy released in the fission (splitting) of ONE atom of U-235 is enough to make a single grain of sand visibly move. </p>
<p>And then nothing else would happen if it was just that one atom. No danger. </p>
<p>Uranium atoms fission all the time naturally. If you held a sub critical mass of it in your hand it would feel warm. That's from all the natural fission happening. You'd have health issues afterwards but that's due to the radiation from way more than the ONE atom you asked about.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>And the understatement of the year award goes to...</p>
<p>To put some actual science (or at least math) in this top-level comment: Let's suppose instead of a log we have a sample of pure carbon weighing twelve grams. The number of atoms is, naturally, Avogadro's number: 6.02×10^23. Or approximately 6.02×10^14 billion. An actual log is not only much bigger, but also contains smaller atoms such as hydrogen.</p>
<p>tl;dr: The difference in scale between an atom and a macroscopic object cannot be measured in mere billions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Splitting atoms is just an expression - you can't split one atom or a few of them. </p>
<p>Here is an extremely simplified explanation of an atomic explosion, full of technical inaccuracy but giving the general idea:</p>
<p>Atoms consist of protons, electrons, and neutrons. Some uranium atoms have extra neutrons which they slowly lose, mostly flying off into space. On the way, some neutrons hit other uranium atoms and knock off other neutrons, which do the same thing. Most of the neutrons fly off into space before they hit very many others, so nothing happens. But if you put 4 or 5 pounds of uranium together in a chunk, about a 2-inch ball, a neutron will knock off enough other neutrons that the process quickly ramps up. The ball gets hot, melts, and vaporizes. </p>
<p>Melting and vaporizing moves the atoms farther apart. This means fewer of them get hit by neutrons, and the process immediately slows back down. But if you hold the uranium together in one piece long enough, the storm of neutrons rages out of control and becomes &quot;critical&quot;. At this point the hot uranium is trying so hard to expand, it can't be contained - this is an atomic blast. </p>
<p>The trick is to hold the uranium together long enough for it to go critical. Even though it only takes a fraction of a second, the expansion is so strong that it's very difficult to keep together. In an atom bomb the uranium is wrapped in a layer of normal explosives. Setting them off compresses the uranium together and holds it together long enough to go critical and create an atomic explosion. </p>
<p>So the answer to your question is that you can't split just a few atoms, or a few billion. Going critical takes a minimum of a couple pounds of uranium (or plutonium). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>radioactivity is atoms 'splitting' at a normal rate. There are things around you are are constantly radioactive, such as the carbon 14 that you are breathing in and out <em>RIGHT NOW</em>.</p>
<p>SO what's dangerous? A harmful dose of radiation? a lethal dose of radiation? A release of energy big enough to create a shockwave/fireball? Let's go with that..</p>
<p>OK, to follow your question, you want to create a shockwave that would be lethal to any human within one meter of the origin.While I don't have the exact knowledge and math you need, I can provide you with the series of questions you need.</p>
<p>1) how much energy do you need to create a 1-meter lethal shockwave/explosion?</p>
<p>2) how much energy is released per split atom of a given element (let's pick something well known, uranium 238).</p>
<p>3) Then how many atoms of uranium 238 does it take splitting simultaneously to create that shockwave?</p>
<p>4) what's the minimum amount of U238 that you'd need to make that release of energy probable, even given ideal conditions to induce it? (this one may be a null question, it might not be possible to trigger a nuclear explosion that small)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
