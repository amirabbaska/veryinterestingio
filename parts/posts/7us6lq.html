		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quadcopters are inefficient but you only have to adjust power to 4 very small and fast reacting motors to maneuver. No fancy control linkages needed or control surfaces outside of your 4 motors and propellers. </p>
<p>With a regular copter, they use a very complex set of linkages to tilt each blade as it goes around its rotation and back again for maneuvering, as well as increase/decrease the overall tilt of all blades to gain/lose altitude. Another tail rotar is required (or dual main rotars spinning in opposite directions)  to compensate for blade torque. </p>
<p>Regular copters often use turbine engines that take incredibly long (on the order of 10+ seconds) to adjust RPM from max operating RPM to min operating RPM, so adjusting RPM of the motors to control lift is just not an option. These however are very efficient sources of energy (Gasoline stores so much more energy per pound then a battery) and turbines are especially efficient if run only at a fixed RPM. </p>
<p>a tiny motor like on a quadcopter is often electric and can throttled to full RPM/0RPM and even reverse within a second. They can even recover energy back into the battery by slowing down the motor, slowing the motor down much faster then if the motor was just no longer powered.</p>
<p>You could almost think of a helicopter as having multiple independent blades instead of a rotar, and the main difference being between a quadcopter and helicopter being that a quadcopter controls by altering the RPM of its blades while a helicopter alters the pitch of its blades. </p>
<p>PS: One of the main reasons quadcopters are inefficient is because larger blades are more efficient and a quadcopter uses smaller blades. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quadcopters are really easy to fly and are really easy to program a computer to fly.  Left, right, front, back, up down, it is a simple matter of altering prop speed.  A traditional helicopter has to worry about momentum and turning radius and all kinds of other things.</p>
<p>The tradeoff is that a quadcopter is much less efficient.  They take more energy to do less, and pound for pound, they are slower and have less range and lifting power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary advantage of a quadcopter is simplicity. Control of the craft is achieved entirely by varying the speed of motors, and the only moving parts are the rotors themselves.</p>
<p>By contact,  and helicopter needs to be able to vary the pitch of the blades individually in order to control the pitch of the blades individually in order to control the pitch and roll of the aircraft, and this is done through a system of linkages. That makes for a substantially more complex design, both to maintain and to fly. </p>
<p>But a single rotor is more efficient than four smaller ones for the same lift capacity. This is less important for a drone that can just land when it runs out of battery than a full size aircraft where range is important.</p>
<p>Also, a quadcopter with its fixed pitch blades cannot autorotate - if the power fails, it will crash. This gives helicopters a safety advantage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I hope this is allowed as a top level comment. You should check out some RC helicopters and see how hard they are to fly, but can do so much more than a drone. Helicopters are powerful and much more versatile. Drones (multi-copter) are more stable and easier to control</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
