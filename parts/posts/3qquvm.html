		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is &quot;taxes&quot;. </p>
<p>In France, like the rest of Europe, they used a concept called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_horsepower" target="_blank">tax horsepower</a>&quot;, which is completely foreign to the United States. After World War 2, the French government decided they would encourage French automotive manufacturers to abandon luxury production and instead embrace smaller, cheaper cars, so they started taxing horsepower - the more powerful the engine, the higher the tax. This led French car makers to use much smaller engines than everyone else (save for possibly the Japanese), especially in the larger luxury cars that they were still known for (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citro%C3%ABn_DS" target="_blank">Citroën DS</a>, which was equipped with a 4-cylinder engine at a time when American luxury was embracing the V8), which led Americans to view French cars as almost dangerously underpowered.</p>
<p>Additionally, French reliability just wasn't there. Citroëns were known for having absolutely fantastic suspensions... when they worked, which wasn't often since their hydraulic suspension system was absolutely byzantine to your average American mechanic that was used to leaf springs. Peugeots were known for their stylish looks and decent diesels (a side-effect of how France calculated their &quot;tax horsepower&quot;), but were also known for being a bit more expensive than everyone else and for having some dodgy electrical systems. As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, Renault partnered up with AMC in the '80s and proved conclusively that, yes, <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/features/dishonorable-mention-the-10-most-embarrassing-award-winners-in-automotive-history" target="_blank">Americans can make boring underpowered French cars to French reliability standards too</a>. </p>
<p>What finally killed the French once and for all, though, was that they were just too expensive for what they were. The foreign exchange rate between the dollar and the franc wasn't favorable, especially after Nixon closed the gold window in the '70s, and it didn't get better as the '80s and early '90s wore on. By the time Peugeot pulled out in 1991, the Peugeot 405 (think of a French &quot;Toyota Camry&quot;, only 1.9L 110hp engine) cost over $20,000 (over $35,000 in today's dollars). For half that, you could find yourself in a period Camry with a 130hp engine and Toyota reliability; or, you could spend your $20,000+ on a nice Mercedes-Benz 300-series or BMW with far more power and luxury. </p>
<p>So, to recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>French cars were too expensive.</li>
<li>French cars were too unreliable.</li>
<li>French cars were underpowered.</li>
</ul></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>French cars used to be sold here. Mainly Renault and Peugeot. They didn't do well here. Too much competition, too little name recognition.  </p>
<p>Renault pulled out in the late 80s when their American partner, AMC, was bought out by Chrysler, who really only wanted the Jeep brand. Peugeot followed in 1991. Their auto sales had dropped from 14,000 to just 4,000 cars in 4 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're completely different markets. We tend to drive tiny cars that wouldn't sell in America, you tend to drive huge cars that wouldn't sell over here.</p>
<p>French manufacturers specialise in small city cars designed for the European market, so it isn't worth it for them to establish dealer networks in the US - they just wouldn't sell enough cars to recoup their costs. German manufacturers like BMW and Mercedes have more midsize cars in their range and sell at higher prices, so the economics are better.</p>
<p>Conversely, Buick and GMC vehicles aren't exported to Europe by GM. Ford don't sell the Explorer, the Expedition, the F150 or the Super Duty here. Beyond a few enthusiasts, there's just no market for large SUVs or trucks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a production worker in the US automotive industry (one of the &quot;Big 3&quot;), I can give many witty and humorous reasons, but the main one is this:</p>
<p>French companies have no domestic US production facilities. </p>
<p>The US market is saturated with Japanese and German cars because their companies have developed a very long and expensive network of stateside production. Instead of shipping cargo ships full of cars to the US, companies have built the cars in the US, creating jobs and lessening the stigma/xenophobia that went along with say, buying a Volkwagen Beetle in the early 1960s, or a Honda in the 1970s. </p>
<p>This tore down a lot of the &quot;they're taken our jerbs&quot; rhetoric of the unions by paying similar wages and benefits as traditional UAW auto workers in the US. </p>
<p>Japanese companies with US assembly factories: 12
German companies with US assembly factories: 5
Korean companies with US assembly factories: 1
French companies with US assembly factories: 0</p>
<p>Gotta get back to work. Peace. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They used to be, but they never sold well. For Renault, they made a disastrous alliance with AMC (American Motors Corporation, remember the Rambler?), a failing US brand. Double bad when they sold the Jeep brand to Chrysler for money. It sucked the cash out of the French car maker and left them unable to change with the times. (I don't think a Renault ever had A/C for instance.)</p>
<p>I remember Peugeot cars, but the disappeared about the same time, 1980s(?). The dollar was weak, and Peugeots were expensive for what you got.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
