		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take a second to think about blinking. Now that you’re thinking about it, you probably stopped blinking to see what would happen. In this time, you may have missed several blinks that would’ve happened naturally and not really even been noticed. Now, you’re brain is going to go “oh crap, I didn’t blink! Let me make up for it right now!” and you’ll blink several times to “get caught up” from the blinks you “missed.” Now that your brain has reset itself on blinking, you’ll think “have o blinked enough? Maybe I should throw in a couple more JUST IN CASE,” this the increased urge to do it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You normally don't do it more. You just realize that you are blinking more than you normally notice. If you were to notice your breathing, it does not increase the rate of which you breathe, unless you try to breathe faster. I'm not expert but I think the same applies for blinking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

On the extreme end, those with OCD-like behavior and/or anxiety could do this more frequently and for longer periods. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normally you're not consciously aware of your processes like blinking or breathing. However, you can take active control by thinking about it. When you do, you break the pattern that your breathing/blinking was in. This along with the fact that you're actually noticing it means it feels irregular and maybe faster. That doesn't mean you're actually blinking more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
