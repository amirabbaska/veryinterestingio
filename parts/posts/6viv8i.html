		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unrelated, but it's actually possible that ancient relatives of crocodiles had external ears. The bit where you'd put modern crocs' earlid muscles was greatly developed in land-based cousins called notosuchians, and even further in a subgroup called the baurusuchids. This implies they had <em>something</em> over their ears that needed to be wiggled, and they weren't exactly keeping water out of their ears regularly.</p>
<p>So yeah. Possible land crocs with ears, big enough to hunt dinosaurs. Mesozoic be whack yo.</p>
<p>EDIT: Unfortunately their ears were not in fact superpredators. This is why I need to grammar.</p>

Unfortunately I can't find a better source so Buzzfeed it shall be. Two paleontologists took skeletons of modern animals and sketched them the way we've been historically sketching dinosaurs. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The remains from cartilaginous protrusions would be visible in sedimentary deposits. For example, look at <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pompeya._Cadaver_de_beb%C3%A9.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> cast made from the body of someone who died in Pompeii during the Vesuvius explosion. His cartilaginous nose is visible. Dinosaurs would have left similar impressions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is, we can't know for sure 100%, from dinosaur to dinosaur. But there are some things we do know. Impressions left by dinosaurs haven't shown us anything weird yet. Birds tend not to  have cartilaginous ears and noses, so it's unlikely their ancestors did. And also, cartilage leaves very minute traces of their existence in the form of bone shape, and stress points.</p>
<p>For an example, look at the skull of an elephant. We can guess just by examining it really closely how much weight the muscles surrounding the skull were supporting, and where a protrusion was likely based on tiny grooves left on the bone near the nose left by muscle. Logically, if such grooves were present in dinosaur bone, we could conclude similar protrusions. Nothing we've found so far seems to suggest cartilaginous protrusions, but that could change with just the right specimen.</p>
