		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every year the world health organization researches which variation of the flu is going to be most common.  After they come to a decision, the flu shot is made specifically for that virus. The flu shot contains a dead part of the virus that your body can identify and recognize when you actually come in contact with the virus later on.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, only for certain strains. </p>
<p>But last year, on one of my trips to the ER for my death flu, and resulting pneumonia, and 103 degree fever for 10 days, I got to see all the nurses and doctors treating me and saying &quot;we got the flu shot, it's for this flu, and we've been treating dozens of people for it this last month, and none of got sick. Why didn't you get the flu shot? It's free, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>Decided I'll get the flu shot for now on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the flu shot is only good for certain strains based on the past year research.  They are often better than 50% but sometimes are lower. I believe two years ago it was only a 36% efficacy.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but those strains are somewhat yearly. The flu shot immunizes you against the strains that they're seeing that year. Next year they'll be different; that's why you have to get one every year. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
