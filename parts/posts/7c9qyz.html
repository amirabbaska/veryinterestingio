		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The scientific name for 'bounciness' is the coefficient of restitution. </p>
<p>It's influenced by two main things; how much an object deforms when it hits something, and how much energy it loses in that process. </p>
<p>Something very hard like a rock, loses lots of energy when it deforms but is very hard so overall can seem 'bouncy'. </p>
<p>A superball deforms a lot (relatively) when it hits something but doesn't lose much energy, so is also very 'bouncy'.</p>
<p>What influences how much energy something loses during impact is a much more complicated question.</p>
<p>Source: have a PhD in how materials and construction influence impact behaviour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's an extremely broad question that brings up many answers, but usually geometry, and materials.   </p>
<p>Round shapes filled with air, like balls tend to be bouncy because when they hit the ground, the air compresses to a higher pressure, and then when it returns to it's original pressure it bounces back.</p>
<p>If you are talking about rubber versus hard plastic, usually you are talking about rubber being made of long chains of organic molecules, that can be thought of like a bunch of strings tangled together in a ball.  If you pull at opposite ends of the ball, strings will slide past each other and stretch out to an elongated shape versus the coiled up shapes they started in.  Chemical bonds and van der waal's forces can pull them back to their original shape.</p>
<p>Hard Plastic tends to have their long chains of organic molecules so tightly crosslinked to other molecules that they can't slide past.  Think of them as being more heavily knotted tangled jumbles of string.</p>
<p>Hope that helps some, although I'm not sure it is a clear definition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a scientific answer for you, but in my layman's brain its because certain materials have a physical makeup that makes them more elastic than others. Allowing them to transfer energy thru them and then retain most of it and return it back. A &quot;bounce back&quot; effect if you will. I'm sure someone will school me otherwise or in more detail.</p>
<p>Edit: to add to that, it also requires a certain amount of mass and rigidity  to be able to retain the energy and return it back. ie, a rubber band wont bounce that much on its own, but a ball of them will </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
