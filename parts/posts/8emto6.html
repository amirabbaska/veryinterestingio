		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch" target="_blank">According to Wikipedia</a>, the plastic density of the patch is about 5kg/km^2 and it covers the region between 135°W to 155°W and 35°N to 42°N.  That region is about 1.3 M km^2 since a degree of lattitude is about 111 km and a degree of longitude, at 40°N, is about 85 km. So the total plastic mass is about 7 million kg or 7 thousand tons.  The <a href="http://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/Bulk%20Density%20Summary%20Report%20-%20Jan2010.pdf" target="_blank">typical density of compactified recycled plastic</a> ranges from 20 to 200 kg/m^3, depending on the method of compactification, so if all the plastic was compacted together it would work out to a sphere between 40 and 80 meter in diameter, i.e., a bit smaller than a football field.   </p>
<p>It would definitely not be visible on Google Earth if you were zoomed out enough to see the ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I did a breakdown below to help people with the scale and context: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/86bthl/great_pacific_garbage_patch_is_16_times_bigger/dw4kdwg/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/86bthl/great_pacific_garbage_patch_is_16_times_bigger/dw4kdwg/</a></p>
<p>In short, <strong>if you cleaned up every spec of plastic in the entire 1.6 million square kilometers, and dumped it all into a Walmart, it would fill the Walmart 1 foot deep</strong>.</p>
<p>That's it? Yep, that's it.</p>
<p>Still awful, and half of it is made from fishing nets, but, context is important to avoid sensationalizing things.</p>
<p>Some interesting tidbits because I hear about this all the time but never get a chance to grasp the scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>92% of the plastic mass is large chunks</strong>, baseball or bigger, but it will all eventually break down into tiny pieces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1.8 trillion pieces of plastic currently. That's 250 pieces per person on the planet they say. That's sensationalist rhetoric. Most of the pieces are miniscule. <strong>They know the reader will think about every person throwing 250 water bottles or toothbrushes into the ocean every year as a &quot;piece&quot;, but, in reality a single water bottle might break down into 4000 micro pieces that they're counting</strong>. While 92% of the mass is huge, 94% of the piece-count is rice-sized. This number is completely meaningless because if you took each piece and broke it in half and in half again, you'd have 7.2 Trillion pieces. Is that any worse? It's the same mass. The number of pieces is interesting maybe, but doesn't mean anything other than perhaps the degree to which the plastic is broken down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>46% of the mass of the plastic is fishing nets</strong>. I'd never heard that before. HALF the mass is just fishing nets. That's where it's coming from. Nets are shitty for entanglement reasons too, obviously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's &quot;only&quot; 80,000 tons of it in total. That sounds like a big number, but let me frame that in context. <strong>That's only half of what an average landfill ads in a year</strong>. An average landfill in the USA ads 150,000 tons a year, and they're usually around for 50+ years. The page says it's 500 jumbo jets. Well 500 jumbo jets is actually shockingly small, that's one jet, then a 2 hour drive to find the next closest one. <strong>Or, think of a giant redwood tree, it's only 40 of those for the entire mass of the patch</strong>. Think of seeing a giant tree, then driving 8 hours to the next nearest. To me, it's a shockingly small amount of garbage. This relatively small amount of garbage is dusted over an area half the size of the entire USA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broken down (by me), while there's 250 pieces per person on earth, by mass, <strong>there's 10 grams of plastic in the ocean per person on earth. Your share of that is about 2 plastic bottlecaps worth</strong>. That actually seems like a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>Volume-wise, <strong>the size of all the plastic in the entire Great Pacific Garbage Patch, is about 3% the size of a single Walmart</strong>. Think about one cube of plastic, 129 feet (43m) square. That's it. That's the entire patch. <strong>If you &quot;cleaned up&quot; every scrap of plastic in the entire 1.6 million square km of the patch and threw it on the floor of a Walmart to house it, it would only reach half way to your knee</strong>. It's really just, not that much plastic.</li>
</ul>
<p>...</p>
<p>My concern is, <strong>can it ever completely break down, or, what's the end-game of it?</strong> I've heard that it will become microscopic in size, continue to poison or bioaccumulate in fish. But then what? Will sunlight/abrasion ever completely break it down like ocean water does to everything else, atomizing it?</p>
<p>Scooping it up while it's large definitely makes sense, as does not putting the stuff there in the first place, but, if half of it is fishing nets, presumably they just tear off on their own.</p>
<p>Overall I think this story is generally overblown because the dramatic name &quot;Giant Pacific Garbage Patch&quot; leads you to think of a country-sized landfill floating in the ocean. Still something worth addressing though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually in the middle of finalizing a research paper for grad school on potential remedies to the GPGP.  </p>
<p>So, the answer to your initial question regarding the size of the GPGP would be that no one has any idea! We can only produce an estimate but in all reality, there is just no way of truly finding out because most of that plastic does sink to the bottom of the ocean, which means it's difficult to quantify. </p>
<p>To understand the GPGP, a brief understanding of oceanic gyres is necessary, so in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Imagine a massive yet very calm whirlpool in the middle of the ocean. Here, the whirlpool is the gyre. If someone were to toss a piece of plastic from CA out into the ocean, that piece of plastic would eventually drift into that whirlpool (gyres) because of currents flowing along the west coast of North America and east coast of Asia. The circular motion of the gyre would eventually draw in that piece of plastic, which would then become trapped. Quantify that into millions and you have the GPGP. </p>
</li>
<li>The GPGP is one of five oceanic gyres in the world. It's located between California and Japan and is the most famous because it's the largest. It's three times the size of France and twice the size of Texas. That is an estimate of the the surface, which is a lot more feasible to produce guesses on. </li>
</ul>
<p>The GPGP is not really a garbage patch the way we tend to think of garbage in landfills, but rather it's an area that is full of microplastics. The GPGP is very illusive because it changes shapes and it's invisible to the naked eye. Over 90% of the plastic is smaller than a fingernail. Best analogy to describe it: You add pepper flakes to a soup and then swirl it around and around. The pepper flakes are essentially the plastic. So to answer your second question, the GPGP is not visible on Google Earth because the majority of it is comprised of microplastics. </p>
<p>Other facts about the GPGP: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>80% of the debris is believed to originate from land-based activities in North America and Asia while the other 20% comes from boats, off-shore oil rigs, and large cargo ships. Of that 20%, majority are fishing lines (if you get a chance, this is another interesting topic- ghostfishing). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plastic is not sustainable. It is not biodegradable, but it is photodegradable. What this means is that they can break down but it's always there. Combine plastic, ocean water, sunlight, currents, weather changes, etc and what's left are the large chunks of plastic breaking down into tiny microscopic plastic polymers. These types of plastics are estimated to make up 94% of an estimated 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic in the patch. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is BIG problem. These microplastics act as a sponge, which means that when they break down, they release toxins which are then absorbed again by other plastics. It's essentially a pool of hazardous toxins, that include DDT, PCB, and other nonylphenols. Not only are marine species being harmed, but if you like fish, there is a good chance that they have eaten some of this plastic toxins. *These microplastics are mistaken for plankton and algae, which are the base of the marine food chain. Studies have also shown that the toxins also lead to low sperm count (low testosterone). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remedies? The Ocean Clean Up has great information, so does Ocean Society and Plastic Pollution Solutions. A simple search will give you tons of results. There's also a book out there. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Straws are horrible too btw! #Sheddthestraw campaign can provide tons of information too. </p>
</li>
<li>I'm actually working on the paper now, I just saw your post and had to post a comment because...it's the GPGP! </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the references in case you want to look more into it: </p>

<p>The EPA and NOOA have great information on there too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>5Kgs/Km2 is probably far less than in most urban areas.
1,000,000 sq meters.
5000 grams of plastic and a bottle weights 10g (really more, but I like round numbers), so 500 bottles.
So a bottle per 2000sq meters.
Or a bottle every 100 meters or so, so like a bottle every 2 football pitches side by side, or something like that.  If totally space out evenly.
So pretty much any picture that has more than one bottle in it is overstating the density.  You can show a lot of stuff in one pic, but then you can't say that it the size of Rhode Island or whatever.
Or have 500 bottles together, but you need a sq km of water in the background.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to Wikipedia, the plastic density of the patch is about 5kg/km2 and it covers the region between 135°W to 155°W and 35°N to 42°N. That region is about 1.3 M km2 since a degree of lattitude is about 111 km and a degree of longitude, at 40°N, is about 85 km. So the total plastic mass is about 7 million kg or 7 thousand tons</p>
<p>If you assume that to be visible on Google Maps, the density would have to be closer to 1Kg of trash for every square meter, that gives us a density of 1000Kg/KM^2  </p>
<p>Which is 200x the density of the current trash patch</p>
<p>So if the current area is 1.3M KM^2, that means the new area to make this a visible-from-space patch would be about 6500 KM^2</p>
<p>That's approximately the size of Tokyo, Japan</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
