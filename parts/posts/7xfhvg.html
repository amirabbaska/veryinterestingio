		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why whenever I watch movies, especially high definition on a surround sound (or even without a sound system just the TV’s natural audio) is the mix so polarizing? I find myself cranking the volume up as loud as it can go during dialogue portions, and then action scenes I have the volume as low as it can go because it’s so piercingly audible. I’ve tried messing with settings and it sort of helps, but I’ve noticed this ever since DVDs came out and we transitioned into higher quality picture and audio. </p>
<p>I have great hearing so I know that’s not it (but I’m expecting to get this response in the comments). </p>
<p>Thanks, reddit!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having a high dynamic range (the difference in volume at reference amplification between the lowest whisper sound and the loudest explosion in the soundtrack) is often a sought after factor. In proper professional movie theatres where you won't bother a neighbour this is a good thing. For most consumers it's pretty annoying. If you're able to, when I set up my surround sound I program the center channel at least 3db louder than any other speaker to compensate for the quiet voice thing. Many receiver/amps have also a night mode that compresses Dynamic range as well although I haven't been a fan when I've tried it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You need at least a 5.1 surround system and equalize the center channel with the others.  Dialogue is usually in the center channel, so it's volume should be increased relative to the other channels</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I experience it just out of TV speakers. Literally can't watch a damn thing without having it super loud. I used to have a htpc plugged into my TV and windows has an audio setting called Loud Equilization which completely fixed it, but can't replicate it on other devices. I now just have an Android box connected to the TV and been trying to find and equivalent setting. Unless I wear headphones, as soon as music or an action scene plays in the show, wife comes out 'can you turn that down a bit please', at which point I just switch the TV off because it's fucking pointless. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what others are saying, and it hasn't been specifically mentioned so far, is that filmmakers set out <em>deliberately</em> to create the huge gap between dialogue and explosions. In sound editing there are a few standards (like LUFS) that define peak waveforms in dB. It's standard practice in the industry, intended to be viewed in theatres.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
