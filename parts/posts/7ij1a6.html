		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, boiling the water in the egg forms steam, which builds to high pressure and explodes the egg.  But that raises the question (posed by /u/pavel_lishin ), why <em>doesn't</em> this happen when cooking eggs on the stovetop?</p>
<p>It's not about even vs uneven heating, it's about boiling point.  The water inside the egg has lots of dissolved molecules in it, so its boiling point is higher than plain water.  The water bath can't rise above its boiling point until it all boils away, so the egg can't get hot enough to boil so long as it's underwater.</p>
<p>In a microwave, however, there's no water bath, so the temperatures in the egg can rise much higher.</p>
<p>One consequence of this is that you totally can hard-boil eggs in the microwave, so long as you <a href="http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/cooking/tips/a32091/how-to-microwave-eggs/" target="_blank">put them in a bowl of water</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shell is hard. When the contents are heated unevenly (more toward the centre) expansion occurs. The shell can't expand  so... boom! Boiling an egg heats it more evenly, but even then the shell will still crack quite often.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
