<p>We are Dr. Mads Daugaard, Dr. Nader Al Nakouzi, Chris Wang, and Gunjan Kumar from the Vancouver Prostate Centre. We are part of the group that recently published a study detailing the use of a malaria protein, VAR2CSA, as a new and novel way of targeting cancers.</p>
<p>Cancer and the placenta show many similar characteristics. However, scientists have spent decades trying to find biochemical similarities between placenta tissue and cancer. Together with our colleagues from University of Copenhagen we discovered how malaria uses VAR2CSA to embed itself in the placenta and how the same target is present on cancer cells. Based on that discovery we immediately saw its potential to deliver cancer drugs in a precise, controlled way to tumors.</p>
<p>New and novel ways of targeting cancers are needed in order to combat the disease. With a recombinant version of VAR2CSA, we hope to develop a promising therapy for a broad spectrum of different cancers.</p>
<p>We will be answering your questions at 1pm EST (10am PST). Ask Us Anything!</p>
<p>Edit: Hello Reddit! Thank you all for the wonderful questions, we are here to answer what ever question you have for us for the next hour. Ask away!</p>
<p>Edit 2: Hi All! Thank you all so much for all the questions again, we had a blast answering everything we can. However, we must be go back to work now! We will come back through out the day and answer more questions when we have time. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST :D</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello!</p>
<p>I'm a newly started Danish student from Aalborg on 1. semester in Medicine with Industrial Specialization. I wish you the best of luck with your project! I have a few questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What do you think the odds are, that this will end up as a major breakthrough? I'm curious about the odds of it working for humans, as I've heard it worked on mice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's been tons of stuff like &quot;Cure for cancer found!&quot; in the news over the years which (obviously) haven't been true, and this has made most average people lower their expectations for anything alike. Specifically, it was easy to see all the hate and disappointment in the comment sections of the articles of your discovery, where most people believed it was a lie. Do you think anything needs to be done about this, and if yes, what? Additionally; Does the public's opinion on this even matter?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm fascinated by the work, but I'm curious what field it's in, as I have just started on my bachelor. For my candidate, I can choose between translational medicine and biomedicine, and I'm wondering which one of these best describes your work.</p>
</li>
<li>What does this discovery feel like for yourselves, personally? Pride, increased curiosity, happy, et cetera?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, first of all - I'm in awe of your work, and hearing that the placenta and cancer share similarities is one of the most curious things I've heard in a while.
Forgive the naivety in my question, but how would a treatment go about targetting the protein to the tumour? Wouldn't the immune system of the human body resist it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
