		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit! </p>
<p>We are Dr. Mads Daugaard, Dr. Nader Al Nakouzi, Chris Wang, and Gunjan Kumar from the Vancouver Prostate Centre. We are part of the group that recently published a study detailing the use of a malaria protein, VAR2CSA, as a new and novel way of targeting cancers.</p>
<p>Cancer and the placenta show many similar characteristics. However, scientists have spent decades trying to find biochemical similarities between placenta tissue and cancer. Together with our colleagues from University of Copenhagen we discovered how malaria uses VAR2CSA to embed itself in the placenta and how the same target is present on cancer cells. Based on that discovery we immediately saw its potential to deliver cancer drugs in a precise, controlled way to tumors.</p>
<p>New and novel ways of targeting cancers are needed in order to combat the disease. With a recombinant version of VAR2CSA, we hope to develop a promising therapy for a broad spectrum of different cancers.</p>
<p>We will be answering your questions at 1pm EST (10am PST). Ask Us Anything!</p>
<p>Edit: Hello Reddit! Thank you all for the wonderful questions, we are here to answer what ever question you have for us for the next hour. Ask away!</p>
<p>Edit 2: Hi All! Thank you all so much for all the questions again, we had a blast answering everything we can. However, we must be go back to work now! We will come back through out the day and answer more questions when we have time. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST :D</p></div></div>
