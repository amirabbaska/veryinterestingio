		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, by definition a steroid is just a specific chemical structure. Most of them just exist naturally: hormones like testosterone or oestrogen, vitamin D, cholesterol, ... Performance enhancing steroids are called anabolic steroids, and are mostly some variations on the male testosterone. When it comes to muscle development, they mostly stimulate protein synthesis and muscle recovery. </p>
<p>What makes them dangerous is that testosterone is a sex hormone, impacting a lot more male &quot;features&quot; than just muscle development. It impacts your sex drive, facial hair, baldness, mood (roid rages), fertility, growth (cancers), ... Artificially injecting it also disrupts your natural production, making problems even worse. </p>
<p>Besides wannabe bodybuilders, they are also used under prescription when teenagers don't enter puberty for example, so not all use is terrible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also needs to be said, most wouldn't consider them very dangerous. Yes they do have side effects, balding (only with certain steroids) , bitch tits, mood swings, cold sweats,low natural testosterone production. But a vast majority of side effects can be stopped or avoided all together if you use it properly and also take antiestrogens, HCG, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Im going to tell you the tale like you were my small child...</p>
<p>It's not a scary universe, the FDA and the DEA petioned against the reclassification of them back when congress got their panties inna bunch over sports and doping... </p>
<p>Used alongside proper monitoring they are just as safe as the pill is for females (works for most, other women have awful reactions)... Only thing is the pill stops 1 to 2 eggs a month. While male hormonal contraception (testosterone/progesterone derivative) has to stop MILLIONS of sperm per DAY. So yea its just ineffective in comparison. Especially because plenty of people have babies on lotsss of steroids. </p>
<p>You see son, in the universe of steroids there are many characters. From the foxy Estrogens (E1, and her banggin sister E2), The manly Testosterone (A man amongst people), or his Cousin DHT (whos balding but hunggg). You see son the world is large and filled with other plebs. From progesterone, to glucocorticoids and all between. </p>
<p>If you want to read about the ones that create God's like Arnold skip to the second part... </p>
<p>Like in Genesis imagine progesterone (and its 3 sister/brothers). Synthesized and fashioned from cholesterol (the remains of our enemies), the first of the steroids is born.
From here Enzymes creak it into its truer form. The plebs of the glucocorticoid tribe are some of the first and they work on the breakdown of old cells (catabolism) and many other good but in moderate to low levels and BAD in high level activity (stress hormones)</p>
<p>Yet progesterone can always become Testosterone. Testosterone activates the Androgen system and that builds (anabolism). Specifically it builds muscle. BUT it is hard to be a MAN and so it changes itself into Estrogen or DHT</p>
<p>Estrogens are the female steroid, and while VERY necessary in men and boys can cause negative effects on the male figure (see man titties)</p>
<p>DHT is the old man testosterone. During puberty it increases male secondary characteristics. A lil dht gel during puberty can increase size of the penis. As can testosterone.</p>
<p>Part 2: GODS</p>
<p>The synthetics are modified testosterones, dht, and in crazy cases progestin... You tweak a hydrogen, add a chloride, maybe remove a hydrogen, add a carbonyl, double bond YOU SCIENCE the Stuff and next thing you know. New molecule to test. Could be bad could be good. Could hurt your liver or activate the wrong receptor... After almost 100 years of research, 50 good years, we have a good knowledge of it. Many compounds and yet NONE can replace testosterone. Many uses. Ill go over a few...</p>
<p>Deca (nandrolone decantonate)- progesterone derivative so it can affect more than just the androgen receptor... This is the old world's favorite bulking steroid. Lots of mass. Can lift heavier all the time.</p>
<p>Trenbolone-
The God amongst men. Cattle steroid, and like deca a progesterone derivative giving it cool properties no others have. You get too big too fast. Rage is real</p>
<p>Anavar-
DHT derivative, great for lean musscle, cutting, bad on lipids. Gives great look without many side effects. Expensive. used for burn victims, women and children.</p>
<p>I can go on if you like...</p>
<p>Edit: ok basics... There's an A:A ratio. Androgenic:Anabolic aka Masculinization/Muscularity. Androgenic compounds can promote rage, male characteristics and insta strength (great for power lifting). Anabolic is the most important. The body goes between anabolic and catabolic states constantly through the day. During sleep we mostly stay anabolic. With the addition of steroids we stay in the anabolic state more than the catabolic state. I don't like to talk about oral steroids much because they all contain the same structural difference in the 17th carbon that turns it into a liver toxic compound. So I'll continue about the other ones I promote as can be used safely. </p>
<p>EQ AKA (boldenone undecyclate) -
Great for low side effects. Testosterone with a small change. Half as much conversion to estrogen as testosterone probably less because another metabolic product of it is an estrogen enzyme inhibitor. Promotes red blood production more than other AAS</p>
<p>Masteron- DHT derivative. Promotes dry lean muscle. Binds to estrogen enzyme and disables it. As well as to SBGH a hormomne that hold any steroid in the blood as inactive. Therefore it makes ALL steroids more free flowing and effective. Including estrogen at first but usually that's not an issue.</p>
<p>Those are my favorites. Others require a bit of mastery in my opinion and can be more toxic or side effect heavy. ONES REACTION to steroids is personal and based on their genetic makeup. Some love TREN and become addicted to the gains. Some commit manslaughter week 2. It's individual. MEN HAVE BEEN GIVEN TESTOSTERONE FOR YEARS WITHOUT NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS IF MONITORED PROPERLY (usually by a doctor) </p>
<p>ANCILLARY DRUGS- drugs to come off steroids or to stay safe on them.</p>
<p>Aromatase inhibitor- used to stop conversion of testosterone to estrogen. You want about 30-60% inhibition depending on the person, cycle, etc... Some cycles don't need this because they use testosterone replacement levels meant to convert to estrogen but usually you want this to prevent titties, soft dick, emotions, bloating, acne, etc... To little any you get lethargic, soft dick, indifference, etc.</p>
<p>SERMS (not SARMS) -
selective estrogen receptor modulators attach to the estrogen  receptors more and harder than estrogen but are weak unlike estrogen. This is helpful after cycling roids to avoid (or reverse any gynocymastia) some SERMS help in the brain to stimulate 2 hormones that start normal ballsack testosterone and sperm production. Some SERMS help  to reduce boobies, or promote liver health.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing is inherently dangerous about natural steroids, and not necessarily synthetic steroids either. It is the overuse of them that is dangerous, because it throws your naturally regulated hormone levels off balance. In men anabolic steroids cause extra oestrogen to be released, causing the development of breast tissue, shrinking of the testicles among other things. In women the same substances cause the growth of extra hair (usually facial is the only real difference), a lowering of the voice as well as clitoral growth.</p>
<p>They have a variety of different effects, and often are not used to cheat in sport. For example cancer patients are often provided steroids to help revitalise them after chemo/radiotherapy. So not all uses are bad or cause unwanted side effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
