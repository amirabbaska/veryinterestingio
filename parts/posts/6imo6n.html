		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It allows them to split the work load. You also have a nasal cycle where they switch every 4 hours or so. Also, some smells are detected better in faster air and some in slower air to stick to the receptors. There's a Sci Show YouTube video about it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having them switch off gives the less active nostril time to recover. The constant air passing through can dry it out, so in the down time, it can regain lost moisture and replace dried out mucus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm really sorry but I've NEVER known that I only use one nostril. Does that make me weird? I can only breathe through one nostril if I put my finger over the other, I'll check on it every once in a while now because I'll be thinking about it, but I've never noticed this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I breathe through both most of the time. First time I learned this I checked 12 times a day for a whole week. Found no clear incident of one-nostril-over-the-other unless I got explicitly plugged up, like when first waking up or when dealing with anything (dust, eating horseradish or garlic, etc.) that generated excessive snot. Granted, I typically have a <em>dominant</em> nostril at any one time, but air flows through both at no more an extreme than a 40/60 ratio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On top of whats been covered about maintaining the nose, the molecules that make up smells decay at different rates, it's easier to smell something that decays slowly if you breath in slowly and visa versa. So breathing in at different speeds in each nostril allows our noses to pick up a wider variety of smells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
