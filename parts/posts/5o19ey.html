		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A sound wave can be represented by the lower image for simplicity: <a href="http://www.mediacollege.com/audio/images/loudspeaker-waveform.gif" target="_blank">http://www.mediacollege.com/audio/images/loudspeaker-waveform.gif</a></p>
<p>Noise-cancelling equipment is able to produce a sound that creates a 'peak' where the heard wave is a valley, and a 'valley' where the heard wave is a peak, as in this diagram (ignore titles) <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/f/ff/Destructive_interference_.png" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/f/ff/Destructive_interference_.png</a></p>
<p>This results in no sound being heard, because waves that are perfectly out of phase will cancel themselves.</p>
<p>Noise cancelling equipment eliminates droning white noise, not loud noise. The sound itself wouldn't damage your ears, and neither will the equipment that can cancel the sound. Only loud sounds can hurt your ears, so wear ear protection where there is loud white noise, not noise-cancelling equipment </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other responders explained the first part of your question better than I could, so I'll defer to them. I'd like to address the second half about whether or not adding more sounds and decibels can hurt your hearing.</p>
<p>While active noise canceling headphones add sound waves, they do not increase decibels to your ears. In fact, they decrease them. Think of sound waves like ripples in a pool or pond. The height of the waves (amplitude) is how loud the sound waves are. So if you have something at one end of the pool causing waves 10cm high that might represent a loud sound. </p>
<p>Now let's say you have another mechanism that creates waves, but times them in such a way that it adds a peak when the other wave is in a trough and adds a trough when the other wave is a peak. The peaks and troughs of both waves cancel each other out and you get waves with smaller amplitudes. You added waves, but decreased the height of the original wave through interference. This is how noise canceling technology works. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound waves are sinusoidal.  Think of a [sine wave] (<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Simple_sine_wave.svg/1024px-Simple_sine_wave.svg.png" target="_blank">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Simple_sine_wave.svg/1024px-Simple_sine_wave.svg.png</a>), it varies between a peak and a valley.    </p>
<p>Noise cancelling produces a sound wave that is exactly the same, but 180 degrees out of phase... meaning at the same time that the original sound produces a peak, the noise cancelling system produces a valley and instead of a valley, it produces a peak.  When you combine the two waves that are 180 degrees out of phase, the amplitude cancels out to zero.    </p>
<p>It's the same as how adding +1 and -1 = 0.    </p>
<p>Does it hurt your ears?  No, because the level of the sound is actually reduced.  This isn't tricking you into thinking that it's reduced, it really is.  The amplitude of the noise reaching your ear drum is much lower, which is why you don't hear it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've wondered this too. It does make sense that inverse waves can cancel out. On the other hand, doesn't it take fractions of a second for the incoming noise to be detected and for the noise-cancelling device to produce the corresponding inverse wave?</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder if slight imperfections in detection and cancellation can create even bigger waves than the original (e.g. a high-frequency sine wave and negative sine wave sum to zero, but if displaced just by a <strong>tiny bit</strong>, they can sum to be twice the original).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some good answers about how sound comes in waves and those waves can cancel, but to put it in more &quot;real&quot; terms those &quot;waves&quot; are actually pockets of air with either higher or lower pressure. So think of a guitar string, when you strum it it hits the air a pushes it closer to other air, creating a pocket of higher pressure. That pocket pushes into the air next to it, and then that pushes into the air next to it, etc., so the pocket travels. </p>
<p>When you cancel noise, you're eliminating those pockets of high and low pressure so at your ears the air is exactly how it is if they was no noise, and thus it doesn't hurt your ears.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
