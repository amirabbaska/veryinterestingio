		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I talked to someone who works in a can filling factory. The food is often cooked in the can at 121 C, so the ribs allow the cans themselves and the steam produced to expand during said cooking, and then to contract back to regular size after cooking, without damaging the seal.</p>
<p>Strength is a secondary concern, usually the crush strength isn't as important as the vertical strength (stacking strength).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tin cans are hot filled then sealed. When the contents cool it pulls a vaccum in the can. Without the ribbing the can would implode. The reason aluminum cans don't have this feature is because they are pressurized with carbonation that pushes out on the walls giving them strength. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
