		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For any satellite, including a moon, it has to revolve far enough away that it isn't torn apart by tidal forces. This is called the <a href="http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/roche_limit.html" target="_blank">Roche Limit</a>. The Roche limit is usually 2.5 times greater than the radius of the body. This theoretical planet sharing an atmosphere with its moon would have an atmosphere which is at least 3000% greater than the volume of the actual planet. In comparison, the earths atmosphere extends to be only 700 Km above sea level compared to the 6300 Km radius of the Earth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a related question. My first thought about Op's question was that even if the atmosphere was large enough to capture a moon the drag would decay the orbit.</p>
<p>But what if the moon in in a geostationary orbit?</p>
<p>That led to my question. Clearly the atmosphere matches the earth's spin at the ground. As you go up though, it would have to move faster to allow for the increased radius of spin. So a Coriolis force in the vertical direction. This would be unsustainable though at greater distances.  Jet streams run east and west. </p>
<p>At what point does the atmosphere become gas particles in orbit?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Even if the planet somehow had an atmosphere so large that it extended to the Roche limit (the smallest orbit a satellite can have without being destroyed by tidal forces), the problem is atmospheric drag - that is, air resistance.</p>
<p>Plowing through an atmosphere will slow down the moon. As it slows, its orbit will get lower - putting it into thicker atmosphere that slows it even more. It won't so much orbit as spiral down into the atmosphere and tear itself apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This can happen with binary stars, but it's fairly temporary in an astronomical timescale. It's also not really a case of &quot;sharing&quot; as much as &quot;taking&quot;.</p>
<p>The big problem with a moon/planet combo is that they would tear each other apart (like another poster said). Plus, the friction would probably have a more dramatic effect on the smaller member, than between pairs of stars.</p>
<p>It could probably happen between a pair of gas giants, if they somehow got close enough and were also dense enough.</p>
<p>After more thought, I feel that if two bodies had atmospheres extending to or beyond their mutual center of gravity, any gas that got to that height would be blown away by solar wind due to the effectively null gravity at that mutual center of mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plenty of posters have already made it clear that truly &quot;sharing&quot; an atmosphere is highly improbable. But there are examples, even in our own solar system, of orbiting bodies exchanging gases, at least from time to time.</p>
<p>Io, the closet moon of Jupiter, is very volcanic (moreso than Earth, despite its much smaller size). It is constantly spewing out sulfur dioxide gas, which forms a thin atmosphere. Jupiter's strong magnetic field rips this sulfur away, and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(moon\)#Interaction_with_Jupiter.27s_magnetosphere" target="_blank">through a series of interactions</a>, this greatly increases the strength of Jupiter's magnetic field, and essentially turns Io into a giant electric generator. Pretty wild.</p>
<p>For another example, last year when New Horizons passed Charon, Pluto's moon, it photographed a huge orange/brown region on its north pole which has been informally dubbed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordor_Macula?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Modor</a>. It's origin is not certain, but many believe it's the frozen remains of gases which are gravitationally siphoned from Pluto's atmosphere. </p>
<p>Neither of these cases are cut and dry examples of &quot;sharing&quot; am atmosphere, but certainly gas exchange happens, and it can have interesting and unanticipated effects on the overall appearance and behavior of the planet-moon systems it's seen in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
