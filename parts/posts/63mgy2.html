		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><del>The squeegee is to clear excess shaving cream before the blades get there.</del> Since you presumably have some sort of shaving soap or cream you don't need to moisturize more before the blades do their job. The moisturizer bar comes afterwards to help re-moisturize once the blades clear away the cream/soap.</p>
<p>Edit: The squeegee thing is actually called a guard bar and prepares the skin for shaving by smoothing it and making it taut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwAG0Ddatww" target="_blank">Gillette video</a> the average guy takes 170 strokes or more to properly shave. From my experience, the reality is that you never get a clean shave in a series of single passes no matter what blade you use. </p>
<p>In my case it takes multiple passes in different directions to get what I consider a clean shave. The first pass removes the shaving cream and some of the hairs and the lubricating strip ensures that the next pass glides smoothly. It also may have some impact on the angle of the cutting action. </p>
<p>Then consider that as the lubricant wears off the angle changes and the razor may not cut as well over time as the angles gets ever more flatter. How hard you press the razor into your skin may also affect the angle and at what angle you hold the blade may impact its effectiveness if the lubricating strip acts as a fulcrum to lift the blades away from the skin surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
