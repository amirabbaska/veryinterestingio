<p>My question is, what does the light array that blinks faster than the speed of sound achieve, that a camera rolling at 1000 fps slowed down to 30 can not?</p></div></div>

<p>Several things are happening to achieve the look from Thor Ragnarok. </p>
<p>1) The camera is shooting at an extremely high FPS. Thus giving you slow motion.</p>
<p>2) The lights and the camera are also moving extremely fast.</p>
<p>3) The result is a visual effect that makes the slow motion footage look slow AND normal speed at the same time. The subject is slow but the camera motion and light movement is fast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Conventional slo-mo takes many frames per second and plays them back at normal speed.  This makes things see to move more slowly.</p>
<p>Strobe-tach, and related technology, are very different.  If you have multiple flashes per frame, you get multiple images, but regardless you get no motion blur because the light is only on for a tiny bit of time.</p>
<p>If you shoot a moving thing at 24 FPS, traditional movie speed, you get motion blur of approximately 1/24^th of a second.  If you shoot that same motion at 240 FPS and play it back at normal speed everything is slowed down and you get 1/240^th of a second motion blur.  If you shoot the same motion at 24 FPS under a 240 Hz strobe, you get 10 unblurred images per frame and no slow down.  If you shoot at 240 FPS under a 1200Hz strobe you get five clear images per frame and those five overlapped images move slowly.  It looks a lot different because your eye integrates the multiple images differently than it handles motion blue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The title is a bit misleading I think. If I understand this correctly it's conventional slow-mo from the cameras perspective except that you add an array of appropriately synchronized strobes. This way you can &quot;move&quot; the light source by a significant amount even during super fast slow-mo since you don't actually try to move a physical light source at absurd speeds but you fire strobes along the path in sequence.</p>
<p>Similar things were done for cameras in the matrix movies IIRC. Essentially they set up a ton of photo cameras along a camera path and then triggered them all at the same time. That way you can move along the path of the setup cameras while the action remains frozen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The effect gives it a surreal, dreamlike quality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
