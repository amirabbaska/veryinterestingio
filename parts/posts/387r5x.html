		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been trying to find the lowest temperature fire can be. Like the actual flame, not the ignition point or anything like that. On earth, not on earth, however. The more answers the better. I started asking my HS science teachers in 1992, asked every science professor I've had. Never got an answer.  Thank you!</p>
<p>Edit:  Going to edit to clarify my intentions:  14 year old me, sophomore in HS, was bored one day, and wondered if there was a fire cold enough I could hold it, touch it, be engulfed in it, without being harmed.  /u/legalizegaypot hit the nail on the head with his expanding of the question.  Now, while I love the theoretical discussions, my original intention was to find the coldest fire that could be produced from known materials.  I hope this helps to clarify my intentions, but damn, I'm loving the theoretical discussions right now.</p></div></div>
