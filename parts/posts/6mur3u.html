		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine does not provide energy at all. It just stops your brain from telling the rest of your body to become tired.</p>
<p>An ELI5 explanation of how caffeine works is probably like this: In your brain, there are keys and keyholes. When the key goes into the hole, your brain performs various functions. There is a keyhole, that when a certain key goes inside, your brain releases chemicals to make you tired. Caffeine fits in the keyhole, but does not pass the message to become tired. It just blocks the real keys from going inside. </p>
<p>In response, your brain makes more keyholes. This is why heavy caffeine users need more and more caffeine just to feel normal. Because you have so many keyholes, if you don't fill them with caffeine, your brain will send super strong signals to make you tired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine as a molecule blocks the normal activity of receptors in the brain. These receptors usually interact to a molecule called adenosine. When these receptors bond with adenosine, your brain reads this as being tired.
If you drink coffee when your adenosine levels are low (optimal time for a cuppa in the morning is 30mins-1 hour after waking up, NOT IMMEDIATELY) then the caffeine blocks these molecules from being bonded with and your brain doesn't feel tired.<br />
Whereas, if your brain is all full up of adenosine, then as it can't shove the adenosine out of its place, all you feel are the other affects of caffeine such as increased heart beat</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a slot in your brain that only takes a certain shaped chemical. That chemical is called adenosine and it makes you feel tired when it fits into that slot. Caffeine works because it looks similar enough to your brain to fit into the adenosine slot, but because it's slightly different it kind of &quot;blocks&quot; the slot so no more adenosine can be absorbed. </p>
<p>Therefore caffeine doesn't really give you energy at all, but instead it makes you less capable of feeling tired. </p>
<p>By now you're wondering &quot;So why do I feel a pick-me-up from drinking caffeine?&quot; and mindblowing truth is that you weren't tired from adenosine being absorbed, you were tired because you were in the midst of a <em>caffeine withdrawal</em> and thus felt much better once you got your fix. </p>
<p>Caffeine is a beautiful lie. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The caffeine in coffee blocks adenosine receptors in your brain from receiving adenosine, which is a neurotransmitter that causes fatigue. Although caffeine prevents your brain from receiving adenosine, it doesn’t stop your body from producing the neurotransmitter. Thus, when the caffeine wears off, there is a buildup of adenosine that will make you sleepy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of other answers assume you are sleep deprived.  Lets say you just slept for 8 hours, had a cup of coffee, and it's otherwise a normal day but you still feel <em>tired.</em>  Maybe you even feel more tired after the coffee?</p>
<p>It's because of Dehydration.  If you are dehydrated, the 'plasma' in your blood is greatly reduced.  This 'plasma' is actually almost all water with a few other things in it.  This means your blood cells are now crowded together in less fluid. Like people in a crowded swimming pool, they cannot move easily.  According to <a href="http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/dehydration-and-its-effects-on-performance" target="_blank">studies</a>, a 5% decrease in body water weight from dehydration, can result in a 30% decrease in physical ability. </p>
<p><a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003281.htm" target="_blank">Here's an easy test</a> for checking how dehydrated you are. No special tools required!</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> Some people are saying that more recent studies show the dehydration of caffeine is not significant (A 2005 study vs a 1928 study).  I checked out the studies, and I personally don't feel either are conclusive because of sample size (50 individuals) and because water intake wasn't controlled rigorously.   Either way, moving the controversial statement below...  please stop PMing me.  </p>
<p>Caffeine further dehydrates you, especially the 180mg that's in cup of coffee (there's 34mg in a Coke and 60mg in a black tea bag). That's why you can get even more tired feeling after your cup of coffee!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
