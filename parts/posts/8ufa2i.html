		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was casually drinking my coffee and wondering what this is actually doing to my brain and why I feel so great when I drink it. Sure enough, it's partially because of dopamine. Here's why I am confused, though. Does the brain start producing more dopamine, or does it just take longer for it to be reabsorbed, or both? A lot of articles I read mention how it lets the dopamine &quot;do it's thing more freely&quot;, but I'm not sure if that means ramp up production, or just act differently than before.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine doesn’t interact with dopamine production directly, that’s just your brain telling you that it enjoys the coffee. Caffeine works by blocking certain receptors in your brain that tell your body to become tired.</p>
<p>When your cells need energy, they break down ATP molecules, which release energy and a few byproducts, including Adenosine. Over time Adenosine builds up and binds to its specific receptor telling the body to become tired. It gets cleared away, but this is usually slower than it’s created. As it accumulates you feel more and more tired, but when you sleep the enzyme that clears it out can catch up. Caffeine binds to the same receptor as Adenosine, but it doesn’t activate it, so you don’t feel sleepy. It also makes it easier for the enzyme to clear out the Adenosine.</p>
<p>So, caffeine doesn’t perk you up, it just makes you feel less tired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other comment did a good job of answering your question but something that I think a lot of people get confused about is the dopamine, serotonin equals feel good.  It has much more to do with the location these neurotransmitters bind.  Increased dopamine in the substantia nigra is the common link between basically every drug of abuse.  But having too much dopamine doesn’t make you feel good if it’s constant and global... in fact it’s thought to be a root cause of schizophrenia.  So dopamine and seretonin really are no more than simple communicators, sort of like the breaker box for specific areas in your brain, one of these lights makes you feel good when it’s flipped on.  Flip another seretonin or dopamine switch in a different part of the brain and very, very different things will occur.  That’s why those “happiness is <picture of dopamine and seretonin> tattoos are so very wrong.  They’re also claiming happiness is life threatening seretonin syndrome and possibly schizophrenia.  I know this didn’t have much to do with coffee but it sounded like you might be interested in some more neurochemistry, especially where pharmacology is involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By blocking adenosine receptors, release of other neurotransmitters like dopamine is increased. It's not that more is produced, just that what's available is more easily released (then reabsorbed and readied for use again).</p>
<p>Caffeine also affects binding of dopamine to G-coupled receptors via allosteric interaction with adenosine G-coupled receptors (these can form various heterooligomers).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Due to the blocking of adenosine inhibitory effects through its receptors, caffeine indirectly affects the release of norepinephrine, dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and perhaps neuropeptides (Daly et al., 1999).&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up question, there was a guy that did a self-study on Caffeine effects that drank a generous amount daily for a month and then quit cold-turkey... IIRC the scans of his brain indicated brain cells had grown closed together and that quitting resulted in them stretching back out? I may be quoting it incorrectly because I had only watched the documentary of it randomly on tv once, but has that been confirmed as another effect from caffeine?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
