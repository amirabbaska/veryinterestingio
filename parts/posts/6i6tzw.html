<blockquote>
<p>The limit on mass arises because stars of greater mass have a higher rate of core energy generation, their luminosity increasing far out of proportion to their mass. For a sufficiently massive star the outward pressure of radiant energy generated by nuclear fusion in the starâ€™s core exceeds the inward pull of its own gravity. This is called the Eddington limit. Beyond this limit, a star ought to push itself apart, or at least shed enough mass to reduce its internal energy generation to a lower, maintainable rate. In theory, a more massive star could not hold itself together because of the mass loss resulting from the outflow of stellar material. In practice the theoretical Eddington Limit must be modified for high luminosity stars and the empirical Humphreys Davidson Limit is derived</p>

<p>&quot;We expected to find 20 to 30 stars with masses between 130 and 1,000 solar masses,&quot; Figer said. &quot;But we found none. If they could have formed, we would have seen them.&quot; </p>
<p>He set the limit at 150 solar masses.  If a gas cloud/ proto star is too massive, radiation pressure would probably destroy it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stars are born hot and bright, the gravitational collapse of the nebula they form from is the source of the energy (conversion of gravitational potential energy to thermal energy) that heats them up. Even before they are hot enough in their cores to fuse Hydrogen they are hot enough to shine. The more massive the star is the more extreme this process. However, that heat translates to radiation pressure which can keep additional material from collapsing onto the star and also can drive stellar winds which cause the proto-star to lose mass. It's thought that these processes result in a practical limit somewhere around 150 to 300 or 400 solar masses for star formation. Stars above 150 solar masses are extraordinarily rare and might form through non-standard processes (perhaps involving stellar mergers or some complex process of mass gain after formation).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
