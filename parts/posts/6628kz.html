		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An important thing to remember is that when we say &quot;the speed of light&quot; we mean &quot;the speed of light in a vacuum&quot;. Gravitational waves always travel at the same speed, as far as we know.</p>
<p>In order for there to be an index of refraction for gravitational waves, it helps to understand why there is an index of refraction for electromagnetic waves. From a wave phenomenon perspective, as the oscillating field enters the material, it interacts with atoms, causing them to oscillate in response, which in turn allows them to radiate light with the same frequency. This interaction slows down the propagation of the wave. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiHN0ZWE5bk" target="_blank">great explanation with more detail here</a>).</p>
<p>In order for the same thing to happen for a gravitational wave, it would have to enter a region where its oscillation drives masses to oscillate in a way that re-radiates a gravitational wave. However, because gravity is so weak compared to electromagnetism, anything light enough to be oscillated is not going to generate a strong wave, and anything massive enough to generate a strong wave is not going to be very responsive. This means that there's not really anything (that we know of, at any rate) which can really affect the propagation of the gravitational wave. There are some other issues as well which have to do with the fact that gravitational waves actually change the shape of space-time, rather than propagate through it like electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p>All of these things means there isn't really anything which will actually absorb gravitational waves, and related to that, there isn't really anything which can slow them down.</p>
<p>That's my understanding - I don't work with gravitational waves but about half of my department does, so I might have some details off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that the speed of light changes in media specifically because of how the medium responds to <strong>electromagnetic</strong> fields.</p>
<p>So there's no reason why the &quot;index of refraction&quot; for a gravitational wave in matter should be the same as that of electromagnetic waves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravitational waves follow the rule that they travel at the speed of causality. The whole idea behind the speed of light is a terrible idea in every way because light doesn't determine the speed which we actually call 'the speed of light' instead light obeys a 'speed limit' that is set by the an entirely different effect that has nothing to do with light, and light just happens to travel at that speed in a vacuume, in other mediums light travels at a different speed so 'the speed of light' is like saying &quot;The speed of the Bell X-1&quot; instead of saying &quot;Mach 1&quot;, the Bell X-1 moved at speeds other than Mach 1 in many cases yet we could use it's top speed as a replacement for Mach number, but it would be inaccurate because it isn't true except for certain cases. Likewise the speed of light is a stupid term that compares the speed of causality to the speed at which light travels in one specific case, there are many cases where the speed of light is not equal to the speed of causality, and we should really start using a different term to avoid this kind of confusion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people say &quot;the speed of light&quot; they usually mean &quot;the speed of light in a vacuum&quot; or more specifically &quot;the speed of massless particles&quot; (all of which are the same, c). This differs from the speed of light in a medium that has a different electrical permittivity and/or permeability than a vacuum does, and thus has a lower effective speed of propagation of electromagnetic waves / photons. However, even in such media the speed of massless particles other than photons often remains the same as c. And this is the case for gravitational waves, they are not in general refracted or lensed the way light waves are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Stuff going at the speed of light has nothing to do with it being intrinsically related to light in someway.
