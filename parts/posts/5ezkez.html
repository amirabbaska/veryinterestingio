		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>short answer: clothing fibers + body hair that grows towards a sheltered depression in your skin = belly button lint, but not &quot;any-other-body-part lint&quot;. you need both the hair and the place for fibers to collect in order for it to work!</p>
<p>longer answer: tiny fibers from your clothing are rubbed off by the hair around your navel. the hair grows in such a fashion that it &quot;points&quot; into your belly button - meaning, hair above it points down, and hair below it points up - and this pattern of growth helps funnel these tiny fibers into your navel, a depression where they can collect. </p>
<p>since other body hair typically doesn't &quot;funnel&quot; lint or fibers into a protected, shallow pocket - also, since there <em>aren't</em> any other real protected, shallow pockets in your skin - lint isn't collected elsewhere. </p>
<p>so, if you have an &quot;outie,&quot; or a really shallow belly button, or don't have (much) hair that grows around your navel, you are likely to experience much less (if any) belly button lint.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because your chest and stomach hair points to your belly button, the lint will travel towards your belly button and settle there. You'll find the hairier you are, the more gathers; when I shave my torso completely I have no build up, and then as my hair grows back out it becomes more and more of an issue.</p>
<p>This of course comes from your clothing and you'll find there's more when you wear something like a woolly jumper, compared to a cotton shirt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Belly button fluff is just clothes fibres. It collects there because it's a gap. Hair does seem to play a part from studies on it. There is a theory that the direction the hair 'points' is important. </p>
<p>It does collect elsewhere. It collects between toes from socks quite frequently and for some people the intergluteal cleft also collects it (intergluteal cleft =fancy name for a bum crack-I just wanted to use the term because I find it funny).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not everyone gets belly button lint and some people also get lint stuck behind their ears. The reason is actually the type of hair you have based on genetics. Some people have hairs with microscopic spindles on the end that causes the lint from clothes to become detached, the belly button is simply the crevice that it gets stuck in. Even things like belly button lint are genetic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
