		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key to understanding many of the properties of clouds, including this one, is to keep in mind that clouds are not a single object: they are an area of air which has cooled to the point where water vapor can condense. </p>
<p>For your typical cumulus cloud (<a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/wcumulus.htm" target="_blank">like these</a>), this process is due to a pocket of air being warmed near the ground, to the point where it is less dense than the air around it, and begins to rise as an updraft. As this air rises, it cools due to expansion (known as <a href="http://geography.name/the-adiabatic-process/" target="_blank">adiabatic cooling</a>). Eventually it cools to the point where the water vapor in the air begins to condense into cloud droplets. Since the air in the updraft all generally started with the same temperature and humidity, the height at which this condensation starts is essentially the same for the entire updraft: for this reason, the bottoms of many clouds are flat.</p>
<p>You can often observe this process happening in severe storms that have very strong updrafts. For example, <a href="https://youtu.be/CAynT7Gz_Ns?t=55s" target="_blank">in this storm that eventually produces a tornado</a>, the flat bottom of the cloud actually shows many bumps and variations over time, as regions of air that have slightly different temperature and humidity are lifted up into the storm. It is apparent that the air is rising rapidly, but the cloud keeps forming at the same height.</p>
<p>I'm sure you know, but it's important to note that this only applies to some types of clouds. There are many types of clouds, such as <a href="https://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/wxfacts/Cirrus.htm" target="_blank">cirrus</a>, that are not flat on the bottom, because they form by different processes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alternatively, extensively large cloud formations like <a href="https://www.google.com.mt/search?client=ms-unknown&amp;ei=i1NgW4aEEY6tgQbCzbLgCg&amp;q=cumulonimbus&amp;oq=cumulo&amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i67j0l3j0i10.20863.24738..25771...2.0...203.965.0j5j1......0....1.......5..0i71j35i39j0i131j46i67j0i67i70i249.EvqedWm7PZs" target="_blank">Cumulonimbus</a> stretch all the way up to the stratosphere and also flatten out. This is mostly due to the ozone layer which is found in the stratosphere that has effectively reversed this atmospheric layer's temperature profile. </p>
<p>i.e. The higher up one goes in the stratosphere, the hotter it gets (the opposite of the troposhere). So the tropopause (the boundary between the troposhere and the stratosphere) is cooled to about -57Â°C and then the stratosphere starts to heat up again the closer one gets to the ozone layer. This occurs because ozone traps and emits a lot of captured insolation thus heating the surrounding atmosphere. The Earth is fascinating!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
