		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's actually part of dopamine's role in the brain. Extrinsic motivation, delay gratification, dopamine often spikes if you <em>anticipate</em> some action will lead to some sort of reward in the future, so that you kinda &quot;enjoy&quot; doing the action and are motivated to do it, even if you don't actually enjoy the action. </p>
<p>The catch is, you're going to <em>want</em> to do the thing (in fact, you're going to have to exert willpower <em>not</em> to do it) but you won't necessarily <em>like</em> the experience as a whole. There's a few other chemicals besides dopamine that go into actual <em>satisfaction</em>. (And you probably want to avoid giving <em>too much</em> dopamine, or it'll just result in doped-out euphoric bliss.)</p>
<p>E.g. browsing reddit. Low dopamine hits for novelty, dopamine hits for getting orange envelopes, you want to browse reddit, but only very rarely is there actual satisfaction. </p>
<p>You pretty much never go &quot;oh man, that was such a great reddit session, let's do it again&quot; after the fact, the way you might for more natural rewards like food, sex, or social activity. You're just sort of inexorably driven to do it again by forces which aren't entirely under conscious control. Whether or not you find it &quot;rewarding&quot; really depends on how you define the term. </p>
<p>With well-timed dopamine spikes, you could probably create this ambiguous relationship with any activity! In fact, even activities you actively hate doing but can't help yourself are partly dopamine driven - the urge to get into angry debates, the desire to have one more word in an argument, to stalk your ex on facebook on more time, to repeatedly obsess about that one cringey awkward thing you did once (although true obsession probably also involves serotonin and a bunch of other stuff).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I might be dumb, but I feel like the top voted answers aren't really answering OP's question. I feel like OP is asking &quot;if I artificially applied dopamine to my brain at some point while getting kicked in the balls... am I going to start liking it?&quot; Most of these answers are basically what dopamine does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is solid evidence that 'reward' consists of multiple components with distinct neurobiological substrates. While dopamine appears essential for 'wanting' something (the addictive property of drugs), it does not appear to be essential for 'liking' something, i.e., the hedonic, subjectively experienced pleasure while doing / consuming something which is primarily mediated via opiod receptors (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2756052/#!po=12.5000" target="_blank">paper</a>).</p>
<p>For example, administration of L-DOPA, which is metabolized to dopamine in the brain and increases its levels, does not have strong euphoriant effects. In fact, I just finished a study using L-DOPA in healthy human subjects and they did not report increases in mood or well being.</p>
<p>Therefore, administration of dopamine theoretically will change peoples behavior (they will start doing something they did not like before), yet they will not do it because they suddenly 'like' this, they will just start 'wanting' to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As many have already pointed out, dopamine isn't directly related to the subjective sense of finding something to be &quot;rewarding&quot;.</p>
<p>Dopamine is part of a system that helps organisms learn how to make good decisions. To make a good decision, you should be able to <em>predict</em> the <em>consequences</em> of the different alternatives. To gauge whether or not to trust your predictions of consequences, your beliefs can be assigned varying degrees of confidence.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>If</em> I eat this pie, I'll feel real good. I want to feel good. Therefore, eating the pie is a good decision.</p>
</li>
<li><em>If</em> I eat this pie it will contribute negatively to my health. I want to be healthy. Therefore, eating the pie is a poor decision.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we have a conflict. The first represents immediate gratification, the second deferred gratification. To determine what decision is the best, you should multiply the expected value of the alternatives with their assigned confidence. How do you determine the confidence? Dopamine signals expected reward. Various parts of the brain contribute to a measure of uncertainty. The dopaminergic response is diminished by the levels of uncertainty. If artificially enhanced (cocaine, amphetamines), the uncertainty is discounted. <em>This</em> is the reason why drugs that affect dopamine makes it seem like you have more &quot;willpower&quot;--they cause the uncertainty regarding an alternative to be discounted. Cleaning your room or doing homework will feel effortless, because the system is interpreting it as &quot;this is paying off; the investment is low and the profit good; keep it up!&quot;.</p>
<p>So the answer to your question is &quot;no&quot;, because dopamine isn't directly about either reward or liking. What you could have asked, though, is whether you could enter opioids to do the same. Opioids, unlike dopamine, <em>do</em> feel subjectively rewarding. They are used in the brain to promote adaptive behavior (eating, being social, having sex), and you could use them to make anything feel as good as any of those if you did it right. And, as you might have imagined, blocking opioid receptors can release you from addiction to stuff that has to do with opioids. Heroin and alcohol addiction can be eliminated by naltrexone, a drug that occupies opioid receptors without activating them. Of course, it is dopamine that will change the behavior. Dopamine updates its prediction of consequences: &quot;I see that heroin is no longer rewarding. I will now not steer you, Jeremy, toward heroin no more.&quot;</p>
<p>The dopamine/opioid interaction is very important in a discussion of reward. Opioids affect the conscious experience of something as pleasureable, &quot;liking&quot;. Dopamine affect the exploitation of behavioral strategies to increase the probability of making good decisions based on prediction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
