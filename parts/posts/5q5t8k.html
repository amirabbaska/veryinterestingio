This would certainly not be possible in a lot of countries, is there any limit or can continue ruling like that forever? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, the President is essentially given power to make any actions by Congress.  So congress will pass a law, let's say Congress passes the Build a Bridge Across the Potomac act (a river running near Washington DC), that authorizes the some agency to spend $1 billion dollars to build a new bridge and sets some rules for how the bridge should be built (it might specify how the contractor should be chosen and that the bridge should allow at least 3 lanes of traffic, or needs to facilitate river shipments below a certain height, etc).  </p>
<p>But that act won't include all the details of the project.  So when the act is vague or doesn't mention something.  The President has the authority to tell the agency that received the money how to do the details (if he doesn't tell them anything the agency head would have the authority within the law).  Remember agency heads all work for him, so he's their boss.  Maybe the president wants the bridge to be a suspension bridge, or to only consider contractors incorporated in the US, or the bridge to be painted blue.  </p>
<p>Many laws are relatively vague, Congress passes lots of laws with fairly general proposals, so the president can claim pretty considerable wiggle room, while still operating within the language of the law.  </p>
<p>As a real example, here's an exerpt from the executive order to put the Japanese into internment camps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas the successful prosecution of the war requires every possible protection against espionage and against sabotage to national-defense material, national-defense premises, and national-defense utilities as defined in <strong>Section 4, Act of April 20, 1918, 40 Stat. 533</strong>, as amended by the <strong>Act of November 30, 1940, 54 Stat. 1220</strong>, and the <strong>Act of August 21, 1941, 55 Stat. 655 (U.S.C., Title 50, Sec. 104)</strong>;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The executive order makes a case that the acts referenced (I've bolded them) give the President the authority to take the specific action of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, I hereby authorize and direct the Secretary of War, and the Military Commanders whom he may from time to time designate, whenever he or any designated Commander deems such action necessary or desirable, to prescribe military areas in such places and of such extent as he or the appropriate Military Commander may determine, from which any or all persons may be excluded, and with respect to which, the right of any person to enter, remain in, or leave shall be subject to whatever restrictions the Secretary of War or the appropriate Military Commander may impose in his discretion. The Secretary of War is hereby authorized to provide for residents of any such area who are excluded therefrom, such transportation, food, shelter, and other accommodations as may be necessary, in the judgment of the Secretary of War or the said Military Commander, and until other arrangements are made, to accomplish the purpose of this order. The designation of military areas in any region or locality shall supersede designations of prohibited and restricted areas by the Attorney General under the Proclamations of December 7 and 8, 1941, and shall supersede the responsibility and authority of the Attorney General under the said Proclamations in respect of such prohibited and restricted areas.</p>
<p>I hereby further authorize and direct the Secretary of War and the said Military Commanders to take such other steps as he or the appropriate Military Commander may deem advisable to enforce compliance with the restrictions applicable to each Military area herein above authorized to be designated, including the use of Federal troops and other Federal Agencies, with authority to accept assistance of state and local agencies.</p>
<p>I hereby further authorize and direct all Executive Departments, independent establishments and other Federal Agencies, to assist the Secretary of War or the said Military Commanders in carrying out this Executive Order, including the furnishing of medical aid, hospitalization, food, clothing, transportation, use of land, shelter, and other supplies, equipment, utilities, facilities, and services.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way the US government works, Congress makes laws, the Executive branch (over which the President has almost unilateral control) takes action, and the Judicial branch sorts out what actions and laws are legal and constitutional.</p>
<p>Effectively this means that the President's power is not limited by scope or field (some restrictions apply). He cannot write new laws, i.e outlaw or legalize something. He cannot collect or spend more money than congress allows him to. Congress can force him to use the money only for specific things or prevent him from using the money for specific things. He can only deploy troops for a maximum of 3 months before he needs approval from congress. He cannot declare war or approve treaties (but he can make executive agreements which are basically treaties without all the formality). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main limitation is that the president can't just allocate funds to do as he likes, that's Congress' job.</p>
<p>An example is with Obama wanting to close Guantanamo Bay. He was ready to do it, but Congress refused to pay for it, and I believe they specified in the budget (or some other laws) that the funds could not be used to relocate the Gitmo prisoners.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there's nothing set in stone, but he is the head of the executive branch, and the executive branch's function is to carry out and enforce laws. so basically anything within the law, within the budget, and under the purview of the executive branch (all the departments and agencies and bureaus fall under the executive branch) is fair game. when it comes to building a wall, he can't do that unless congress agrees to pay for it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to things others have already said:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The president cannot fund anything he orders. Congress must approve of any orders he makes enough to give them funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The president can take any military action for (i think) 72 hours, after which time, approval must be received by congress for action to continue, or forces must be repealed.</p>
</li>
<li>The president cannot declare war. He can, however, incite an opponent to declare war against the US.</li>
