		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As soon as I saw this post, my mind went back to a FiveThirtyEight article I read a while ago which went into detail on this topic, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-msg-got-a-bad-rap-flawed-science-and-xenophobia/" target="_blank"><strong>How MSG Got A Bad Rap: Flawed Science And Xenophobia</strong></a></p>
<p>MSG became a popular food additive during our whole &quot;scientific food&quot; period in the mid 20th century, when everything was powered and processed and prepackaged. It ended up in lots of common foods at the time with few complaints.</p>
<p>However, eventually a sort of chemophobia began to assert itself again, and substances with &quot;chemical-sounding&quot; names started to become suspect, rather than a sign of purity and progress.</p>
<p>Then, as the article puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1968, the New England Journal of Medicine published a letter from a doctor complaining about radiating pain in his arms, weakness and heart palpitations after eating at Chinese restaurants. He mused that cooking wine, MSG or excessive salt might be to blame. Reader responses poured in with similar complaints, and scientists jumped to research the phenomenon. “Chinese Restaurant Syndrome” was born.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to have set the ball rolling. There were some deeply flawed studies that indicated some potential problems.  They weren't even single-blind; participants knew whether or not they were eating MSG. They have not been backed up by modern studies with proper methodologies. This lead to actual medical professionals recognizing the aforementioned &quot;Chinese Restaurant Syndrome&quot;, and it all kind of spiraled out from there. Once a myth gets going, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds" target="_blank">it's hard to shut it down with evidence</a>, after all.</p>
<p>The article continues,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That MSG causes health problems may have thrived on racially charged biases from the outset. Ian Mosby, a food historian, wrote in a 2009 paper titled “‘That Won-Ton Soup Headache’: The Chinese Restaurant Syndrome, MSG and the Making of American Food, 1968-1980” that fear of MSG in Chinese food is part of the U.S.’s long history of viewing the “exotic” cuisine of Asia as dangerous or dirty. As Sand put it: “It was the misfortune of Chinese cooks to be caught with the white powder by their stoves when the once-praised flavor enhancer suddenly became a chemical additive.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do want to point out that there <em>are</em> people who do have bad reactions to glutamate, in general, but this is very rare. </p>
<p>I've tried to summarize it down to a fairly bite-sized length, but you should check out the full article. It's not terribly long, and it goes into detail on some stuff that I skimmed over to keep it short.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Based on several very anti-MSG people I've met, it's because of the following reasoning:</p>
<p>We should limit our salt intake. Salt is a seasoning. MSG is kind of like salt, but has a chemical name. Chemicals are bad. MSG must be a manmade salt-equivalent. MSG is therefore bad.</p>
<p>It was frequently compared to aspartame, with the exact same reasoning - it's a 'fake version' of a thing we should limit our intake of anyway.</p>
<p>As to why they do it? I think it makes people feel smart to &quot;know better&quot; than other people, even if they have to make up reasons why other people are wrong. Same with most climate change deniers - it ultimately boils down to &quot;other people say things, but I know better than them.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three reasons:</p>
<p>1) it has a scary sounding name. </p>
<p>2) it is used more aggressively in Chinese and other Eastern cuisines, and we fear things that are different. </p>
<p>3) some dude did a hack job of a study demonstrating the connection between MSG and headaches, but it was absolute junk science. Doesn't stop people from using it as confirmation of what they already believed due to one of the other two reasons.</p>
<p>Worth noting that MSG is naturally occurring and found in many common foods, like mushrooms, tomatoes, and delicious eggplant. We just don't have a common name for it as we do with other foods (&quot;salt&quot; instead of Sodium Chloride, &quot;water&quot; instead of... um... brain fart, but whatever water is).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a theory that a lot of foods that use MSG (like fast food) use MSG to make really really shitty food taste good. I get pretty sick after I eat fast food. Not because of the MSG, but because it's absolute shit food. Crappy canned soups, Doritos, etc all make me feel ill. That's way too much salt and grease for my body to process without feeling like crap. So, along with the whole MSG is evil bullshit I saw in the &quot;news&quot; it was easy for me to say, &quot;Yeah, that must be true because when I eat those foods I feel crappy.&quot; It's easy enough to believe, so people believe it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As short as it can be explained: It's anti-Asian xenophobia. Around the 60's and 70's, in North America there was a tremendous wave of xenophobia that manifested in, for example, lots of laws banning things from Asian culture. If you look at the Canadian criminal code, for example, they ban a whole list of Asian-sounding weapons like Nunchaku, Marikigusari and Kusarigami -one of which just means a rope with a weight on the end- without banning, by the way, swords. Even in New York, where guns are allowed, nunchaku are still banned.</p>
<p>This fear of Asian culture similarly led to the promulgation of the myth that Asian food must be dangerous. MSG was spuriously identified as a health concern.</p>
<p>MSG is delicious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
