		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2011/09/26/140753048/kids-sugar-cravings-might-be-biological" target="_blank">Article worth reading about this</a></p>
<p>Scientific evidence shows that children not only have a stronger preference for sugar than adults – but that sweet-tooth is hardwired from Day One.</p>
<p>&quot;We know that the newborn can detect sweet and will actually prefer sweeter solutions to less sweet ones. The basic biology of the child is that they don't have to learn to like sweet or salt. It's there from before birth,&quot; explains Julie Mennella of the Monell Chemical Senses Center.</p>
<p>Unlike adults, who often find overly sugary things unpleasant, Mennella says kids are actually living in different sensory worlds than adults when it comes to basic tastes.</p>
<p>&quot;They prefer much more intense sweetness and saltiness than the adult, and it doesn't decrease until late adolescence. And we have some evidence they may be more sensitive to bitter taste,&quot; Mennella says.</p>
<p>A reason for this may be that a preference for sweet, caloric substances during rapid growth may have given children as an evolutionary advantage when calories were scarce. That notion is supported by the fact that sugar doesn't just taste good to children -– it actually makes them feel good, too.</p>
<p>Mennella's research has shown that sugar is a natural pain reliever in children, and many hospitals even put a sweet-tasting liquid in a baby's mouth during circumcisions or heel stick procedures to help lessen the pain.</p>
<p>When researchers gave adults and children water mixed with various amounts of sugar, adults preferred sugar concentrations similar to that of a can of soda, while finding higher concentrations too sweet. By comparison, children preferred at least twice that concentration, and younger children had virtually no limit.</p>
<p>&quot;You can keep putting sugar in to the point where you can't dissolve it in the water anymore and they still like it,&quot; says Sue Coldwell, a researcher at the University of Washington who has studied kids and sweets.</p>
<p>But there seems to be an age limit on the super-sized sugar preference.</p>
<p>Coldwell and her colleagues suspected that sugar preferences changed during adolescence. They checked a bunch of indicators, like body image and hormones, and then they checked bone growth. They gave the sugar-water test to adolescents while simultaneously measuring a marker of bone growth in their urine. What they found was that kids who were still growing preferred sweets. Those whose growth had already stopped –- around age 15 or 16 — had taste preferences similar to adults.</p>
<p>Exactly how this all works is still somewhat of a mystery, but Coldwell says that one important clue lies in the discovery that growing bones actually secrete hormones that can influence metabolism. Other well-known metabolic hormones like leptin and insulin have been shown to act on brain areas that control cravings and appetites, and even directly bind to the tongue, where they affect the preference for sweet tastes. Coldwell suspects that hormones from growing bones may be doing the same thing. In other words, it's not your kid's fault he raided the cookie jar – the hormones from his growing bones made him do it.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know for sure, but I am very suspicious that the bones are somehow telling either the brain or the tongue that there is energy needed for their growth and signaling for that preference to increase,&quot; says Coldwell.</p>
<p>That's not to say a kid can't overdo it. In a modern world of calorie overload and childhood obesity, cravings for sugar are no longer the evolutionary advantage they once might have once been. But if the goal is to get children to reduce their intake of sugar, researchers say understanding the biology behind their cravings is the first step.</p>
<p>TL:DR - They think we're genetically programmed to want sugar and that our intense childhood craving for sugar stops when our bones are finished growing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real question I have is why I, 35, haven't apparently discovered this. There are some sickeningly sweet artificial candies I don't like, but I'm a 2.5 spoons of sugar in my coffee kind of guy. It frankly <em>baffles</em> my mind that people not only drink but <em>choose</em> to drink dry red wines and pay a lot of money for the privilege. Same with most beers, which are bitter and utterly irredeemable to me.</p>
<p>I once went to a wine tasting with several friends my age, and we all got flights of red wines. There was one that all of them were cooing on about how good it was, whereas to me it tasted just as bitter and tongue-numbing as the other reds. I honest-to-God thought they were fucking with me.  One of those same friends frequently can't stand sweet drinks I like, such as a vanilla cream soda or similar.</p>
<p>So strange to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few theories. One is that children have less developed palates. Adults are able to appreciate the subtle and savory flavors of bitter foods. Kids dislike them because they can't taste the entire flavor profile, opting for simpler sweet foods. For adults, those sweet foods are overwhelming because they lack subtly. Another theory is that children crave sweets more because the body craves sugar when it's younger, at the point in development when humans need loads of diverse sugars.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In nature the most common sweet foods are fruits, which evolved to be sweet so animals eat them and spread seeds. Most bitter flavors in our food are produced by alkaloids, many of which are poisonous.  Therefore sweet foods are generally safer than bitter foods, because plants don't want to poison the animals that help them propagate.  Since children are smaller than adults and therefore can be poisoned more easily it makes sense for them to avoid bitter foods and be drawn to sweeter and therefore safer foods chemically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
