Can anyone explain how this doesn't cause major oral bleeding?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in the middle east and we were heavily ingrained with the culture of the region.<br />
So Camels actually have super thick lining the inside of their mouth which is more than substantial enough to eat and chew on Cacti, they basically chew until the spikes barely matter and their digestive systems are insane, their entire biology has been amazingly adapted to their environment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Some of the ones camels have are big and hard (partially keratinized) and protect their mouths from bleeding etc when they eat spiky things. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Basically they have finger-lips, take their time working around the spines and the tasty good bits inside are oh so worth the prickles: <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-are-camels-capable-of-eating-a-cactus" target="_blank">someone who sounds intelligent</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is particularly interesting because  camels are native to the old world, while cacti  are limited to the new world.</p>
<p>However, many old world desert plants have long spines.  And while modern camels are limited to the old world, their ancestors came from the Americas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
