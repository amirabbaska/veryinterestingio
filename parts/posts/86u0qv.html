		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>Because lemons and limes are crossbreeds that weren't actually a wild plant, and even if they weren't sweet, their ancestors still had sugars and that made them appealing for creatures to eat.</em></p>
<p>Most of the types of &quot;citrus&quot; plant that we grow and sell in produce sections now were crossbred from a mix of only a few original plants. Lemons come from &quot;Citron&quot;, a really thick-rinded fruit with a small but sweet pulpy core, and &quot;Bitter Orange&quot;, which is what it sounds like. Limes comes from a citrus-type tree called &quot;Micrantha&quot;.</p>
<p>But even so, just because they taste sour doesn't mean that animals won't eat and spread them. A lemon DOES have sugars and, in the same way we humans like a little bitterness, animals may appreciate it too. Food doesn't have to taste sweet to be extremely healthy and an easy source of calories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the citrus, like almost all agricultural products are the results of centuries of selective/cross/hybrid breeding. Limes and lemons did not exist in nature. Citrus products are the result of cross breeding of 4 different original species.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lemons and limes are sweet. They just also happen to be very sour. But if you didn't have sour taste buds, they would taste sweet. This is evidenced when you eat a &quot;miracle berry&quot;, then eat a lemon or lime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals actually like sour and sweet. Sour is how your tongue detects acid, which kills  many germs and fungi and small bacteria. We (probably) evolved to like sweet+sour more than pure sweet because purely sweet things are more likely to be contaminated. That's why so many human recipes call for sweet and sour combinations. Would you rather drink lemonade or sugary water? Less importantly, sour might also be an indicator of the presence of vitamin C or other nutrients.</p>
<p>From the fruit's perspective, it doesn't want to be infested by germs or fungi either. Fruits are picky about what eats them, and when. Fruits don't wanna be eaten at the wrong time or by the wrong creature. Often, fruits are extra sour or bitter when unripe, and turn sweet when ripe when they are ready to be eaten.</p>
<p>You can see this in practice in everyday life - notice how most vegetables and non-sour fruit such as cucumber need to go in the fridge to keep, whereas more sour fruits such as apples and oranges can keep outside?</p>
<p>Lemons and limes in particular are human bred to be particularly sour, but these would be the reasons the trait originally evolved for fruits in general.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
