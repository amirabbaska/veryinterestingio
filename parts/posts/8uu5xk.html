<p>Recall the definition of pH = -log10[H+]. That is, it's based on the concentration of protons/hydronium ions in solution. A pH -2 just means a [H+] = &quot;100M,&quot; which is a lot but is still possible. At this concentration, traditional acid-base chemistry changes a bit (considering pure water is 55M, and usually hydronium is a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of H2O + H+.).</p>
<p>The reverse is true for a high basic pH, considering the equilibrium with water.</p>
<p>1-14 is just for our convenience for most chemistries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it's important to recognize that pH is a mathematical term. literally means &quot;power of Hydrogen&quot; as in 10^X. since hydrogen is an atom usually associated with acidity (bronsted acid/base) that is what is measured. really an acid base reaction is just a redox reaction where electrons are exchanged. electrons often accompany a proton or another nucleus. </p>
<p>to simplify things pH = -log[H].  where [H] is the concentration of &quot;free&quot; hydrogens.  The brackets mean mole/liter but can just think of it as an amount per volume, mole being a shit ton because there is a lot of atoms in a liter of anything. so, if we have 5mole/liter of hydrogens in a solution then the pH is -0.7 so we see that the pH value is just a consequence of simplifying a large value down to a small number and the +/- aspect is indicating greater than or less than 1mole/liter. just a mathematical simplification with no other meaning. as you can see pH theoretically could be any value.  </p>
<p>The 1-14 range has to do with water as most pH measurements are done in water. when water is in a acidic/basic equilibrium it has a pH of 7. it's just the value that is mathematically associated with those concentrations and nothing more. at pH 1 there is 0.1mole/liter of hydrogens and next to zero of its other half (OH). at 14 it's the opposite. even more specifically why 14 is used is because there is a mathematical ratio for the separation of H2O -&gt; H + OH which is calculated Kw = [H][OH]  where Kw is usually 10^-14. so now you can see the pH = -log(10^(-14)) = 14. etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PH goes well beyond 1-14. 1-14 is roughly the range you'll see in normal life, with the strongest acids you encounter normally being things like stomach acid (which peaks at around 1) or battery acid (which is around 0), and the strongest bases you encounter normally being stuff like bleach (12.6) or lye (13.5). That's why many people think of that as the limits. Things like textbooks you saw as a kid would only show the examples around there, since beyond that it's not everyday comparisons anymore. </p>
<p>Concentrated sulfuric acid is around -3, and things beyond that are considered superacids. There are also superbases. The problem with the PH scale is that it breaks down beyond a certain point. If you go a few steps beyond 0, or above 14, it breaks down since it uses an oversimplified measurement. On the PH scale, things are measured by their impact on hydrogen ions. Acids give away hydrogen ions, and bases take them. The problem is, that breaks down. Acids also can be things that gain electrons easily. It also breaks down if an acid is giving up more hydrogen ions than there are other molecules in the solution. It also measures things as they are dissolved in water, but superbases are able to straight up take the protons out of the water, which kinda makes it so you can't dissolve it in water since it's no longer water at that point. </p>
<p>There's a scale for those, the PKa scale, but that ignores concentration so you can't see an acid of a particular rating destroy something and say that's what that rating does like you can with PH. There's another scale that's essentially equivalent to PH and shows what it would be if PH worked at that point, but I couldn't find a ton of examples of strengths on that scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
