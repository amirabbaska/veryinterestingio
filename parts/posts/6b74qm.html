		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The feeling of numbness and tingling you get is called paresthesia, and it can be caused by many things that involve both the central nervous system (Brain, brainstem and the spinal cord) and peripheral nervous system (The sensory and motor neurons carrying information to and from your muscles, skin and pretty much your whole body). In this case the paresthesia is caused by deprivation of blood supply to the peripheral nerves. Peripheral sensory and motor nerves are supplied by small vessels called Vasa nervorum. These small vessels are particularly susceptible to mechanical pressure. When a certain amount of pressure is applied for a prolonged period of time, blood flow to the peripheral nerve they supply is compromised. Nerves require a constant source of oxygen to carry on oxidative phosphorylation and produce the energy that is required for creating action potentials (impulses that travel down the nerve cell). When you cut the required oxygen off, the nerve cells cease to function until circulation is returned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A common cause of this is thoracic outlet syndrome or TOS, often caused by sleeping with your arm under your head. We covered it in massage school.  In the case of TOS, your ulna nerve gets pinched by the scalenes, peck minor, or clavicle and first rib.  It can cause loss of feeling in your arm, or more commonly numbness in the outside three fingers.  </p>
