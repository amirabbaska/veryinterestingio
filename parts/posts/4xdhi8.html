		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently read an article in a French science magazine stating that the universe might be an hypertorus (Euclidian, finite and borderless). They represented it using a cube in which when you exit through one side you actually come back in from the opposite one.</p>
<p>I made a drawing to make my question clearer : <a href="http://imgur.com/a/C84eq" target="_blank">Drawing</a></p>
<p><em>The three panels on the left represent the universe in 2D and when you move through a side you come back through the opposite one. The star is any star and the black dot represents the Earth. The arrow is the light emited from the star.</em></p>
<p><em>The three right panels represent what we see from the surface of the Earth.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first 2 pictures are straight-forward the star lits us directly and we see it in the sky as it was at the moment the light was emited</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the second line of the &quot;comic&quot; you can see the light traveling through the right side and coming back out of the left one and then hitting us. What we then see in the sky is a second star that appears to be way further than the first one and way older, when it is in fact the same one !</p>
</li>
<li>On the third line I was imagining a scenario where the light goes through the loop several times. We would then see the star as it was a very long time ago, or even maybe witness it's birth ?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To recap</strong></p>
<p>It sounds crazy but would it be possible that we see the same star at different moments of it's life span ?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>Christ this blew up over the week-end while I was away, I will try to read everything as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Also thank you for the gilding ! Even if I have no clue what it does, I feel like someone now !</p></div></div>

<p>Let's assume its true.  The cube with re-spawn on the other side (basically star fox multiplayer).</p>
<p>The first time the light from a star reaches you, it will have traveled simply the distance between you and the star.  The 2nd time it passes you, it will have traveled the distance between you and the star PLUS the length of the universe.  Since the 2nd is likely orders of magnitude larger, the lumonsity of the 2nd will be that much dimmer ie: likely on the order of a single photon per sq meter / year, or something absurd like that.</p>
<p>The photons aren't parallel, but near it, so over very large distances they slowly spread.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If that were the Universe's actual shape, and it were small enough and expanding slowly enough, yes, you could see the same star in multiple places and at multiple ages.</p>
<p>However, as I understand it, if this were true then the light from the Cosmic Microwave Background would form a sort of nonrandom striped or rippled pattern all across the sky. Not visible to human eyes, of course, but we have plenty of machines that can detect and map this light. No sign of such a pattern has been found, and so cosmologists strongly believe that the Universe is too large (possibly infinite) and expanding too quickly for the 'see the same star in different directions' thing to happen. I believe this holds for a number of models of the shape of an expanding universe, not just your hypertorus version.</p>
<p>With that being said, under certain conditions you can already see distant objects in two places at once due to gravitational lensing (which doesn't rely on how the Universe is joined onto itself at large scales). This doesn't happen with any of the stars you can see with your eyes because they are way too close and there are no objects around with strong enough gravity to generate the effect. But it can happen with very distant galaxies that are positioned behind nearer galaxies, because the effect becomes significant across those enormous distances. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Einstein_cross.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is a telescope photograph showing this in action; there are only two objects in the picture, the nearer one in the center and the farther one shown four times around it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
