		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your dry fingers have difficulty adhering to the smooth plastic. When you wet your finger, the water fills the spaces between your skin and the plastic bag. Water molecules are slightly bent, which means that they act a little bit like small magnets, with a small attractive force between them. This small attractive force (Van der Waals forces) causes the water to bond to both your fingers and to the bag, allowing you to grip it better. The forces in this case are small and the bag is light, so the force your hand apply is lower than the Van der Waals force.</p>
<p>When opening a jar, the Van der Waals force is still there, but you are applying a much larger force to try to open the jar. In this case, you grip the jar much harder, which increases the surface area contact and allows you to transmit the force from your hand to the jar and lid, hence opening it. When the jar and lid is wet, the water gets between your hand and the jar. Water is a fluid and cannot transmit shear force (the force of objects moving alongside one another), so your hand slips as soon as you apply a force greater than the Van Der Waals force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water naturally grips to things, especially stuff like plastic. If the bag was underwater it would be slippery and much harder, but with a small amount of water you can use that grippiness (called adhesion) to get a little more grab on the plastic. Another example of this is people who swipe their thumb across their lips before they separate two pieces of paper, it allows for more grip.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
