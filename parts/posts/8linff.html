<p>1.) Movies are recorded from a fixed camera angle for each shot. This means that 4000 pixels on screen are always 4000 pixels, regardless of how many objects you have in a shot or how close up you get to them.</p>
<p>2.) Video games are interactive 3d worlds that you can move 'through'. This means game designers need to find a way to make every object that you can conceivably get up close to, from the gun in your hand all the way to the tree on top of that far off mountain, look good up close. To exacerbate things further, the objects are 3d, which means that every surface needs to be covered with pixels even if you can't currently see it, because you 'might'.  </p>
<p>*There are things that can be done to help this, like 'streaming' textures in and out of 'memory' when you don't see them, but as a general rule, unless there's a load screen, everything you can see in the world that you can reach must have an ultra HD texture in case you get right up close to it. </p>
<p>**Second edit: A lot of ppl have been asking about how I got into the industry or got this particular job, and even suggested I do an ama so I think that's what I'll do.  That said, I'll give a brief summary here:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To be a game artist or 3d artist in general it helps 'a lot' to have a background in traditional art (drawing and painting mostly)  I got a 4 year degree in Illustration myself, but at least some training in the fundamentals is needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then you'll want to learn the tools and techniques specific to content creation for current games. This would include a suite of digital sculpting, modeling, and texturing tools, as well as a game 'engine' to bring all your content together.  ZBrush, 3dsMax or Maya, Photoshop, and Substance Suite are the current standard, and either Unreal or Unity for your engine.  I took a post grad in game art which can be helpful for those who learn better from a guided structure, but not mandatory as YouTube is full of good educational content, and there are numerous excellent online forums and programs taught by pros to choose from (Art Station is a must).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work work work on your portfolio. Look at the pros and see where the bar's set, then aim for that. Don't work in a bubble! Developing a critical eye for your own work is key, but in order to do that you need feedback from those with a keener eye than you, so post you work online and ask for critiques. The importance of this can't be over stated.</p>
</li>
<li>Apply EVERYWHERE at first (Only for entry level jobs of course).  We all have our dream companies and games, but we all gotta start somewhere, so don't be afraid to aim high but don't be too proud to aim low either. Getting your first job and getting your foot in the door is far more important, as it means you will be getting paid to gain valuable experience in the field. Think of it as the first step of your new career that will inevitably wind you up at Naughty Dog or Sony!</li>
</ol>
<p>Ok, that's it for now. Hope that satisfies!**</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>because texture in a game are applied to surfaces that can be viewed from as close by as the player wants.  </p>
<p>If you have a rock with a 64x64 texture, that looks great if the player is far away enough to make the rock only take up 48x48 pixels on screen.</p>
<p>But if the player walks up to said rock and looks closely at it, that rock might be filling the entire screen.</p>
<p>Then a 1920x1080 screen is being filled by a 64x64 texture.
That doesn't look very good.</p>
<p>So to conclude - it's because in a game the player has the freedom to look around and zoom in.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because real life is rendered in infinity x infinity, and then downscaled to 720x480. It's the same reason that supersampling on the ps4 pro typically looks better than just rendering in 1080p.</p>
<p>(For those that don't know, supersampling renders a scene in 4K and then downscales for a 1080p display. Results in a much better image and better draw distance than just rendering in 1080p)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are correlating two different things. Textures are not high in resolution for a realistic effect, though that helps. Cartoon games can also have high rez textures. Games try to please users with crisp and detailed worlds and characters so this means that textures need to be filled with these details.</p>
<p>A movie is realistic because of the art direction to put it this way. Look at the Hobbit movies. People say the CG is bad. It's actually not, however it's the cartoon art direction that is misleading them. The color palette and overall bloom makes everything look for kids and slightly off. The Lord of the Rings is gritty and has dark tones and this we usually correlate with realism. </p>
<p>Electronic Arts has some realistic games out of there and it's because of the art direction and not the resolution. It's in the chosen lighting and mood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
