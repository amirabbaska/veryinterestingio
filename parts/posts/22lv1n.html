		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking about the way we recreate images of dinosaurs based on their skeletons and other clues, but was wondering how it would hold up against animals with cartilaginous appendages.  There would obviously be clues (such as a gaping hole where the nose is) but I was curious whether they'd come up with a long, mostly-triangular nose like we have or whether it'd look more like Ralph Fiennes in Harry Potter (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/ocJCS1W.jpg" target="_blank">Voldemort</a>.</p>
<p>I suppose another way to ask this question is &quot;how do we account for cartilaginous appendages in trying to re-model extinct species&quot; or &quot;how accurately would we be able to model it with our current technology if we somehow didn't realize it was a human skull?&quot;</p>
<p>Thank you, and I apologize if I categorized this improperly.  I made a guess.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to share an example with dinosaurs, since you brought them upâ€” <em>we still don't actually know whether dinosaurs had lips or not.</em> (For reference for what I mean, here's a <a href="http://reptilespecialists.com/images/lizards/cayman_rock_comp.jpg" target="_blank">lizard</a> with lips and a <a href="http://www.neveryetmelted.com/wp-images/Crocodile.jpg" target="_blank">crocodile</a> without lips.)</p>
<p>Here's one velociraptor reconstruction where the teeth are <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DrXs4wA.jpg" target="_blank">covered by lips when the mouth is closed</a>, one with half-covering lips where the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rqMXbSP.jpg" target="_blank">teeth still stick out,</a> and then the full no-lips at all approach <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1472/901/1600/Kong%20Vastatosaurus%20rex%20bust.0.jpg" target="_blank">seen in King Kong.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://helix.northwestern.edu/article/paleoartists-see-bones-and-make-dinosaurs" target="_blank">Here's an article</a> which interviews paleoartists, people who reconstruct dinosaurs, and confirms that it's still just artist interpretation at this point, and we don't know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Lips are one of many 'gray areas' of interpretation, for which alternatives are freely expressed among the artists...&quot; Japanese artists seal the mouth while western artists tend to keep mouths open, like a crocodile who is constantly baring its teeth, said Tyler Keillor, a paleoartist and fossil preparator at Prof. Paul Sereno's lab at the University of Chicago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a really interesting article... just ignore the bit where they repeatedly call Komodo dragons &quot;kimono&quot; dragons...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They would probably just speculate.  Apparently &quot;shrink wrapped dinosaur syndrome&quot; is a thing where dinosaurs just look like they put skin on the bones.  There's a book someone made where they gave animals that are alive today the shrink wrapped treatment.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's assume all human representations were not available. No paintings, photographs, or statues. The only human remains were the type we currently find of other extinct species. </p>
<p>There are a few ways to determine skin and cartilage properties without resorting to a complete guess. For instance:</p>
<p>1) DNA. Yes, just like Jurassic Park. Depending on the distance of time between the species extinction and the discovery of the species, a genetic copy may be able to be made by introducing human DNA into a close relative and breeding successive generations until the &quot;new&quot; creature's genome matches 100% or as close as possible with the human genome.</p>
<p>2) Fossils. There have been extinct animals who in the right circumstances have had their skin, feathers, and cartilage fossilized. With these fossils it would be pretty easy to see the shape of a human nose or ear. Unfortunately for us, but fortunately for future anthropologists and archaeologists, many modern humans have been trapped in airless pockets of sediment which are perfect for this type of fossilization. Tsunamis, mud slides, floods, etc. can create the right environment to preserve soft tissue detail.

<p>3) Informed speculation is always an option. Given less than optimal fossil records, future discoverers can look at our nearest relatives to get a close idea of the shape of our ears and noses. Taking a look at the chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, or orangutan (The great apes), researchers could see the similarities in ear shape (which is very close to modern human ear shape) and nose shape (somewhat shorter and flatter than modern humans). With the similarities in shape noted by looking at our relatives, researchers could further refine their picture by adapting those shapes with the bone structure of modern humans found in fossils or bones. The nose ridge of the skull would suggest that our noses were narrower and protruded further out than our other ape cousins. </p>
<p>With any or a combination of these methods, future human researchers should be able to pin down a fairly accurate representation of human soft tissue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
