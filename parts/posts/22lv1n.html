		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking about the way we recreate images of dinosaurs based on their skeletons and other clues, but was wondering how it would hold up against animals with cartilaginous appendages.  There would obviously be clues (such as a gaping hole where the nose is) but I was curious whether they'd come up with a long, mostly-triangular nose like we have or whether it'd look more like Ralph Fiennes in Harry Potter (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/ocJCS1W.jpg" target="_blank">Voldemort</a>.</p>
<p>I suppose another way to ask this question is &quot;how do we account for cartilaginous appendages in trying to re-model extinct species&quot; or &quot;how accurately would we be able to model it with our current technology if we somehow didn't realize it was a human skull?&quot;</p>
<p>Thank you, and I apologize if I categorized this improperly.  I made a guess.</p></div></div>
