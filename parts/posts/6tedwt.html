So, do any of you guys know why particles have more energy when apart and how this results in those particles having more mass? Thanks.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is true if the particles have attractive interactions with one another. If you have two particles which interact via an attractive (negative) potential energy, then they will prefer to be close to each other to minimize the potential energy of the system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To paint a picture that might make more sense in your head, imagine to attractive particles close together, and then separate them. To separate them, you have to apply work (moving them against their mutual force). Because work is required for the separated configuration, it is of higher energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They (particles attracted to each other) have more energy when separated because the act of separating them requires energy - the force required to pull them apart times the distance they have traveled. The energy you apply adds to the potential energy of the two-particle system. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>if the 2 particles attract, they will pull on each other. Think about it as having the 2 being connected by a rubber band. When they are close, there's not a pull towards the middle, but you try to split apart those suckers, and SNAP! they crash back in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Binding Energy per Nucleon (BE/A) peaks at an atomic mass of 62. U-235 has a BE/A of approximately 7.6 MeV/amu. If you split that into 2 approximately equal fragments with 118 mass number, the BE/A of a 118 mass number is 8.5 Mev/amu. The binding energy is the energy required to break a nucleus up into its nucleons, where as a BE/A curve shows that you that when nuclei have an abundance of neutrons as heavy elements do, they are less stable having a lower binding energy per nucleon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
