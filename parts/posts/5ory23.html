<p>Best example that I've had so far are expansion of bread dough and expansion of the balloon w.r.t. how objects are moving away from each other. However, in all these scenarios there's constant energy applied i.e in case of bread dough the fermentation (or respective chemical reactions), in case of baloon some form of pump. What is this pump in case of universe which is facilitating the expansion?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question. Here's an analogy.</p>
<p>Imagine you throw a ball in the air - really, really hard. After the ball leaves your hand, it is moving up in the air. Now, if someone looks over and sees this ball flying up in the air they might ask &quot;How is that ball flying through the air on its own!?!?&quot; Of course, it is because you threw it!</p>
<p>This is exactly what happened with the Universe. Based on our current understanding of Cosmology, the Big Bang caused the Universe to begin expanding very rapidly. Why? That's a great question and still one of hot debate.</p>
<p>So what happens next? Well, in our ball analogy, the ball will slow down as it gets higher and higher due to the force of gravity of the Earth. This is exactly the same for the Universe. Due to the gravity of all the stuff in the Universe, the expansion of space slowed after the Big Bang. In fact, if the total mass density of the Universe was above some critical value, the Universe would eventually halt its expansion and begin contracting, just as the ball will eventually reach its highest point and start falling. </p>
<p>Perhaps the Universe did not have enough mass density to cause it to recollapse? Then what would happen? Well, that would be like if we threw the ball so hard that the force of gravity of the Earth could not stop it. The ball would slow down for a while, escape the Earth's gravity, then coast along forever.</p>
<p>These two ideas are summarized <a href="http://www.nat.vu.nl/~wimu/Varying-Constants-Pictures/Time-Scale-Universe.jpg" target="_blank">in this figure</a>. The x-axis is time, and the y-axis is called the &quot;scale factor&quot; which is a way of visualizing the size of the Universe. In our first example, we would be in a &quot;closed&quot; Universe where the Universe eventually re-collapses and we get a &quot;Big Crunch&quot;. The second example is like the &quot;Flat&quot; or &quot;Negative Curvature&quot; lines where the ball just coasts on forever.</p>
<p>You might have heard that the Universe is accelerating. That was one of the greatest discoveries of our time. Now we have a completely different scenario. Imagine if you threw up your ball, it went up and slowed down a bit, but then suddenly it started speeding up and flying higher and higher, faster and faster. You would assume some magical force is pushing the ball up, and you would be right! This seems to be what is happening in our Universe. We've given this mysterious force the name &quot;Dark Energy&quot;, and it is causing the Universe to accelerate! This is indicated by the &quot;Dark Energy&quot; curve on that graph.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another important concept to understand is that nothing in the universe is <em>traveling</em> faster than light. Galaxies moving away from us at 400,000,000 m/s aren't actually moving through space that fast. What is happening is the &quot;metric expansion of space time&quot;. In other words, space itself is what is growing. As an analogy, imagine a 4x4 grid that is 1&quot; per unit at t=0. You are at (0,0) and there is a planet at (2,2). We can see with the Pythagorean theorem that the distance to that point is sqrt(8) inches away. </p>
<p>Now, the way to think of metric expansion is that at time t=1s, you are still at (0,0) and the planet is still at (2,2). We would say that the planet isn't traveling right? But now our initial 4x4 grid is 2&quot; per unit. And our new distance is sqrt(32) inches away. The object is now 4 times further away, but its actual position on the grid is the same. What has changed is the <em>size of the grid (space) itself</em>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another question would be &quot;What is space in itself?&quot;. As both of this threads go, there is clear distinction of something and nothing (fx BB as singularity), so in my understanding space is &quot;something&quot;, rather than &quot;the nothing, in which other things exists and move&quot;, because the &quot;literally nothing&quot; was there around the singularity existed...</p>
