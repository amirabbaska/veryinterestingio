		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So when you're sick, your immune system makes these chemicals called cytokines before anything else. Cytokines are basically really tiny and smelly and stick to virus/bacteria cells so that bigger, badder immune cells can find them and wipe em out.</p>
<p>One common type of cytokine is called TNF (tumor necrosis factor). When you're sick, your body starts cranking out tons of TNF and other cytokines so it can start fighting the infection. When you're really really sick, TNF levels in your body get so high that levels in your taste buds start to warp your sense of taste and you taste bitterness more than other flavors. This can cause normal foods to taste gross until you fight off the infection.</p>
<p>This can also happen more often with upper respiratory tract infections, where more cytokines are floating around your nose/throat/mouth area than normal. Also, metallic taste is a known side effect of several medications so that could be adding to the effect. Taste is super complex though so there may be many factors adding to it, if anyone has more ideas I'd love to learn. I researched this after I got ultra sick one weekend and couldn't stand the taste of anything except gatorade and super salty crackers.</p>

<p>Edit: When I say smelly, I mean it as a metaphor for attractive to immune cells. TNF and cytokines are signalling molecules, they aren't literally smelly. Bad breath and other changes in personal odor when you're sick are due to a whole host of other factors like changes in oral and gut bacteria, diet, and composition of sweat as well as increased sweating due to fluctuations in body temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
