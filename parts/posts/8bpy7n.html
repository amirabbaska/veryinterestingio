		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, the way a battery works is there are 3 parts.  Two electrodes, a positive one, and a negative one, and a divider between the electrodes that insulates the two electrodes but allows ions (atoms or molecules with either extra electrons or a deficit of electrons compared to their protons) to pass from one terminal to another.</p>
<p>In an ELI5 sense, for every electron that leaves the battery, an equivalent amount of charge needs to cross the divider to maintain the voltage.  What happens is the rate of Ion movement isn't high enough with old batteries, but even though it isn't fast enough to maintain battery life, over time, it gets there and brings the voltage back up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The charge in a battery isn't entirely consistent throughout the battery. When you place a battery under load, the charge from around the electrodes depletes first, lowers the voltage, and can be low enough to cutoff. The higher charge disperses to the areas around the electrodes and the battery can work again.</p>
<p>It's like drinking a milkshake or slurpee through a straw. You can hit the bottom and get air while there is still shake in the cup. Then you wait a bit until the shake reaches the straw and you get a bit more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes, depending on the chemistry, batteries will &quot;recover&quot; a bit after discharging. The battery isn't completely empty, but is below the device's cut-off level. Once the battery recovers past this cut-off, it will work again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
