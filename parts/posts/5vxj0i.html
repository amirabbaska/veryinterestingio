		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_animal" target="_blank">social animals.</a></p>
<p>Tens of thousands of years ago our ancestors found there was a distinct survival advantage in working together in familial groups. As such, we gradually augmented our existing survival attributes with social behaviours that would cause us to stay together when under stress.</p>
<p>Facial expressions, grooming each others fur, crying, touching, vocalisations etc. All of these things help communicate individual feelings and establish social structures. When you are being hugged or touched, your brain is rewarding you for taking part in actions that will improve your overall survival chances by releasing Oxytocin to calm your nervous system.</p>
<p>Remember, you are a product of a very, VERY long and unbroken chain of surviving organisms, stretching back millions of years. The actions that kept you alive were rewarded with <em>pleasure</em> hormones (eating, drinking, bonding, fucking, hugging etc). The actions that reduced your chances are either not rewarded at all, or marked by an unpleasant sensation we call <em>pain</em>.</p>
<p>This is why most people get lonely when away from other people. You're reducing your survival chances and so your body is trying to compel you to return to your kind. And hugging feels so good because you're being rewarded for bonding with said kind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Evolution. Hugs cause our brain to release a chemical called oxytocin, otherwise known as the &quot;cuddle chemical&quot; because of the way it makes us feel. There's no way for us to be <em>sure</em> of the reasons for this reaction (it'd be like asking: &quot;Why do we have ten toes?&quot;), but we have some pretty good guesses. The pleasure we get encouraged us (as early humans) to be social, which as SovietWomble says, likely boosted our chances for survival enough that the trait won out.</p>
<p>About a week ago scientists reported that dogs have the same chemical release when we pet them: our touch makes them feel good. Apparently, when they stare happily at us, they're trying to provoke that feeling within us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Putting aside the social contact, many mammals (including humans) also like the sensation of being squeezed. I recommend Temple Grandin book &quot;Animals in Translation&quot;. She tells a story about building a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hug_machine" target="_blank">&quot;hug box&quot;</a> as a teenager and how the sensation of being squeezed was a huge stress relief. This is used on horses and cows, too, because it helps keep the animal calm while they have to get shots.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason it helps me so much is probably because my sadness stems from feeling lonely.  I'm 25 years old, kind, intelligent, relatively attractive, and make friends easily, but I've never cuddled with anyone before.  The only hugs I've had are the quick &quot;haven't seen you in a while friend&quot; hugs, but damn... best feeling in the world to me.  I guess I'm not sure exactly how to answer your question, but I can definitely confirm that it works.  If I had to choose between $100K, and cuddling with someone who actually wanted to/wasn't paid to, I'd go with the latter, zero hesitation.  Sorry for the depressing comment by the way.  Great question though!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
