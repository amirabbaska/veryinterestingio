		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the reasons posted above/below, zoning out is also advantageous. Zoning out puts you in some form of a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network" target="_blank">Default Mode Network</a>. During this time your brain is probably processing information and making new connections from a broader perspective based on recent input. Think of this like when you want to think something over and &quot;sleep on it&quot; and wake up with new insights, except it's happening while you are awake in a smaller form.</p>
<p>Perhaps my explanation is more about why we still have it than why it happens. </p>
<p>Edit: If you want to learn how to utilize the DMN to learn tough stuff more effectively I wrote a post a few weeks ago about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/5403p7/functional_versus_rewarding_break_activities/" target="_blank">using the DMN with break activities.</a></p>
<p>Real ELI5: My last explanation sucked, I'll let this video <a href="https://youtu.be/dzjsk5e7srI?t=68" target="_blank">do all the explaining</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A small amount of stimulation, such as heavy traffic, can put some people into a dissociative state. An individual in such a state may stare ahead blankly without processing what he sees. Being in a dissociative state while driving is known as &quot;highway hypnosis.&quot;
To achieve a dissociative state, the body releases opiates into the brain. Chronic dissociation limits perceptions and the ability to interact with others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have that too. In my case it is linked to my low level Aspergers syndrome, that nowadays is called high functioning autism. When my brain gets too much stimulation, it simply shuts down. For example, the missus and I went to the zoo recently. By the end of the day, we were eating a sandwich, and I went into my zone out. The missus calls this my blank tv screen, because I dont even blink and barely breathe anymore. It lasts untill she sees I am not there at the moment, and &quot;wakes me up&quot;. Doctor explained it as a self protection mechanism. When my brain gets too overwhelmed, it goes into safety mode. Running a CCleaner, and resetting me. Making me able to participate again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
