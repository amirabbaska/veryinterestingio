		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you can replace the word with “he”’ or “’she,” use who. If you can replace it with “him” or “her,” use whom. Or even easier, answer a question with those words.</p>
<p>Who would like some ice cream? He would like some ice cream.</p>
<p>To whom is that letter addressed? The letter is addressed to her.</p>
<p>Who would like some ice cream? Would he like some ice cream?</p>
<p>To whom is that letter addressed? Is that letter addressed to her?</p>
<p>Who/whom ate my sandwich?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try substituting “she” and “her”: </p>
<p>She ate my sandwich. Her ate my sandwich. “She” works and “her” doesn’t. That means the word you want is who.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who/whom should I talk to about labeling food in the refrigerator?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try substituting “he” and “him”: </p>
<p>I should talk to he. I should talk to him. “Him” works, so the word you need is whom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond ELI5, but the technical definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who should be used to refer to the subject of a sentence </p>
<p>Whom should be used to refer to the object of a verb or preposition.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine replacing it with a third-person pronoun, as if you were talking about a known person.  You might have to change the order of words, especially when the phrase you're wondering about is a question, but it'll still show you <em>which</em> word is right.</p>
<p>Where you'd use <em>he</em> or <em>she</em>, it's <em>who</em>.  Where you'd use <em>him</em> or <em>her</em>, it's <em>whom</em>.  For <em>his</em>-or-<em>her</em> and <em>his</em>-or-<em>hers</em> it's &quot;whose&quot;, but that's kinda beside the point.</p>
<p>Examples of the process:</p>
<p>&quot;[?] are they&quot;? -&gt; &quot;<em>He</em> is ...&quot; so &quot;<em>Who</em> are they&quot;?</p>
<p>&quot;[?] did you go with?&quot; -&gt; &quot;You went with <em>her</em>&quot; so &quot;<em>Whom</em> did you go with?&quot; (but this sounds a little clunky, and most people would accept <em>who</em>.  If you rephrased it in a pickier way, as &quot;with <em>whom</em> did you go?&quot;, practically nobody would accept <em>who</em>)</p>
<p>We can go into the technical terminology if you like, but this is ELI5 so I thought I'd start with the answer that people know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I love this. An easy way to check is to slightly modify the sentence and replace the who/whom with either he or him. If you require a him(note the M) then you need to use whom(M!). If you require a he, then you use who.</p>
<p>First an example for whom: &quot;With whom am I traveling?&quot;
You wouldn't say &quot;I am traveling with he.&quot; You'd use him, right? so you know it must be whom.</p>
<p>For who: &quot;Who is there?&quot;
You wouldn't say &quot;Him is there.&quot; You'd say &quot;He is there.&quot; so you know to use who.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>as others have stated if you can replace it with he/she, use who, him/her is whom</p>
<p>however the REAL answer is that as english has evolved, who has beome acceptable to use in all cases, and the &quot;who/whom&quot; police are generally regarded as annoying and insufferable. </p>
<p>they're not the same as grammar police, they specifically like to wait for moments to point out who/whom &quot;corrections&quot; whenever possible. but what they don't realize is that everyone hates them, and it's okay to just say say &quot;who&quot;</p>
<p>(i mean that. english is evolving to lose pronoun cases. whom is becomming an obsolete word. in casual conversations it's generally always considered ok to use &quot;who&quot; in either case....however you CANNOT use &quot;whom&quot; in both cases.</p>
<p>this presents a few issues about the word.</p>
<p>1) if you never use, you'll never have to worry about using it incorrectly.</p>
<p>2) 90% of the time people try to use &quot;whom&quot; in casual conversations they are using it incorrectly and they sound like pretentious idiots. you can avoid that by just not using it at all. everyone will always understand you for saying &quot;who&quot; in casual conversations.</p>
<p>3) that being said.. casual writing and convos &quot;who&quot; is always fine. they say you SHOULD use whom when possible in formal writing. but if you're using it make sure you use it correctly. it doesn't have the same interchangeability that &quot;who&quot; does... you sound dumb if you use &quot;whom&quot; in the wrong context. when in doubt, just say &quot;who&quot;.</p>
<p>but it's getting to the point where it's being phased out and eventually no one will say it anymore. (english does evolve over time, just like every language.  like i said we're phasing out pronoun cases.. and whom is the next to go.)</p>
<p>whatever you do, don't be a &quot;who/whom&quot; policeman in casual conversations or all your friends will hate you lol.</p>
<p>as you can tell from my post i'm starting a movement to phase out capital letters next. who's with me?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
