		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Competitive breath-hold divers (and synchronised swimmers!) are better at conserving oxygen than untrained people. All mammals have something called the mammalian dive response (MDR), which you can think of like fuel economy mode: when we hold our breath, especially in water, it triggers our bodies to go into a &quot;save oxygen&quot; mode. It does a lot of things like slow heart rate, change muscle metabolism to anaerobic and other superhuman-y stuff. The neat thing about MDR is that you can train it to be stronger, just like you would lift weights for muscles. This means the world's best apnea divers actually have no changes in the oxygen level in their body after a 5-6 minute breath-hold. </p>
<p>The 22 minute hold (actually the current Guinness oxygen world record is 23 minutes from Croatian Goran Colak) was done on pure oxygen. The person saturates their system with pure oxygen (normal air only has ~21%) beforehand which means that they have more oxygen stores in their blood. The best performances without pure oxygen are 10-12 minutes.  </p>
<p>People usually refer to brain damage from hypoxia in the context of hospital emergency, e.g. someone's heart stopping - it's not the same thing. Doing a maximum breath-hold you are starting with a normal, healthy body, and you have the MDR adaptations conserving oxygen use and protecting you from brain damage. One of the most important is increased blood flow in your brain, meaning that even as the oxygen levels in your body fall, your brain stays at near normal levels of oxygen, for almost the whole time. if you do hold too long, blacking out from breath-hold (in humans) is actually another protective mechanism. Our brains use &gt;20% of our body's oxygen stores, and shutting off the conscious part of the brain buys us extra time, at least 3-4 minutes (after blacking out), before we are placing our brain or vitals under threat from low oxygen. In competition diving you are disqualified if you are too hypoxic, and waaaay disqualified if you black out!</p>
<p>People don't immediately go out and do these huge performances - it takes years of training, and the sport (which is AWESOME, by the way) has really strict safety protocols. The most important one is always do breath-hold with a buddy who watches you like a hawk. Loss of consciousness is a risk - as I said, it's not the end of the world if you have a buddy there, but fatal if you're alone in the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The air you inhale is ~21% Oxygen the air you exhale is 13-16% oxygen, Hold your breath for 60 seconds with a blood oxygen meter on and you find that there is zero change in the amount of oxygen your blood is carrying. Hold for another minute and your blood oxygen level will only drop a few percent. The urge to breath becomes intense very quickly because your body doesn't actually have anyway to sense the amount of oxygen in your blood but rather senses the build up of CO2, as your oxygen level drops your body will start to restrict blood flow to the extremities this (not the actual lack of oxygen) is what causes your fingers or lips to tingle when you are extremely out of breath. </p>
<p>Your body can also power many systems anaerobically (without oxygen) your muscles can use more energy less efficiently and with more waste (lactic acid) for quite some time the only vital part of you that lacks this ability is your brain. Now all this adds up to the ability to hold your breath for about 7 or 8 minutes with proper training, the record you are referring too is a pure O2 record where the diver holds their breath after breathing pure medical grade oxygen which again doesn't reduce the feeling of needing to breath at all but does allow you to hold much longer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many many factors that go into this. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Brain damage occurs quicker if there is no blood flow. Oxygen plays a big part in this but it's what supplies the brain with oxygen, that's more important. The blood flow also carries the waste or bad content (I.e. carbon dioxide) away, allowing the brain to continue using up oxygen to make energy and keep on living. So the function of the heart, as well as the patency (sp?) Of the blood vessels is of utmost importance here. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lung's capacity also plays into it. While most adults have an equal amount of lung volume, some will still have more capacity than others. We use different terminology in medicine to explain volumes and capacity in the lungs, however, that would take me forever to explain it here. The most important one to know in this case is FRC, which is functional residual capacity. Basically, this is the amount of air that remains in the lungs once someone exhales regularly. This may not sound important, but in reality, it could be the difference between life and death if someone were to pass out and stop breathing. Babies/children have less FRC, as well as patients with COPD for example. Then there's also TLC, or total lung capacity, which is the total volume of a person's lungs if they were to inhale using all their strength. That also varies from person to person dramatically depending on their physical conditioning and strength. </p>
</li>
<li>Another factor is metabolic demand and metabolic activity. The brain receives a huge chunk of our body's blood supply, that's mainly due to the high metabolic activity. The brain needs constant oxygen and sugar because it doesn't carry much reserve, if any. So the neurons die quicker.  However, there are ways to decrease metabolic activity. In medicine, cooling the body helps decrease oxygen requirements/demand, therefore helping us theoretically keep a patients brain alive be slowing it's metabolic demand. This also works by slowing metabolic activity of other organs, which leaves more oxygen available for the brain.  This is how we keep patients alive during cardiac surgeries, by supplying cold blood flow. As a side note, babies use up oxygen twice as fast as adults. </li>
</ol>
<p>Those are the big points, but there are many other smaller things to consider such as physical condition of the person, genetic makeup that always one person to tolerate more carbon dioxide buildup, etc. I hope those helped. I could spend hours talking about this. I love answering medical questions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I'm surprised that no one has answered the time difference between the two. Everyone concetrated on the breath holding, no one actually answered why the times are different.</p>
<p>The fact that you start getting brain damage after 6 minutes is because there is no blood circulation. You actually have lots of oxygen stored in the blood inside your arms+legs etc. that, during a cardiac arrest, won't be used by anything other than your brain (i'm exaggerating a bit here) since the rest of your body is at a stand-still.</p>
<p>The blood in your brain won't get exchanged since the heart isn't beating (cardiac arrest). So there's very little blood + oxygen there. Meanwhile there's a ton of oxygen stored in the blood inside your arms + legs etc. </p>
<p>This is the reason you do CPR. You start up blood circulation so the oxygen that hasn't been used up from your arms + legs (since you're lying on the floor, not moving :P) can reach your brain and help it survive. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the breath holding world record was done with a beating heart (i hope) so that is similar to what we try in CPR.</p>
