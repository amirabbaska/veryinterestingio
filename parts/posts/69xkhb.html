		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is we are not sure and there are many theories</p>
<p>Goose bumps start in the part of the body called the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system sends signals from your brain to your skin. Goose bumps usually happen when you get cold or feel certain powerful emotions, such as fear.</p>
<p>When you feel certain powerful emotions, a part of your brain called the hypothalamus sends a message via your nerves to the muscles in your skin to tighten up. When the skin on your body gets tight, your hairs stand on end and goose bumps form.</p>
<p><strong>You're probably still wondering exactly how goose bumps are related to music.</strong> As you may have experienced before, goose bumps can occur when you hear a love song, a classic song, or a passionate version of the Star Spangled Banner.</p>
<p>A theory about why people get goose bumps from music is that  People can feel intense emotions, like sadness and passion. When people feel strong emotions, their brains release the same chemicals that tell the skin to form goose bumps.</p>
<p><em>More details for nerd 5 year old -</em> </p>
<p>About 50 percent of people get chills when listening to music. <a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n2/abs/nn.2726.html" target="_blank">Research shows</a> that’s because music stimulates an ancient reward pathway in the brain, encouraging dopamine to flood the striatum—a part of the forebrain activated by addiction, reward, and motivation. Music, it seems, may affect our brains the same way that sex, gambling, and potato chips do.</p>
<p>Strangely, those dopamine levels can peak several seconds before the song’s special moment. That’s because your brain is a good listener—it’s constantly predicting what’s going to happen next. (Evolutionarily speaking, it’s a handy habit to have. Making good predictions is essential for survival.)</p>
<p>But music is tricky. It can be unpredictable, teasing our brains and keeping those dopamine triggers guessing. And that’s where the chills may come in. Because when you finally hear that long awaited chord, the striatum sighs with dopamine-soaked satisfaction and—BAM—you get the chills. The greater the build-up, the greater the chill.</p>
<p>You can feel chills from any genre, whether it’s Mozart, Madonna, tango, or techno. It’s the structure—not the style—that counts. Goosebumps most often occur when something unexpected happens: A new instrument enters, the form shifts, the volume suddenly dims. It’s all about the element of surprise.</p>
<p><strong>But there are competing theories.</strong> Neuroscientist <a href="http://www.sensoryresearch.net/misc/EmotionalSourcesOfChillsInducedByMusic.pdf" target="_blank">Jaak Panksepp</a>, for example, discovered that sad music triggers chills more often than happy music. He argues that a melancholy tune activates an ancient, chill-inducing mechanism—a distress response our ancestors felt when separated from family. When a ballad makes us feel nostalgic or wistful, that evolutionary design kicks into gear.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's depends on the person, but I recently read a study about people who get intensely pleasurable experiences, like &quot;chills&quot;, from listening to music. They noted that when this happened, the same parts of the brain are active that 'rewards' itself by releasing dopamine from things such as sex, eating, and even opiates.<br />
<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/98/20/11818.full" target="_blank">Here</a> is a link to that study, for the curious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with excitement and happiness. Which release a whole host chemicals related to a relatively primitive fight or flight response. Your Lizard brain doesn't know it's music you're listening to. It just knows your more advanced cerebral brain is getting exited based on physiological connections you've made to a soothing singing voice, or a certain song that triggers an emotion in you psychologically. This in turn causes the release of serotonin, Oxycontin, adrenaline, and dopamine, that triggers an ancient survival function that served duel purposes of warmth and visual deterrent ( like making ones self bigger to scare the woolly mammoth)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sumit316 covered the main points. The reason powerful emotions lead to horripilation (goosebumps) is yet unknown. Most behaviors we know play a role in our fitness to some degree, but why then do we cry when we are sad or even joyful? Why do we experience horripilation when we hear good music? We as humans have yet to understand why we experience certain sensations under paradoxical conditions or due to seemingly unrelated causes, but given the interconnected complexity of our peripheral and central nervous systems, the majority of theories explaining these phenomena can be found there. </p>
<p>Our brain is a processing and storage unit that is connected to the outside world via our body and that can influence our body's interaction with the outside world via the peripheral nervous system. Due to their intensely connected nature (for example damage to area of the brain can cause all sorts of sensation or motion impairment, from blindness to paralysis to involuntary movements like in Tourett's syndrome), it is not surprising to find these mechanisms in our nervous systems that we have established are part of certain behaviors, but are also seen at work in unexpected ways. Maybe one day we can understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
