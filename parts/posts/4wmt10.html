		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kung Fu is chinese for what literally amounts to Hard Work.  Anything can be Kung Fu, from martial arts, to being a surgeon, to otherwise.  In general, its used as an umbrella term for most of the Shaolin martial arts.</p>
<p>Karate is a term that today means 'empty hand,' but when it was first introduced to Japan, it meant 'foreign hand,' as it came from Okinawa, and before that, it can be traced back to China, with much of it coming from the shaolin temple.  As such, many techniques in Okinawan Karatejutsu have similarities to Shaolin styles.  Karate today is taught in different styles, but it basically revolves around striking, grappling and chin na (pressure point techniques/eye gouges, etc.)</p>
<p>Jujutsu literally means &quot;Gentle techniques.&quot;  It is called that, because jujutsu is very easy for the user to execute, but devastating for the opponent.  Samurai jujutsu is the predecessor of Judo, Aikido and Aikijujutsu. Jujutsu is the art from which most of the submission techniques originate, but is meant for unarmed defense against an armed opponent.  Judo is jujutsu but with the majority of the lethal techniques removed, and some more emphasis added on non-damaging submissions.  Only Judo, Brazilian jujutsu and other sport forms forego teaching defense against an armed assailant.  </p>
<p>Aikijujutsu originated from jujutsu, but changed dramatically as it was taught, and most techniques I've been exposed to use a person's own energy against them.  <del>Aikido is the tournament form of Aikijujutsu, and has some of the more lethal techniques removed.</del>  Many comments below correct me on Aiki, so I graciously concede to them.</p>
<p>Tae Kwan Do is similar to karatejutsu in that a lot of it has been altered from the original towards what we have today which is a lot of footwork based martial arts involving almost exclusively kicking or less handwork.  Older forms of TKD are strikingly similar to Okinawan karatejutsu and Shaolin kung fu.  </p>
<p>Ninjutsu is basically a combination of Samurai jujutsu, some forms of striking techniques based off of jujutsu, and specialized stealth techniques involving distractions, using teamwork for traps, and assassination.  Ninja often used traps like hornet nests stuffed in jars to be thrown at pursuers, knives, or even had women working as geisha use their hairpins in order to dispatch targets.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of them have different origins and all have different focuses.</p>
<p>Karate is about strikes with hands, feet, elbows and knees (as well as some grapples).</p>
<p>Judo is mostly about throws and takedowns.</p>
<p>Kung Fu is an umbrella term for any Chinese Martial art.</p>
<p>Ninjitsu is about striking pressure points and sensitive areas.</p>
<p>Jiu Jitsu is about trapping, locking, takedowns, etc.</p>
<p>Tae Kwan Do is about striking and kicking.</p>
<p>Aikido is about turning the momentum of the attacks of your opponent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Outside of Tae Kwon Do and Kung Fu (Actually Gung Fu) being of different countries, as otherwise explained, you'll find a lot of similarities between the rest.</p>
<p>Ninjutsu (jitsu is a weak transliteration, should be jutsu, which generally means &quot;technique&quot;, or &quot;ninja technique&quot; in this context, the term &quot;ninja&quot; being rather hard to pin down as it originates in shinobi, and on and on) is going to be the most readily unique among other arts, because it is somewhat specialized.  I'm unfamiliar with it, as it's kind of one of those &quot;weeaboo&quot; things that you hear more boasting about than ever see real evidence.</p>
<p>Judo and Jujutsu (&quot;correct&quot; of jiu jitsu) have the same root form of &quot;ju&quot;, where -do and -jutsu describe the school of thought or ethos behind it, -do being &quot;the way&quot; and -jutsu being &quot;technique&quot;, but it doesn't always hold storngly.  Judo is largely the sport practice of Jujutsu (not to be confused to Brazillian &quot;Jiu Jitsu&quot; or BJJ, which is its own school of techniques that originated with Jujutsu and were otherwise &quot;battle tested&quot; and refined in MMA) are very much about grapples, throws, submission holds, and other &quot;body&quot; control actions.</p>
<p>Karate, conversely, far more focuses on strikes over the rest.  Otherwise, you will see a lot of overlap in the techniques between them.  The prototypical karate punch is seen in jujutsu.</p>
<p>Aikido is one of the most &quot;convoluted&quot; of the ones you've put here, because it has a long history.  The root art &quot;Daito ryu aikijutsu&quot;, which was basically the martial art supplement to the Katana (daito being another common name for what we frequently refer to as a katana), and Aikido started from this common practice and blended it with many other martial arts to form a strong basis of fundamental defensive techniques.  However, this particular style still shares roots with jujutsu, so you'll still see a lot of those things, but you'll also see a lot more </p>
<p>Where aikido becomes a bit more unique is that it is firmly in the &quot;-do&quot; category of arts.  Aiki, meaning balance in this context, forms &quot;the way of balance&quot;, and the teachings of the arts are the redirection of momentum and intent to subvert situations.  When someone attacks you, it is their commitment to the act which gives you the most power to act against them.</p>
<p>It's a lot of talk, but it's all sound by kinetics, they just organize it in ways that some people hype it up.  But using these techniques, the idea is to, fundamentally, diffuse a conflict by using very little energy and effort to use the energy given to you by an attack to end the conflict.  (From experience, it is far more tiring to be the attacker than the Aikidoka, by a wide margin.  10v1, you'll have 10 attackers panting while the defender might have a light sweat at best.</p>
<p>However, the technique is very much taught with the ideal of stopping a fight as simply as possible, with as little effort as possible, and as a way to &quot;explain to the defeated the error of their ways&quot; by allowing you a literal 0 effort pinning technique (except against the most absurdly strong).</p>
<p>There's a lot of mystic bullshit around the art, such as Ueshiba Sensei (the founder) being able to dodge bullets by reacting to the light flash from the gun, but the techniques are sound.</p>
<p>If you want other comparisons, I suggest actually reading up on them, or watching them in competition or demonstration.  TKD is commonly known to be heavy on kicks, and is similar but distinct from Muay Thai.  Of which you can actually find breakdowns of a Muay Thai kick (power over speed) and a Karate kick (speed over power).</p>
<p>Kung Fu is basically just Chinese for &quot;martial arts&quot; so you'll have to look deeper into that.  Tai Chi has a really interesting history, and is really cool in that it's frequently practiced for the purposes of health and meditation, but you can just speed up the movements to make them combat worthy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aight motherfuckers, I've been doing martial arts for a few years and I've tried a lot of different things and I'll tell you what each one is <em>actually</em> like. </p>
<p>Karate: There are a bunch of different kinds of Karate. Most forms of Karate treat your hands as if they are blades, and consider landing a strike on an opponent a kill, which seems like a good idea until you realize that makes karate tournaments aggressive games of tag instead of fighting. </p>
<p>Kyokushin Karate was invented by a crazy Japanese cult leader guy in the 60's. They broke from the tradition of angry tag and decided they wanted to fuck each other up as much as they possibly could without punching each other in the head for some reason. This means their way of fighting revolves around standing as close to each other as possible and punching each other in the body constantly until someone kicks Someone in the head from like two inches away. It's awesome and frankly kind of stupid because head punches are something you should probably learn how to deal with in your martial art, but they invented a kick called ROLLING THUNDER which is just a weaponized front flip so I love them.</p>
<p>Judo: Judo started as a way to preserve empty handed samurai techniques from the rapidly dying Japanese Jiu Jitsu, but when wrestlers started kicking all their asses in their own competitions they decided to change the rules so you couldn't grab someones pants anymore, which put the emphasis on throws that they wanted but also made it so they don't train how to deal with wrestlers, so it made their martial art worse as a whole. They're still really good at throwing people, but worse at the other parts of grappling.</p>
<p>Kung Fu was all fucked up by the Communist Revaluation in China and most of the legitimate stuff is only taught to Chinese people in Hong Kong. If you learned Kung Fu in the states you probably got good at throwing two kicks and then learned terrible habits for the entire rest of any kind of fighting. Wing Chun is often mistaken as a martial art, and is actually an ancient Chinese form of patty cake. If you saw Ip man 2 and you think can chain punch a boxer and win, please try it and get it on film.</p>
<p>Ninjitsu is that shit they do on Naruto, if you see someone doing it in real life point and laugh. If a Wing Chun practitioner and a Ninjitsu master get put in a ring together the fight is often decided by whos trapper keeper has a more badass picture of a dragon on it.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of Jiu Jitsu. Japanese Jiu Jitsu was the martial arts learned by the samurai to kill each other. It involves weapons, eye pokes, and joint locks and chokes that were designed to hurt somoene in full armor because punching them wouldn't do much. If a gym outside of Japan says they do this they're probably lying.</p>
<p>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu was developed as a self defense system by the weird cult that is the Gracie family. Really it's just Judo with an emphasis on ground fighting, submissions and being able to fight off your back instead of throws. They aren't afraid of tuching each others pants though so they don't get raped by wrestlers and actually learn how takedowns and clinching without the gi works. Expect the person you roll with to be high as fuck. </p>
<p>Tae kwan do is a testament to how much Koreans hate the Japanese. They took Karate, and then made it about how to throw every kick ever. Tae kwan do gyms are notorious for being Mcdojos though, so if  they advertise how much discipline your kid will learn by throwing a shitty front kick and charge you fifty bucks a belt run in the other direction. </p>
<p>Aikido, often mistaken for a martial art, is an indoctrination system for Japanese culture. You'll learn how to do flips for no reason when Sensei does a standing wristlock to you instead of just pulling your hand back like a sane person. If you try to use Aikido in a fight against an awake opponent you will probably get hurt really badly because they won't do flips like they're supposed to. Steven Seagull is the Donald Trump of martial arts. </p>
<p>Krav Maga was invented by the Jews in the 50's to beat up Palestinians, and is the martial art you learn when you want to feel superior to everyone else and still be bad at fighting. You'll learn how to knee someone in the head fifty times and poke their eyes out, but as soon as a wrestler double legs your ass you'll start complaining about how if you had a knife they'd be dead already and if you go to the ground in a street fight you automatically die because the floor is lava. The best strategy to beat a Krav Maga practitioner standing up is to punch them really hard in the face because they can't spar without instantly murdering anyone so most of them have no idea how to fight at all. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you want a slightly different view, from an MMA fighter, here it is. I'd like to stress this is from my experience as an MMA fighter and as a martial arts practitioner. Nothing more or less.</p>
<p>A lot of 'traditional' martial arts aren't really that effective as a fighting style. They're more of an art or a sport rather than an effective means of hand to hand combat. Of course they do have some good techniques and skills, but generally, a decent rule of thumb is if it's not used in MMA, it's probably not that legitimate. </p>
<p>Essentially, what you'll see in MMA is different forms of wrestling, grappling martial arts, and kickboxing variants. Personally, what I train in is BJJ, (arguably the most effective form of unarmed self defense. takes opponents to the ground and works for submissions.) judo, (japanese martial art that involves throws) muay thai, (thailand kickboxing) and wrestling. (the thing you see in high school sports.)</p>
<p>Karate is essentially some kickboxing with some limited grappling. Not super effective as a main fighting style, but does have some good techniques. More of a 'traditional' or 'sporty' martial art. I will say though, I got seriously fucked up by a kyokushin karate guy in training. Those head kicks are fuckin gnarly. </p>
<p>Judo is grappling from the standing position with very quick submissions after you have thrown the enemy.</p>
<p>Kung Fu is a really broad spectrum with a lot of very unique styles within it. Basically anything from China. A LOT of this is either ineffective or mystical crap shelled out by McDojos.</p>
<p>Ninjitsu, is sadly, a lost art. No one can truly replicate ninjitsu because it was such a broad combat style, and ninjas were secretive. As well as being secretive, they were also often poor and weren't the most well documented bunch. Ninjitsu included stealth, deception, using tools, weapons, assassination, hand to hand combat designed to quickly incapacitate foes, infiltration, etc. If you see anywhere offering to teach ninjitsu its 100% crap. The ninjas are long gone and ninjitsu with them.</p>
<p>Jiujitsu, in the traditional sense, is a Japaneses grappling martial art based off of judo. To be honest I dont know <em>that</em> much about japanese jiujitsu. However, brazilian jiujitsu, jiujitsus more modern cousin, I know <em>a lot</em> about. It was basically invented by the gracie family to be a very efficient way of grapping. BJJ is arguably the most effective form of hand to hand self defense, and literally every MMA fighter has to know at least some BJJ to not be beaten by it. It is the premiere ground fighting martial art.</p>
<p>TDK is mostly focused on kicks. It has been seriously sportified and isnt really effective as a whole, but there are some very good kicks in there. </p>
<p>Aikido is mostly a bunch of throws and locks that look really cool, but in practice aren't that effective. Their training is basically them letting eachother throw them but any proficient grappler shouldnt have any trouble vs them.</p>
<p>That's just my 2 cents on martial arts. I'm an MMA fighter and I like getting my head punched in. To anyone who got mad at me because you train something that I called not very effective; I'm sure you're a taekwondo ninjitsu kung fu assassin master who can beat me up and kill me with a touch to the forehead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
