If someone receives a heart transplant or another transplant as a child, does the received organ grow with the child? Or does it stay the same size as it’s a foreign body and they need to receive and adult one later on? Or is it the same size anyway?</p></div></div>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The transplanted organs will grow appropriately with the child as they age as they would have in the donor's body as is governed by the normal cell's cycle and physiologic changes.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, life expectency for a heart transplant is rather short, 10-15 years in adults. </p>
