<p>The current President is immune to ethics laws because the majority party at the moment (the Republicans) aren't holding him to those ethics laws.</p>
<p>Simply put: right now, they're a police officer who's blatantly looking the other way as someone's getting mugged.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When Congress made these laws, they likely wanted to avoid direct conflict between the branches and the Constitutional problems it might create -- you can imagine an unscrupulous Congress using conflict of interest rules to launch baseless attacks against the president.  It never really was an issue, because every president before Trump has acted as if the rules applied to them, both to avoid political problems and because people who run for president generally have an inherent belief in the country and its institutions.  By leaving the president and vice president out, you avoid having to answer some tricky questions about separation of powers that might tie up the law in court.</p>
<p>But now we're in an unusual situation where the president seems indifferent to ethics norms, and there aren't really any mechanisms to constrain him if Congress abdicates is responsibility as a coequal branch of government.  Buckle your seat belts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If politicians weren't immune from the same laws that government regular citizens, then these laws could be used to game the system. For example, if the police were allowed to detain politicians for question, then they would simply stop their political opponents, delaying them long enough to ensure they missed their chance to vote.</p>
<p>So it's the same with ethics laws. If you allow people to challenge someone for everything they do as an ethics violation, then he will be tied up in court all day answering to these charges and unable to perform his duties. </p>
<p>I mean that's what we're talking about here after all. You're asking how there might be a way to stymie Trump for the next four years by tying him up in court 24/7. Now you might think you're being clever, but you have to remember that when the shoe is on the other foot, your opponents will do the same exact thing to you. </p>
<p>Think of it in the context of executive orders. You hate these things so much when Trump uses, but you never gave a second thought to them before when Obama was doing them. So in this same way, be careful what you wish for, because you might just get it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one is actually stating what should be obvious, our current president is <strong>not</strong> in violation of the Ethics in Government Act. There are only two reasons you would think he would be in violation: you think the act has some generally ethical clause in it, or you think Trump has not disclosed his financial reports.</p>
<p><em>Option 1: you think the act has some generally ethical clause in it.</em> The Ethics in Government Act covers the disclosure of financial reports, a few other technical things, and establishes oversight of this process. That's it. It in no ways says things like &quot;The president must be ethical&quot;. This act is solely about financial disclosure, nothing else. Speaking of that...</p>
<p><em>Option 2: you think Trump has not disclosed his financial reports.</em> Well guess what, he has. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2838696-Trump-2016-Financial-Disclosure.html" target="_blank">Here</a> it is, go read it yourself.</p>
<p>You may have heard that Trump has been refusing to release his tax returns. That is correct, he has refused to do that even though most other Presidents have. <em>But</em> that is not legally required. Trump has done everything he legally had to do to disclose his finances, thus he is not in violation of the Ethics in Government act.</p>
<p>Hopefully that makes sense to you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ethics in government law is fairly limited in what it does. </p>
<p>Also, in a fight between the president and Congress, the constitution is the controlling document. That has supremacy in how things get handled. The Constitution allows impeachment for &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; and it also allows for significant Congressional oversight - if they choose to exercise it. </p>
<p>They are not choosing to exercise it. Congress has the power. It's just not using it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
