		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>when you exercise your whole cardio vascular (heart,lungs and arteries and veins) system adjusts to get more oxygen into your muscles, and also more waste out.
All the components are working in tandem, increasing, decreasing and stabilising as required.<br />
Its a very nicely synced system</p>
<p>when you take cocaine its JUST your heart that increases. its now out of sync with rest of the system, even pushing against it and making your heart strain.
That's the problem.  </p>
<p>I suppose the cocaine case is a bit like having one formula-1 wheel on a car: its out of sync with the rest and you're gonna have a bad time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Higher heart rate alone is dangerous for the heart.
Higher heart rate with higher oxygen levels in the blood (due to exercise) is whatâ€™s preferred  to obtain a healthy training of the heart :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you do coke your blood vessels shrink up and the heart beats faster to push against it. Fighting against pressure. Thickens walls of heart, reduces pumping capacity.</p>
<p>With exercise its more about flow, and you have more blood coming back to the heart. Increases stroke volume which lowers heart rate when resting. This is why endurance athletes have low as fuck heart rates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to think the same thing about panic attacks. &quot;I have heart palpitations! My heart is getting a great workout!&quot; But the stress hormones associated with panic attacks isn't good for the rest of the body. And the damage to endothelial cells of blood vessels from high blood pressure isn't good either. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cardio gets your entire cardio vascular system working, not just your heart. When doing cardio, veins and arteries expand to receive more blood because your entire body is demanding it. A stimulant that increases your heart rate only does not do this, so your heart is pumping like mad through veins and arteries that are not expanded and calling for it putting a lot of strain on them.</p>
