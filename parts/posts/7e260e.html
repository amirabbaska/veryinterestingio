		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The p value is the probability of observing the result you did given the assumption of the null hypothesis. If you get an extreme p value, the implication is that the original assumption is false. However, there may be many reasons your p value is extreme - unrepresentative sample, poor randomisation, other variables (measured or not), incorrect assumptions about the distribution, incorrect use or interpretation of tests. As someone else said ITT, the assumption is that you did everything right up to that point, the p value can't root out bad study design. If you suspect a sampling error has been made, then strictly speaking you should try to quantify the error and the effect it has had on the results, redesign the study, recalculate your required sample size and go again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say I claim to have the clairvoyant power to predict all coin flips.  I agree to participate in a study of my ability to predict coin flips, and with a fair coin and no cheating, successfully predict 7 coin flips in a row.  p &lt; .01.  That doesn't mean that there is a &lt;1% chance that it was due to sampling error and a &gt;99% chance that I have supernatural powers.  All it must means that, before the challenge, there was less than a 1% chance that I would make 7 successful guesses in a row.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
