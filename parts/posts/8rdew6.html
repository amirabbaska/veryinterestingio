		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The people pointing out Rastafarian roots are correct, but I think it is easier to focus on these specific reference.</p>
<p>Babylon: In the Bible, Babylon defeats the Jewish kings and takes some of them prisoner in the city. For the Caribbean communities that are tied to reggae and Rastafarianism, Babylon is the place of their captivity ... basically the Americas.</p>
<p>Zion: In the Bible, Zion is Jerusalem, the home promised to the Jews by God. Likewise, for the reggae singers, Zion generally refers to Africa, the home that their ancestors were taken from as slaves.</p>
<p>You can add a lot of little details, but that is the basic idea for a lot of the references. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rastafarian is basically Judaism for Jamaicans. So they have a lot of the same religious symbols like mount Zion.  If I remember correctly strict Rastafarians don't eat pork either. </p>
<p>In my opinion reggae is the best religious music out there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: The reason that you hear these terms in Reggae a lot is because so many of the practitioners of the music are of the Rastafari belief system.</p>
<p>Joe Higgs is considered the father of reggae by many people, as he started Bob Marley and the Wailers, Bunny Livingston, Peter Tosh, Jimmy Cliff, and more.</p>
<p>Back at that point, many of the original Reggae players (Reggae was quickly dividing into 4 sub-genres) were of the Rastafarian belief.</p>
<p>In the Rastafari belief system, god is referred to as &quot;Jah&quot; (likely from Jehovah), which is why you hear Jah a lot. Now, since Rastafarianism originated in Africa, many times &quot;Zion&quot; is referring to Africa. But to many Reggae performers (particularly those in Africa) Zion is only the holy group of Rastafari, and specifically those in Africa. Additionally, in groups such as the Reggae musicians mostly living in Jamaica, Zion refers to all Rastafari, both in Jamaica, Africa, and sometimes all over the world. Sometimes these more liberal Reggae musicians will accept a wider range of African descended people into their definition of &quot;Zion&quot;, even if they aren't Rastafarians. This all becomes more important when you talk about Babylon.</p>
<p>&quot;Babylon&quot; Is mostly a term used to refer to the entirety of the world that is not Zion. So based on the definitions of &quot;Zion&quot; that the different groups have, the definition of &quot;Babylon&quot; can change drastically. For example, some Rastafari groups simply refer to all white people as Babylon, while some may just call anyone who is not Rastafari &quot;crazy bald-heads&quot;. There is varying degrees of militarism in the different Rastafari groups, with some being outright armed and violent, and some being entirely peaceful.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the reason that you hear these terms in Reggae a lot is because so many of the practitioners of the music are of the Rastafari belief system.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Zion and Babylon are symbolic. Given that reggae music in itself is religious, Zion symbolizes the promised land while Babylon symbolizes unrighteousness and moral corruption;  analogous to Christianity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
