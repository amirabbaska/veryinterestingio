<p>When a star of sufficient mass dies it collapses in on itself to form a black hole (or other things).  What prevents this from happening while the star is still burning?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Pressure.</em> </p>
<p>When the star is still alive, there is fusion in the core, producing thermal energy which creates a thermal pressure, which pushes back against the pressure from gravity which compresses it. </p>
<p>Imagine it like a concert, where everyone wants to go to the center of the dance floor. They're all squeezing <em>inward.</em> The people in the middle might be crushed if they stand still. But suppose they are moshing. The constant bouncing and shoving pushes back against all the people pushing in, and so they can keep the mosh pit open. If they stop moshing or slow down or the song ends, then without anything to push back the crowd the other people will come in and the crowd will compress. </p>
<p>In the same way, fusion in the core of the star is like the moshers. They get the energy to push back against the crowd from fusion. Once they've exhausted the fuel, they can't push back, and they get compressed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is very weak, but it is also relentless.  All matter wants to continue compressing indefinitely, but various other effects prevent it from doing so.  Usually ordinary atomic forces, chemical and electromagnetic forces we're pretty familiar with, prevent stuff from occupying the same space.  But get enough mass together and electron repulsion doesn't matter any more and you can start forcing nuclei together, causing fusion and creating a star.</p>
<p>In a star the heat generated by fusion creates pressure.  In addition to simple thermal pressure, fusion also creates radiation and so outward pushing radiation pressure.  Fusion generated outward pressure is the main thing balancing stars.  This outward pressure from pressure counteracts the inward pressure of gravity.  These two sources of pressure counteract each other and the star maintains an approximate shape.  The smallest star, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS-VPyLaJFM" target="_blank">red dwarf</a>, constantly cycles its supply of hydrogen and helium and doesn't have the layered internal structure predicted in most stars.<br />
Consider a pot of boiling water, as water at the bottom heats it rises, then cools and falls back down.  In the red dwarf something similar happens, except that the source of heat is the gas undergoing fusion at the star's center.  Heat causes the gas to expand, move away from the center and carry its heat toward the surface.  This constant cycling creates enough fluid pressure that the inward pressure of gravity cannot compress the star any more.</p>
<p>If that pressure is no longer enough the star begins to collapse in on itself.  The next source of pressure that can hold it up is its electron degeneracy pressure.  This is a sort of fancy term that simply means that Fermions (like electrons) don't particularly like to be in the same place.  We've long past exceeded their electrical repulsion, this is caused by the Pauli exclusion principle.  Two electrons cannot occupy the same quantum state, so they cannot be compressed any more.  This creates an extremely dense object known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf" target="_blank">white dwarf</a>.</p>
<p>Too much mass, however, and even this pressure is overcome and the star collapses into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW3aV7U-aik" target="_blank">neutron star</a>.  Eventually electrons and protons are forced together forming neutrons, and the only thing holding it up is the fundamental nuclear forces.  The entire mass of the star is compressed into an unbelievably dense piece of material, which functions a lot like a star-sized atom.  Except this atom is held together entirely by gravity, rather than the strong force.</p>
<p>Add yet more mass and there's nothing left to hold it up.  Gravity demands everything fall in, so fall in everything does.  Nuclear forces can't prevent all the stuff in a star from deciding to all occupy the same approximate point.  This creates a singularity, possibly a single point of infinite density or just incomprehensibly dense form of exotic matter held up by a yet unknown force.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-P5IFTqB98" target="_blank">Black holes</a> are very poorly understood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not accurate to say that the sun is &quot;burning&quot; actually the immense gravity is breaking what we call strong force and releasing energy per nuclear fusion, and creating heavier elements as a byproduct.<br />
The force created from fusion Keeps itself from collapsing by pushing outward. That's why starts don't collapse until the end of their life cycle.<br />
It's been a while since I studied astronomy, so if I made any mistakes please correct me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good explanation that someone could visualize:</p>
<p>Think of deep frying something, say an egg roll. What keeps the oil from soaking into the roll? The steam coming <em>out</em> of the roll. As long as they're in balance, you have yummy goodness, (that isn't greasy). However, if the water/moisture in the egg roll runs out, no more steam. And you end up with a grease soaked <del>blackhole</del> egg roll that adds gravity to your colon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
