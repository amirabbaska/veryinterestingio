Cystic Fibrosis will get many years added to their life with a transplant. So I guess the real answer is organ availability. If we had endless donations we'd transplant COPD patients more for the improved quality of life.</p>
<p>Edit: I have a family member who received a double lung and heart transplant who has Cystic Fibrosis. The above is the information we were given when he was first put on the list over a decade ago. I know in Canada we do transplants for COPD patients who meet transplant requirements. However, your place on the list is figured through an algorithm that looks at age, survival rate, rejection rate, quality of life before and after, current health, current habits (ie smoking), and many other details to try to help the best candidates who will gain the most benefit. So the more organs available, the more people who can be helped. Maybe the default should be to have your organs donated and to sign a card if you chose not to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

We actually do transplant COPD patients, but they are end stage (usually by using pulmonary function testing to decide this stage). COPD is a disease that typically does not progress quickly so it is a bit harder to get listed for this condition unless you are very severe. However, we will transplant COPD patients. </p>
<p>The other issues that often come up with this group is the fact that many continue to smoke and are at higher risk for lung cancer so if you do/have either, you will not be transplanted. Surprisingly, diseases like cystic fibrosis can also wait for a while on the list despite frequent infections and flares as we use lung function as a big part of their place on the list (which can still be relatively preserved in some of these patients).</p>
<p>If interested, there is a scoring system called the lung allocation score (LAS) which aims to reduce wait time for the sickest patients and tries to identify those in need of a transplant more urgently. It takes into account many things about the patient (see below).</p>
<p><a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/resources/allocation-calculators/las-calculator/" target="_blank">https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/resources/allocation-calculators/las-calculator/</a></p>
<p>This is a super hot topic about lung allocation based on type of disease, severity of illness, etc  and people are working on many ways to optimize timing of transplant. The underlying lung disease is important as they all have different rates of progression, so it can be tricky deciding when to list someone. So your point about COPD patients not seeming to be transplanted as often is well taken but hopefully this helps shed light on why :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tl;dr: COPD patients definitely get lung transplants, if they qualify, it's just less common for them to qualify.</p>
<p>People with COPD do get lung transplants, all the time. It's actually the primary &quot;treatment&quot; for the disease, unless you qualify for lung volume reduction surgery. I had pretty serious COPD and I'm about a month out from my double transplant surgery, and I'd estimate about 25% of the people in my transplant support group also had COPD before surgery.</p>
<p>However, I'm also 42, never smoked, and otherwise generally healthy. That's pretty rare for a COPD patient. COPD is a <strong>very</strong> gradual and unpredictable disease. Even if you get on a transplant list, your &quot;score&quot; is going to be low relative to other people, especially CF patients, because COPD is unlikely to kill you suddenly. It's also a generally manageable disease until it gets really bad. They wouldn't even consider me for transplant until I required oxygen for normal activity and estimated I was within a year or so of being on a ventilator. People who get emphysema from smoking, for example, could be well into their 50s or 60s before the effects become noticeable. Those people likely have other health problems as well, so you can't justify giving them a set of lungs that could go to someone else. Even people with genetic factors behind their COPD might be too old to benefit from new lungs by the time they need them.</p>
<p>On top of that, post-transplant lung recipients have it a bit rough. Lungs are the hardest organs to keep healthy because, by definition, they <strong>have</strong> to be exposed to the environment. You are on immuno-suppressants for life, plus a handful of anti-bacteria/fungal/viral/etc drugs to compensate, plus another handful of drugs and supplements to counter all the side-effects. The drugs destroy your liver and kidneys, stress out your heart, drain key minerals, make you nauseuous, etc. The stress of the surgery/rehab/medication may actually be worse than just living with COPD.</p>
<p>In my case, there's a decent chance I'll get 10-15 years added to my like with these lungs, and if I work at it, <strong>maybe</strong> stay healthy enough for a second transplant in my 60s. I can go back to breathing &quot;room air&quot;, working full time, etc. Those things all count in favor of getting a lung transplant when someone 20 years older in my situation may not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lung transplants can be done for COPD, but you have other factors to take into consideration. Survival rate, age, comorbidities, environment, etc.  </p>
<p>People with cystic fibrosis are usually very young and get transplants in their 20s since their lungs are so full of secretions that they can no longer manage it even with constant chest physio.  They’re often in and out of hospital every 1-2 weeks since their lungs fill up so quickly.</p>
<p>COPD though is a disease that’s pretty insidious. You don’t really realize you have any issues until your lungs can no longer compensate for the built up damage.  Since your lungs and heart work very closely together, by the time your lungs have issues, your heart likely will too (increased blood pressure, pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, among the possibilities).  Since it takes time for COPD severity to build to the point where you’re symptomatic, patients with it are often more advanced in age.  They have been looking to transplant in older patients more recently but still take into account who would benefit more from having a new set of lungs (20 year old vs 60 year old) if they are both candidates for the same set.  </p>
<p>Another thing to take into consideration is what type of COPD the patient has. If it’s more localized, they’ll often lean towards lung reduction surgery instead of a full on transplant. Since COPD is an obstructive disease, it makes exhaling difficult due the sheer amount of air trapped inside the lung.  If your damage is all in the upper left lobe, often times removing that one area can improve quality of life, ymmv tho of course depending on the patient and their circumstances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
