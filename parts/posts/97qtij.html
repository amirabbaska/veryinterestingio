<p>Brushing+flossing+mouthwashing multiple times a day takes a lot of time and more-or-less requires being near a water source. Are these kindasorta-ancient inventions of hair on a stick or a durable string really the pinnacle of toothcare, or is there no technology we know of that could possibly get teeth more reliably-cleaner(or works faster)?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brushing and flossing IS very effective. However many people do both of these things very incorrectly. When brushing, you are not scrubbing back and forth, you are moving rapidly in concentric circles along the gums to disorganize plaque. An electric toothbrush really does this best.</p>
<p>Flossing is not to clean in between teeth, but rather to clean in between the tooth and the gumline. So you are flossing twice between each tooth, once along each &quot;tooth wall&quot;. In helps to think of the floss as making a &quot;C&quot; shape as you go.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons contribute to why a new method of cleaning teeth is not out.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The need for a new method to clean teeth is almost non-existent. Brush, floss and go to the dentist every 6 months can guarantee healthy teeth in the long run. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Products like toothbrush and toothpaste are cheap for the regular joe. Customers are satisfied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's only a minor hassle that people have accepted. If it is a hassle that is big enough, the demand for a new cleaning method will rise and it might be on the market really soon. But as of now, the demand for a new method is low. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, it is true that we need a water source. To satisfy the need for a water source, we have invented plumbing. The majority of the human population aren't nomads, just one good water system and we're good to go. </p>
</li>
<li>The hair on a stick and the durable string tools is simply good enough to do 95% of the job. The other 5% is done by dentists every 6 months. Why must we invent another tool or method simply because its predecessor is ancient?  </li>
</ol>
<p>Here are more tools that are way older than your great grandmother. Paper, ink, pencil, fork, spoon, knife and the list goes on and on. If you use my argument to say &quot;then why the fuck did we invent the computer that replaces the calendar, dvd player, newspapers etc?&quot; Here is my answer. It is easy enough to program a computer to do the job. Perhaps in the future there exists a full body cleansing machine which will replace the floss and the toothbrush.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There needs to be some type of mold that fits your mouth that has strings that go in between your teeth.  The outer part of the mold will have bristles similar to a regular tooth brush and the strings that fit in between each tooth act as floss.  The device will vibrate to clean your teeth like how an electric toothbrush does.  Toothpaste would be added to the device and distributed evenly to all teeth throughout the automatic brushing process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t help that the ADA are against major developments that could keep you away from your dentist longer. </p>
<p>For instance, they are against the use of NovaMin and BioMin which are two amazing products that help your teeth regenerate tooth enamel. You can’t get it in the US. </p>
<p>However, it’s available in basically any other country. I import mine from India. </p>
<p>Like a lot of the industry/regulatory groups in the US, they basically represent the professionals and look out for their best interests. </p>
<p>I’m sure there are other dental technologies that have been killed off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
