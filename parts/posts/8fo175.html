		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes.</p>
<p>Some medications will collect in a specific organ and won't need to be increased to account for the extra mass, others spread throughout the body and will need an increased dosage.</p>
<p>Some drugs are actually &quot;fat-soluble&quot; and will concentrate in the fatty tissue itself, making doseage difficult for very obese people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn’t a really cut and dry answer to this one...  it depends on the medication.</p>
<p>Many medications are titrated to effect or lab values (ie meds for cholesterol, anti depressants, epilepsy meds). We don’t start overweight patients on doses any higher for these medications. We will just increase doses based on what their labs say or how the patient feels. I can’t say for certain, but I don’t believe anyone has taken time to gather data and find if overweight persons require a higher “effective” dose.</p>
<p>Other medications, like oral antibiotics, are a flat dose regardless of weight. Oral antibiotics are dosed based on indication and not patient weight.  Because of how these drugs act in the body despite the persons weight, they will effectively eliminate an infection without increasing the dose (which could then lead to toxic side effects).</p>
<p>Intravenous antibiotics are a totally different scenario where the dosing is predominately weight based (with a max dose ceiling). In the case of IV antibiotics, overweight individuals do indeed need larger doses. </p>
<p>TL;DR it just depends what types of drug we’re talking about</p>
<p>As a reference, I am a Pharmacist in a hospital.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people get fat, not everything gets bigger. When organs get bigger, that is usually a problem/sign of a problem. Most often, when a person gets fat, most of the extra bulk is literally fat, adipose cells. There are some other increases, like in bone mass and skin, but not a lot of stuff inside the body gets bigger. Lots of drugs dont really target fat or skin, so it doesnt really matter too much...though you do adjust somewhat for certain things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on how the medication distributes throughout your body, yes an overweight person might need a higher dose.<br />
To think of it easily, there are two ways a drug distributes through your body, it can either stay in your blood (body weight does not matter) or it can move into your tissue and fat (body weight does matter).<br />
To address this, there are different calculation that can be used:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Acutal Body Weight (ABW) = Your weight with no adjustments </li>
<li>Ideal Body Weight (IBW) = An approximation of what you 'should' weigh that takes in to consideration height, age, gender, and a population based muscle mass average </li>
<li>Dosing Body Weight (DBW) = an adjustment to IBW for people with an ABW that is 30% or more above their ideal body weight</li>
</ul></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
