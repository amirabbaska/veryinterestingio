		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. The planet's orbit is not really affected by whether it is balanced or not. Since it rotates 365.24 times every orbit, having a bit more mass (much less than 1% by the way) on one side is an effect that is evened out over time â€” it doesn't on average change the planet's center of gravity, which is what really affects its orbital location.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're assuming there was an imbalance in the first place.  The crust floats on magma.  The Earth wouldn't have been imbalanced any more than a bathtub with all the rubber duckies clumped together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, because continental rock is lighter than oceanic crust, but also thicker. In general, there is the same weight of lithosphere (the uppermost layers of the Earth) everywhere at the surface of the Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. The shape of the orbit is determined based only on the planet's center of mass. Even a theoretical egg-shaped planet or something with a more extreme shape (like a space station) only orbits based on its center of mass.</p>
<p>That center of mass has may have changed within the earth over the past 335 million years, but this change has not affected the orbit because of the law of conservation of momentum; any motion within the system does not affect the trajectory of the entire combined system.</p>
<p>Even if there was a massive explosion and the planet cracked in half, the center of mass of the combined two halves of the planet would continue on the same trajectory as the center of mass of the once-whole planet.</p>
<p>Because of conservation of momentum, the only way to change our planet's trajectory (or any trajectory) is to eject mass out into space. If we were to hurl a continent out into space, conservation of momentum states that the trajectory of the center of mass of the planet+continent must remain the same... but we don't care about the continent any more. The center of mass of the planet will change trajectory from the planet+continent system.</p>
<p>This is how rockets work to change their trajectory; they eject mass (exhaust) into space. The center of mass of the rocket + exhaust does not change trajectory, but the trajectory of the rocket alone does. We just don't care any more about the rocket exhaust flying out towards deep space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
