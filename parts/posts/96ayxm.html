		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The truth is we don't know. Spiders don't have a centralized brain, but rather a decentralized nervous system like other arthropods. (layman here correct me if I am off). We have seen remarkable feats of intelligence among spiders, look at the portia spiders as an example, who mimic the vibrations of prey in other spiders webs to eat the spider. How they pull it off isn't clear to us yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've previously heard it explained this way: Spiders, like all insects are like very simple robots that obey very basic directives. Spiders are 'programmed' find a spot with good airflow, and build a web there. If they catch stuff, they survive. If not, they probably die. That's OK, because successful spiders have hundreds if not thousands of offspring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: How the web shoots out of their butt is a big influcne on where they build the web and the shape it takes. Some spiders use some of their senses to determine the exact placement of their web in their chosen spot. </p>
<p>Here is a lengthy bit I <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-does-a-spider-decide-where-to-put-up-its-web" target="_blank">found here</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most important factor is phylogeny. Each spider family has its own characteristic arrangement of spinnerets (the organs used to spin the webs), and they decide what type of web can be built. And this shape is adapted to one specific type of habitat. Here's a small, general guide (exceptions abound, as usual):</p>
<p>Mygalomorphs (e.g., trapdoor spiders): most can only construct simple lines of silk, which can act as detectors. They live in burrows, with these sensory silk lines radiating out of them. When the lines are cut, the spider knows that prey is nearby and comes out and ambushes it.</p>
<p>Sheet-web builders (e.g., velvet spiders, funnel-web spiders): As the name says, their silk comes out in massive sheets. And the best place to put a sheet is, of course, on some vegetation under a tree, with insects dropping from the tree being a good source of food. Funnel web builders have a bit more control over their webs, being able to connect a circular (&quot;funnel shaped&quot;) burrow made out of silk in which the spider lives.</p>
<p>Space-web builders (e.g., linyphiids, theridiids): These webs take up space. Linyphiid ones consist of a bowl made out of tangled threads, and attached to the lower branches of a tree. That way, anything falling from either the lower branches or the canopy will come into the bowl, and the spider (which stays on the underside the bowl) will just collect all the food easily. Theridiids (which are actually highly-derived orb weavers that build space webs, so I put them here) have slightly more refined webs, since they have specific combs on their legs allowing them to craft the silk into neat lines instead of a densely-packed bowl. To make up for the lack of catchment though, their silk is very sticky (like all orb-weavers) and they can also throw silk at their prey (kinda like Spiderman).</p>
<p>Orb weavers have the most control over their webs. They're the typical meticulous geometric ones (they have their own classification, including radial webs and spiral webs, etc.). They're very finely-tuned to be as good as possible at catching prey. They show asymmetries depending on the specific tree/bit of vegetation they're at, so that each line is in the path of a flying insect; the spider will also use light cues and a gravity compass to make sure their web is in the best possible position. (The role of experience vs. genetic predisopsition would make a cool study, if it hasn't been studied already...)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine it’s comparable to a kind of algorithm. Their senses observe various things about the environment, and millions of years of trial and error through evolution has given them some way to evaluate those observations and determine if an area is suitable. They have no central nervous systems, so they’re not <em>thinking</em> about it, it just happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been monitoring spiders for a few years.  Apparently they search for a location with a food source that is seemingly out of the way.  Once they find that location.  Most other spiders will then also set up their nests in the same local.  Most feed on smaller bugs and expand their webs as it fills with bugs it has eaten.  Eventually more and more spiders migrate to the same hunting grounds and build their nests.  This leads to spider warfare.  Where they start to hunt one another.  The daddy long legs seem to have loosely defined webs that are quite expansive and have the highest kill ratio of bugs and other spiders.  The funnel spiders stay close to the ground and in corners.  Which is a good strategy they stay in a funnel web with only one way in around the daddy long legs.  They can't get attacked from behind.  Yet if they come out of the funnel the daddy long legs have captured and fed off of over 20 funnel spiders.  </p>
<p>There use to be black widows however the daddy long legs dispatched them last year.  It seems there is a contest between the wolf spiders and the daddy long legs.  The daddy long legs have been seen on their webs ganging up to take on a wolf spider.  As the wolf spider was using the daddy long legs nests.  The last wolf spider contest took the lives of two daddy long legs.  </p>
<p>Yet about a day ago a daddy long leg made a meal out of a smaller wolf spider.  </p>
<p>I have not seen any orb weavers in two years.  I don't know what killed them except maybe humans.  </p>
<p>That's just the observation of the spider kingdom in my basement.  Those spiders should praise me as a god.  As flooding almost destroyed their ecosystem and I saved them.  </p>
<p>It's quite entertaining.  they confined themselves to one corner of the home because of the cleaning around the house made some locations undesirable spider real estate.  I speculate that spiders have a way of sensing that some area's are unsafe to build webs around.  </p>
<p>I'm not certain if it's the presence of human cleaning or if it's a lingering remains of a dead spider that causes them to stop building webs in former spider housing areas?</p>
<p>It does seem that supply of food is the main concern of spider habitat.  I believe spider eye sight is actually quite good.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
