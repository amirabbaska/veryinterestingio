		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends. Dollar sign (and similar) said to be written before so that one can't easily add digits to the front. And one can't add digits to the end because of thousand delimiters (and decimal point, yes). That is, changing $10,000 into $<em>9</em>10,0000 would be noticeable.</p>
<p>In Russia, for comparison, we don't use delimiters and separate currency sign (₽) was approved less than 5 years ago. Before that we went around writting <em>руб.</em> at the end, and for countering falsification we just additionally write the sum in words in parentheses: 10000.00 (ten thousand rubles zero kopeks).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone on here is wrong about the origin of this. It comes from ledger keeping. Debts were written in columned lines in ledgerbooks. The second column was the sum owed. The third column described the debtor and / or nature of debt. The first column was empty if the debt was unpaid, and marked if there was any payment. A letter - such as S or L - was written if the first payment was made. Additional marks were added to the letter as additional payments were made. That's why both the Dollar and Pound symbols are an S and L respectively, with one or two hash marks on them. The symbols on the left hand side, the first column, made it easy to scan the page for paid or unpaid debts. The second most important information was the amount, so it came next. After that were mere notes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's not universally the case: in Quebec, for instance, the dollar symbol comes after the amount i.e. 25$. Another example is the franc (formerly used in France before the euro). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That depends on language in which it is written. In my language currency symbols come after the number. It is OK to write them before but the correct way is to write them after.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
