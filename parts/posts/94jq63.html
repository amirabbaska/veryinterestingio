<p>According to the post / article, the free-range planet is said to be 13 times the mass of Jupiter but does not orbit a star and no moons have been found yet.</p>
<p>If this is the case, how could have astronomers determined its mass without looking at its gravitational effects on other bodies?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They used a model developed by <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/592734/meta" target="_blank">Saumon and Marley</a> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2611" target="_blank">arxiv</a>]. These two looked at properties of many brown dwarfs which have been categorized recently, and found correlations between the mass of a brown dwarf and its age, temperature, and size. These brown dwarfs are more typical bodies whose physical properties we were able to measure by more usual methods (e.g., by looking at orbital properties of satellites).</p>
<p>For the rogue planet, <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa70e2/meta" target="_blank">Gagne <em>et al.</em></a> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01625" target="_blank">arxiv</a>] identified that the object belonged to a group of objects which gave them an estimate of its age, and measured the luminosity. They used these to determine its temperature and mass using the aforementioned model.</p>
<p>Essentially, the rogue planet was compared to other objects with known properties, and we're making the reasonable assumption that it will have similar characteristics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If it’s off by itself and we only just found it - we obviously didn’t wait for years to ping it with a laser to measure it...how do we know it’s x size at x distance away instead of bigger in size and further away? Since there aren’t really any landmarks around it - how do we measure distance and therefore size? (Or do we estimate the size based on some other theories mentioned, and then work backwards to figure out how far away it is?) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can also estimate size by looking at the albedo or reflectivity of a body. If you know or can estimate the albedo and can estimate how much light it receives and then what it actually reflects, you can estimate the size. Then using what you know about the composition from spectra and whatnot as well as other examples, you can figure an average density and extrapolate the mass from there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
