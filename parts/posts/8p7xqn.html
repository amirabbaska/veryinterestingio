<p>The CNG tank's expiry date is reaching soon, I should definitely go for inspection, but does the expiry date means anything at all? </p>
<p>I already Google the question, but the top results don't really provide any information about what happens when the CNG tank &quot;expired&quot;. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CNG tanks are not like propane tanks.   They are generally made of synthetic materials, fibers, etc.   They store natural gas at 250 times atmospheric pressure, around 3600 PSI.   The compression and expansion of these fibers do wear the tank significantly, unlike propane tanks.  And the consequenses of failure are significantly more serious - propane is about 5 atmospheres of pressure give or take.  Perhaps you got a used or new old stock CNG tank installed, many newer tanks have a 20 year life.  They cannot be re-certified and your vehicle should be taken out of service, or have the tank replaced.   The consequences are potentially explosive if you do not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pressure vessels aren't my area of expertise but I am a structural engineer for the offshore industry. As you empty and fill the tank you stress and unstress the walls and welds in the tank. There'll be tiny imperfections in the metal and as these imperfections will grow a tiny amount with every stress cycle. The tank will be designed to take a certain number of cycles and the expiry date will be based on this assuming a high mileage of the vehicle. Enough cycles and the tank will fail. There'll be safety factors on top so the tank may go for well beyond its design life but it wouldn't be worth it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory what should happen is sort of described <a href="http://lpgautopower.com.au/the-facts-about-autogas-cylinder-testing/" target="_blank">here</a>, visual inspection for damage/corrosion etc, and replacement of all 'wear-and-tear' components.     </p>
<p>If you want to keep your own tank then your car will be 'out of the CNG business' for some time (unless you pay extra for a 'rental' tank) and you need two trips to the garage.<br />
It depends on your country/garage if (only) a new tank or a refurbished tank is allowed for replacement.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think depends on your tank construction. But it's not like it's suddenly more dangerous after the expiration date.</p>
<p>The two things that may happen with metal tanks are corrosion and metal fatigue. Friend had an old propane tank that failed due to pit corrosion. One day started leaking out a pinhole in the tank wall. Fatigue would be due to filling cycles.</p>
<p>I know that compressed gas cylinders have to be hydro tested every ten years and sometimes they fail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
