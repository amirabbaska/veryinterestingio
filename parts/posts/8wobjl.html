		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Copper like silver and other heavy metals shreds almost all life by strongly binding thiols and amines on various biologically necessary molecules. It's just heavy metal toxicity. It's amped up a bit because bacterial cells have negatively charged membranes that schlorps the metal towards it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of important metabolism processes in any living thing involve moving sodium and potassium ions (+1 charge) or magnesium and calcium ions (+2 charge). Copper ions can carry both of these charges. So a key theory is that they can occasionally get in and take the place of the proper ions and either cause those chemical reactions to malfunction or they irreversibly bind to proteins and enzymes where the normal ion is supposed to be able to bind and unbind loosely.</p>
<p>This is actually similar to how heavy metals can poison us. The thought is that copper (and silver) surfaces can produce a deluge of these mildly harmful ions. They create a devastating environment for bacteria but aren't much trouble for massive multicellular creatures like us who can replenish our faulty proteins pretty easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Copper is stable in two oxidation states: +1 and +2, meaning it likes to give up either one or two electrons to other chemical species. It can steal one electron (going from +2 to +1) from or give one electron (going from +1 to +2) to another atom/molecule, thus generating a free radical (a species with an unpaired electron), which can wreak havoc on living systems by damaging lipids (fats) and nucleic acids like DNA.</p>
<p>This is one of the ways your immune system defends you against invaders. White blood cells release copper ions, which damage invading bacteria/parasites/virally infected cells by generating radical species. It's called the &quot;respiratory burst&quot;.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is how doorknobs do it specifically, but it could be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe the electrons of the copper must be disrupting membrane proteins so that they no longer function normally such as regulating osmotic pressure or balancing electrical potential across the inner and outer membranes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>we honestly don't know. copper is well known and uniquely powerful as an anti-microbial, there is tons of literature documenting just how effective it is, but we don't have a solid understanding of its mechanism of action.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
