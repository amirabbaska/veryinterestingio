		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When employees depend on their employer to provide healthcare then they are much more likely to stay in a terrible job with abusive management. </p>
<p>It's the same with foreign employees with a corporate sponsored work visa. Those employees will get kicked out of the country of they lose their job for whatever reason. That's why big corporations are always pushing for more H-1B visas (in addition to pushing down salaries for highly trained personnel). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What happens right now is BigCo pays its workers partially in cash and partially in health benefits.  It doesn't need to pay taxes on those health benefits, so the same money paid in health benefits is far cheaper for the company than it would be in salary.</p>
<p>If you remove the option of providing benefits, all you do is shift the salary portion upwards.  After the stickiness settled out, BigCo would be spending the same on its employees and its employees would be making a higher salary (but almost certainly getting this additional money and more taxed away to pay for universal benefits).</p>
<p>However, the issue isn't really BigCo.  It's SmallCo.</p>
<p>Let's say you're a senior partner in a 50-person law firm.  Your firm offers excellent health benefits.  More importantly, you <em>personally</em> have decision authority over those benefits.</p>
<p>What that means is that when your child gets sick with a nigh-unto-incurable conditions, you have enormous clout with the insurance company.  If they're not willing to cover the care or they're hassling you over bills, you can threaten to take your business - and the business of the other 49 people in your law firm - elsewhere.</p>
<p>In contrast, that same senior partner in a universal health care world has no clout whatsoever.  They're still making the same six-figure-plus salary, they still belong to the same golf club, but now the people making decisions about their health care aren't returning their phone calls.</p>
<p>The same happens with unions.  Many unions control the health care for their members.  If you create a government universal health care plan, they suddenly lose control over their health care.</p>
<p>And this is literally a life-and-death issue.  People outside of these sorts of arrangements (unions, professional middle class) don't have much power over their health care under any scheme, so it doesn't matter very much to them.  The tremendously wealthy and influential - CEOs and Senators - have control no matter what.  But the middle class goes from having decent, responsive medical care to being treated like indigents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To a certain degree, socialized anything has a stigma attached to it. Market-based systems developed organically (for most consumer transactions, health care included), and those market systems had to work through some wrinkles to work. Because of that, in most cases they work reasonably well, and help allocate goods and services in a relatively efficient way. In a few cases, various governments tried socializing some services. Those socialized services didn't work out well initially--and of course they didn't, the market based systems took time to get right too--which has attached a stigma to any new initiative that hopes to socialize something. People see the problems that have been created by socialized systems, but not the solutions that they've provided. </p>
<p>The problem in healthcare is that it doesn't lend itself to a fair market transaction. If you're dying of a disease, and only one person can cure that disease, that supplier can charge you whatever you're willing to pay. If you have a gun shot wound, and you need treatment right now, you're not going to shop from surgeon to surgeon to get the best price. </p>
<p>On the other side, the moral issues in healthcare can be really tricky. If I have a disease that can be treated, but at a very high cost, at what point is the cost of my treatment too great of a burden to inflict upon society? How does my role in society impact that determination? If I'm a skilled surgeon, should society be willing to tolerate more expensive treatment than if I'm a used car salesman? Who makes that call? </p>
<p>I interned for a family court judge for a semester some years ago. Those judges make really difficult decisions that have a significant impact on kids lives. The emotional baggage clearly weighed on the judges I interacted with. Can you imagine asking someone to be a judge on a panel determining (in essence) who lives and who dies? The emotional burden would be enormous. </p>
<p>All that being said, I'm the odd person who is right-of-center politically, but believes a single-payer system is the right healthcare solution. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>this is a problem of agency. </p>
<p>Most of the employees of most large corporations <em>should</em> be in favor of this, but since many of them get health insurance through work, they don't think that they would benefit (not realizing that they <em>should</em> be demanding substantially higher wages when their employers no longer need to pay for their health insurance, which would more than offset their personal increase in taxes, if any). </p>
<p>High ranking, highly paid executives who have a lot of influence on corporate policy and lobbying not only have health insurance through work, they also make so much more money than average that they would personally lose out by having to pay higher taxes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Under the current system they pay for their own employees. Under that system they pay for everybody. Now sure the cost is spread around with everybody pitching in, but the US has a progressive tax system, meaning the large US corporation will be paying disproportionally compared to everyone else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
