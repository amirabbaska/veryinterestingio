		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fusion in the Sun is a multi-stage process. The initial step involves the fusion of 2 protons into a fusion product called helium-2 or a diproton. However, the diproton is very unstable and often decays back into 2 separate protons. In a small fraction of the cases, the diproton can undergo a process called beta-plus decay immediately after fusing, in which a positron and neutrino are emitted and a deuterium nucleus is left (one of the protons in the diproton decays to a neutron in this process). The deuterium is then used in further stages of the fusion process until helium-4 is created.</p>
<p>Since the rate of beta-plus decay of the diproton is so low, the average time needed for a proton to become part of a deuterium nucleus is very long, with estimates putting it at a billion years. During this time, the proton will undergo many unsuccessful fusion attempts that involve the creation and immediate breaking up of a diproton.</p>
<p>The rest of the fusion process is much faster. So when making bombs, where it's important to detonate as much of the payload as possible in the very brief time window where the temperature and pressure are high enough to achieve fusion, it would be infeasible to start with pure hydrogen. So in fusion bomb designs, this slow proton-proton fusion step is simply skipped by starting with deuterium or tritium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A contributing factor is the rate of fusion. Fusion in the Sun is <em>really</em> slow, it's going to take 10 billion years to use all the fuel up. A cubic metre of the Sun's core produces a measly 300 Watts of power, about the same as a compost heap. The Sun's overall power is simply because of its size.</p>
<p>By contrast a thermonuclear bomb must use up as much of its fuel as possible in a fraction of a second (before the remainder gets blown apart by the explosion). Hence the bomb needs something easy to fuse (deuterium and lithium) whereas the Sun can get by with something hard to fuse (normal hydrogen). The nuclear physics behind why hydrogen is hard to fuse has been addressed by Rannasha.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
