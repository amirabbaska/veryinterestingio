		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nihilism, from the Latin &quot;Nihil&quot; for &quot;Nothing,&quot; states as its basic tenet that nothing has meaning outside of the meaning we assign to it as humans. These meanings can change (mutable), and the same thing can mean different things to different people (non-universal). This flies in the face of the goal of philosophy in general, which for a long time was seen as the search for the ultimate meaning of things. Philosophy can be the search for a universal moral code, or proof of knowledge beyond Descarte's assertion of &quot;I think, therefore I am,&quot; or any other attempt to learn a universal truth. Nihilism denies philosophy by attempting to show that not only will it never reach its goal of immutable universal truth, but that immutable universal truth does not exist. This can lead to some pretty unnerving conclusions, like that there is no God, your life is meaningless in the grand scheme of things, and that the knowledge you've gained in your lifetime either relies on assumptions that can't be proven (axioms) or are merely educated guesses based on experience, but cannot be guaranteed as predictors of future behavior. For that second part, imagine flipping a coin. It can either come up heads or tails. Say it comes up heads. So you flip it again, and it comes up heads again. And again. And again. After a long time repeating this, getting heads every time, eventually inductive reasoning (logical thought based on past evidence) would lead you to believe that flipped coins only come up heads. Nihilism states that we can never know that for sure. All we can really say for sure is &quot;In the past it always came up heads&quot; (or, a bit pedantically but much more accurately, &quot;I have a memory where it seems I flipped a coin many times, and every time the coin seemed to land heads up&quot;). Nihilism strikes a blow against philosophy by leaning on the uncertainty of the past in predicting the future, the inability for any human being to test any hypothesis under all possible conditions, the unreliability of our individual senses and our inability to guarantee that the same thing will be defined the same way by different people. Instead, nihilism proposes that there is no such thing as meaning or morality, and that even existence itself cannot be proven beyond the individual.</p>
<p>In order to define existentialism, you must first define its inverse: essentialism. Beginning with Plato's study of forms (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave</a>), philosophers believed for a very long time that everything has its &quot;essence,&quot; a part of the thing which defines it, and without which it would cease to be that thing. Plato posited the idea that these &quot;essences&quot; existed in some otherworldly manner, and that the things we actually see in the world are reflections of the essential thing, which only exists to define the real-world instances. For an example, look at your chair. Essentialists believe that there is some sort of &quot;chair-ness&quot; that all chairs have, and without which they would not be chairs. If you ask an Essentialist what makes something a chair, they might discuss legs to support weight, an elevated horizontal flat place to put your bum, a vertical flat place to rest your back, or anything else in their effort to find the bare minimum of what makes a chair a chair. Existentialism flies in the face of that idea. Existentialists believe that existence comes before essence, which is to say that things (and people) are not defined by something external, but by their existence, where they are, and what they do. If you ask an existentialist what makes something a chair, they would answer something more along the lines of &quot;It's a chair because I'm sitting on it.&quot; Existentialists go on to stress the idea of authenticity, which is (rather difficultly) defined as 'acting as oneself'. The basic idea is that you decide who you are and what you do, then you go and be you and do you stuff. The act of being you and doing you stuff is then what defines you, and that definition can only come after you've been yourself and done all the you stuff you're gonna do. Authenticity is the goal of existentialism. Be you. Do you. Know that you being you is just as valid as Sam being Sam and Kelly being Kelly. Also know that you trying to be Kelly is gonna be a problem, because it's not internally consistent and will lead to conflicts. Existentialists also talk about Absurdism a lot. Absurdism is the idea that the universe simply is as it is, regardless of how we would like it to be or how we define. One of the problems of philosophy is &quot;If there is an all-powerful, all-loving God, why is there undeserved suffering?&quot; On this point, nihilists and existentialists agree: there is no God (edit: Kierkegaard doesn't agree. He says that there is a God, but we cannot know what God does or why. I would say to him that an ineffable God is functionally equivalent to a non-existent God, but that's me...). Where they split is in the existentialist belief that the universe can be understood, even without there being an ultimate meaning or goal implicit in its existence. Nihilists believe that the universe cannot be understood.</p>
<p>Personally, I find nihilism very compelling. I'm an atheist, I've had enough experience with hallucinogens and dreams to know that the evidence of my senses is not perfectly reliable, and I do believe that people are almost entirely products of their environment. I don't think there is one universal, immutable meaning to life or a moral system that, followed strictly, cannot be perverted toward immoral results. But I also believe that existentialism follows logically from nihilism. If no belief system has any validity, then it follows that all beliefs are equally invalid. This can be rephrased as &quot;all belief systems are equally valid&quot; without changing its meaning at all, and I draw my personal philosophy from that. I define me, and it's okay for parts of that definition to be radically different from how other people define themselves. It's also okay for parts of it to be the same. It's even okay for you to draw your personal meaning from external definitions. There are, for example, parts of me that are irrevocably Catholic despite my lack of actual faith in God. I draw comfort from community and ritualism, and I define myself by opposition with the Protestant majority in the United States. I've had experiences many people never have, and they happened when I was very young. It's natural that they would make their way into the foundation of who I am. The Authentic Me. The trouble with letting external things help define you is that you might not realize you're doing it and, because of that ignorance, you don't get to make an authentic decision for how you are defined as a person. </p>
<p>If you made it through that wall of text without getting caught up in my circular reasoning or thrown completely off the scent by my inarticulate ramblings, I'd advise you to consider the single line from Camus's &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; that eventually led me down the road to existentialism. &quot;There is only one serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.&quot; Which is to say that the only question worth asking is 'Should I continue to be and do, or should I stop, and why?' I want to answer 'continue,' as do most people most of the time. The ideas of existentialism, as I understand them, are the best framework from which I can construct a reason to answer 'continue'. The basic idea is that this world sucks really hard a lot of the time, but sometimes it's the insanely great, and that regardless of what happens to me after I die, I will never again get the chance to be me here and now.</p>
<p>edit: all holy and ever-living cow what just happened? I've never been gang-gilded before. Thank you all for your generosity. I'm not an expert, just someone who has taken a few university-level courses and dedicated myself to fair bit of independent study afterward. I'll try to answer your questions, but plz don't feel bad if I don't or my answers kinda suck.</p>
<p>I also wanna note that I didn't leave out Kierkegaard by accident. I left him out because I think Christianity (which, as Epicurus said, posits a all-knowing, all-powerful and all-loving God) is fundamentally incompatible with the Absurd and, when pressed, Kierkegaard resorts to ineffability. If your opinion differs from mine, I'd love Love LOVE to talk with you about it over PM. Also, this isn't to say don't read Kierkegaard. I just disagree with him on one of his foundational points. And I'm just some random jackoff from the Internet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nihilism isn't so much a &quot;philosophy&quot; as an adjective than can be applied to a worldview. &quot;Nihil&quot; is Latin for &quot;nothing&quot;. And when a philosophy is described as Nihilistic, the description usually suggests that it describes a worldview that is devoid of objective moral truths or meaning. When used as a criticism this implies a philosophical dead end, where there is nothing left to do but stare at your shoes and despair at the meaninglessness of existence.</p>
<p>French existentialism is generally atheistic, and therefore suggests that we are alone in a universe where no objective moral principals can be rationally derived. Further it states that unlike things that are created with a purpose or &quot;essence&quot; (cups, hammers, pencils) - humans come into existence, without any purpose or essence. Lastly because our decisions are not informed by dogma or doctrine, we cannot point to an objective moral principle and claim that &quot;we had no choice&quot;. We are, in fact, condemned to choose in every situation and have nothing or no one else to blame for the consequences of our choices.</p>
<p>In short we are abandoned in the world without purpose and condemned to make decisions on our own with no external moral guidance available to tell us what the right thing to do is. This sounds rather bleak, which explains why people sometimes accuse existentialists of being nihilists. But there is an upside.</p>
<p>In reality existentialism doesn't encourage you to drown in meaninglessness. It purports to describe the world as it really is and offers an answer - When you realise that you are abandoned and without purpose, you can create your own purpose. You can define yourself and live a truly authentic existence. </p>
<p>Others seek guidance in moralising scriptures or pretend to shirk responsibility by deferring to authority - living in existential &quot;bad faith&quot; (for in reality you still made a choice even if you claim you had none, and are therefore still responsible, even if you claim not to be; and your purpose is still self-defined, even if you claim it isn't). As an existentialist living an authentic existence, one lives with the realisation that they are always choose to act in a particular way or not act at all, and therefore bear the full responsibility for the consequences of those actions or inactions. In that sense existentialism opens your eyes to the full extent of your freedom and offers an escape from bad faith.</p>
<p>In short, rather than being an emo, existentialism suggests: be authentic, be honest with yourself, and never turn a blind eye to the inescapable fact that only you are responsible for your choices and their repercussions. Read Sartre's brief lecture &quot;Existentialism is a Humanism&quot; (or Existentialism and Humanism) or if you already have, read it again... it's a very concise and comprehensive defense against the assertion that existentialists are shoe-gazing nihilists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nihilism wasn't really an actual school of philosophy, there may have been some contemporary nihilists who use the label for whatever reason, but historically it was more something you said about schools of thought you disagreed with if you felt that what they claimed as the grounds of truth and/or morality wasn't sufficient.   Nihilism can mean several different things, moral nihilism, nothing is either good of bad, epistemological nihilism, nothing can be known, or ontological nihilism, nothing is real or exists. </p>
<p>Existentialism was a movement that developed around the first half of the 20th century, carrying a lot stuff over from some 19th century philosophers.   The name comes from the notion that &quot;existence precedes essence&quot;, that is we are born into the world before we have a purpose, before we having meaning, and so we are free to find meaning in life.  Its not that there is no meaning, its just that people aren't tools, they're not made like a hammer with a purpose of pounding nails.  Existentialism has a notion of humans as radically free in the world, and ultimately responsible for it, the choice to keep living is a choice to in a way endorse the world.  Existentialism focuses on human's having choice, and authentically expressing themselves as opposed to acting in 'bad faith', bad faith meaning denying that we have a choice and that we are responsible because it allows us to conform more comfortable or massage our egos. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Existentialism&quot; is not a term that can be broken down into a few general ideas, as some Existentialist thinkers are often directly opposed to each other (e.g., Nietzsche &amp; Dostoevsky, while maintaining some similarities, are still completely opposed to each in other regards).</p>
<p>It is better to understand Existentialism as a <em>literary</em> tradition, instead of a set of philosophical axioms.</p>
<p>This is because philosophers are concerned with making and setting up arguments that can withstand logical deliberation and scrutiny. A philosopher writes to defend an idea by way of a philosophical argument.</p>
<p>Existential writers, however, do not base their 'philosophy' off of a philosophical 'argument' which can be laid out in logical syntax or as a set of propositions.</p>
<p>Existential writers write based of an &quot;experience&quot; they had while living, usually an experience that was for them extremely profound. For Kierkegaard, this was the loss of Regina. for Nietzsche, it was the death of god. </p>
<p>In the most general sense, Existential writers discuss the problems involved with having a &quot;self&quot;. Be careful here to not immediately equate the &quot;self&quot; with the mind/mental states. While the two are obviously involved with each other, the &quot;self&quot; should be understood as a 'contradiction'. </p>
<p>The self is what gives rise to contradictions, broadly speaking. A contradiction is when the way you perceive yourself as a person, i.e., who you perceive yourself to <em>be</em>, does not align with the actual state of affairs that compromises your facticity (the 'facts' about your life).</p>
<p>For example: I may think of my self as being a very hard-working person. But the facts of my life contradict this if I do not have a job, I do not exercise, and I sit at home playing video games all day.</p>
<p>This is a contradiction because how I perceive myself does not align with what I actually am.</p>
<p>Existential literature is, broadly speaking, concerned with the <em>struggle of having a self</em>, the almost daily battle to attempt to line up our perceptions of ourselves with reality. These 'perceptions of myself' can have implicit moral value(I think of myself as a very good person) or practical value(I think of myself as a very good athlete).</p>
<p>Existential literature, then, is the tradition which many philosophical writers have taken up where they write about the experience of having a self. Some will write about duties and obligations and commitments (Kierkegaard, Sartre), some will write about freedom and morality(Dostoevsky, Nietzsche), and some will try and systematize the experience of the self metaphysically (Heidegger).</p>
<p>All in all, existentialism is rich literary <em>tradition</em>, but it should not be thought of as its own philosophy in and of itself.</p>
<p>Nihilism? That's fairly straightforward and different. Nihilism is simply the idea that life has absolutely no value or meaning. </p>
<p>An existentialist thinker would not agree that life has no value, as that would imply that the struggle and labor involved with having a 'self' is meaningless as well. For an existentialist author, struggling with the inherit contradictions of your nature and desires is the most meaningful thing you can do.</p>
<p>Fun Fact: Nietzsche was not a nihilist. He was exceedingly pro-living. This often gets overlooked due to his often quoted line &quot;God is dead&quot;, which many people then assume to mean &quot;life is meaningless&quot;. But Nietzsche, on the contrary, urges people to live full and ambitious lives, and to constantly overcome their weaknesses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since none of the top answers are actually ELI5, here's an attempt that isn't splurging thousands of words at you:</p>
<p>Existentialism basically says that the only meaning in life is the meaning we humans give to things. Searching for &quot;the meaning of life&quot; is pointless because there's never an absolute answer; it depends on the individual. Existentialism is actually a pretty broad region of philosophy because several different people used the label and espoused differing beliefs and wrote about different subjects, but that's the main thing.</p>
<p>Nihilism on the other hand is about denying the basic accepted tenets that most people live by, such as the validity of the senses, that universal morals exist, that life can have <em>any</em> meaning at all, and more. It's the last one that causes confusion with existentialism, because you might argue that having &quot;no meaning&quot; and &quot;no meaning but what we give it&quot; is the same thing.</p>
<p>In those terms, Existentialism is kind of a subset of Nihilism, since it denies one tenet that many people live by. But Existentialist philosophers added a lot of stuff on top about the importance of freedom, about existential &quot;Angst&quot; (fear and confusion in the face of meaninglessness) and other things.</p>
<p>So, they are closely related, many philosophers will be both at the same time, but they're not the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
