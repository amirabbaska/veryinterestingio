<p>But a bunch of them?  You'll get a response at minimum.  To paraphrase Wayne Wheeler (the guy who got Prohibition passed) &quot;the primary desire of any American politician is to get and keep a job.&quot;  If you make it clear that they need to play ball with you to get/keep their job... they'll work with you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If 500 registered voters of mine call me up and say &quot;We want you to vote no on Bill No.123 or we'll vote for John Doe in the next election&quot;, if I don't vote no on Bill No.123, I lose 500 voters, and run a risk of losing an election. The number one priority of a politician is to get re-elected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has more of an impact than you think, particularly if you are registered to vote in their district. A phone call or personalized letter (not a form letter) will at the very least be documented in their office. If several people call or write in (again, not a form letter from some organization on your behalf) on the same issue, then it really gets the representative's attention. Also, you would be surprised how easily you can get a meeting with your state representative by just stopping by their office during the session. They are reluctant to turn away a constituent who is registered to vote.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot, actually.  My Aunt worked for a State Representative and one of her jobs was to compile stats of calls received for the Congressman.</p>
<p>If there was a 'hot' issue then it was tracked closely.  But even random 'one offs' were put into a general category like 'Veterans Affairs', 'Schools', 'Budget' etc. </p>
<p>Now a days its almost all done online by signing up for a petition.  I don't think a call is any more important than signing the petition online... unless you are donor or well known (for courtesy's sake).</p>
<p>Sign up for email notices from your Congressman and sign the online petitions that are in interest to you.  I just did one last week and the results (over 5000 online signatures) were used to sway a decision on closing some state offices.  We wanted them kept open for jobs.  The cities that didn't have as many votes... well, they also don't have this specific office any more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are not a notable person, with money to donate or influence over a bloc of voters, your opinion will essentially just end up on a tally sheet. X calls on one side of a subject, Y calls on the other.</p>
<p>Any reasons you give for your opinion are typically ignored. If you're hoping to sway a representative based on the logic of your argument, you're wasting your time. Your argument will not be conveyed to them. </p>
<p>The tally itself is significant, however. Politicians take the total number of calls on an issue seriously as a barometer of how much their constituents care about an issue. And how many people call from each side is taken seriously as well. The call volume is also low enough (on most issues) that individual calls have some weight. At the Federal level, a few hundred calls on an issue to a congressman is extremely strong feedback. And while being 1 in 300 people might not seem like a lot of sway, that's a lot more influence than a vote holds. On less well publicized issues, as few as a dozen calls all on the same side can sway a representative to vote one way or another.</p>
<p>If you want to know what a call sheet looks like, <a href="http://borgenproject.org/call-congress/" target="_blank">Borgen Project</a> has a page encouraging people to call elected officials which includes examples of call sheets (This isn't necessarily an endorsement of the Borgen Project, I'm just linking to it for examples).</p>
<p>I also saw a post on social media recently by someone named Mark Jahnke offering advice on how to make your calls as effective as possible. He claimed to have worked taking calls in a Senators office. I don't know him and can't independently confirm it, but his advice lines up with what I've found when calling representatives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Friends! As some of you know, I used to work on Capitol Hill as the person in charge of all the incoming phone calls to my Senator's office. I have some insider tips to make calling your reps easier and quicker.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Give your name, city, and zip code, and say &quot;I don't need a response.&quot; That way, they can quickly confirm you are a constituent, and that they can tally you down without taking the time to input you into a response database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PLEASE ONLY CALL YOUR OWN REPRESENTATIVES! Your tally will not be marked down unless you can rattle off a city and zip from the state, or are calling from an in-state area code. I know you really want to give other reps a piece of your mind, but your call will be ignored unless you can provide a zip from their district. And don't try to make this up; I could often tell who was lying very quickly thanks to the knowledge of the state's geography. Exceptions to this are things like Paul Ryan's ACA poll which are national.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State the issue, state your position. &quot;I am opposed to <strong>____</strong>.&quot; &quot;I am in favor of _<strong>__</strong>.&quot; &quot;I am opposed to banning the import of phalanges.&quot; I am in favor of a trade deal to lower the price of juice smoothies.&quot; That's it. That's all we write down so we can get a tally of who is in favor, who is against. It doesn't matter WHY you hold that opinion. The more people calling, the less detail they have time to write down. Help them out by being simple and direct. This keeps calls shorter, allowing more callers through.</p>
</li>
<li>Please be nice! The people answering the phones on Capitol Hill already had the hardest job in DC and some of the lowest pay as well, and for a month now their jobs have become absolute murder, with nonstop calls for 9 hours every day. Thank them for their hard work answering the phones, because without them our Senators could not represent us!</li>
</ol>
<p>What does this sound like?</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, my name is Mark, I'm a constituent from Seattle, zip code 98***, I don't need a response. I am opposed to banning the sale of blueberries and I encourage the Senator to please oppose implementation of any such ban. Thanks for your hard work answering the phones!&quot;</p>
<p>This is how I wish every caller had phrased their message. It makes it easier for the people answering the phones and takes less time and emotion than a long script. I know that you want to say why, but keeping it short and sweet helps the office answer more calls per hour, meaning more people get heard. The bigger the tally, the more powerful your voice.</p>
<p>Also, when you're reading off the same script as 100 other callers that day... well...they know what you're about to say, so you don't need to use the whole script for your opinion to be heard!</p>
<p>Pick one issue each day, use this format (I am in favor of _<strong><strong> or I oppose __</strong></strong>), and call your 2 Senators and 1 Representative on their DC and State Office lines, and you'll be on your way to being heard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hope this is useful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
