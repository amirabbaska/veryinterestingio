<p>Source... have over 15 species of tarantulas - they almost always clean themselves after eating - sometimes with multiple legs scritching / wiping at the same time. It is fascinating to watch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They'll keep going reflexively until they reach the right size dirt ball to call it quits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Rather boring answer, but they're cleaning themselves. They have various receptors located around their legs and head area, so they want those parts to be clean so they can sense the world around them and not get smacked by that swatter you're about to bring down on them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you watch, say, a moth or an ant, they will occasionally clean their eyes and antenna.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
