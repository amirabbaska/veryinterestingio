		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a big fragrance junkie...I have a super sensitive nose so I have a large fragrance collection I've amassed over the years.</p>
<p>One thing that took me years to realize is that if a bottle gets tipped over or not put back sitting upright I will often come back to an empty or greatly reduced bottle of cologne after some time.  This caused me to think my brother was using my  favorite fragrance when I really left it sitting on it's side accidentally for a week or two.  </p>
<p>The process I just described has cost me hundreds over the years and I'm generally not a reckless person but you travel or what not ya know...or move.</p>
<p>Why is evaporation possible much much more quickly when left on its side where the liquid can typically hit the spray spout versus upright?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there's actually a decent amount of things going on here, and an understanding of equilibrium is somewhat required...</p>
<p>First, we will assume a near perfect seal on the lid, but it is impossible to assume a perfect seal entirely around the top of the perfume bottle because there has to be a hole for you to spray the liquid perfume out of. This hole is where you'll lose most of the perfume</p>
<p>One thing you'll need to understand here is vapor pressure. This is the pressure exerted from your liquid perfume onto the gas around it. In a closed container, the pressure around the liquid and the vapor pressure from the liquid will eventually be equal, this is called equilibrium (side note, when a vapor pressure is higher than the surrounding gases pressure, you will see any liquid evaporate). </p>
<p>Now, there is a tiny tube sticking down into the liquid perfume, which separates our perfume bottle from the outside air. This is very important with things like perfume, because they have a very high vapor pressure, which makes them evaporate and is actually why you can smell them distinctly.</p>
<p>The tube that has been developed is actually a very clever way to keep the perfume inside the bottle. When it is in the liquid it creates surface tension that actually creates an effect that prevents the the liquid from evaporating. Pretty cool right? However, this surface tension only works when the area of the surface of the liquid (surface area) making contact with another gas is very low. But since this isn't a perfect solution, the tube also creates a much smaller surface area for the liquid to evaporate from.</p>
<p>When the bottle is on its side, the surface area gets turned on its side, which is too much surface area for the surface tension to make a dent in this evaporation, when the liquid is actually in the tube. This isn't always the case though... sometimes the tube sticks up into the gas, and there's no surface tension at all!</p>
<p>So with the bottle on its side, the seal created by the tube is no longer effective, and more evaporation happens. </p>
<p>TL;DR: The fast way to explain this is the liquid is no longer in equilibrium with the gas inside the bottle, but rather the air you breathe, which is impossible for a 1L bottle to achieve and thus evaporates completely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have data to back this up but my hypothesis is that us has to do with the seal on the bottle. These seals aren't perfect which is why you get evaporation in the first place. When the bottle is on its side this allows liquid to contact the opening. Since liquid is 100s to 1000s of times more dense then vapors the rate of removal can be much quicker. Since the air outside the bottle isn't saturated with perfume (you don't smell it so it's not saturated) it evaporates much more quickly than in the bottle and you don't have any liquid pooling on the counter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A contributing factor is the shape of the bottle. As it evaporates upward, the gas is forced into a smaller volume at the neck which causes some to condense back down. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the spout is in the cologne it creates a vacuum and the liquid has nowhere to escape.  Think of it like when you put a straw in a drink and put your finger over one end and lift it out.  There is still drink in the straw until you remove your finger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
