		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order for us to learn from mistakes, we must remember them. It's buggy but it works from an evolutionary standpointâ€‹. </p>
<p>Animals have to adapt to survive negative consequences. We're humans but we're animals too and for us to have survived this long, we will have to have learned to remember what did not work for us. We remember what almost killed us or hurt our social status because we can't have happy, healthy, wealthy children if we are dead; nor if nobody likes us. So our brains are wired to keep us alive and in good standing with society.</p>
<p>In other words, we can't forget about the things that sucked in our lives because our genetics want us to learn from them so that we can have children that can learn from them too. Evolution!</p>
<p>TL;DR: If our brains didn't dwell, this would be a planet of the apes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because if somethings going right there is no need to think about it because its already working out. If you are doing something wrong you need to work out what it is your doing wrong and fix it eg. dwell on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
