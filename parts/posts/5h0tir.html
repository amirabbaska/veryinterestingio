		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that iron or heavier elements won't work since you can't release energy by fusing such atoms together.</p>
<p>To get into more detail, in order for a star to generate energy via fusion, it needs to have elements that will release energy when they stick together to form heavier elements. To figure out which elements would work, take a look at <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg/1024px-Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg.png" target="_blank">this diagram</a> showing the binding energies of different isotopes <em>per nucleon</em> (proton/neutron). The higher the binding energy is, the more stable a given nucleus is. If we start to the left of the chart you have hydrogen, where you see that the slope is very steep going to helium. This high positive slope here means that you can release a lot of energy when fusing hydrogen atoms together. </p>
<p>Now as you go to heavier and heavier elements, you see that this slope starts to level off. By the time you get to various isotopes of iron and nickel, this slope becomes flat. What that means is that these isotopes are as stable as they can be and you can't get any additional energy by fusing them together. In fact, if you go to heavier elements, you now see the slope inverting. That means that you can now gain energy by breaking atoms apart. This is the regime in which nuclear fission can now be used to generate energy. </p>
<p>As an aside, the reason that isotopes of iron are so close to the peak of the stability chart (technicically Ni-62 wins by a sliver), together with the many pathways to end up with these isotopes, explains why iron tends to be so abundant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Stuff to the right can be fissioned to yield energy.  So things as heavy or heavier than iron signal the death of fusion in a star, as fusion then  eats up energy rather than yielding it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A star burns by fusing elements together. The most common and most efficient fuel (in terms of energy gained vs. energy required to start burning) is hydrogen. When hydrogen fuses, it makes helium. When the hydrogen has all been fused, the star is made up of all helium. Helium needs more heat to burn than does hydrogen, so the star starts to cool. As it does, it loses the ability to support its own mass. It collapses on itself, which in turn makes it hotter again. It eventually collapses to the point where it's hot enough to start the helium fusion reaction. Then it spends time fusing helium until that, too, runs out. Then it starts to collapse, gets hotter, and the cycle repeats up and up the periodic table. Each time it repeats, a new element is produced, and the process gets less and less efficient. This lasts until the star produces iron (hence the peak).</p>
<p>So, if a star is massive enough, it will produce an iron core. If it produces a large enough iron core, the mass of the tightly-packed core will cause it to collapse under its own weight, causing a supernova. In the tremendous burst of energy that results, elements more dense than iron are produced (basically everything to the right of iron on the periodic table). These elements are usually thrown into space, so they don't really get a chance to make up any stars. So you can't make a star out of elements heavier than iron. Even if you did happen to get together a huge chunk of elements heavier than iron, they wouldn't be a star because they wouldn't &quot;burn&quot; in fusion.</p>
<p>Even neutron stars, which are left behind after a supernova and are composed of solid neutrons (i.e. unimaginably dense), don't really burn like stars do. They just have such immense amounts of energy left over from the supernova that they put off light and heat similar to a star. But that's not the same as actual stars, who have a chain reaction of fusion that's constantly &quot;burning.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: Decided to explain the whole process for curious readers. Sorry if you already knew about it, OP.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sadly, no. Only elements lighter than Iron(Fe) can occur in fusion reactions within a star. Iron will form in a star, but after that period of its life cycle begins the star may not be around for more than an hour.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a theory that in around 10^1500 years iron stars are a possibility. if in the formation of a neutron stars the protons don't decay into neutrons, it will form a shell/crust of iron and then cause a cascade fusion or subatomic material to form iron all the way towards the core to form a fully iron star... Wow. Mind blown when I found out about this theoretical possibility. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
