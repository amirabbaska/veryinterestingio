		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very old incident, it happened back in 2011.  </p>
<p>The guy didn't sell the device and the FBI didn't sue him.  Rather, the FBI asked for him to return the device and he did.  He then sued the FBI alleging that his civil rights had been violated because the FBI did not have a warrant to place the device.</p>
<p>At the time there was no constitutional warrant requirement to attach a GPS device so your car so he lost.  Since then the Supreme Court issued a ruling in United States v. Jones, 132 S.Ct. 945 (2012) where it held that the 4th Amendment required law enforcement to get a warrant before installing a GPS device tracking device on your car.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the U.S. it is your constitutional right to privacy (4th amendment). This right may be suspended, without your knowledge or consent, by the judicial branch on behalf of any number of government agencies, the FBI included (CIA is slightly different regarding the hurdles involved). </p>
<p>Now once the judicial branch has suspended your right to privacy the agents that requested the warrant whether it be to electronically monitor your movements, tap your phone, even search your house without your knowledge, have decent latitude to employ whatever techniques they feel necessary to carry out the &quot;searches&quot; specified in the warrant. </p>
<p>Now in the case you are referring to, anything used in accordance with the &quot;search&quot; is legally allowed to be there. Any intentional disruption of this &quot;search&quot; by an outside party could technically be considered obstruction and the action of selling property that is not yours can certainly be considered theft. </p>
<p>Now, based on your description, it seems as if the FBI in this case chose not to pursue any criminal charges instead opting for civil proceedings where they were much more likely to win a 'destruction of property' type case. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no single surveillance policy for these agencies. If you're talking specifically about electronic surveillance or wiretapping, the most basic &quot;policy&quot; is that neither agency can target anyone protected by the constitution (American citizens anywhere, and others in the US) without a warrant (with a few constitutional exceptions, including if evidence is going to disappear and they don't have time to get a warrant).  </p>
<p>The &quot;surveillance policy&quot; that has been getting attention in recent weeks is called Section 702.  It's part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and although you can't target Americans with it, and technically you still have to comply with the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. BUT the way it works as a practical matter is you collect a bunch of information, THEN say &quot;oops, some of that was from American citizens&quot; and then you have to go, &quot;la la la didn't see that!&quot;  I don't know of any instances of the CIA using Section 702, but we learned about some 702-authorized NSA programs in the Snowden leaks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Policies will vary between agencies, jurisdictions, etc.  In general, a warrant is needed by the FBI.  The CIA cannot operate on US territory, so their options are much greater.</p>
<p>With regard to all the news about Trump being &quot;wire-tapped&quot;, the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC, also called the FISA Court) is a U.S. federal court established and authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) to oversee requests for surveillance warrants against foreign spies inside the United States.  This is the domain of the FBI, as the surveillance occurs within the USA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
