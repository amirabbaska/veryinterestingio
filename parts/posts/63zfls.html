We also have a patient who is a professional medium.</p>
<p>Personally I think that they're just awful frauds preying on people's emotions and gullibility, but what I do find interesting is that between all of the usual &quot;your father is here, he loves you and is with you always&quot; patter, there is specific, personal information, that they don't really have any way of knowing. Obviously some of it could have been overheard, and I assume guesswork plays a big part; people are more likely to remember the one time the psychic was right over the 20 times they were wrong, especially if they <em>want</em> to believe it. But it still seems too accurate to be pure guesswork.</p>
<p>So, how do they know all this stuff? How are they able to be accurate enough to convince otherwise intelligent, rational people that they can speak to dead people?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to put it out there, unless a particular situation is manipulative/problematic, I would let your coworkers believe what they want - whatever makes a really difficult job a little easier to deal with.  </p>
<p>edit: &quot;But (1)some/(2)every situation is manipulative/problematic!&quot;  </p>
<p>(1) For the one's that are problematic, I would absolutely espouse some kind of resolution - do not allow people you care about to be taken advantage of in detrimental ways, or for anyone's superstitions to affect their professional responsibilities.   </p>
<p>(2)<br />
<strong>On the psychic side</strong>, sure - psychics are always manipulative, if not outright delusional. I would probably advocate strictly regulating the whole practice, or at least slapping a bright neon disclaimer on it; it wouldn't take much for me to believe it should be outlawed all together.<br />
<strong>On the believer side</strong>, it is simply false that it is always problematic to believe in psychics or to hold other superstitions. If you think it is <em>always</em> a problem to believe such things, show me an argument that can handle the abundance of counterexamples of people who believe crazy things to the benefit of themselves and those around them. Such counterexamples are by no means the majority, but they're also not uncommon. Simply <em>assuming</em> all situations are identical and that you can apply universal policies to them without taking account of particularity is itself a falsehood, and one that - as I agree is the case with superstition - can <em>often</em> do more harm than good. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, for a number of years, while living on the road, I made my way by psychic readings. My grift was using I Ching diviniations. If you were at a Phish concert in the early 90's or other outdoor gathering, I might have been there in my tent. Long hair, beads, sitting cross-legged. My two traveling companions would work the crowd.</p>
<p>They would strike up conversation with somebody. Talk about an amazing experience they just had with a fortune teller. Along the way they would gather some basic information before directing them my way. We had a basic code worked out. Crossed arms. If they had one finger out, the person lost somebody. 2 fingers meant a recent breakup. So on and so forth.</p>
<p>Now, doing a reading is a combination of &quot;cold&quot; reads and &quot;hot&quot; reads. &quot;Cold&quot; is where there is <em>no</em> information given before hand.</p>
<p>Here's the big trick. The person giving the read has to both believe in what they're doing and disbelieve at the same time. It's an odd head space to be in.</p>
<p>So the mark is led in, and I see there's one finger up. They say &quot;I heard you do readings?&quot;. I would look up and make eye contact. Longer than is comfortable. When their gaze broke, I would smile and say &quot;I sense a feeling of grief about you. A loss.&quot; and then break into the patter of how the I Ching represents the binary code of the universe, and how all around us are reoccurring patterns that can offer insight.</p>
<p>From there, it's a bit of showmanship. Throw down the sticks, etc.</p>
<p>For a cold reading, it's easier than it seems. First, your mark <em>always</em> gives you free information. Names, relations, etc. You just need to listen. When you parrot them back later, they've forgotten they ever said anything to you in the first place. Next, there are universal experiences that feel unique to every individual. &quot;You feel as if you are underappreciated&quot; or &quot;you feel like you're giving more of your energy than you receive in return&quot;. Everyone has a love they still hold on to that they fail to tell anyone else about. Everyone has memory of a smell that reminds them of someone. Those sorts of things.</p>
<p>You don't even need to be good, or even smart. Memory is an amazing thing. I could get twenty things wrong, but if I got one thing right, the marks memory of the event is that I got <em>everything</em> right.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you're there to listen to them. To offer them a sympathetic ear. You become their confidant. Your advice is vague enough that they apply it to whatever they had already decided to do, and give you credit for it.</p>
<p>After a while, I felt pretty crappy about preying on people in need. Might be why I try to debunk those bastards every chance I get.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there are a lot of tricks. involved. </p>
<p>shotgunning - is a basically a technique which gets used all over the place where you say things that are in reality very general but relate to people personally so sound very specific. (see buzzfeeds X number of things show you come from X. hint: they are all very similar)</p>
<p>cold-reading - another technique where you basically spew a lot of bits of information and watch the target for some sort of reaction. people will generally involuntarily react when they hear the beginning of something they are thinking about, like names.<br />
Added into this if the 'medium' is close people will often jump in and correct them, whilst stil believing they are being read. </p>
<p>pre-prep - For much more targeted work, it is very possible to gather a lot of free information about someone before you ever meet. Thinks like twitter and facebook are a treasure trove of information. So if you know the details already you just need to add in the act of diving the information from them.<br />
This also works in studios etc, where they will ask you to do something like fill in a basic survey or give certain details when you buy the ticket for example. </p>
<p>they key thing to remember, is if you are seeing someone do this publicly in some sort of show, they it is likely they have practices their techniques over many hours/years. Much like magicians and sleight of hand, they are able to pick a lot of information from people that might not seem immediately obvious unless you have the expertise in looking for it.<br />
The secondary part of this is, they will always find more success with people that want to believe. These people will take something that was maybe close and in their mind remember it as almost exact becasue it reinforces their pre-existing belief that the experience was legitimate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
