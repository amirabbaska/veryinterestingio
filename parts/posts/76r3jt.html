		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are  already a lot of well-intentioned but misinformed responses here.</p>
<p>The little-known fact is that the famous E = m c^2 is universal, not at all just confined to exotic particles.</p>
<p>As a result, any and all conversions of energy convert <em>some</em> (usually tiny) amount of mass into energy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another example is hydroelectric generation. The electrical energy produced by Grand Coulee Dam's turbines every 3.7 hours represents one gram of mass. This mass passes to electrical devices (such as lights in cities) powered by the generators, where it appears as a gram of heat and light.[35] Turbine designers look at their equations in terms of pressure, torque, and RPM. However, Einstein's equations show that all energy has mass, and thus the electrical energy produced by a dam's generators, and the resulting heat and light, all retain their mass—which is equivalent to the energy. The potential energy—and equivalent mass—represented by the waters of the Columbia River as it descends to the Pacific Ocean would be converted to heat due to viscous friction and the turbulence of white water rapids and waterfalls were it not for the dam and its generators. This heat would remain as mass on site at the water, were it not for the equipment that converted some of this potential and kinetic energy into electrical energy, which can move from place to place (taking mass with it).</p>

<p>Even burning a candle converts matter into energy. We've all been influenced so strongly by science fiction in movies that we think of exotic phenomenon, but what Einstein discovered is even more remarkable precisely because it also applies to the mundane.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Matter is energy.  It's just energy that can hang around in one place.</p>
<p>Energy is really just a quantity, a value to tell you how much of various kinds of work can be done.  Energy in the form of light has a wavelength and it can't stay in one spot.  Energy in the form of matter has mass and it works to stay in one spot. Energy also acts as a measure of that work: Matter is energy that has mass and works to stay in one spot, but moving matter is even more energy that both works to stay still and push around anything that isn't moving in the same way as this moving matter.</p>
<p>What does it take to convert matter into energy? A chemical reaction will do it.  For instance, take table salt and put it in water.  The salt is soluble so it will break down from NaCl to Na+ and Cl- ions.  The bonds that held the salt together were energy as part of that matter but the bonds between the Na+ and Cl- and the solvent molecules are weaker. This means it takes energy from the water and turns it into matter (the saltwater solution).</p>
<p>Let that water evaporate and the salt will crystallize back to salt crystals, and you've created energy from the matter.</p>
<p>You seem to imply that matter is protons, neutrons and electrons.  But that's only part of the story. Protons, neutrons and electrons are a form of energy, so are the bonds between them, so are their configurations, what shell the electrons are in, etc. </p>
<p>There's no trivial way to convert those into &quot;pure energy&quot; and even still, what is &quot;pure energy&quot;? They are, essentially, pure energy as it is. What else are they made of?  They're just somewhat stable.  But a neutron, outside of an atom, is going to decay into a proton, electron and antineutrino and release some energy, but that &quot;pure energy&quot; might be in the form of kinetic energy, it might be in the form of a high energy photon, it might be used to do something else. </p>
<p>Think of matter more like waves on the ocean. Those waves are energy, they move, they push around other waves.  If you were to create an opposite wave wave that had a trough exactly where one wave had a peak, that wave would have its own energy, adding energy to the system, but it would annihilate the wave you were looking at.  This is kind of how a matter-antimatter reaction could be imagined.  But you can't just make an opposite wave with a trough appear without creating another peak, and to do that takes energy and you end up with nothing as you just use energy to make the two waves and if they disappear the energy is returned like splashing water and letting it settle.</p>
<p>Energy is lazy.  It does nothing. You can picture a hadron kind of like three sticks that are twisted so that they all support eachother. Going to a new metaphor, think of these three sticks creating a little raft that can float on a wave on the ocean. </p>
<p>You're asking essentially how to break those apart.  But you kind of need other sticks floating on the ocean to break them apart. If you do, they will quickly sink unless the parts bump into something else that turns them into a raft.  This is unlikely to happen though. The only reason the rafts were built in the first place is that a giant explosion caused a lot of these sticks to smash into eachother and some of them made stable structures out of two or three sticks.  The rest of the sticks just kind of knock things around instead of floating on the surface. </p>
<p>When we make a bomb, we are converting matter into energy and it causes an explosion.  We are converting part of the matter that makes up, say the bonds in some nitrate into kinetic energy (which is really still part of the resultant matter), heat energy (which you might also say is part of the resultant matter), photons, and other results.</p>
<p>When we make a nuclear bomb, we are essentially converting matter that keeps one element together into other forms of energy, which causes a chain reaction breaking apart other atoms and releasing some of that energy.</p>
<p>But if you were to straight up convert matter directly into energy, it would be quite boring honestly. Matter is interesting, energy is much less so.  What would the energy do? It's not going to kinetically push stuff around, there wouldn't be an explosion because that requires matter.  It's not going to heat anything up, that requires matter. You'll release a bunch of very high energy photons, which unless they interact with matter don't actually ... well, matter.  And if they do interact with matter, now your system is no longer talking about completely converting matter into energy.  Now like many other reactions it's talking about converting some portion of matter in a system to energy.</p>
<p>The other thing is that because energy is lazy, if it's in a stable configuration its because it's easy for it to stay that way. You want to change that, you need a lot of energy to start with, and then you need to make sure it doesn't just find another stable configuration to go back to. Unless you have a direct recipe to annihilate something, even if you break it up, it's going to decay into other things that you might not consider &quot;pure energy&quot;.  </p>
<p>To blow apart hadrons into photons you would need a ridiculous amount of energy. I'm not sure how much, but very much.  Aside from the impracticality of this, this would release a lot of energy.  But the other thing to consider is that during the big bang when there was also a ridiculous amount of energy, these hadrons were formed.   Could this even be possible without also having some quantity of that energy be used to create new hadrons?  But if you are already doing this you're probably not really concerned about the explosion that converting that atom into pure energy will cause, because you're likely in the big bang. </p>
<p>So yeah, reacting anti-matter with matter will create it, but that's like the waves on the ocean, either you've made both the anti-matter and matter, in which case the energy returned is the energy that you've used to create them, or you react some anti-matter that you've made with the matter that you didn't, in which case you've also had some matter left over and the energy you get is half from the anti-matter you created and half still in the matter that you created. And we can't really create or store anti-matter reliably or find it and trap it reliably. </p>
<p>Any other way of destroying matter to get its energy out would take so much energy that I don't know what would happen, but you would possibly run the risk of using up some of that energy in creating matter and might create a chain reaction that would destroy the observable universe?  Probably not. Who knows.  Where would you get that much energy to start with though?</p>
<p>If you're happy to live with protons, electrons, neutrons, neutrinos, positrons and the rest of the gang surviving the ordeal, we already have a bunch of different ways to convert matter into energy, and they can do everything from create an explosion, to light up, to warm up, to give us wifi on our computers, or let us warm our blood and move around.  If you want to change elements into lighter ones, you're looking at fission, if you want to change elements into heavier ones, you're looking at fusion.  Not all of these things create energy, breaking up things heavier than lead generally do, as does fusing things lighter than lead.  But energy is a lot of things, it's momentum, it's mass, it's temperature, it's light, it's radio waves, it's gamma rays, it's a particular electron configuration, it's molecular bonds, it's quarks, it's hadrons, it's particles.  An explosion is caused by matter with kinetic energy creating pressure through electromagnetic interactions (electrons pushing away from other electrons)  You need matter for an explosion to make sense. You need matter for time to make sense even. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest way is nuclear fission, where you shoot neutrons at a material until it breaks into smaller elements. But this only releases some of the binding energy between nucleons.</p>
<p>The alternative is matter-antimatter annihilation, where you shoot an element, like hydrogen, with its antimatter equivalent, like antihydrogen. This, in theory, results in a 100% conversion of mass to energy. The problem is that it's very difficult to make antimatter and even more difficult to store it because it annihilates as soon as it touches matter.</p>
<p>And, yes, if you had enough it would explode.</p>
<p>Also, it would take an antiiron atom to convert a whole iron atom into energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You may have a slight misconception that converting mass into energy is a special process. Actually, it is constantly ongoing in small amounts. When you turn on your flashlight and it emits light, the flashlight, if you had a very sensitive way to weigh it, would weigh a tiny bit less. When you stretch a string and load it with extra energy, it weighs a tiny bit more, and so forth. If you mean COMPLETELY convert mass into energy or vice versa, this requires conditions not usually found in every day life, such as black holes etc .. The sun, by virtue of radiating light and heat, loses mass each day .. quite a lot of mass in kg but only a small fraction of its total mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
