		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Graphene is a very new technology. Right now the benefits don't outweigh the costs of mass production, although iirc mass production of hybrid Li+/graphene supercapacitor batteries was announced this year (by Samsung I think, could be wrong). </p>
<p>It usually takes 10-15 years for new materials and designs to go from academic labs to mass production. Even the transistor didn't enter consumer technology until about a decade after its invention. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just did a term paper on this!</p>
<p>To keep it simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At this point there does not exist a cost effective method to produce high quality graphene on a large scale. You can use Hummers method to make graphene oxide flakes, which is like a mid-level quality graphene. But flakes are too small of a &quot;sheet&quot; for some applications like solar cells. For bigger sheets you need to use chemical deposition, which is really expensive but can produce higher quality graphene. But this method doesn't scale up well. </p>
</li>
<li>Carbon nanotubes were discovered years ago. And they're just graphene sheet rolled up into cylindrical tubes so they have very similar properties as graphene and is already a more established technology.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: I noticed my response was kind of generic and similar to alot of other answers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Kind of like solar panels; they are really nice in theory, but still very expensive and kinda hard to set up for the average consumer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It is absolutely amazing at everything <em>except making it out of a lab</em></p>
<p>Graphene is really good at a lot of things, but really expensive to manufacture.  Until someone can come up with a good way to make tons of graphene cheaply it'll stay in the lab and other specialized(read high budget) applications</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
