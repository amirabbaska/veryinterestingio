		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure it's 25%</p>
<p>Formula for percent error is </p>
<p>|(actual value - <del>experimental</del> estimated value)| / actual value</p>
<p><del>In this case the economist's estimate would serve as the experimental value,</del> so</p>
<p>|(4 - 3)| / 4 = .25</p>
<p>edit: added absolute value bars for clarity. value is scalar, not vector</p>
<p>edit 2: all semantics, but &quot;experimental&quot; was confusing and ambiguous</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both of the following statement are mathematically accurate:</p>
<p>Actual growth was 33% more than predicted.</p>
<p>Predicted growth was 25% less than the actual growth.</p>
<p>Here's another way of looking at it with just hard numbers:</p>
<p>4 is about 33% more than 3.</p>
<p>3 is 25% less than 4.</p>
<p><em>BUT</em> as others are pointing out, conventionally error is described as a percentage of actual results. The different was one pp, the actual was 4, so we call that an error of 25% even though it's <em>also</em> accurate to say growth was 33% more than predicted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actuary here, common question.</p>
<p>When talking about percentage change, you've got to provide context, and should avoid introducing a percentage that they're off.</p>
<p>For example, what if real growth was 0.01%?, is the economist off by [(0.01% - 3.00%)] / (0.01%) = 29900%. That's not useful information.</p>
<p>It's best to say what you said: 3% was predicted, actual was 4%. You will only ever introduce confusion by stating, &quot;so they were off by 33%.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
