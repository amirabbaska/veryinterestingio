Would a meltdown be much more survivable if it was under 20 feet of water? Oh what about underground reactors?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the response so far :) But another issue is why not deep under ground such as in deep cave systems where a space has been created or in mountain where  it can provide additional shielding? Basically why build it where they are built right now?</p></div></div>
