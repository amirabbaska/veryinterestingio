		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to address the  &quot;30 years ago cars were simple to fix&quot; part:</p>
<p>30 years ago, your average automobile had an engine that would need rebuilding a lot sooner than the cars we drive today.
30 years ago, parts were more expensive, most people' available sources for parts were much more limited, and information on how to fix something was not freely available on the internet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes that's the intent.  &quot;I'll fix it up later&quot; and then they never get to it.  We've got a couple cars parked in the yard that need attention, but there are other priorities on the plate right now.  </p>
<p>As far as the woods goes...  Is it possible that it wasn't always woods?  Could have been a field?  The back yard of our property is wooded....but it hasn't been that was forever.  I found picnic benches and things back there that were set up as though to be used.  I imagine that they were fields 40 years or so ago.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of abandoned cars like that were stolen.. If there aren't environmental/property concerns, it may be decided that the cost of extracting the car is more than the car is worth. It's common around here for stolen cars to get shoved off embankments when they're being disposed of.. There's not <em>usually</em> bodies in them..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
