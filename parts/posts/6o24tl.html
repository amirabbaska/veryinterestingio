		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an example of what's called &quot;ablaut reduplication&quot;. An &quot;ablaut&quot; is a specific type of change in a vowel sound; &quot;reduplication&quot; is repeating something exactly or almost exactly.</p>
<p>In English, the vowels in an ablaut reduplication nearly always follow the same pattern: &quot;i&quot; comes before &quot;a&quot;, which comes before &quot;o&quot;. This is one of those unconscious rules of English pronunciation that we have: we have somehow learned that this is the correct order, and putting the vowels in any other order sounds &quot;wrong&quot;.</p>
<p>So we have &quot;tick, tock&quot;, &quot;tip-top&quot;, &quot;chit-chat&quot;, &quot;tittle-tattle&quot;, &quot;bish, bash, bosh&quot; and so on. If you're not British, you may not have ever heard of &quot;bish, bash, bosh&quot;, and yet it still sounds right, while &quot;bosh, bash, bish&quot; sounds more awkward (or should do).</p>
<p>In the phrase &quot;big bad wolf&quot;, this ablaut reduplication actually overrides a grammar rule: normally, adjectives describing your opinion of something should come before adjectives describing that thing's size, so it should be &quot;bad big wolf&quot;, in the same way that we say &quot;boring little man&quot; and not &quot;little boring man&quot;. But the urge to preserve the order of ablaut reduplication is much greater, so we say &quot;big bad wolf&quot;.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the gold.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: My attention has been drawn to the fact that there are other cases where &quot;big&quot; breaks the usual order of adjectives without ablaut reduplication being a factor. There's probably something else going on there, and one day I might read up on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an image I found explaining it: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/46kLQuf.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/46kLQuf.jpg</a></p>
<p>Basically it's because English has subtle rules for the order words should go in. If there's words with I, A, and O, the first is the one with I, and the second can be A or O.</p>
<p>Redditor /u/qdatk explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i-a and i-o vowels are chosen because they are maximally different from each other and hence &quot;interesting&quot; to the ear. The i comes before the a/o because a/o are longer in duration, which makes them fit better with final syllables.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason ablaut reduplication works is because of the physics of sound. Almost all sounds begin with high pitched information and end with low pitched information.
The order of vowels in ablaut reduplication is the exact order of the brightness of the vowels.
Say &quot;Fe Fi Fo Fum&quot;. Every word gets darker/lower than the first. It sounds almost like a piece of gravel bouncing down a hill, sounding further away with each bounce. </p>
<p>Sentences that are phonetically pleasing are sentences that closely match the sounds of nature. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In linguistics there is something called collocation, which is where pairs of words are always used in the same order. Examples are in and out, cream and sugar, rain or shine, suit and tie.  There's no rule about these pairs, but are used through habit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The word &quot;tick&quot; we usually pronounce with a higher tone then the word &quot;tock&quot; so its an elevated tick followed by a lower noted tock, up down up down, tick tock, tick tock.</p>
<p>When pronouncing the O in tock it drops the note of the word do to opening your mouth more than when you say tick which is tighter, more abrasive and higher.</p>
<p>If you start with Tock but start low and then go high for tick it doesn't sound nearly as awkward. Tock tick tock tick low high low high. Its saying the O as a higher noted word than the I that sounds odd.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
