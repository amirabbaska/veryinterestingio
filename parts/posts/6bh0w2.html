<p>TRAPPIST-1 is a prime candidate in the search for life beyond our solar system. It is one of the 300 closest stars to us, and hosts seven Earth-sized planets, several of which might have the right temperatures to host liquid water. It also has a remarkably precise orbital configuration. For every 2 times the outermost planet goes around the central star, the progressively interior planets each execute almost exactly 3, 4, 6, 9, 15 and 24 orbits. Such a long so-called resonant chain is unprecedented.</p>
<p>We recently translated these rhythmic planetary motions into music. We also assigned planets notes by scaling up their orbital frequencies into the human hearing range. The result is remarkably harmonious thanks to the near-perfect period ratios between planets. You can learn more and experience the awful cacophony generated by more normal systems at <a href="http://www.system-sounds.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.system-sounds.com" target="_blank">http://www.system-sounds.com</a></a>.</p>
<p>One puzzle that has loomed since the discovery of TRAPPIST-1 is how such a tightly spaced system of planets can avoid destroying itself due to repeated gravitational tugs. Our research has revealed a solution that relies on the same harmonic pattern responsible for creating such beautiful music. </p>
<p>Thought Cafe, the animation team behind the video is also joining us.</p>
<p>We'll be on around 3:30 PM ET (19:30 UT). Ask Us Anything!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently read an article that put a damper on everyone's excitement for this system. Apparently the activity of the star was such that the solar wind from it would be much more violent than our own, and hence these planets would need very strong magnetospheres in order to be habitable.</p>
<p>Any comments on this? Is there a way to test for the existence of a magnetosphere on an exoplanet? Is the solar wind in this system really as harsh as I'd heard?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
