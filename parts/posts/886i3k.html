		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, your map of Mercury was built by assembling lots of pictures taken by Mariner 10, and the &quot;flat plain&quot; is an area where data is missing.  But the missing data problem is worse than it looks!  Your map shows the <em>good</em> side of Mercury.  Here's a rectangular map that shows everything we knew about Mercury until a few years ago:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/images/content/285929main_img5.1.jpg" target="_blank">https://www.nasa.gov/images/content/285929main_img5.1.jpg</a></p>
<p>Your strip of missing data shows up, but <strong>one whole side of the planet is blank!</strong>  We had no idea what this side looked like until the Messenger spacecraft arrived 40 years later in 2011.</p>
<p>The reason is kind of interesting: Mercury rotates on its axis 3 times for every 2 times it goes around the sun.  The Mariner 10 spacecraft flew by Mercury once every 2 times Mercury went around the sun... and so each time it flew by, the same side of Mercury was facing away from the sun, in darkness and impossible to photograph.</p>
<p>NASA knew about this, of course, but there wasn't enough fuel to get Mariner 10 into a better orbit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="https://www.space.com/4839-enduring-mysteries-mercury.html" target="_blank">this site</a> there has only been one mission to mercury. It said only 45% of it has been mapped. I'm assuming that the blank is not a giant plaine, but the 5% of that side of the planet that was not mapped.</p>
<p>Edit: The source is outdated. There has been a more recent mission to mercury that took better pictures. Read other comments for more details. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It looks like missing satellite scan data. Survey satellites usually use polar orbits to map a planet's surface, taking hundreds (if not thousands) of separate images which get composited into images like this one. For whatever reason, the imagery for the &quot;plains&quot; sections is missing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a composite picture. The giant &quot;plain&quot; is just a gap that wasn't
photographed up close. They probably filled it either by averaging
the colors of the rest of the image, or with a lower resolution image
from further away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
