		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sulfur is only noxious in  excessive amounts, and in appropriate amounts is actually a vital nutrient for plants. Beans and peas need sulfur for their nitrogen fixing symbiotic bacteria to thrive. All plants need sulfur to make chlorophyll and some vitamins. The characteristic smell of onions  is  because of some sulfur compounds the onion plant makes, and some compounds in broccoli that seem to fight cancer are sulfur compounds.  </p>
<p>Also, adding a little elemental sulfur to the soil will provide a slow, but long lasting change to the PH of the soil as beneficial bacteria slowly convert it to a form the plants will use. Pouring vinegar on the dirt with cause a shocking but very temporary change that will kill many plants, but leave the soil just as alkaline as it was before, once the vinegar breaks down. Which doesn't take long.</p>
<p>Vinegar actually makes a good weed killer, because it's pretty toxic to plants but breaks down completely into harmless compounds in a fairly short time. From a plants point of view, vinegar is the noxious chemical, not sulfur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sulphur is no more noxious than acetic acid in the right concentrations. Vinegar is less than 5%. Generally the best way to change soil PH is to use a high acid fertilizer, like ones made for hydrangea,  dogwood, ezalia, gardinia, or rhododendron. Use them as often as possible for a couple years. Changing soil acidity is a slow process.</p>
<p>Edit: almost all fertilizer is acidic, except lawn fertilizer. Most plants absorb nutrients most efficiently at a PH between 5.2 and 6.2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My extension office recommended ammonium sulfate on my lawn because my soil has a high alkalinity. It doesn't last as long as extended-release fertilizers but it does make a difference. I also had to auger some holes around a yellowing maple (iron chlorosis) and add sulfur to the soil with iron chelate. Tree is fine now with annual treatments. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
