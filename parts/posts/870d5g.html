		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The original duck hunt was designed for CRT televisions and would not work on an LCD. A CRT (cathode ray tube) works by spraying a stream of electrons at a screen which has pixels that glow when the electrons hit it. The spray progressively sweeps from left to right; top to bottom. It would do this about 100 times per second. </p>
<p>The duck hunt gun was a small focusing lens and a white light sensor (like a solar panel but optimized for sensing). </p>
<p>When you pull the trigger, the whole screen displays black for a few microseconds and then the area around the ducks lit up as white squares one at a time. Each duck gets its on flash one at a time. When the gun saw a white square through its photosensor, the game would stop progressing through squares and report it hit that duck based on the timing. </p>
<p><strong>Edit: thank you for the gold kind stranger!</strong>
<strong>I'll post this as a bonus.</strong> Duck hunt already made me go viral once before. It turned me into a meme in college. After getting second in a dorm duck hunt drinking tournament, we stole the controller and posted this to college humor:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It actually works on the same principle.  What do you think the sensor bar does?</p>
<p>The Wiimote, just like the NES light gun, is a <em>camera</em>.  You can learn more about it in <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/johnny_lee_demos_wii_remote_hacks" target="_blank">this old TED talk</a>.  The Wiimote sees light from the sensor bar, sends the location of that light to the Wii, and the Wii calculates where the Wiimote is pointing.</p>
<p>But wait, you say.  The sensor bar is a sensor; it doesn't emit light!  NOPE.  The &quot;sensor bar&quot; is nothing but a pair of light bulbs at either end, but you can't see the light because it's infrared.  However, it's <em>near</em> infrared, so if you point your cell phone camera at the sensor bar, you'll be able to see the lights!  Same thing with your TV remote, actually.  Your Wiimote camera sees the two lights on the sensor bar and relays that information to the Wii.  But really, any infrared source will work.  You can use a pair of incandescent bulbs or even candles.</p>
<p>The NES light gun works on the same principle, though with with so much less processing power, Duck Hunt uses tricks to know whether you hit a duck rather than calculating the position of the gun.  The light gun is still a camera, but instead of seeing a sensor bar, the light gun sees what's on the actual screen, though only with a narrow angle.  The game puts signals on the actual screen that the camera reads; in this case, it flashes the screen and the ducks' hit boxes in different ways and the light gun sends to the console what it saw in the small region it was looking at.</p>
<p>In both cases, the whole thing is a misdirection.  The products are shaped and marketed to make you think that the console is seeing these toy items you're holding -- we all know that guns shoot things <em>out</em>, for example, so obviously the gun is shooting a signal that is being received somehow, just like in laser tag, right? -- but in reality, the opposite is happening; the TV is shooting the signals to the gun, which is the receiver, not the sender.  Same with the Wii; the Wii tells you that it has a &quot;sensor bar&quot;, which is obviously a sensor, sensing things, but in reality, the sensor is in the Wiimote and the sensor bar is nothing but a pair of infrared LEDs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Kinect is a real camera that can really see you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you held the zapper all the way at the end of the wire and just pointed at the screen and pulled the trigger, you would never miss. I'm not sure if it had anything to do with the size of the tv, but we stayed up one night and played until the scoreboard flipped. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
