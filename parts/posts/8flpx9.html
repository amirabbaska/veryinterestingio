		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their submission date would by necessity be <em>after</em> the original submission, and therefore not valid.</p>
<p>The original submitter would have record of the date and easily win any legal challenge.</p>
<p>I'd imagine there's also something in the job description about this (like how McDonald's employees can't win McDonald's contests), but I can't say that for certain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>
<p>99.99% of patent applications aren't worth stealing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patent examiners, at least in the United States, can't file for patents.</p>
</li>
<li>Everything is scanned into electronic databases, assigned sequential application numbers based on filing date, and opened up for public inspection during the entire prosecution process so there's a huge papertrail and it's pretty much impossible to create a phony application and backdate it to establish prior invention.</li>
</ol>
<p>It would take a grand conspiracy to pull that one off, you would need a number of people working at multiple levels within the patent office with the highest levels of network administrative privileges, and you would have to file dummy applications with the sole intentions of swapping them out at a later date with inventions lifted from patent applications that haven't even been filed yet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a patent. As for today, there is no way someone could rip you off because we needed 6 lawyers and a ton of paper work to get ours passed. Those guys gave their name on it and 2 of them were patent lawyers. God forbid someone tried to rip us off because they would have their heads on a pike.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The patent submitter has proof of prior work, so that if the patent clerk changed the name to theirs, the originator can make a strong case in court with all their evidence of research and development, even basic motive, and prior drafts of the patent, along with research and lawyer bills. The clerk may not even know what the patent is even for, let alone prove they have the competency to have invented it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
