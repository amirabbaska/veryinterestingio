		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A somewhat counter-intuitive thing about temperature is that it is an aggregate property - so it is well-defined for a large group, but not so well for a few atoms. It is basically a function of the average velocity of molecules.</p>
<p>Individual molecules, however, have a distribution of velocities. You can think of this as a result of an infinite series of random collisions between atoms and molecules. For example, sometimes you can have two particles that happen to travel in almost the same direction impact a third one. That third one is going to get a hell of a kick and go must faster than any of the three were traveling to begin with.</p>
<p>As a result, some water molecules are quite faster than the average corresponding to the temperature. So they can achieve &quot;escape velocity,&quot; or get kicked out, depending on your perspective. And they fly off.</p>
<p>This is also the mechanism behind evaporative cooling. Since the molecules with the highest kinetic energy are the ones that are leaving, the average kinetic energy of those remaining drops, and so does the temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Boiling point&quot; does not mean &quot;evaporation point&quot;. It means &quot;the point at which the vapor pressure exceeds pressure in the liquid phase.&quot; In other words, if you make a bubble in the liquid, the pressure in the vapor will be higher than the surrounding liquid, causing the bubble to expand, in other words: &quot;boiling.&quot; Another way of looking at it, is if you take a cup of water and put a lid on it, then if you are below the boiling point, there will be evaporation until the air above the liquid becomes so saturated that there is an equal amount of evaporation and condensation, you so reach equilibrium between the liquid and vapor phases. On the other hand if you are above boiling point, the pressure in the cup will rise (or if it's a big enough cup that the pressure rise is small enough that you can ignore the effect of the pressure rise on the boiling point, then the water will eventually evaporate away completely). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Likely to get buried but I would like to offer an explanation from a thermodynamic standpoint that is more concerned with chemical equilibria that is actually pretty simple to understand. </p>
<p>Assuming that we're at a set temperature and atmospheric pressure, all liquids exist in chemical equilibrium with their gaseous state, which means that at any given point in time, there exists, say water, in both its liquid and gas state in a fixed ratio. This also means that the rate at which water is becoming a liquid is the same at which water is becoming a gas. You can shift equilibrium (change the ratio of liquid to gas state) by changing temperature. Obviously, at increasing temperatures, we're going to have more gaseous water than liquid water. </p>
<p>Even at room temperature, we're going to be in chemical equilibrium, albeit, liquid water is going to be more prominent. However, gaseous water doesn't need to condense back within the reservoir of water that it originated from. Because we're in equilibrium, more and more water is going to leave as a gas and get lost into the atmosphere as long as we're not at absolute zero. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Temperatures are an estimation of the energy of the molecules in a substance. Some molecules have a ridiculous amount of energy and they simply bounce around like crazy until they fly away.
When we boil water, we simply give most of the molecules enough energy to fly away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water evaporating into air is similar to a solid dissolving into a liquid. </p>
<p>If you place a sugar cube in a cup of water, some of the molecules will slowly dissolve into the liquid. This will happen faster if you add heat, and slower if there is already some sugar dissolved in the water. As long as the water is not saturated, sugar will dissolve since it is moving from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration (due to entropy).</p>
<p>Unless the air is fully saturated with water (i.e. is completely humid), water will slowly &quot;dissolve&quot; into the air. At higher temperatures, this happens faster, and at higher humidity, this happens slower. This is partly why humid days feels much hotter: your body cools down when sweat evaporates off your skin, and evaporation is slower at higher humidity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
