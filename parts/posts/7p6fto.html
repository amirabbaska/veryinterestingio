<ul>
<li>water is liquid</li>
<li>fats are liquid/solid in useful combination</li>
<li>a wealth of proteins and catalysts are able to facilitate our metabolism</li>
<li>it's a balance between being high enough to keep fungal infections at bay (which adversely affect cold blooded creatures) without being TOO high and putting a too high requirement on food consumption to fuel it</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For all of those posting about their body temperatures:
Everyone’s temp changes throughout the day, based on factors like cortisol level, time of day etc. Everyone fluctuates around a mean. “Yes, but 97.5 is normal for me, so 99 is a fever” isn’t a thing and only invites many unnecessary tests.
Am ER doc and see this crap all the time, especially right now during flu season. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering too since when I take a baseline temp on myself or either of my children, it comes back at 97.7F. not 98.6F. my sister runs the other way 99.8F is her standard temp- so when she got  her temp taken @ school and they send her home for 99.9F But I had to sit it out at 99.9 even though I actually had the fever and she was just herself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
