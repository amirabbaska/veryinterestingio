		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm Dr. Christina Nicolaidis and I'm editor of a brand new peer-reviewed journal called <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/toc/aut/0/0" target="_blank">Autism in Adulthood</a>. I teach social work at Portland State University and internal medicine at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland, Oregon.  There's a lot of talk about autism in children, but not as much about autism among adults.  That's why we just launched this new academic journal. Our goal is to cover the most pressing issues affecting autistic adults, from emerging adulthood to later life. I am particularly excited about including autistic adults in our new journal - as editorial board members, authors, reviewers and readers. As a doctor and a services researcher, my own research is focused on how people on the autism spectrum can get better access to health care services. Many autistic adults don't get the health care they need, resulting in more health problems and shorter life expectancy.  Ask me anything about the new journal or the ways that people on the autism spectrum can get better care. </p>
<p>We'll be on at 1 p.m. Pacific (4 PM ET, 21 UT), we're looking forward to the session!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, thank you for this AMA. It seems that GenX adults with milder symptoms, more akin to those that used to be deemed Asperger’s before DSM-5, who were left to navigate the world before there was this current awareness, are still somewhat in a no-man’s land due to the fact that they’ve adopted certain behavioral accommodations to “pass” in social situations. Are there any specific diagnostic tools that are truly able to assess where these individuals exist on the spectrum? And if so, what treatment options exist for these now-middle-aged adults?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have two questions about autism that you may be able to answer (or maybe not, as they're pretty specific, but who knows, I may as well ask !) :</p>
<p>- First, I read that depression may make autistic people &quot;lose&quot; their special interest, but I can't find any science behind that, is that true and if it is, is there an explanation for that ? Is there any other autistic-specific symptoms of depression ?</p>
<p>- Second, a big part of adult life is love and sex, there was a poll that showed that there is less straight people in the autistic population then in the non-autistic one, do you have an explanation for that difference ? Is there any other difference between autistic and non-autistic people in that general field ?</p>
<p>Thanks for that AMA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
