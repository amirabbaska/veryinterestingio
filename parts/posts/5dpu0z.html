<p>What none of these post mention, and what you are looking for is something called the Haas-effect. Lots of people here mention Hz, and while that is certainly related you are still able to distinguish the individual beats at a low frequency.</p>
<p>This is also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedence_effect" target="_blank">Precedence effect</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;precedence effect&quot; was described and named in 1949 by Wallach et al.[3] They showed that when two identical sounds are presented in close succession they will be heard as a single fused sound. In their experiments, fusion occurred when the lag between the two sounds was in the range 1 to 5 ms for clicks, and up to 40 ms for more complex sounds such as speech or piano music. When the lag was longer, the second sound was heard as an echo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the real answer is, depending on your metronome sound it will range from 1 ms (60000 BPM) to around 40 ms (1500 BPM) between each click where you can no longer distinguish each hit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Steve Lehman in his <a href="https://slehman.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/document/pdf/3/StephenHLehmanDissertation.pdf" target="_blank">dissertation</a> talks about the highest perceivable tempo.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Parncutt also suggests a standard tempo range of 67-150 BPM, finding that listeners stop hearing durations as regular pulses below 33 BPM (1800 seconds) and start grouping individual pulses into larger units above 300 BPM (200 milliseconds). Parncutt’s proposed limits on the perception of tempo (200-
1800 milliseconds) can also be directly related to a listener’s physical ability to reproduce isochronous durations. Bruno Repp (2005) has cited 100 milliseconds as the shortest physically reproducible duration and 1800 milliseconds as the longest such duration. 1800 milliseconds (33 BPM) corresponds to Parncutt’s lower limit of tempo perception and the duration of 100 milliseconds, is half the value of Parcutt’s upper limit of 200 milliseconds. For many music theorists, the
very notion of tempo is contingent upon the ability to perceive symmetrical divisions of a regular pulse, usually in ratios of 2:1 or 3:1. Given our apparent inability to reproduce, and perceive regular sub-pulses shorter than 100 milliseconds, Parncutt’s upper limit of tempo perception (200 milliseconds) can be viewed as a logical threshold. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For reference 16th notes around 150 bpm are approximately 100 ms. So 16th notes in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNRCvG9YtYI" target="_blank">Radiohead's Weird Fishes</a> are approximately 100ms long each. It's not exact, but it might give you a frame of reference for how long that duration is. </p>
<p>It's not exactly what you asked about, but it does give you a place to start and should someone not come along with a full answer you could try looking through the sources. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen some good explanations in here about a few things but I don't quite think they are what OP is asking about. I don't have an exact answer but check out [this video]( <a href="https://youtu.be/AEu9LLQpOF8" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/AEu9LLQpOF8</a>). When the gun fires at 600 pounds per minute (think beats per minute) it's pretty easy to hear distinct shots (beats). But when it fires at 30,000 rounds per minute it sounds like a tone as opposed to individual shots. So the answer is obviously somewhere between 600 and 30,000 bom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Psycho-acoustics and perception are not areas where you can draw strict boundaries between stimuli and their perception. </p>
<p>Still, one fascinating concept is what we call the &quot;thickness of the present&quot;, which is about 100ms (or 10 Hz) and is tied to our central nervous system rather than our perceptual system. In a rough approximation, it is the &quot;internal clock rate&quot; of our brain. It is the time span within which 2 successive and appropriate stimuli will be merged into one single percept more or less appropriately , because your brain cannot separate them for individual processing.</p>
<p>So, take a sequence of consistent pictures presented to you: at 12 to 24 Hz, your brain starts merging the one after the next, and you see a smooth animation instead of successive pictures. Similarly, at about 12 to 20Hz, appropriately formed audio waves start to be perceived as a low bass sound instead of a wobbling pulse. Similar effects can be perceived with touch (using grainy surfaces that you brush with your fingers).</p>
<p>But this does not work for everything. In audio as in video, the merging between successive stimuli to interpret them at a higher level can only occur if there is some sort of consistency between them. Very fast sequences of white noise are still interpreted as beats at 40Hz. Conversely, a sound with lots of energy in the higher harmonics can be perceived as an infra-bass sound lower than 10Hz , as our ears can reconstruct a low fundamental frequency from its harmonics.</p>
<p>Rather than set absolute boundaries, you may want to play and discover for yourself these effects, by using a tool such as <a href="http://highc.org" target="_blank">http://highc.org</a> . In this tool, while it's not its end goal, you can place and modulate audio signals between 0.0001Hz and 20kHz on a continuous scale.  If you place sounds around the line of 20Hz, you can hear the transition from beats to low audio for various stimuli.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The technical answer is this:</p>
<p>It you play two very short pulses, first at the same time and then gradually farther apart, you hear them split up in the high frequencies first. You can easily detect 60.000 BPM above 2kHz. </p>
<p>In the low frequencies, you need a bigger time difference to detect separation. For 60Hz, think of 600 BPM. </p>
<p>(I had to learn this to do good speaker design and tuning. The placement of subs is less critical than the curve of a line array, for example)</p>
<p>For the artistic answer, listen to Kontakte, by K. Stockhausen. About halfway, there's a tone that gets lower and lower, until it gets broken up in separate chunks of soundwaves, that become a beat rather than a tone. </p>
<p>For a more popmusic approach of this, listen to Funk Soul Brother by fatboy Slim. This edit goes up!</p>
<p>What you will notice in both cases, is that there's no sudden moment in which a pitch becomes a beat. They gradually go from one into the other. The separation can be clear in the high harmonics, while the low harmonics are one sound. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
