		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>In theory</strong>.....Under communism, the end result of socialism, work is voluntary and lacks any material incentives. The number of mentally and physically healthy people who would not want to work, especially when work has become less alienating and less strenuous, is minuscule. A post-scarcity society can more than support them. Apathy is often a sign of mental illness, such as depression and many forms of psychosis, and the mentally ill would receive the necessary support as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the former socialist GDR  (east germany) people could choose what Job they wanted to do. Most of the time. If your parents where not fully in line with the system you wouldn't be allowed to study. In all companys only people in line would get promoted. If you were considered to be a weak link you might not get a car, don't get a bigger apartment even after you have a family. The state would make you feel his power. A real dissident would lose his job and maybe end up in jail.</p>
<p>People who refused to work, were considered as anti-social punks. (Sometimes they really where punks; pop culture, youth movement)</p>
<p>They could even be prosecuted. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the Soviet communist system, each factory or community would form it's own Communist Party committee and elect a leader.  That leader would then be a representative to a higher committee.  That committee would elect it's own leader(s) who would then serve on another higher committee.  At the top level, there was the <em>Party Congress</em> and the <em>Central Committee</em>.  Theoretically, the top level committees could direct and divide work as they saw fit.  Often, these decisions were delegated down to lower committees, all the way down to individual communities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Work was divided by central planners. In Soviet Russia there was quite literally an office of several thousand people who planned out the economy.</p>
<p>Workers were given quotas to fulfill. For example, a car factory owner would be told to make X amount of cars. He and his workers would be reimbursed with rations and housing. Not only this, but the government officers who enforced quotas were themselves subject to quotas. Those who did not meet quotas were threatened with years of imprisonment. This applied to every single area of the economy, from farming to clothes making.</p>
<p>An economy requires many interactions between different enterprises. If factory A required materials from factory B, the owner of factory A would place an order with the central planning office who would issue quotas to factory B. Any distribution of resources required goverment approval.</p>
<p>This resulted in many inefficient situations, for example tonnes of food rotting away while people went hungry, simply due to the difficulty of managing an entire economy and distributing resources.</p>
<p>The theory of communism plays on quite subtle understandings of economics. If you read Marx's theories, it is not immediately obvious how flawed they are. Unfortunately it has taken practice and the suffering of millions to show the problems with communism. If you're interested in further reading on this topic, I recommend reading some of economist  Dr. Thomas Sowell's works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
