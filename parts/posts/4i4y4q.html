<p><strong>From Dr. Noto:</strong> I been fascinated by ancient life for as long as I can remember. At heart I am a paleoecologist, interested in fossil organisms as once living things inhabiting and interacting with each other and their environment. Currently I am an assistant professor in Biological Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside.</p>
<p><strong>From Dr. Drumheller-Horton:</strong> My research falls into two broad fields: taphonomy (the study of everything that happens to an organism from when it dies until when we find it) and crocodylian evolution/behavior. I am an assistant adjunct professor and lecturer in Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of Tennessee.</p>

<p><strong>Texas was a very different place 95 million years ago.</strong> Dinosaurs and crocodiles dominated a lush coast, preserved as a rich fossil bed in Dallas-Forth Worth called the Arlington Archosaur Site (AAS). The AAS is an important, productive fossil locality that preserves a previously unknown fauna from this part of North America. </p>
<p>The rocks here contain a rare record of ecosystem transition, when major groups of dinosaurs and other animals were changing significantly. The AAS preserves a nearly complete coastal ecosystem, providing an unparalleled glimpse into the life that existed here over 95 million years ago. Thousands of specimens have been recovered including previously unknown dinosaurs, crocodiles, turtles, mammals, amphibians, fish, invertebrates, and plants. The diversity, abundance, and quality of the material is extraordinary. </p>
<p>The site is run in partnership with amateur volunteers, creating a unique citizen-science initiative with far-reaching education opportunities for the surrounding community. You can find us on Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Arlington-Archosaur-Site-188601874524788/" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

<p>We will be back at 1:30ET to answer your questions. Ask us anything!</p>
<p><strong>Edit: and we're off! Thank you so much for a great AMA!</strong></p></div></div>
