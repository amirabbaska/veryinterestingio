		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are intrinsically, extraordinarily bad at judging risk.</p>
<p>Things we do every day that are incredibly dangerous (ex: driving) do not provoke a fear response in us, due to habituation.  Meanwhile, extraordinarily rare but spectacular and scary events (ex: terrorist attack, plane crash, etc.) preoccupy our brain with fear because of how random, novel, and powerless we feel about them.</p>
<p>This causes our brain circuitry to mess up, and get legitimately scared about say, being in a crash while on a plane, even though we felt safe and comfortable on the car ride there, which was <em>literally</em> a million times more likely to kill us.</p>
<p>Nuclear suffers from this.  A lot.  When you look at nuclear's track record in terms of environmental damage, damage to human health, deaths, etc. it is orders of magnitude safer than coal, gas, or oil.  Thousands of times.  (Fun fact:  there is an environmentally significant oil pipeline rupture approximately every 14 days in the US.  But like driving, we're habituated to it and do not factor in that risk anymore.)</p>
<p>But nuclear, because it is rare, explosive, involves radiation, and tends to be pretty disruptive when something <em>does</em> go wrong (ex: Chernobyl, Fukushima), our brains place these incidents far higher in our minds in terms of perceived danger and risk.  We obsess on them more and want to take dramatic action to reduce the chances, even at extraordinary cost.  And even when it doesn't make any actual logical sense.  (Ex: you get significantly more daily radiation exposure living near a coal plant than a nuclear one.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear energy gets a bad rap due to incidents like Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Fukushima. To many people, what they know about nuclear energy is mostly dominated by the (rare) disasters. It make nuclear power come across as dangerous to your average voter so they are likely to vote for parties that make it a point to close nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>Mind, there are genuine dangers and problems to be resolved like nuclear waste, but the actual statistical danger of this and the way people perceive this danger is very different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the plants in Switzerland are very old, and have design flaws.  Newer reactors would be safer but are very expensive (more than 10 billion USD each).  So Switzerland wants to close down all the extremely old reactors before a problem starts.</p>
<p>This is fine.  Being pro nuclear is not the same as being pro worn out nuclear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not only about risks. It's about contaminated waste and where to store it. Germany, for example, has yet to find a place to store the tons of nuclear waste that need to be stored safely for millions of years. The search and temporary storage have costed the tax payer billions and will continue to cost billions as there's no end in sight. That's why the cheap nuclear waste is a illusion,maybe not in every country, but surely in Germany and many other European countries who have not found a way to store waste safely. It's cheap and clean on paper until you have to deal with the waste. Than it becomes insanely dirty (some temporary places have leaked in Germany) and unjustifiably expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since people are defending nuclear power indirectly by saying the fears are overblown (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_and_radiation_accidents_and_incidents" target="_blank">and they're right</a>), I will point out a few things.</p>
<p>For one, all these incidents were accidents.  While few in number, and fail safes are getting bigger, one can't discount that accidents happen.  When it comes to nuclear energy, it really only has to happen once.  Once it does, it's done.  You can't take back Chernobyl - not within our lifetime, nor the next.  Life is returning but on a molecular level it's different.</p>
<p>It's also just as feasible to use renewable energy.  Nuclear energy is amazing but other technologies have caught up and are more consumer-friendly.  Not everyone's going to have a nuclear reactor in their backyard but we can all install some form of wind and solar technology that is itself renewable.</p>
<p>Switzerland has enough wind and sun (even Germany has enough sun, put it that way) that they can afford to switch over, and since nuclear has a bad rap, it's probably political suicide for anyone to push through nuclear energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
