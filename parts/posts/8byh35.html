		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I heard it explained like this on NPR: Since the genetic diversity is so great in Africa the 5 fastest AND the five slowest runners in the world are probably in Africa.  It's just that no one is looking for the 5 slowest runners.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Genetics + Altitude + Culture</p>
<p>East Africans are genetically predispositioned to be better at long distance running, (sprinting for west afaik?)</p>
<p>Any runner who trains at that altitude will have an advantage, any runner who trains all their life at that altitude will have a bigger advantage</p>
<p>Being a long distance runner became a &quot;thing&quot; to get out of poverty, so lots of kids chase that dream</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Africans, as a whole, aren't. Middle and Long distance running is dominated by a very specific region is East Africa. </p>
<p>The vast majority of the successful athletes there were born and raised at high altitude, giving them a significant advantage, over say a Dutch person. <del>Added to that, genetically many of them are tall and thin, a useful body type for long distance running.</del></p>
<p>Further more, success breads success. I did some high level middle distance running in the UK, our group of serious athletes would get maybe a dozen people at training, but most people played other sports. in Kenya in particular, running is essentially the national sport, partly down to how successful many Kenyans are at it, meaning that the talent pool at a young age is quite large.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Africa is the most genetically diverse continent by far, since the rest of us just are the descendants of the few that left. So some African populations have lived in areas suitable for long distance running for long enough to have an edge. Others not. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some speculate that many African countries use running as a form of hunting. Most animals use short bursts of speed to get away from predators, so being able to run for a long time means you can catch up to the exhausted animal and just pick it up. This leads to very skilled endurance runners</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
