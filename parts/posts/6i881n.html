		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these comments are probably wrong. Depending on what's in your freezer exactly, and when it was put in there, it shouldn't have viable preexisting eggs or larvae.</p>
<p>The blast-freezing process brings things to a temperature that kills most fly eggs, basically absolutely any that you're going to encounter. And without the blast freezing process, eggs on the surface of food (which is where most flies lay their eggs) will become nonviable in just a few days, max. If frozen slowly, the water in the egg will crystalize and rupture the egg.</p>
<p>Everything you buy in the freezer isle is blast frozen (Edit: OK, <em>Almost</em> everything). All meat that you buy with the exception of fresh-shellfish is most likely going to be egg free. And shellfish-bourne eggs don't turn in to flies, they turn into worms and other parasites. Flies generally don't lay eggs on unripe fruit. They lay eggs on wet stuff. There are exceptions, like the fig wasp, that inject eggs. But these insects need more unripe fruit to successfully have multiple generations, which wouldn't be the case here. I'm guessing OP is dealing with some sort of blowfly larva like the common house-fly.</p>
<p>Flies are very good at detecting the chemicals released as food spoils. As food spoils, it &quot;outgasses&quot;. Solids and liquids are transformed by microorganisms into gasses. These gasses take up a much greater volume than the liquid and solid precursors. This puts pressure on the magnetically sealed door. This causes your freezer to begin to &quot;burp&quot; out these fly friendly gasses. Depending on the setup, there's a decent chance that the door will open and remain open. Regardless, fly noses act like leak-detectors on your fridge. They will find small cracks, and they will gleefully sneak through failed U-traps. Food in ziplock-bags will liquify, burst, and spill all over the freezer floor, weakening the magnetic seals, and luring flies to lay eggs right on the seal, allowing larvae to crawl in the direction of the scent.</p>
<p>A couple years back, I had a fruit-fly infestation that got rather bad.  My freezer was new and in good working order. Fruit flies <em>obviously</em> are not going to be able to breed inside. But they are able to crawl inside, freeze, and die.</p>
<p>In my case, fruit-flies were likely going in the ice-dispenser, because that's where the largest collection of them were found. It has an inner funnel that is pushed up against the ice reservoir to work. They were trapped in that cold funnel region. The flap-gate on the ice-dispenser is not nearly as strong of a seal as the door seal. If you have an ice-dispenser, that's likely how they got in.</p>
<p>The only way it would be brought-in fly eggs would be if you froze some leftovers that a fly had time to lay eggs upon (this only takes seconds) and you did that like the same day the freezer failed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, most of the posters here are <em>probably</em> wrong about the insect eggs.  Flies that lay eggs that create meat-eating maggots do not lay their eggs randomly about.  They only lay their eggs on rotting flesh.  They would not have been randomly mixed in your produce.  They also don't just a lay a few eggs that are hard to miss.  They lay a small pocket of hundreds of eggs and you would <a href="http://justbajan.com/health/articles/flyeggs/eggs1.jpg" target="_blank"><em>probably</em> notice them if they were a frequent occurrence on food.</a></p>
<p>Second, most of the <em>other</em> posters here are probably right in that your fridge is not as air tight as it may otherwise seem.  Their reasons as to how the flies may have gotten in are reasonable.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should consider how a fridge door seal works.  When you close the door and the seal collapses a bit, you are forcing a little more air out.  When the door rebounds a bit as the seal uncompressed you generate a little bit of lower pressure inside the fridge as compared to the outside environment.  You can test this with a well-sealed freezer like a chest freezer.  You can feel the air squeeze out on shutting, and if you have a good seal it is harder to open back up than just the weight of the lid.  It's actually progressively harder to open the door up until the point the seal fails, since you are creating additional volume inside the fridge by lifting the door while the seal is intact and the pressure lowers until the seal fails.  </p>
<p>Also adding to this phenomena is that any room temperature air that entered the freezer will cool, shirking its partial pressure and further helping to hold the door shut.</p>
<p>Now, consider what happens when food (in the absence of insects for now) begins to rot.  That rot is caused by bacteria and fungus eating your food. And what happens when bacteria eat?  I mean other than your food spoiling?  They poop out CO2, methane, and other gases.</p>
<p>If that builds up it can overcome the slightly lower pressure otherwise enjoyed by the interior and force the door deal to fail, providing an egress for the trapped gases inside.</p>
<p>Once those gases are free it's like a massive neon sign to critters that feed on rot.  And they are very, very good at finding where such gases are leaking from, and are pretty determined little critters about finding a way to worm inside and fulfill their biological imperatives.</p>
<p>TL;DR - fridges are very good about keeping outside air out when cool &amp; running.  They are not so good at keeping inside air in when temperatures equalize to the outside environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Replying as I have also been a victim of the same science experiment: I came back from 10 weeks in Europe to a refrigerator/freezer mildew and maggot cesspool.</p>
<p>My supposition at the time was as follows:
As the frozen goods in the freezer above thawed and began to spoil, the resulting sludge began to pool along the door seal. As the bacteria pool continued to cook and develop, the air heated and expanded enough to allow the sludge to begin to leak out and down toward the refrigerator seam. As the seal was now open enough to allow fluid to seep out, small insects found a path into the freezer area.<br />
The comments here about eggs already existing in the goods makes reasonable sense, but all of the items in my freezer were pre-packaged, due to my bachelor status. Having witnessed how much the seals had been distended due to the mildew growth, I am more inclined to think the bugs came in after the seals had blown.  </p>
<p>By the time I arrived home, I can only guess that weeks and probably months had passed. Both compartments were dark brown, bison-level fuzzy, and three levels beyond pungent. (Note that I have had to remove possessions from a car whence someone was shot to death, that had then sat in a sunny police impound lot for two days, and this refrigerator stench was actually worse.)<br />
I did try to clean the refrigerator for a couple of hours before realizing that the stench I was failing to get out of the main compartments had most assuredly gotten deeper into the appliance, and that it was a total write-off.<br />
Called the sanitation department for a heavy-item removal, and bought a new one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Francesco Redi did an experiment on spontaneous generation using rotting meat and maggots. One chunk of meat had an airtight jar, one had a gauze covering and the other was open. In the 17th century it was widely accepted that some organisms would spontaneously generate under the right conditions, and Redi set out to disapprove it. </p>
<p>In his experiment the airtight container spawned no maggots. The gauze spawned few and the uncovered was crawling. Now that we know the maggots didn't magically grow from the meat there are a few possible explanations:</p>
<p>1.Your fridge is not airtight
2.The meat was already contaminated but within safety guidelines as cooking red meat from refrigerated to serving temp kills the eggs and baddies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
