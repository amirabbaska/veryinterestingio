		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The goal is not to avoid any possible contamination - if we would do that, we wouldn't send probes at all. Possible contamination should be as unlikely as reasonably possible. If we can let a spacecraft burn up in the atmosphere of the gas giant, that is done.</p>
<p>A lander cannot do that, of course, so it will get sterilized as good as reasonably possible.</p>
<p>The Mars rovers avoid regions where liquid water temporarily could exist underground today, for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's difficult to do. We build all our spacecraft in sterile conditions , but can't do anything about contamination during launch. Most bacteria die in space, but there is always a chance some will survive. </p>

Like some tardigrades started thriving in the upper atmosphere of Saturn? One day we show up and the entire planet has tardigrades all over it from Cassini a couple hundred years back</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>very carefully.</p>
<p>cleanrooms can only do so much (generally just particulates) and eventually the product has to go outside onto the launch pad where it sits for a short time, collecting Earth contamination.</p>
<p>sterilization protocols in addition to cleanroom process will help, but there will needs to be some kind of encapsulation in addition to an en route decontamination process to try and ensure a contaminant free probe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When asked about that, the ESA team replied &quot;We're not worried. The surface of Titan is worse than anything we could do to the probe to sterilize it.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
