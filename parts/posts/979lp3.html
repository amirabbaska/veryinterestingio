		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mushrooms require a lot of moisture, so they will pop up after rainstorms, or during the morning dew hours. Also the mushrooms you see are just the reproductive organs of a larger fungal organism, the Mycelium. </p>
<p>The Mycelium is fungus like a colony that just chills out until conditions are right, and then when conditions are right they produce mushrooms in hopes of spreading spores to reproduce. Conditions don't remain 'right' for very long, so rapid growth of the mushroom is necessary to facilitate reproduction.</p>
<p>Source: I like mushrooms. Not a Mycologist, so I can't really give a more in depth answer, but this thread is empty, so I just thought I would throw in my two cents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mushrooms are the fruit, the BLOOM portion of life.<br />
So, to answer your question, mushrooms grow after a rain when the mushoom's mycelium (vegative portion) has matured in the ground, enough to be ready to bloom as soon as moisture comes.   </p>
<p>Think of mushrooms like an iceberg. What's going on underground is much more than what you see above ground.<br />
You see the mushroom appear after a rain, but it has been there, underground......you just didn't see it yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An example would be when you’re growing a mycelium on a substrate in your own home for your own enlightenment.</p>
<p>Once the mycelium has permeated through the substrate (its food) you shock it by putting into the fridge for a few days.</p>
<p>The mycelium thinks “Winter is coming” and fruits heavily when you take it out of the fridge.</p>
<p>Also shrooms are 92% water, when you dry them there’s not much left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>water evaporating off the mycellium thats exposed to the air is one of the environmental triggers for new mushrooms to form. mushrooms are mostly water anyway so the soil its growing in probably has really good moisture retention.  i never seen a mushroom grow that big that fast before though but within 2-3 days i have. its possible they were already growing but that rain was what they needed to go through a growth spurt and reach maturity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
