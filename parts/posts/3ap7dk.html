It'll take a while to read through the discussion generated, but it seems so far people have been speculating on if pressure or trapped exhaled air is the main limiting factor.   I have also enjoyed reading everyones failed attempts to try this at home.</p>
<p>Edit 2:  So this post was inspired by a memory from my primary school days (a long time ago) where we would solve mysteries, with one such mystery being someone dying due to lack of fresh air in a long stick.  As such I already knew of the effects of a pipe filling with CO2, but i wanted to see if that, or the pressure factor, would make trying such a task impossible. As <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3ap7dk/how_far_underwater_could_you_breath_using_a_hose/cseu5sz" target="_blank">dietcoketin pointed out</a> ,this seems to be from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Encyclopedia_Brown" target="_blank">encyclopaedia Brown series</a></p></div></div>
