It'll take a while to read through the discussion generated, but it seems so far people have been speculating on if pressure or trapped exhaled air is the main limiting factor.   I have also enjoyed reading everyones failed attempts to try this at home.</p>
<p>Edit 2:  So this post was inspired by a memory from my primary school days (a long time ago) where we would solve mysteries, with one such mystery being someone dying due to lack of fresh air in a long stick.  As such I already knew of the effects of a pipe filling with CO2, but i wanted to see if that, or the pressure factor, would make trying such a task impossible. As <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3ap7dk/how_far_underwater_could_you_breath_using_a_hose/cseu5sz" target="_blank">dietcoketin pointed out</a> ,this seems to be from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Encyclopedia_Brown" target="_blank">encyclopaedia Brown series</a></p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ah, I've answered this question before in /r/geek. The original that I answered was &quot;Why don't we use really long snorkels? &quot;</p>
<p>The average forced vital capacity (assuming you are breathing as hard as you can with every breath) is roughly 4200 mL. For a 2 cm wide snorkel you'd need about 13.5 meters of snorkel tube to waste 50% of that as dead space. However! Dead space is decidedly <em>not</em> the issue if you are heading underwater. Besides, you can inhale through the tube and exhale into the water, as someone cleverly mentioned. </p>
<p>The average healthy male can generate about -120 cmH2O (-80 to -100 for females) of what's called <strong>negative inspiratory force</strong>, or &quot;ability to suck&quot; if you like. However, you need a <em>difference</em> of about 40-60 cmH2O to breathe effectively which translating to about 50 cm of depth under water, is the number at which other people in this thread have suggested is when it gets really hard to pull air down. </p>
<p>Basically, the pressure difference between you and the surface would be significant when you push past about a half meter. That's a lot of extra work for lungs that are used to about 0 atmospheres of difference, so you probably aren't strong enough to take the entire forced vital capacity because inhaling will be <em>so hard</em>.</p>
<p>If you were just hanging out at ground level and attempting to breathe only through a long snorkel (or just a giant straw at this point) then dead space in the snorkel will be what makes you pass out. </p>
<p>Edit: Frequently asked questions (too many to reply to individually)</p>
<ul>
<li>What is dead space?</li>
</ul>
<p>It's air that's being pushed back and forth without any significant oxygen/CO2 exchange happening with your lungs. Basically, air that's not doing any work.</p>
<ul>
<li>What about SCUBA gear?</li>
</ul>
<p>As someone answered already, diving cylinders are hooked up to apparatuses that allow you to breathe in a gas mixture at the same pressure as the surrounding ambient pressure, so there's no large pressure gradient to overcome.</p>
<ul>
<li>What if there's a pump?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, then you'd no longer be breathing on your own to overcome the pressure gradient. That's what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-supplied_diving" target="_blank">surface-supplied diving</a> is, and they seem to historically have been used in the 1800's.</p>
<ul>
<li>What if I have a large lung capacity? Does a higher FVC affect how far I'd be able to go down?</li>
</ul>
<p>No. The limiting factor is the amount of negative inspiratory force you're able to generate, which is dependent on how powerful your diaphragm is. Even if you had exceptionally powerful respiratory muscles, you'd get maybe a few more centimeters or tens of centimeters down the water.</p>
<ul>
<li>Air compresses and you need to breathe in more air to get the same oxygenation</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone had this misconception but this is actually <em>not</em> a significant factor because in our scenario the air is still openly connected to the atmosphere. If you are breathing in air through a rigid pipe it will not compress significantly. If you walked from the top of a flight of stairs to the bottom you are not suddenly gasping for air (unless it's for other, more medical, reasons).</p>
<ul>
<li>Guys suck more than girls lmao</li>
</ul>
<p>Well meme'd, my friend, but 50 others have made the same joke.</p>
<ul>
<li>I would like this in freedom units please</li>
</ul>
<p>50 cm (depth at which it becomes hard to breathe ) is about a foot and a half to two feet. 13.5 meters is 44 feet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From experience, not very far.
It all depends on the diaphragm strength. But I would say about 50 cm. It is already very difficult to breathe through a 35 cm tube.</p>
<p>1 m seems definitely impossible (it would feels like you try to breathe with a horse sitting on your chest).</p>
<p>Even if you could compensate the overpressure, the other factor would be that the air in the pipe will contain the air you just expelled (high in CO2 and poor in O2). It would be like you are breathing in a sealed plastic bag.</p>
<p>A 40 cm pipe with a radius of 2 cm contains 1L of air. This &quot;dead&quot; air will be the first litre of air you breathe each time.</p>
<p>Note that at rest we normally breathe about 0.5L.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
