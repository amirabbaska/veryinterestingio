In 2014, he had a big result for a certain form of the equation. I was still in college at the time and my PDE professor said that most of the mathematics community expects him to be the one to win the prize for it. This particular professor was so confident that he predicted that Dr. Tao would do it by 2016. I had never heard of him at the time but it turns out Dr. Tao was a child prodigy in maths and was a full professor at 24. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the thread linked above I don't see anything about the Yang-Mills mass gap problem, so I'll write a little about recent progresses.</p>
<p>First: very roughly, the Yang-Mills mass gap problem states that a certain class of physical theories (first of all exist, and) have a mass gap, i.e. there's a particle with minimal mass in them. In other words, you can't have particles arbitrarily light in those theories.</p>
<p>Last year an <strong>extremely</strong> surprising paper was published: <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04573.pdf" target="_blank">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04573.pdf</a></p>
<p>The paper deals with a problem similar to the Yang-Mills problem: it takes a family of physical theories, and consider whether they have a <em>spectral</em> gap, which is a property similar to the mass gap. They prove that the spectral gap problem is <strong>undecidable</strong>. This is extremely surprising: nobody even ever considered such a result as possible. This naturally begs the question: <em>could the Yang-Mills mass gap problem be undecidable?</em></p>
<p>It seems to me that the general consensus among physicists is <strong>no</strong>, because the family of theories considered in the article above is artificially constructed and not arising in nature. They believe that a &quot;true&quot; physical theory shouldn't behave like that, and the undecidability of the mass gap would be an extremely weird phenomenon. But, sometimes mathematics doesn't care about that, so who knows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a tangential note, the ABC conjecture, while not a Millenium prize problem per se, is among the class of &quot;(relatively) easily stated number theory problems with arbitrarily hard proofs&quot;. The interesting part about it is that several years ago now, at this point, a Japanese professor released ~500 pages of entirely new mathematics, which among many many other things includes a proof of the ABC conjecture (and it's really only a footnote in relation to the rest of the work).</p>
<p>In the years since it's been released, the extant mathematical community has been very slow to read, absorb and understand these new mathematics, but so far it looks as if it could be revolutionary stuff once it hits a critical mass of enough other people understanding it. <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2099534-mathematicians-finally-starting-to-understand-epic-abc-proof/" target="_blank">Here</a>'s a recent popular article on the subject.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has taken nearly four years, but mathematicians are finally starting to comprehend a mammoth proof that could revolutionise our understanding of the deep nature of numbers.</p>
<p>The 500-page proof was published online by Shinichi Mochizuki of Kyoto University, Japan in 2012 and offers a solution to a longstanding problem known as the ABC conjecture, which explores the fundamental relationships between numbers, addition and multiplication beginning with the simple equation a + b = c.</p>
<p>Mathematicians were excited by the proof but struggled to get to grips with Mochizuki’s “Inter-universal Teichmüller Theory” (IUT), an entirely new realm of mathematics he had developed over decades in order to solve the problem.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>At least 10 people now understand the theory in detail, says Fesenko, and the IUT papers have almost passed peer review so should be officially published in a journal in the next year or so. That will likely change the attitude of people who have previously been hostile towards Mochizuki’s work, says Fesenko. “Mathematicians are very conservative people, and they follow the traditions. When papers are published, that’s it.”</p>
<p>“There are definitely people who understand various crucial parts of the IUT,” says Jeffrey Lagarias of the University of Michigan, who attended the Kyoto meeting, but was not able to absorb the entire theory in one go. “More people outside Japan have incentive to work to understand IUT as it is presented, all 500 pages of it, making use of new materials at the various conferences.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here's some info from the website of the most recent conference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The work (currently being refereed) of SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI on inter-universal Teichmüller (IUT) theory (also known as arithmetic deformation theory) and its application to famous conjectures in diophantine geometry became publicly available in August 2012. This theory, developed over 20 years, introduces a vast collection of novel ideas, methods and objects. Aspects of the theory extend arithmetic geometry to a non-scheme-theoretic setting and, more generally, open a new fundamental area of mathematics.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a relatively recent push to solving the Riemann Hypothesis using the theory of &quot;Random Matrices&quot;. Essentially, the spacing and behavior of the eigenvalues of classes of random matrices should be related. </p>
<p>On the other hand, an alternative version of he Riemann Hypothesis was proved in the 70s by Pierre Deligne, with the help of Alexander Grothendieck. This was proved using very a very abstract framework that basically treated objects in number theory the same way we treat geometric objects in geometry and topology. There are some key things that exist in this alternate version that allow us to piece everything together just right so that we can prove the Riemann Hypothesis in this case. We then think that we might be able to prove the <em>actual</em> Riemann Hypothesis if we can find a way to transfer those &quot;key things&quot; into the traditional case. In particular, a meaningful definition of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_with_one_element" target="_blank">Field with One element</a> might give us the tools we need to prove the Riemann Hypothesis. The issue is that we need to make this analog between Number Theory and Geometry <em>way</em> more explicit to do this. This analog has been hinted and plaguing Number Theorists for hundreds of years and while Grothendieck was the first to really make this analogy explicit and flesh it out in a meaningful way, there are still huge swaths that are unknown about it. But there is now a whole field, called Arithmetic Geometry, that tries to figure out exactly how this analogy works. </p>
<p>Mochizuki, of the ABC-conjecture already mentioned, has worked to extend and further a lot of the ideas of Grothendieck, and some of his tools may be just the analogs we need to work on the Riemann Hypothesis. The main missing element is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frobenius_endomorphism" target="_blank">Frobenius Automorphism</a> for the &quot;Prime at infinity&quot;. The ABC-Conjecture has very strong ties to geometry through Arithmetic Geometry, and his main theory is built to help make sense of the notion of a &quot;Frobenius&quot; and he then extends this notion to include the &quot;prime at infinity&quot;. Though, I haven't heard anyone explicitly say that Mochizuki's work might lead to something about the Riemann Hypothesis, I don't know his work too well (but who does?), this is just my inference based on what he and others have said about it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Then there's the [Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch_and_Swinnerton-Dyer_conjecture" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch_and_Swinnerton-Dyer_conjecture</a>. This one is hard and though it has seen a bit of progress, but is still a long ways off. Essentially, we can use functions like the Riemann Zeta Function to extract information about number systems by looking at Taylor coefficients. These are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_number_formula" target="_blank">Analytic Class Number Formulas</a>. Now, in Number Theory and Arithmetic Geometry, we kinda see number systems as the most basic version of much larger constructions. They're like 1 dimensional flat things, in a world of arbitrary dimensional things that are curved, looped etc. One of the most important objects in  this larger world, that are just a step above number systems, are Elliptic Curves. These encode a lot of arithmetic, for instance, we were able to prove Fermat's Last Theorem by taking advantage of the highly sophisticated arithmetic of Elliptic Curves. So if Elliptic Curves are just more complicated objects in the same world as number systems, then a lot of the stuff we use about number systems should have analogous results for Elliptic Curves. Now, we can talk about Riemann Zeta-type functions for Elliptic Curves and so the idea is then that, just as the Taylor coefficients tell us about the arithmetic number systems, the Taylor coefficients of these functions should tell us about the more sophisticated arithmetic of Elliptic Curves. This is the BSD Conjecture.</p>
<p>In the 80s, long before the Millennium Prize Problems, Victor Kolyvagin proved a very special case of the BSD using surprisingly innovative and complicated techniques. Basically, he proved that it is true for the simplest possible Elliptic Curves in an infinitely complex family of Elliptic Curves. This, however, is the only firm progress in it. Interestingly enough in 2015, it was proved that a nonzero proportion of all Elliptic Curves are of this type, meaning that the BSD is at least true for a lot of Elliptic Curves. It is unlikely that his techniques are directly transferable to more complicated Elliptic Curves. </p>
<p>I think that the BSD is probably going to take longer than the Riemann Hypothesis, simply because we are working with more sophisticated objects that we really don't understand super well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
