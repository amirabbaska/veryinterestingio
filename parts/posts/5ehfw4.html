		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have taxes to fund the government and the various services and programs it provides. Property tax is commonly used to fund schools. Inheritance is not a tax on property you own, you did not own it your family member did. It is a tax on the ownership of that property changing hands. The purpose of this is to limit the massive accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few families over generations. Something that can and will happen given enough time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tax system is two things mixed together.</p>
<p>The government needs money to pay for the services it provides.  The government generally prefers to take money from people on a progressive basis (a larger percentage of the money is collected from people with more money/income).  </p>
<p>The government wants people to do some things and not do other things.  This presents an opportunity to use the tax system to motivate behavior.  Rather than outlaw something, like beer, the government imposes a special tax on it.  This brings in money that the government needs, and it discourages over-consumption of beer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this combination can have some bizarre interactions.  Warren Buffet (very rich person) mostly invests his money in things the government approves of.  As a result of these tax incentives, he claims he pays a lower tax rate on his humongous income than his secretary pays on her modest income.  That's the sort of problem that occurs when government ties to to two things at once.  Simpler is better, and the US tax system us the opposite of simple.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tax system in broad terms(theoretical):</p>
<p>In broad terms, the tax system is intended to take a portion of disposable income away from people and use it to further society as a whole.  Think roads/infrastructure/police/fire department...ect.  It's the revenue generating process of the business we call a government.  There are several ways governments collect taxes: sales tax, income tax, and property tax are the main three.  </p>
<p>Sales tax: The government is creating a safe place for you to go to to buy goods.  If I go to walmart, the city I live in provides streets to get there, a fire department in case of fire, and a police department in case of a robery while I'm there.  The state the city is in also provides some of the roads I use to get to the store and funds in part the city's expenses for their roads and police/fire department through grants.  Sales tax is not something I am required to pay and I am not technically required to buy anything with my income.  I could live off the land in the woods and never pay sales tax since I never take advantage of the city's environment that allows businesses to operate.</p>
<p>Income tax: Basically the same as sales tax.  The government provides a safe place for me to work make income.  By creating this place for me to live, wether through roads, infrastructure, police, or other services, the state and federal government want a portion of what I make.  This is where the idea for a flat tax shows it has little merit.  If I make $20,000 per year, the government understands I don't have as much disposable income and only requires me to pay a small portion of my income as tax.  If I make $200,000 per year, the government knows that I was very successful by working in their territory and wants a larger cut since I can afford to give up a larger portion of my income.  This is the one tax that almost everyone has to pay some amount for.  Although you can go completely off the grid, nearly everyone has some form of income.  You pay this when you make the money, not when it is spent(sales tax) or invested(property taxes on houses).</p>
<p>Property Tax:  If I have a house in a city, it is understood that if it catches on fire the city's fire department will come put out the fire(or try).  If someone breaks into my house, the city will send someone to get them out.  By building my house in the city, I also have close access to numerous city services like roads and parks.  Most property taxes are proportional to the value of what you own.  For a house that cost $200,000 vs one that cost $2,000,000 it only makes sense that the guy who owns and maintains a house worth 10x as much could afford to pay 10x as much in tax.  Property tax is also not required as it is not a requirement to own property.  Like sales tax, I could live off the land in the woods and never pay property tax.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different levels of government that handle different things, and each needs funds to pay for the services it provides. The Federal government mostly relies on income taxes, states use a mix of income and sales tax, local governments use a mix of sales tax and property tax.</p>
<p>Taxes on assets like homes and cars are charged annually because the infrastructure needed to make those assets usable and enjoyable requires ongoing funding. A house won't be worth living in if the schools suck, there are no parks, no police or fire protection, etc. A car requires there to be roads, and snow removal, etc. To charge you upfront for the lifespan of the house or car for these would be more than anybody could pay, and the services are needed on an ongoing basis, so there are annual taxes. As for vehicle taxes, some states charge an annual tax based on value, while others have more substantial gasoline taxes to fund this. Property taxes are typically based on the value of a property, both because those who can afford a larger home can afford more taxes and because they are to some extent benefiting more from the services (ie. those with a 4BR home will likely have more kids attending the local schools than the single person in the 1BR condo).</p>
<p>Inheritances are taxed on a one time basis, and the reality is that any inheritance large enough to fall into the transfer tax range means that the person who acquired the fortune was asleep at the wheel in terms of estate planning -- there are ways to minimize or avoid inheritance taxes via trusts, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you own land, you generally make use of infrastructure paid for by the state. For example, your property would be worth considerably less if it didn't have road access, and things like power, water and telephone lines are also often subsidized or outright state owned. </p>
<p>The same kind of logic could be extended to all kinds of taxes: The state provides services, like education, protection, administration and justice, and you have to pay for it, regardless of whether you agree with how these services are provided or not, or whether you actually benefit from them as much as other people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
