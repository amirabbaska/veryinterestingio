		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diving is supposed to mitigate the resistance entering water, so would it be significantly higher than the point where, say, a belly flop has the effect of hitting concrete? Would it shatter your hands and wrists?</p>
<p>Edit: So surface tension isn't the problem, but density. Assuming non-aerated water, and assuming a straight dive, at what point would hitting the water kill you? Moreover, what injuries would you actually sustain?</p>
<p>Second Edit: Anything above around 140 meters would have the same effect, being terminal velocity, so I suppose a secondary question would be, what speed would you have to be going for this to occur?</p></div></div>

<p>The key factor seems to be when the water is required to move out of the way faster than the speed of sound in water, which will be a function of the impact velocity and the shape/area of the impact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
