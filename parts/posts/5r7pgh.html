		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, when a wound heals, it scabs over the top and heals from the bottom up. It fills in. Unfortunately the tissue it uses to fill in this deficit is fibrous and not very attractive. The larger the deficit, the more likely it will be to scar visibly. A scar IS a wound which has healed &quot;correctly&quot; and &quot;properly&quot;.</p>
<p>If you mean to ask why we can't allow scars to heal more attractively, the answer is...we can. It is absolutely possible to surgically remove scar tissue from smaller wounds and align the now perfectly incised cuts up to allow them to heal with less of a visible scar. </p>
<p>If it's a larger scar, this isn't possible because human skin is held to muscle by connective tissue, so it only has so much immediate give in it and larger wounds would not be able to be fully closed, leaving a deficit and leading to scarring again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From memory, scar tissue isnt made up of, like, skin cells. It's actually made up of collagen fibers.</p>
<p>When you give yourself a small, shallow cut, the surrounding tissue can regenerate quickly enough that no collagen gets deposited at the site of the cut, but if the cut is deep enough and requires a bit more time to fix, collagen fibers get deposited to sort of stitch it together a bit faster. </p>
<p>The scab doesn't really have much to do with it - it's just a plug that your blood forms to cover up the site until either the skin regenerates or scar tissue is formed. If you pick it off early, it reopens the wound and forces the healing process to start all over again. The longer this healing process takes, the more collagen is deposited; and the more collagen, the more likely it'll scar.</p>
<p>That's my understanding of it anyway - hope it helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Scar tissue forms when there is a loss of tissue, or the tissue is simply to damaged. Even in a perfect situation  there's always some damage so you're always going to have some scaring to an extent however the better and faster the wound is closed the less that will be.Which means after a wound has healed and scared, you can surgically remove the scar tissue and stitch the wound, and end up with far less visible scar tissue.</p>
<p>Doesn't happen as part of routine treatment because it's painful, carries a risk of infection and involves surgery, but you can do it. You'd need to seek out a surgeon who does cosmetic stuff basically. </p>
<p>There are a few other surgical techniques as well. Subcision is often used to lessen the appearance of acne scars for example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

I've had several scars from surgery and accidents, but every time I get injured, it results in a scar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the scar is determined by the depth of the cut.<br />
Not by how well the scab forms/heals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
