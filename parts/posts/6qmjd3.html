		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: My answer below covers the mechanistic reasons for baldness (because I'm biochemist and that's the portion I know about) and why it occurs mostly to men. I'm not aware of definitive research on the evolutionary reasons for baldness so I've stayed away from speculating on that and tried to stick to what biochemistry/physiology does know. You are free to speculate about the why as much as you'd like, hopefully someone with a good understanding of hominin anthropology can likely fill in such details. Note that not all traits are positively selected so Male Patterned Baldness may just be a non-deleterious side-effect of sexual maturation. </p>
<p>Hair follicles are mostly switched on by the presence of androgens (i.e. testosterone and dihydrotestosterone) and the follicles have two important reaction parameters; a testosterone sensitivity threshold and a kind of response strength.  The sensitivity threshold level sets how much testosterone must be circulating before a follicle switches over to producing mature hairs. Head and eyebrow hairs are examples of follicles with exceptionally high sensitivity. Very, very, very little testosterone/DHT is required for the follicle to switch on, mature and start producing hair. And this is why male and female infants quickly start producing mature head hairs. On the other hand pubic, underarm and beards hairs have low androgen sensitivity and this is why they do not switch on until the increases in testosterone/DHT levels seen at puberty.</p>
<p>Alongside this follicles have a response strength that dictates how vigorously the follicle produces hair once they are activated. Beards hairs have high response levels, eyebrow and arms hairs not so much. So beard hairs come in fast and thick. Scalp follicles also have a very strong testosterone/DHT response but they don't undergo significant changes at puberty as they are already fully mature when puberty arrives.</p>
<p>If just so happens that there is a loose correlation between this response strength and testosterone/DHT toxicity. Essentially the more strongly a follicle reacts to testosterone the more likely it is to die off after chronic DHT exposure. I guess you could think of it like the follicle being &quot;overworked&quot; but it is a little more sophisticated than that (see first link). As men produce the most testosterone their most sensitive and strongly reacting follicles are at higher risk of this toxicity, and these happen to be the ones on the scalp. And this appears to be the driver for Male Pattern Baldnss. The mechanism for this are not completely understood but this is a nice easy to read summary</p>

<p>As I recall this is also a great review of the effects of androgens on hair development and it covers a lot of detail on the biochemical science of follicle maturation.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll avoid biochemical explanations (biochemist here) and share my observations from a population genetics perspective (a 2nd year uni course I once taught)</p>
<p>From a purely adaptive standpoint, head hair is selected for to protect against cuts and perhaps sunburn.  This is helpful, but one can clearly survive without hair.  Head hair is not a requirement for survival, but almost everyone has head hair, at least through early life, and survival benefits are understood.  The classic Darwinian survival benefit of hair is clear enough.</p>
<p>The maintenance of male pattern baldness genes within the population appears to be more complicated.  It seems to be partly a secondary sexual characteristic, perhaps mixed with a male dominance trait.  These things are indeed connected.  </p>
<p>Traits used in sexual selection need not improve (individual) survival.  There are examples where the opposite is true.  eg Deer antlers are a survival penalty.  However, antlers cannot be faked.  Only a truly healthy male of sufficient age will have impressive antlers.  This is the handicap principal of sexual selection, and it can help to explain the existence of traits that do not (directly) improve survival.</p>
<p>In modern times, an expensive car is a huge financial penalty, but since it cannot be faked, an expensive car does provided a prospective mate with an authentic indicator of wealth. </p>
<p>Male pattern baldness occurs in sexual maturity (often early 20's) and coincides with increases in muscular strength and sexual desire/aggression.  This is analogous to the morphological changes seen in a male silverback gorillas.  An alpha silverback will dominate the troop, and have distinctive secondary sexual characteristics (which include a silver back).   Maturing males developing similar characteristics, which pose a challenge to the alpha's dominance.  So others with these emerging traits become targets of aggression.  Young males may be driven-off or become subordinate.  Subordinate behavior has been shown to decrease testosterone, while dominant behavior increases testosterone.  This may explain how submissive make gorillas suppress silver-back traits, and may become a dominant silverback later in life.  </p>
<p>Successfully displaying silverback traits is a handicap, since one must endure constant challenges to dominance.  Similarly, deer with impressive antlers must endure challenges from other dominant deer for mating rights.  </p>
<p>In modern humans the significance of male pattern baldness may be far less significant than it was in our violent, evolutionary past.  However, the trait does have many similarities to male dominance traits seen in primates, such as gorillas.  It is a male trait seen in sexual-maturity and it is testosterone correlated.   While western society seems to value youth, and hair is a symbol of youth, most western men treat baldness almost like a disease.... something that needs a cure.  I find it interesting to note a significant number of women find male baldness to be sexy.  There are also cultural examples (east asia comes to mind.  monks?) where youth and adolescents are seen to shave their foreheads in an apparent attempt to appear more mature.</p>
<p>My advice for balding men is to embrace it.  Society may subtly judge you to be more mature, dominant and sexually capable.  Nothing to be ashamed of.  Embrace your inner silverback! (but try not to get into fights)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is commonly believed that the accumulation of dihydrotestosterone, apparently a more potent form of testosterone that causes the growth of your bones and body/beard hair, is responsible for male pattern baldness. There is also another hypothesis out there stating that, instead of just the accumulation of dihydrotesterone being the sole culprit, it may actually be the growing of the cranium plates that eventually restrict bloodflow to the area. It is stated in this theory that the reason some parts of the scalp are resistant to balding is because they are closer to the main arterial blood supply. If you look at an illustration of a human skull with the growth plates of the cranium highlighted, the edges of the frontal bone on your forehead appear to make a line resembling male pattern baldness.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to keep in mind, evolution favors things that help your genes get passed along and disfavors things that inhibit it.  Which means things outside of that aren't terribly influenced by evolutionary pressures.</p>
<p>Baldness generally doesn't occur until after the reproducing years have passed so even if it killed you evolution wouldn't have much luck weeding it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of how the evolution works, this is a wrong question. It  wasn't developed on purpose. It was a mutation that a) was a side effect of an useful mutation, or b) it was an arbitrary mutation that was without any disadvantages.</p>
<p>Only in intelligent design things &quot;are made&quot; on a purpose. Evolution is arbitrary and something works, has no downsides and so survives, or has downsides and the mutant dies before being able to reproduce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
