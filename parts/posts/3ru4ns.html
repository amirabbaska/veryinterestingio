		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does! You can clearly see this fact by looking at <a href="http://imgur.com/DcQON5t" target="_blank">this series of pictures</a> of a rainbow taken by a camera visible in the ultraviolet (UV), the visible, and the infrared (IR). Notice how in addition to the visible part of the rainbow (which you can see by eye), there is also an IR band that smoothly follows the red edge and a UV band slots right under the violet edge.</p>
<p>This result is exactly what we would expect. The way rainbows work is that when sunlight strikes water droplets suspended in the air, part of the light is reflected at the air/water interface at the back of each droplet, <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-o8J6w_FRVWQ/Uj7gJ9H-fCI/AAAAAAAAi88/zRZMuMjKxR4/s1600/Rainbow+103.png" target="_blank">as shown in this diagram</a>. Since water is dispersive (meaning that the rerfractive index varies by wavelength), each droplet effectively acts as a small prism spreading the white light into its spectral components. Now our eyes our only sensitive to the visible (by definition), which is why a rainbow looks like a colorful transition from violet to red. However, sunlight also contains <a href="http://imgur.com/KbIrTzA" target="_blank">IR and UV components in addition to visible light</a>. While the water droplets absorb some of this light, much of it ends up reflected, as part of this extended rainbow that you can see from the IR and UV images posted above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is also how we discovered there were other kinds of light other than visible light. </p>
<p>In this experiment, the experimenter created a rainbow in a darkroom from natural light through a slit passed through a prism. Thermometers were placed in each color, and a hypothesis was proposed that different lights carry different energies. A control was placed just to the left of red. When the experimenter observed the temperatures, he discovered that the control and the red color thermometers were both similar in temperature ranges. Even though the control was outside the visible light spectrum. He had discovered infrared. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just want to add that it doesn't extend as far past the visible portion of the spectrum as you might expect. The sun emits less UV and IR light than visible light, and the atmosphere further attenuates light in those parts of the spectrum. In fact, the situation has been like that since well before animals on this planet evolved the ability to see, so our eyes only became sensitive to the part of the spectrum that illuminates the earth most brightly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does. The cause of rainbows, the refraction of light through water droplets is not limited to the visible spectrum. I know that ultraviolet light can be part of the rainbow but I don't know if anything else can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
