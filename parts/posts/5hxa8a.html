		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Shampoo is mostly made up of Surfactant, a chemical that is made of two parts; one part loves to grab onto water and reduces the surface tension of water, and the other part loves to grab onto oils and reduce the surface tension of oils. This stabilizes the interface between oil and water, so that the little surfactant bubble and oil washes away with any added water. This is the first shampooing, all the oil and dirt washes out of the hair. The second shampooing sees the surfactant acting more as a Foaming agent. A foaming agent reduces the surface tension of a liquid, leading to bubble formation, and increases colloidal stability, making the foam last. Because all the oils have been washed away by the first shampooing, there is nothing taking up the attention of the oil-loving side of the surfactant, so the water loving side is the only side that does anything, and it will reduce the surface tension of the water, and create foam bubbles. This is the real &quot;shampoo effect&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Side note (kalabash has explained the why perfectly well): if the second shampoo lathers, you didn't need to shampoo twice.</p>
<p>Shampoo manufacturers tell you that you need to shampoo twice in order to sell twice as much shampoo - exactly the same as alka-seltzer's &quot;plink, plink, fizz&quot; strapline. They used to advise you to use a single tablet, until a marketing company told them they could double sales with one simple trick...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So what you are asking is when you shampoo your hair the first time, it lathers up and you wash it off like normal, but if you shampoo your hair again it lathers even more than before, why is that? Well as simply as I can put it, shampoo has the main ingredient which uses water to help it lather up and it's job is to clean your hair by cleaning the oil from your hair, the thing is that oils, dirt, and other particles pop bubbles. This is why there are more suds the second time around, there are less oils for the shampoo to fight against basically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
