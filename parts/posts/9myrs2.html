		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Below 3.5% moisture content most bacteria can’t live. Sun dried tomatoes are sliced and dried so most of the moisture is gone and bacteria can’t be supported
A tomato on the windowsill still has a lot of moisture in it and the bacteria are having a feast.... and you ingest them when you eat them</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sun dried tomatoes usually have salts applied to help the drying process and these salts generate an unoptimal environment for bacteria to grow and multiply. As they continue to lose water, it becomes even more difficult for bacteria to establish themselves as they need some form of moisture and water to grow properly.</p>
<p>It's similar to how people would use salt to preserve things like meat, or making jerkey. Bacteria can't thrive if they aren't in a wet environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sundried tomatoes are chopped up and sometimes salted,  which helps them dry faster than they rot.</p>
<p>A whole tomato has evolved to hold in moisture, so it rots faster than it dries. That's good for feeding tomato seedlings, but not for preserving as food. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What makes you ill are bacteria (and mold) growing in large numbers on the food. These microoganisms need water to grow, and time. If you manage to make the food dry enough quickly enough, it becomes inhospitable to microorganisms before they can colonize it to a dangerous degree.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
