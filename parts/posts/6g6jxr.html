		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From Terence McKenna:</p>
<p>&quot;Cultures are shaped by the drugs that they take and that they suppress. We are a sugar, red meat, and alcohol culture primarily with tobacco to shore all that up. Think for a minute about a drug like coffee, caffeine. Every labor contract in Western civilization contains a clause which secures the worker’s right to halt the assembly line twice a day, to fuel up on a drug known to cause liver damage and all kinds of problems. Well now, why isn’t there a cannabis break?</p>
<p>The reason is, that caffeine perfectly fits in to a program that would have you busily screwing widgits onto wonkets and moving them along the assembly line. In other words, it promotes capitalist values. Performing repetitious tasks in a state of sort of glazed acceptance. Cannabis, on the other hand… what is always said about it? Makes you inefficient, lazy, uninterested in earning your Mercedes and your house…&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They implemented the &quot;Psychedelic Act of 1970&quot; (ban on all cognitive enhancing drugs, even ones used in scientific studies) to try to  arrest people that were in the civil rights movement &amp; the anti-war movement. Drugs like LSD, DMT, &amp; shrooms were huge in that community &amp; by implementing that act, they were able to disband those groups by throwing a lot of them in jail &amp; also discrediting them by giving them a criminal record, in turn - turning people against them.</p>
<p>That's the whole reason that Psychedelic Act of 1970 was put into place. What's sad is that they were doing studies at a lot of great colleges (like Harvard &amp; other Ivy league schools) seeing how drugs like psilocybin mushrooms could benefit in mental health, but the DEA went busting down doors, confiscating any &amp; all psychedelic drugs, ceasing anymore studies. There's actually a documentary that talks about a lot of this, it's really interesting, but I can't remember what it's called or where I seen it (I want to say YouTube, but I can't find it - if I do, I'll post it in this comment down below.)</p>
<p>If I remember correctly LSD was accidently discovered by a Scientist named <em>Albert Hofmann</em>, when he got some on his skin, while transporting it. It seeped into his skin, causing him to trip. Then I believe they started doing studies on it &amp; more &amp; more people started finding out about it, which led to the &quot;hippies&quot; era that we've all heard stories about. It was all legal then, &amp; people were protesting Vietnam, Civil Rights, going to Woodstock, partying, which all led to what I stated above.</p>
<p>Edit: correction of Albert Hofmann's name.            </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Psychedelics are illegal not because a loving government is concerned that you may jump out of a third story window. Psychedelics are illegal because they dissolve opinion structures and culturally laid down models of behaviour and information processing. They open you up to the possibility that everything you know is wrong.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The core principle behind American drug law is that <strong>all drugs are illegal</strong> by default and only those that are approved <em>for medical use</em> are legal.  Our system of laws has no space in it for legal recreational drugs.</p>
<p>For various historic reasons, alcohol, tobacco &amp; caffeine are not generally treated as drugs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that LSD became illegal after the widespread use in the 70s attracted government attention. Before that, it was just seen as a new alternative medication... I don't remember what its original purpose was. But after college students started abusing it, the media got involved and soon after, it was banned. I'm not sure about mushrooms or DMT or any other psychedelic drug, though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
