		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good example of how we really have more &quot;senses&quot; than can fit into the usual five. Think about a finger. It can tell you all kinds of stuff: Hot/cold, rough/smooth/sharp/dull, vibrations, pressure, pain, and even where it is in space. (A good neurologic exam can look at all these separately.) They're often a bit different in the way they're sensed and how that information is passed along, which means drugs may hit them differently:</p>
<p>&quot;Local anesthetics have greater affinity for receptors within sodium channels during their activated and inactivated states than when they are in their resting states.1,2 Therefore, neural fibers having more rapid firing rates are most susceptible to local anesthetic action. Also, smaller fibers are generally more susceptible, because a given volume of local anesthetic solution can more readily block the requisite number of sodium channels for impulse transmission to be entirely interrupted. For these reasons the tiny, rapid-firing autonomic fibers are most sensitive, followed by sensory fibers and finally somatic motor fibers... The dentist is generally spared this consideration because the trigeminal nerve branches anesthetized for dental procedures are comprised only of small, rapid-firing sensory fibers. However, the many classes of sensory fibers also vary in their diameters and firing rates. For example, pain fibers are more sensitive than those carrying pressure and proprioception. A patient may remain disturbed by a sense of pressure despite complete anesthesia of pain fibers.&quot; (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3403589/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3403589/</a>)</p>
<p><strong>ELI5: To shut someone up by throwing a sock in their mouth, their mouth has to be open. A pain nerve is like five people who are always chattering, so throwing five socks will shut most of them up. A pressure nerve is like ten people who only talk when it's important, so even ten socks may bounce off.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different sensations travel on different sizes of nerve.
Pain (and temperature) travel on the smallest, thinnest nerves.
The Smallest nerves are easiest to block with local anaesthetic, so the pain nerves block first, leaving other sensations and movement intact, on the larger nerves.</p>
<p>We could block the other sensations/ movement too, on larger nerves, with stronger drugs*.  Indeed this is exactly what happens with regional anaesthesia.</p>
<p>Src: am anaesthetist (AKA anaesthesiologist in the US)</p>
<p>Edit: * and by applying the local anaesthetic closer to the nerve</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pain and pressure are both caused by &quot;switches&quot; being turned on, but they're different kinds of switches. It's easier to turn on the pressure switch than the pain switch. This is useful to us because pressure can be positive (&quot;yes, I have a firm grip on this object&quot;) but pain is always meant to alert you to a bad condition of some kind (&quot;my hand really hurts, this bucket is too heavy!&quot;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different types of receptors for pain and pressure and heat and such. Baroreceptors detect pressure, nocireceptors detect pain, thermoreceptors detect heat. Each neuron (nervous system cell) has a job, and anaesthesia interferes with the communications between those cells, but it only really needs to interfere with nocireceptors.</p>
<p>If you want to know more, you could research &quot;mechanoreceptors.&quot; </p>
<p>Sorry if this doesn't make sense. I tried really hard to explain it well. I have a degree in this and it's hard to explain things, but this is good practice for me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
