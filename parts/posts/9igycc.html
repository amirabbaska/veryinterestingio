		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Genetic engineering is now cheap, relatively simple, and pretty reliable - at least when done in a lab setting. Using a tool called CRISPR, researchers can access DNA in live cells, target specific strings of the DNA code to slice out, turn gene expression up or down, or even swap in new DNA. This means we can, theoretically, reverse genetic conditions, modify cell behaviors, and perhaps program the cells to better fight against disease.</p>
<p>If you want an overview on CRISPR and how it works, my university created this animated explainer: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXgU--ugLqY" target="_blank"><a href="https://youtu.be/iXgU--ugLqY" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/iXgU--ugLqY</a></a></p>
<p>My lab is using CRISPR to better understand how the genome controls the functions of human immune cells, in health and disease. We hope to use this research to inform future cell-based therapies to fight cancer, infectious disease, and autoimmunity.</p>
<p>If you're deeply interested in CRISPR, you may have heard of our recent work - we discovered a way to make CRISPR more efficient and flexible in re-writing long DNA sequences in human immune cells, without the use of viruses. There are currently FDA approved gene engineered T cell therapies for certain types of cancer. These cells have been generated by using modified viruses to deliver genes into haphazard sites in the T cell genomes. Improved non-viral CRISPR delivery allows us, effectively, to paste long new stretches of DNA sequences into specific sites in the genome, without having to rely viruses that are costly and laborious to employ. We are working to develop non-viral CRISPR-based genome targeting into broadly useful platforms to make better, faster, cheaper engineered T cells for the next generation of immunotherapies.</p>

<p>I'm here to talk about all things CRISPR, genetic engineering, immunology, or any other part of my work. I'll start around 2:30pm PT (5:30 PM ET, 22:30 UT), AMA!</p>
<p>EDIT: Hi everyone, I’m logged in and eager to start answering your questions!</p>
<p>EDIT 2: I appreciate all the questions, I enjoyed answering them. I’m signing off now, but am looking forward to seeing how the conversation evolves here. Thanks and goodnight.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have worked in a CRISPR lab for a couple years. We were trying to establish optimal protocol in an organism where that didn’t exist yet. Our biggest issue was actually having HDR take place, and our solution was to simply keep injecting until we got a good enough number. I imagine injecting 100s of human embryos is outlandish, so my question is how have you optimized the chances for the repair pathway? Or at least how do you address this problem, if you have this problem.</p>
<p>Thanks! :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
