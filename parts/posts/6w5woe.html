We are members of the <a href="http://vertpaleo.org/the-Society.aspx" target="_blank">Society of Vertebrate Paleontology</a>. We study fossil fish, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles â€” anything with a backbone! Our research includes how these organisms lived, how they were affected by environmental change like a changing climate, how they're related, and much more.</p>
<p>You can learn more about SVP in <a href="http://vertpaleo.org/the-Society/We-are-SVP.aspx" target="_blank">this video</a> or <strong>follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/svp_vertpaleo" target="_blank">@SVP_vertpaleo</a></strong>.</p>
<p>We're at our 77th Annual Meeting in Calgary, Alberta. Ask us your vertebrate paleontology questions! We'll be here to answer your questions at 1pm Mountain Time (3pm eastern)!</p>
<p><strong>Edit: And we're off! Thank you so much for all the fantastic questions!</strong></p>
