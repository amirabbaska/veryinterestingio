		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although the DSM-5 has &quot;Antisocial Personality Disorder&quot;, this seems to be much more based on the impulsive criminal behavior clinicians come across in the criminal population and disregards the functional psychopaths and sociopaths in society.  People with Dependent Personality Disorder and Narcissistic Personality Disorder (for example) can also be fully functional in society, yet they get the &quot;benefit&quot; of a diagnosis.  So why has Psychopathy/Sociopathy been dismissed?</p>
<p>EDIT: lots of interesting information, but very little actually addresses my question directly.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: iglet007 gives a great answer.  Read it.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clinical psychologist here. The short answer to your question is it was completely arbitrary and was decided by a group of clinicians in a room as the DSM-III was being created.</p>
<p>The long answer has to do with the history of the transition from the DSM-II to the DSM-III. At the time, a psychiatrist named Robert Spitzer and his colleagues from several different disciplines formed an editing team for the DSM-III. Over the course of many meetings they proceeded to establish which disorders would go into the new revised DSM (DSM-III was the first major expanded edition unlike the DSM-II which was a tiny thing of less than 100 pages). A lot of this process was arbitrary in that the clinicians would propose names of conditions that they felt best represented the clinical traits they observed in practice. The conditions and the traits were not systematically decided on other than voting. </p>
<p>When it came to psychopathy, a sociologist by the name of Lee Robins argued that empathy (the lack of which is the cornerstone of psychopathy) could not be measured and quantified properly. Therefore, it would be too subjective a criterion to be a part of a diagnostic category and should be thrown out. After much debate, the team decided to exclude psychopathy on this basis and lump its traits into Antisocial Personality Disorder, which was considered to be more a measurable diagnosis.</p>
<p>In short, the above completely arbitrary assignment of traits and labels brought about most of the mental health disorders we know today. Lee Robins's argument single handedly kept out psychopathy out of the DSM for no reason other than his feeling that it was not measurable. These kinds of examples are often used by opponents of the DSM to argue against the categorical diagnostic system that we have.</p>
<p>Hope this addresses your question directly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They’ve not been dismissed, they’ve been reclassified due to new, more effective diagnostic criterion and to hopefully diminish the use of mental illness as equated with criminal behavior.  </p>
<p>It happens in medicine all the time— we don’t call PTSD shell-shock anymore, we don’t call panic disorders hysteria (which has really sexist roots btw), we don’t identify Aspergers as a unique diagnosis within the autism spectrum just because those individuals happen to have academically-oriented special interests. It’s just the evolution of medicine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of DSM-5 diagnoses that don’t match up with colloquial terminology people use. For instance, “depression” is not the name of a disorder - because depression is a normal human emotion that everyone will feel at some point - but “major depressive disorder” is.</p>
<p>And transgender used to be a DSM diagnosis, I don’t remember the exact word that was used, but it has been changed with the DSM-5 to “gender dysphoria” to make it clear that the “disorder” is the mental anguish at your biological sex being at odds with how you feel, not just the fact that you feel that in the first place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you view cluster B personality disorders, sociopathy/psychopathy can be used to describe anyone of them, the closest of which being anti-social personality disorder. </p>
<p>Compare it to things like melancholy vs depression or hysteria vs mania.</p>
<p>Simply put, sociopathy is not a descriptive enough or well defined enough disorder to be an official diagnosis. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
