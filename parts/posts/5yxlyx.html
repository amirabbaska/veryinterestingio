		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a theory called the Sapir-Wharf hypothesis that claims that your mother tongue will alter the way you perceive the world. Wharf was a motha- fuckin genius who was a chemist that studied the causes of factory fires back in the 20s/30s/40s. His research started on language when he saw that &quot;empty&quot; oil barrels was a cause of an explosion when workers threw cigarettes onto them. The word empty means void of anything or nothingness in space. But what our language made us think was that empty meant everything visible. So back then, vapors sitting in that barrel didn't &quot;exist&quot; because they were empty. </p>
<p>Some great examples of this hypothesis is cardinal versus perceived directions (North East South West versus Left Right). In America I tell you to go left on Warner and the Right on Hoille. Aborigines know directions as in cardinal. They can say go West here and then South there. And no matter what they'll understand which way is what. This changes the way we see the world how exactly? Perceived directions are ever hanging depending on the way we face. My left is your right, and vice versa. Cardinal is always the same. No matter where you stand north with always be north. Now this is an extremely abstract example that's hard to understand how it changes the way we see things. </p>
<p>So example 2</p>
<p>Hopi time and Western time. I am going to the store. Now I'm at the store. I was at the store. Future, present, past. There is things happening before now and something will happen after now. That's how western nations (mainly the whole world actually sees time). The Hopi though don't have a future tense. It be We are leaving for the store right now. At that point we are going to 7/11. And there we are going back home. Everything is happening now, it's not going to happen cause the future tense doesn't really exist (and it's incomprehensible in the English language to explain it because we don't use those terms)</p>
<p>Final example, probably the easiest to understand.
Feminine and masculine terms in French and German. Bridge in German is a feminine term, and the Germans, when describing bridges give it femine descriptions such as sleek, long, slender, while bridge in French is masculine and is described as durable, strong, bulk. Just by changing the way a word is described (masculine versus feminine) it changes the way people see non-gendered items in everyday life</p>
<p>Edit:
I study anthropology and have taken a few courses on linguistics and culture </p>
<p>Edit: I switched German and French by mistake </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of debate about this, and the answer is unclear. /u/SleeplessinRedditle quoted a study by Chen, who is an economist and not a linguist, but he makes several very basic errors: for example, he claims English has a &quot;strong&quot; future tense and German has a &quot;weak&quot; future tense, but in fact both languages express the future in almost exactly the same ways (he claims that English always requires a future marker except in very specific cases which he then sets aside, but this is completely false). His hypothesis also fails to explain why savings rates in different countries with the same languages vary so much: Ireland is near the top of the chart in the linked article, Australia near the middle, and the US and the UK right at the bottom.</p>
<p>The basic idea that language can affect how you think is known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (although neither Sapir nor Whorf actually formulated it), and has been floated around and discussed since 1929: it's more correctly called &quot;linguistic relativity&quot;. It comes in two basic versions: linguistic determinism says that the language you speak necessarily restricts the range of possible thoughts you can have and so dictates how you perceive things; linguistic influence says that the language you speak can have some effect on how you think and perceive in some ways, but doesn't dictate everything.</p>
<p>Chen appears to lean towards determinism; if you've seen <em>Arrival</em>, the scriptwriters basically took the determinist model of Sapir-Whorf and ran with it. Obviously, learning a new language can't literally rewire your brain to the extent that you can see all of time -- it makes a great movie, but scientifically it's bunk -- but the consensus among linguists at the moment is that there is no evidence at all to support the idea of linguistic determinism.</p>
<p>Basically, linguistic determinism says that before you can think, you must have language. People who speak languages that use the same word for &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;green&quot; can't tell the difference between those two colours.</p>
<p>However, research suggests the opposite: that we are all born able to think, and then we learn a language that enables us to express those thoughts. Somebody who speaks a language that makes no distinction between &quot;green&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; can still tell the difference between them: they just use the same label for them.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, this chimes in with my experience. Russian has different words for what we call different shades of blue: I can still see the difference between them, but I take longer than a native speaker of Russian to decide which word goes with which shade.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11759-russian-speakers-get-the-blues/" target="_blank">This study</a> suggests that the language does make a bit of a difference -- just not a big one.</p>
<p>Having lived in Germany now for nearly 25 years, I can say that learning the language hasn't made me better at saving money, or changed my perception in any meaningful way. There are some things I can express better in German than in English and vice versa: I don't <em>think</em> differently, but I am able to express a slightly different range of thoughts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're talking about, the idea that our native language shapes our cognitive process, is called the &quot;Sapir-Whorf hypothesis&quot; it was a very popular idea in the social sciences in the second half of the 20th century. Nowadays, most social scientists seem to accept a &quot;soft&quot; version of the hypothesis. That is, language has an effect on our cognition, but it is not nearly as strong an effect as originally proposed by Sapir and Whorf.</p>
<p>Here's an example that is often used to demonstrate the idea in social science classes. If you take 4 different objects, and arrange them in a cross, have the subject look at them for 4 seconds, have them close their eyes and move to the opposite side of the cross from which they observed it, scatter the objects, and ask them to rearrange them.</p>
<p>One of two things will happen: either the person will rearrange them correctly, or else they will rearrange them correctly, but mirrored. This is because there are basically two ways that humans considers space and relationality: we call them &quot;egocentric&quot;, where you use your own body as the ordinal point. This is what results in the mirrored arrangement. There is also &quot;geocentric&quot;, where you ordinate based on the cardinal directions.</p>
<p>In English, when we relay directions, it is most common to say things like &quot;take a left up at the light, go five blocks, and ten right&quot; this is egocentric ordination. For this reason, usually when the experiment is conducted on native English speakers, they will arrange the objects in the mirror pattern.</p>
<p>But! Here's where it gets interesting, and how we come to the acceptance of a &quot;soft&quot; Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. I am a native English speaker, but I am also from the Great Plains. People from areas like the Great Plains, or deserts, or seafaring peoples, due to a lack of landmarks outside of cities, tend to ordinate geocentrically regardless of their native languages preference for expressing direction. So when I did this experiment, I arranged the shapes correctly, even though my perspective had changed. So while our language does affect our cognition, it can be proven to be &quot;trumped&quot; by other factors such as home environment, etc.</p>
<p>Now to give a counter example of why the &quot;strong&quot; Sapir-Whorf hypothesis has largely been discarded: (please remember this is an ELI5 so I am vastly oversimplifying) consider the Japanese language. In Japanese, there is not really a proper future tense. It is implied through context, or through using the present tense but marking location in the future. If we accepted the original Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, this would lead to the conclusion that native Japanese speakers are not able to fully consider the future in the same way as speakers of languages with a dedicated future tense. However, we can see this to be fallacious by looking at household savings rates in Japan as compare to America, where English, a language with a dedicated future tense, is the primary language. Japanese household savings rates are on average, much much higher than America's. This would seem to discredit a &quot;strong&quot; Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.</p>
<p>I think this is a little thick for an ELI5 so I apologize, but I hope that helped a little.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have zero science to back this up, just personal experience. I've spoken English and Portuguese fluently since I was a child (I also speak Spanish and basic Russian now). I live in the US, but when I spend about a week back in Portugal, I feel like something &quot;switches&quot; in my brain. I start dreaming in Portuguese and my tone, speed, inflection, and volume are all much different when I speak it. I vaguely remember reading an article once saying people who natively speak more than one language can experience different personalities. I believe it. I feel more outgoing and funny when I speak Portuguese, and I'm much more cynical and sarcastic when using English. </p>
<p>Edit: through the powers of google here's the link to the above referenced article
<a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2013/11/multilingualism" target="_blank">http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2013/11/multilingualism</a></p>
<p>There is a KEY distinction it appears between bilingualism and biculturalism which seems to be the most important factor. For me, it seems the &quot;differences&quot; I feel when speaking the two languages have more to do with cultural influence and less to do with the grammatical structure of the language. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
