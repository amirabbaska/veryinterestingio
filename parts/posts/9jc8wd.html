		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The UAC prompt (User Account Control, the window that asks Yes/No if you want to allow a program to elevate it's privileges) runs in the 'secure desktop'. The program which requested the elevated privileges has no way (without already having very high privileges) of interacting with that secure desktop. That's why the program can't just click Yes by itself - when that dialog box appears, you're seeing a secure desktop which is heavily locked down to the point where most non-kernel software can't interact with it in any way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The progams don't ask you for permission to run, windows itself asks you if you want to give the program permission to run.</p>
<p>So, for a malicious program:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You accidentally click on program / download something with the program in it and run it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Program, needing access to sensitive files/information, tells windows to give it the info</p>
</li>
<li>Windows asks you, the owner, for permission to let it give the programs that kind of info/access</li>

<p>I'm selling/giving away cookies (software). You come and grab some. But before you can eat them, your mom(the OS) stops and askes very seriously &quot;do you trust u/dazza93?&quot;.</p>
<p>I can't tell your mom anything except the cookies' name.</p>
<p>If you don't trust me your mom will take the cookies away (stop the program), for later if you trust me.</p>
<p>You can tell your mom to throw the cookies away as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>windows does that as part of the UAC(User control Access ) system when it needs ot have &quot; adminstrator&quot; privileges on a non adminstrator account.</p>
<p>the program doesnt get permisison, Windows is asking you if you want ot give it to them. since this generally requires inputting the adminstrator password a malicious program cant force you t odo it unless:</p>
<p>the system is already compromised, the attackers already knows the password required</p>
<p>the code was executed on an already elevated privilege enviroment(ie: the local administrator)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not familiar with the way Windows really works, but every program has to ask Windows for file access and authorization to do any action. Some may be harmless and it always allows it. Others may be more sensitive, and the OS will block them before the user authorizes.</p>
<p>So a piece of code can't just say &quot;if something pops up asking for authorization, click yes&quot; - Windows likely won't present or allow that action. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
