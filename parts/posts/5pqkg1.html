		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Colonel originated as a Italian military rank, where it indicated the leader of a column (group of companies) of men (so the name is no surprise).  </p>
<p>In Spain however, the word used to describe a similar rank (leader of companies of men) was <em>coronel</em> (which may have happened because <em>corona</em> is crown so <em>coronel</em> implies royal authority).  So the term <em>coronel</em> migrated to English, and the word started being pronounced according to English rules, which is where the modern pronunciation came from.  </p>
<p>Later, as European communication increased and military ranks were becoming more standardized the spelling was changed to better reflect the original Italian roots of the word, but the pronunciation was well established and remained true to the Spanish coronel.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
