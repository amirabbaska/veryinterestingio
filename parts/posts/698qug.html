		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was an episode of House that was leaked early, and it didn't have some effects edited in yet (it was an early cut of the episode). One thing I remember was somebody was smoking a cigarette, except it wasn't lit. There was an on screen note that said &quot;Add cigarette smoke effect here&quot; or some such.</p>
<p>So I guess it depends on the production.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Despite the other posts, who are wrong, they do in fact use prop cigarettes.  Traditionally they were &quot;herbal cigarettes&quot; that pretty much looked and burned real, but were not filled with tobacco and didn't have nicotine.  Now, they use a combination of these or vapes that are designed to look real.</p>
<p>The herbals still had tar and smoke and other things that weren't good to breathe, but they were non-addictive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;I had a small scene in a movie with Peter Frampton. And we had to smoke pot for our scene - but it was fake pot! Do not buy pot on a movie set. But I got to smoke fake pot with Peter Frampton, that's a cool story. It's as cool as smoking real pot with a guy who looks like Peter Frampton... I've done that way more&quot; - Mitch Hedgerg</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was an extra on HBO's The Leftovers. All the cigarettes handed to the &quot;Guilty Remnants&quot; were vaping cigs. I guess they're expensive because despite HBO paying a $1M budget for each episode, the crew told us &quot;Do NOT smoke unless the director says 'Action!'.&quot; They were very strict about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in theater; on the stage, depending on things like actor comfort, laundry, and fire proofing requirements, we will sometimes use a real cigarette. Other times when we have the budget, we'll use an e-cigarette that looks and behaves like a real one(the vapor is the giveaway; it disappates almost immediately). There are also things known as &quot;puffers&quot;, paper tubes with a little fake cherry in the end, and when you blow into it powder comes out the end and simulates smoke. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
