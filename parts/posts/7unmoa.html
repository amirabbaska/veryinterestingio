		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A hiccup is caused by a muscle spasm of the diaphragm. The diaphragm is a thin muscle layer under your lungs that helps separate the chest space (which holds mainly your heart and lungs) from the abdominal space. The way air is pulled in during a breath is by flexing the diaphragm. The lungs themselves are not made of muscle so they don't actually do any of the pulling.
During a hiccup, the diaphragm has a spasm which causes a sudden contraction, just like a spasm in any arm or leg muscle, and this is paired with your throat closing in reflex to this spasm down below.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/JustThisHoopyFrood answered your question about what hiccups are. Here's a bit about why they happen.</p>
<p>There’s an excellent evolutionary biology book called Your Inner Fish by Neil Shubin, in which he discusses the reason why we get hiccups from an evolutionary standpoint. [This article]( <a href="http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0812/features/fish_out_of_water.shtml" target="_blank">http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0812/features/fish_out_of_water.shtml</a>) is an adaptation of Shubin’s explanation (the part about hiccups is section III).</p>
<p>To paraphrase: The brainstem controls unconscious, rhythmic breathing, by controlling chest muscles and the diaphragm. But, the controls system originally evolved to control fish breathing, involving throat and gill muscles. The same nerves innervate the diaphragm that innervated the gill system. They come from the brain stem, which made sense in fish, because the gills were a short distance from the brainstem. In humans, though, the nerves have to travel out from the brainstem down to the diaphragm [(phrenic nerve)]( <a href="https://www.epainassist.com/images/what-is-phrenic-nerve.jpg" target="_blank">https://www.epainassist.com/images/what-is-phrenic-nerve.jpg</a>), meaning that things can easily interfere with them and cause diaphragm spasms. When the diaphragm spasms, the glottis closes, making the “hic” sound. It’s thought that this evolved in our amphibious ancestors, specifically for their tadpoles, which use both gills and lungs. Tadpoles have pattern generators in their brainstems that shuts the glottis when they pump water into their mouths. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spasm of the diaphragm muscle - super thin muscle that divides your lungs and heart from your abdomen.  It creates the negative pressure that lets you take a breath.  When it's relaxed, it's bent up, and when it contracts, it goes down, pulling open your lungs.  So that's why a hiccup - a contraction - makes you breathe in quickly.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to study this, but current theories are that irritation of the throat, esophagus, and or stomach can stimulate the nerves that pick up signals from these areas and cause the brain to send signals back down to try and react in some way. These signals can also be sent down the pyramid nerve which goes down to the diaphragm, causing hiccups.
Another thought is that foods that can irritate the stomach or cause too much air to be swallowed simultaneously cause the stomach to get bloated or annoyed and press on the diaphragm, causing irritation in that as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since you've already been provided with a definition, I can at least provide a fun fact - if you have them in excess of 48 hours it's recommended to go to a doctor just in case there's a tumor or something pressed up against the diaphragm. I had hiccups for 52 hours straight a few years back so I learned a lot from frantic googling.</p>
<p>Also, you'll find that when you have the hiccups for so long everyone you meet will have some sort of weird recommendation for trying to cure them and none of them will work. Controlled breathing was the only thing that would give me a temporary pause</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
