Additionally, he made a public statement about the work after its release. How do we still not know who he is?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>His inner circle is very tight knit. Everybody who deals with him directly has an interest in maintaining his anonymity. For those who interact with him professionally, this anonymity is a still significant contributor to the value of his work. For those who are his friends and family, protecting his anonymity is about respecting his desire to live and work this way. </p>
<p>There are photos of him out there, but this tight knit inner circle is effective because there is never a verifiable confirmation by anybody who knows him personally to say &quot;yes - that's him&quot;. So the photos and &quot;Is This The Real Banksy???&quot; headlines are just left hanging out there.</p>
<p>Statements can be released through spokespeople. Works done in public spaces might be created by Banksy, but put up by other people. Anyone brought in from outside to be involved in a work will only deal with Banksy's crew, not Banksy himself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Banksy's identity has been known for a long time. Google it. Though a) it's no one you've otherwise heard of and b) he and his people will never confirm it.</p>
<p>Ultimately it's irrelevant. I could tell you his name is Bob Sampson a 48 year old builder from Frome. Because you've no idea who Bob Sampson is, that information barely registers to you. Doesn't matter. Only if I told you it was Gary Barlow from Take That would it pique your interest. </p>
<p>Thing is, everyone prefers not knowing. His identity already Is Banksy. Outing him fully, with confirmation, would just mean Banksy stops making work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You don't talk about fight club.</p>
<p>I had a geologist friend that had to do some work in Death Valley.  He tells me that one of the first things he was told was basically &quot;You shall not solve the mystery of the sliding rocks&quot;.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
