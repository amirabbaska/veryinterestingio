		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is called &quot;Orthostatic Hypotension&quot;. Most people have it in some degree or another, and some even faint. Tall people usually get the worst of it. It happens when your blood pools in your legs and doesn't go back to the brain fast enough, starving it of that precious oxygen. It can also happen while having bowel movements, peeing right after you wake up, standing still for long periods of time in hot, crowded places (see when teenagers pass out during boy-band concerts? Yeah, that's what it is), having your arms up for too long, or over-excerting yourself at the gym. These episodes can be countered by contracting your abdomen and exhaling strongly. Also a diet rich in sodium, and lots of water.</p>
<p>Not so fun fact: I knew an old guy who had heart surgery. One day he went to pee and died. His heart couldn't take it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normally when you move around, muscles in your legs assist in the venous return of blood against gravity from the lower part of your body. </p>
<p>When you are sitting, these don't work as hard, and blood can pool as you stand up, leading to a temporary decrease in blood pressure to the brain until those muscles get back on the job.</p>
<p>This can affect people to differing severity, and the severity can differ depending on how abrupt the transition is for a single person. Some people don't have any problem at all with it, some people can pass out momentarily. </p>
<p>Getting up slowly can usually moderate the effect. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, it's likely orthostatic hypotension, a drop in blood pressure from standing too quickly.  </p>
<p>Staying hydrated is very important, most people don't drink enough water and are on the dehydrated side, this can make things worse.  Do you take blood pressure medication?  It's a common side effect, you should speak with your doctor.  </p>
<p>A common tip is to get up slowly.  If you're laying down, sit up slowly, sit for a minute and let your body catch up.  Then stand slowly, and stand for a minute, let your body catch up again, and then go.</p>
<p>If you're hydrated and still getting this, you should see your doctor.  You may have hypotension or something else going on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone with POTS who is tired of hearing &quot;it's orthostatic hypotension&quot;
It MAY NOT BE orthostatic hypotension but it could be.
It is not the only orthostatic intolerance out there people!
It could be orthostatic tachycardia!
It could be nuerally mediated syncope
It could be hyper orthostatic tachycardia!</p>
<p>You don't know until you have tilt table testing! Don't listen to these people and screw any medical professional that jumps to that conclusion!!! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
