<p>Inorganic mercury itself actually isn’t that dangerous (except to the kidney). It becomes harmful when it becomes methylated into methylmercury by enzymes inside your cells. For most toxicants, these enzymes change the toxicant in a way that makes it more water soluble (so it leaves the body in urine), but for mercury, methylation makes it less water soluble so it stays inside your cells and body compartments for a long time (MeHg’s half life is roughly 45 days, meaning it takes 45 days for half of it to leave your body, which is extremely long). Note that mercury from fish in our diet is already methylated.</p>
<p>As for how methylmercury actually causes damage inside the body, the main mechanism is oxidative stress. Methylmercury is a nucleophile, so it can donate an electron to various molecules in the cell in a way that usually damages them. Cells respond to high stress by upregulating glutathione conjugation enzymes, that will help to get mercury and other oxidant molecules out of the cell, though there is a limit to how fast it can work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mercury is usually a liquid at room temperature, but even at room temperature it can transition into its vapor form. The vapor form is very toxic because it can be inhaled and take residence in the body. In the body, mercury is present as a 2+ ion. Mercury can efficiently compete with other 2+ ions, such as Zn 2+, that are located in the active/structural sites of enzymes. This competition allows for the enzyme to use mercury instead of the required metal. The change in metal causes the enzyme to be structurally changed in a way where it may no longer perform its biological function. So, the enzyme is turned off. In the case of a zinc utilizing enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase, the zinc acts as a structural support unit and without it your body could no longer metabolize the alcohol we drink. This would lead to a build up of toxic compounds (in this case ethanol) that would kill you. </p>
<p>tldr: Mercury changes important enzymes in a way that hinders their job. Without the enzymes, toxic compounds build up and you die. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of bad stuff happens. Mercury strongly inhibits selenium dependent enzymes, creates oxidative stress, and tends to interfere with basically any protein that contains sulfur (which most proteins do).</p>
<p>Overall, these combined effects result in severe toxicity to cells.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not <em>that</em> dangerous. You can handle liquid mercury or even drink it without drastic effects. People used to be quite cavalier with it, for medicine or amusement. They noticed effects from occupational exposure (hatters, alchemists...) but necessarily occasional use. This is because the liquid doesn't get adsorbed at all easily. The biggest immediate danger from pure Hg is the vapor, which is more easily adsorbed and can accumulate in enclosed spaces. Hence indoor mercury spills are a serious problem since they can emit enough vapor to poison people (especially developing children) for a long time. Outdoor mercury contamination is bad because the element eventually ends up in the food chain, in easily absorbed organic form. As an element it doesn't degrade, but just keeps getting passed up from little fish to big fish, until it reaches dangerous concentrations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/0Yhaei1S5oQ" target="_blank">interesting video by SciShow</a> that details Mercury and it's different forms that can be toxic or lethal to animals and people. It relates to the industrial pollution that occurred in Minamata, Japan during the 1950's. Hopefully it can help explain some of the interactions between cells and organic/inorganic Mercury.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
