		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Still very much a thing, but less so in the western countries. One of the primary causes was high amounts of atmospheric sulfur caused by things like coal burning power plants. In response to this there were regulations passed that cut down on the amount of sulfur released into the atmosphere. Power companies started using catalysts in their exhaust systems that either trap the sulfur or convert it to a more harmless form. </p>
<p>There are also different types of coal with some producing less sulfur. It is also possible to pre-treat coal before burning that produces less sulfur. <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=29812" target="_blank">This is a good article</a> on the decline of sulfur emission in US power plants. </p>
<p>Sulfur dioxide for instance can combine with water to form sulfuric acid. (same thing that makes your eyes water when cutting an onion). Also the same thing that eats through  metal, plants, and people if spilled on them. Hence the name acid rain. Even in very small quantities, it is enough to change soil PH and start killing off plants. It wasn't that the rain would melt things, just that it would hurt plant (and hence animal) life and ruin soil. </p>
<p>Here is an interesting tid bit though; sulfur dioxide helps cool the planet..... And ironically by reducing the man made levels as much as we have, it's helped the greenhouse effect trap heat better and contributed to man made warming. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Acid rain is primarily caused by specific kinds of air pollutants. Legislation in North America and Europe successfully limited the emission of these pollutants--for example, through the establishment of a &quot;cap and trade&quot; system that limits the total pollution and requires companies to pay more to buy the a greater share of that cap. That's why it's not nearly as serious of a problem anymore in the West and you don't hear about it: the solutions are working.</p>
<p>In many industrializing countries, however, like China, acid rain is still a serious problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
