		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>The lifespan for an LED bulb is actually measured in hours of use and on/off cycles, not years.</strong> Primarily we're concerned with hours of use, which is almost always the limiting factor but on/off cycles do have some effect.</p>
<p>There's then a set standard of hours per day that a bulb is expected to perform - eg an assumption that the bulb will be used for an average of, say, 3 hours per day (which I believe is roughly the industry standard). I don't know if this is the exact number used, but you get the idea. The standard used is that once the bulb is &lt;50% or &lt;70% of the original brightness (the number varies by jurisdiction), it is considered &quot;failed&quot; and in need of replacement.</p>
<p>So for example if the assumption is that the bulb will be used for an average of 3 hours per day, we divide the rated number of hours by 3 and then divide that by 365 to know how many years the bulb should be last.</p>
<p>Similarly if the assumption is each bulb is turned on/off twice per day, then we divide the number of on/off cycles by 2 and then divide that by 365 to know how many years it should last. This is usually a &quot;use it until it breaks&quot; thing, and is pretty rare with LED's.</p>
<p>The expected lifespan is the smaller of these two numbers (almost always the number of hours). The companies aren't allowed to round the numbers up (so can't say 15 years), but at the same time 14.8 sounds better than 14, so they don't want to round down.</p>
<p>Note that there's no guarantee of these numbers, they're based on what's called &quot;Mean Time To Failure&quot; (MTTF) which is basically &quot;on average, how long will a bulb last&quot; (although as a comment below points out, I believe this isn't a <em>true</em> mean/average and doesn't use 50% as the target). Some will last longer, others not as long.</p>
<hr />
<p>So the next part of the puzzle is <strong>how do we get this number?</strong>. Mostly by &quot;accelerated testing&quot; - basically by putting the bulb in a warm environment and then leaving it on 24/7. We know for each of the pieces of the bulb, how much they are affected by heat, so we can know that, for example, it fails 5x faster at 80c than 20c. So if we test at 80c for 24 hours a day, that's roughly the same as testing at 20c for 6 hours a day, but for 20x as long (5x longer because of the heat, and 4x longer because there are 4x 6 hours per day). This means we can test for 1 year and actually have a decent idea of the lifespan of around 20 years.</p>
<p>As an extra &quot;bonus&quot;, we don't even necessarily have to test until every bulb fails - if we take enough bulbs, we can wait until maybe 1/4 have failed and extrapolate the overall failure rate from this. Meaning the testing can be done in &lt;1 year even for a product with a 20+ year lifespan.</p>
<p>This comment may help to some extent, too - I won't try to steal it, but it's worth a read </p>

<p>As mentioned in another comment, LED's are not new - it's just that they've recently become much more popular in consumer electronics.</p>
<p><strong>And because this answer has grown to around double the size since I originally wrote it, here's the super TL;DR ELI5</strong></p>
<p>Make it hotter so it breaks faster, then test it 24/7 instead of using it like a normal person would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those bulbs are simply an array of smaller high-power LEDs, placed behind a diffuser to get a more even light over a larger area. The electrical and mechanical properties of those smaller LEDs are very well known, so it's trivial to make assumptions on their life expectancy.</p>
<p>By the way, LED is not a new technology. They have been around since early 60's.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something else no one has mentioned yet is a process called Accelerated Life Testing.  This is an artificial way to test products by speeding up the different stresses and usage a device might experience.  </p>
<p>In the case of light bulbs, that could be higher or lower temperature extremes, rapid on/off cycles, or higher and lower than normal voltages.  </p>
<p>Depending on how long something should last and in what ways it would be expected to fail, they can design specific tests to average out the time it takes to fail, and from that you get the estimated times seen on packaging.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked as an Failure Analysis Electrical Engineer. You put tons of components through stress tests for long periods of time. Some stress tests induce humidity, some heat, some cold, some pressure, some a combination of those. You also run the components at a high voltage on the threshhold of its operating voltage to induce more stress on it. The stress accelerates the wear on the part simulating more time passing, this is described as the acceleration factor. After getting all this data you can use the acceleration factor and probability concepts to determine the failure rate and mean time to failure, estimating how long a part is expected to last.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
