		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The really ELI5 answer. Everything wants to make a single ball of stuff because of gravity. But just like a centrifuge, spinning makes things want to go to the outside. Since they are only spinning in one direction, they only move to the outside in one direction. So you have a ball that is spinning and spitting out stuff in one direction, making it 2D. It is kept 2D because things attract each other, and the closes thing is in a 2D plane with it, so it keeps it in the plane.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any time you have a large number of objects near each other, gravity is going to tend to pull them all to a point.  UNLESS they are revolving around some point in space.  And if they are moving at all, there is almost certainly some amount of revolution to the combined motion.  </p>
<p>What you really look at is the overall average motion of all the objects combined.  So even if they are revolving in different planes, or even different directions, the average is going to be some revolution in a single direction around a particular axis.  And as they all settle down, they will converge into a disc that lies in the plane orthogonal to the axis of the overall average motion. </p>
<p>--  </p>
<p>EDIT:  OK, I understand this is not ELI5 enough.  I am penitent.  If you don't mind, I'll try again:<br />
Say you have a large cloud of little objects in space, pebbles or whatever.  Everything has gravity, so all these things will try to pull together until it is a single ball.  Taking all of their gravities together, you could say they are all being attracted to the center of the cloud.  When it all comes together, it is nearly certain that the ball will be spinning because every little piece will add its motion to the ball- some will push it one way and some the other, but when you add it all up, there's going to be some total that is more than zero.  It will be moving through space, and also rotating.  The rotating part is the part that will help us answer the original question.  </p>
<p>So let's look at our cloud after it has been around a while but before it becomes a ball.  The pebbles are all pulled towards that center point, but they aren't just sinking straight towards it - they will sort of spiral in.  At the beginning, some will be spiraling one way and some the other.  The ones that are going against the majority are going to get pushed like a guy on a crowded sidewalk until they are going roughly the same way.  </p>
<p>Now look at any one pebble, revolving around the point at the center of the cloud.  It's moving in an oval-ish path, which is naturally 2d.  Then look at just two pebbles- imagine these two near-circles around the same point, but at an angle to each other.  The two pebbles each have a tiny bit of gravity and they are going to try to pull together.  So over time, the angle between the circles will become less and less until they are in the same plane.  This will happen to all the pebbles, all tilting their paths closer and closer to each other.  And since the motion of each individual is naturally a 2d path, when they all eventually pull each other together, the overall shape is 2d.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The orbiting objects have a single combined angular momentum that remains constant.  Angular momentum is basically a direction that everything is moving in if you add up the movements of all the objects.  In a 3-dimensional space, that net angular momentum can only spin along a single plane.  The movement to each side of the plane cancels out over time as the orbiting objects hit against one another.  Eventually the system is left with objects moving around the plane in the direction of the system's angular momentum.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do start as large balls of stuff with random orbits, but as they orbit, things end up colliding with each other and get bumped into new orbits. Objects in similar orbits are much less likely to collide, and so most of the collisions are between objects with orbits that aren't along the main plane. The objects orbiting in the disc dont get hit as much so they stay in the disc, while objects with orbits outside the plane have a much higher chance of getting hit, and some of these hits cause the object to line up with the plane. Over time these hits add up, and more and more objects get hit into orbiting in the disc.
Same idea with galaxies and other objects, except instead of collisions it's the gravity of the stars pulling on each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, everything is moving.  Saturn's rings aren't just stationary around the planet.  Each individual rock or dust particle is traveling fast enough to maintain its orbit around Saturn.  (or any other celestial body, but Saturn is an easy reference for us)</p>
<p>Also, anything in orbit must travel completely around a planet.  That's just how orbits work.  You can't have something doing little donuts over the north pole.  That item would fall.  In order to maintain a stable orbit, each individual item is going the longest route possible around its planet.</p>
<p>So that means, if you did have a full sphere/cloud, you're gonna get collisions.  Rocks traveling along the equator are going to crash into rocks traveling at any other angle, and vice versa.</p>
<p>On a long enough time-line (millions and millions of years) all of those collisions will create a uniform 2d disk.</p>
<p>As to why that disk forms where it does:  because spinning.  Other people have covered that portion pretty well already, so I won't rehash... though, fun fact: the earth isn't exactly a sphere.  It's round-ish, but wider along the middle than top to bottom. The proper term is oblate spheroid. Because spinning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
