if I wanted to make 1 gram of some matter (does it even matter what element it is?), how many watt hours is that?
Given the power grid of say, the entire USA, or all electrical power used on earth (Whatever is easier to find in a google search), how long would it take to make that 1 gram of matter? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general you need energy equivalent to the amount of mass you want to create, according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence. In practice, if you want to be able to generate any sort of particle out of nothing, you'll need much more energy to control the processes and machinery you use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wanted to add that besides the &quot;raw&quot; energy of the new particle you usually &quot;use up&quot; more energy because of conservation of momentum.</p>
<p>Imagine you shoot one proton with a kinetic energy of 1.8 GeV at another proton at rest. This process can create a proton-antiproton-pair while preserving the two original protons. The mass of the proton is equivalent to about 0.9 GeV. So is 1.8 GeV of kinetic energy actually enough? No, because the proton and antiproton would &quot;use up&quot; all the kinetic energy just to be created. This means that all four particles would be at rest. The total momentum would be zero as well and conservation of momentum would be violated.</p>
<p>The actual kinetic energy required is 6 times the rest energy of the proton so nearly 6 GeV!</p>
<p>That's also the reason why it is more &quot;economic&quot; to collide particles moving at each other heads on instead of shooting one particle at a stationary target.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the energy cost issue, you can't just make whole atoms - pair production or other forms of energy-mass conversion have a variety of endpoints, but none of them are whole atoms. You'd have to assemble the atoms later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
