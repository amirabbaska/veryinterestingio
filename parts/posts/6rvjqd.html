		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I never understood why airline companies think it's a better idea to load passengers on a plane front to back. I understand that the first class passengers would like to get off the plane before everyone else. Which they could still do if they get on last (also opportunity to spend less time in an uncomfortable seat.) However, it seems it would be much more efficient to load a plane like literally every other form of mass transportation. First in last out.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Airplanes do not load that way, nor do they load for efficiency.</p>
<p>Airplanes load in the way that is the most financial advantageous to the airline (and this will vary between airlines). They give the best (first) loading to the customers they are making the most money from as an incentive to buy tickets like that and as a benefit of such.</p>
<p>They have done endless, endless research on this, and in the end, its all about the money, thats how they load. Thats how they should load. They are a business, they act in their best business interest and for airlines, its all about maximizing profit on each passenger</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those that pay the most get to sit down first. I think that makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Disabled passengers are usually loaded on first before all of that anyways so that's not really a big issue.</p>
<p>Simply put, then you pay £4000 for your ticket instead of £850, the <strong><em>least</em></strong> they could do is seat you first</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly because it's not really much faster than back to front boarding. The best boarding methods avoid passenger conflicts and attempt to use as much space in the airplane simultaneously as possible. Random boarding is fairly effective.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not always the case.</p>
<p>The famous budget airline Ryanair often conducts boarding from two sides at once!</p>
<p>When you print your boarding pass, it states which entrance you should use.</p>
<p>BTW, you haven't seen airline cost optimization if you haven't flown Ryanair. Trust me :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the obvious first/business boarding first... with checked bag fees, more people bring carry on luggage. If you board back to front, passengers will load their carry ons at random overhead bins towards the front of the plane, and then go to their seats in the back. Ask any flight attendant, they'll confirm it. It's strange to think people would be that inconsiderate, but it's definitely the case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
