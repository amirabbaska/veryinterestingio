		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its a method to discourage you from buying that item by offering two alternatives:   add a fries and drink for $1-2 more, or add more nuggets for another $0.50.       For those who choose neither, or are using a coupon on the single item, oh well.</p>
<p>It's a variation on a common marketing trick.   Offer an unappealing item next to a handful of more appealing items.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Small popcorn: $5.00
Medium Popcorn: $8.50
Large Popcorn: $9.00</p>
<p>you feel like you're getting a bargain by buying the large vs the medium when its only a 50c difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An answer I haven't seen below (sorry if I missed it!) is that the actual cost of the ingredients is an almost insignificant part of the cost to McD in providing you with that box of &quot;food&quot;. I don't actually have figures, but the ingredients probably cost pennies, while the wages of the server, the cost of heating / cleaning / renting space for the outlet, the cost of running the fryer, the air conditioning / ventilation, insurance, etc all cost the same whether they sell you a box of 10 or a box of 20, and surely outweigh the cost of the ingredients.</p>
<p>The profit margin probably isn't anywhere near as different as you might imagine, given the odd prices.</p>
<p>That and all the other reasons people correctly pointed out :-P</p>
<p>I've heard (no source for this) that giving you a cup <em>for</em> soda costs them more than filling it <em>with</em> soda. Remember what you're buying isn't the ingredients, but the convenience of having them provided to you in their &quot;ready to consume&quot; form at a time of your choosing. The same is true of all retail...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
