		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>3 issues come to my mind. The first is designing a spacesuit that lets you breathe normally while your bare foot is exposed. Your foot wouldn't suffer much from the vacuum exposure (see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/70s5om/what_would_happen_if_only_your_arm_and_nothing/" target="_blank">this thread</a> for details), I'm mostly wondering how you would prevent air from leaking. I'll just assume you have a solution for that.</p>
<p>(Edit: there are several followup questions about swelling when your foot is exposed to a vacuum. See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/74vncq/is_it_possible_to_put_my_bare_foot_on_the_moon/do2h116/?context=3" target="_blank">this comment</a> for details and a source).</p>
<p>Then you have the problem of temperature of the lunar surface, extremely hot during the day and extremely cold during the night. Let's assume you're stepping on it at sunrise or sunset when temperatures are milder.</p>
<p>Finally, lunar dust is really harmful. It's because of the lack of weather erosion, grains aren't rounded and retain weird shapes with very sharp edges. Your scenario doesn't involve breathing lunar dust (except for what might penetrate into your suit's air, which isn't negligible), but your foot's skin certainly wouldn't be happy.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my mind this is really two questions.  1) Can you expose your bare feet to the moon's environment?  2) Can you safely put your feet in lunar soil?</p>
<p>As to 1, brief full body exposure (say, 5 seconds) <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660005052.pdf" target="_blank">would not be a problem as long as someone was there to get you immediate and proper re-compression and to save you if you go unconscious (about 10 seconds.)</a></p>
<p>As to 2, there's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_health_effects_from_lunar_dust_exposure" target="_blank">whole article at Wikipedia about it.</a>   So long as you washed your feet after, I can't imagine you coming to any immediate harm.  I imagine it would be something like walking in diatomaceous earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't see it mentioned here yet, but the Moon actually has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_lava_tube" target="_blank">ancient lava tubes</a> in the form of intact/collapsed tunnels.  One or more of these could easily be refurbished, made sufficiently air-tight, and conditioned for human habitation.  Not saying going barefoot would be a good idea for a lunar caveman.  But it is at least a conceptually sound idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Exposure to vacuum is harder than going underwater, because you can't hold your breath (we weren't made for that kind of internal pressure). Plus after a few seconds water would start boiling off exposed membranes. This is worst for your eyes, but some sort of very tight-fitting goggles could help. </p>
<p>That said, none of these problems are going to kill you instantly. Estimates for surviving vacuum exposure suggest you have between 10 and 20 seconds of useful consciousness, and up to a minute of survival. </p>
<p>So, forget the space suit with a hole in the foot, what you really need is an airlock that's not much bigger than you which can depressurize and repressurize extremely quickly. Then, you'd just take a quick hop out the airlock onto that regolith, and back in. 2 seconds on the surface, 4 to depressurize, 4 to repressurize. </p>
<p>You'll probably get a rash on your foot, wash it thoroughly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
