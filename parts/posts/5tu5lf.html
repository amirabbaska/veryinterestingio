		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Small chargers today are switch mode power supplies.</p>
<p>They work, simply said, by first rectifying the alternating mains current to direct current, then chopping it up again to pulses at a much higher frequency, transforming it down and rectifying it again. </p>
<p>That sounds overcomplicated, but transformers for high frequencies are WAY smaller, cheaper and more efficient, which is worth the hassle.</p>
<p>The transformer tends to make a sound, just like the &quot;normal&quot; ones make that familiar hum. It's depending on quality, cheap ones tend to have loose parts which vibrate and make them louder .. but normally the used frequency is way beyond our hearing range, so it seems dead quiet. </p>
<p>If the device is charging and needs less and less power to do that as the battery fills up, the power supply has to reduce the power it delivers to held the output voltage at the same level. This is done by making the pulses of the primary voltage shorter and shorter. </p>
<p>If the device is fully charged and in standby, it needs almost no power, but there is a lower limit how short the pulses can be, so the only choice the charger has is to drop (e.g., very simplfied) every 5th pulse completely or the output voltage would climb too high.</p>
<p>But THAT introduces an additional frequency component at (in that case 1/5th) the normal switching frequency, which you can hear. Since the amout of dropped pulses is varying much with load, the sound tends to be quite irregulary and if you pick it your device to use it, while still connected to the charger, you can often even &quot;hear&quot; the fluctuating current consumption by listening to the changing sound. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The phrase is called coil whine. The highest rated comment nailed the basics. You can solve it easiest by replacing your charger, but if you like to ne a do it yourself-er, opening the charger and securing the transformers and coils with silicone, that should reduce or even remove the sound. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're hearing is coils expanding and contracting of a buck converter, which is just a fancy way of saying a voltage converter that uses pulses(high voltage to low voltage probably). Basically what happens is that the correct voltage is generated by turning on the current to the coil for a certain amount of time and then turning it off at a certain(audible, if you can hear it) frequency. This causes the wire in a coil to expand from the heat that the current is generating and upon turning it off it shrinks again. This causes vibration in the air which is just soundwaves at that point. This frequency also varies depending on the current level of charge in your battery and how fast it's getting charged.</p>
<p>Imagine the coil being a balloon where you fill it with such a frequency that you can vibrate the air and produce sound. That's what happens with a coil.</p>
<p>edit: there is also a bit of magnetism involved in higher currents where the coil gets pushed apart when current is flowing. However I don't know how relevant this part is for small electronics. For superconductors one of the challenges is to keep the coil together because the magnetic field inside the coil can get strong enough to rip the coil apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the supply usually operates waaayy above your hearing range. At low loads, we have to employ tricks like pulse skipping or burst mode operaton so that it turns on and off at a lower frequency. (This is done for boring reasons like avoiding discontinuous conduction in magnetics, outside the realm of an eli5) </p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can hear that slower operaton. It's still actually really doing everything at that high frequency you can't usually hear, but it's turning on and off slow enough that it introduces stuff you can hear. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
