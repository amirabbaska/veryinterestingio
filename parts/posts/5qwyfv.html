		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there, PhD student working with honeybees here. First, it's worth noting that honeybees have largely bounced back from the Colony Collapse Disorder (presumably what you're referring to by &quot;dwindling population&quot;) epidemic of ~2006-2013. CCD was a weird, difficult problem and we may never truly understand what caused it, but neonicotinoid pesticides combined with varroa mite infestations and subsequent disease seem to be the general suspects.  </p>
<p>We have indeed genetically modified honeybees for desirable qualities using good ol' fashioned selective breeding. Bees are considered domesticated, and there's several major lines in production that are cold-tolerant, honey-producing, etc. Noteworthy to decline is we have produced lineages which are termed &quot;hygienic&quot; and behave in such a way to reduce the impact of varroa mite infestation. We can and do artificially inseminate queen bees, but it doesn't seem to take well. We probably could genetically modify bees with modern gene techniques to be even better, but honestly that's a load of paperwork, effort, and funding to fix a problem that's not really a problem.  </p>
<p>Lastly, honeybees are already an &quot;invasive&quot; species in the United States. They were brought over from Europe a couple centuries ago. You could release a ton of them but there's really no point. There are already feral colonies pretty much everywhere filling the available niche. Interestingly, they don't seem to compete with native bee species but actually have synergistic effects in some areas such as pollination. Right now dwindling native pollinators are the big issue and there's a bit of effort to conserve them and utilize them in agriculture, but by and large honeybees do a great job so there's little economic incentive and probably not much hope in the long run.</p>
<p>Edit for Clarity: Bee populations tanked rapidly over ~6 years due to CCD which stopped in 2013. Populations of bees have recovered and remain stable <em>HOWEVER</em> bees are failing to overwinter or otherwise die early at increasing rates. Right now, we can compensate by simply producing more bees. We don't know exactly why, and as CCD showed us, we don't want to be caught in a situation where we suddenly have no bees and no alternatives. It <em>is</em> a cause for concern, but we are not presently in any sort of &quot;beepocalypse&quot; <em>for the moment</em>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we will kill them again! And because bee populations aren't as endangered as they are portrayed.</p>
<p>Anyway half-related story time: My parents own a house that was owned by an extremely old couple. The back yard had raspberries, roses bushes and sunflowers etc all neatly kept. Well the lady that sold the house to my mom told her not to kill the bees under the shed and to protect them from the neighbors, because they were the reason she had the most beautiful flowers in the neighborhood. This bee hive was massive, and the bees would form a constant black cloud in the far corner of the yard, but they never hurt us (four young kids), so my mom left them. The nosy neighbors next door complained about the danger constantly (I would guess that they were 50-60, never any children around) but their entire back yard was an industrial garage and five feet of patio where the set up chairs facing our yard and watched us play all day (creepy nosy fucks). We moved and my mom let her brother (who also has young children) rent the house. Same complaint from the neighbors about his kids being in danger, but nobody ever got stung so the bees stayed. Eventually the neighbors waited for them to leave the house and went into the yard and killed every single bee, even though the bees were on the opposite corner of the yard from where their patio bordered and they never went near their plantless yard. The house has crappy plants now, and all the fruits and vegetables in the yard stopped producing. Bees will be fine if people would let them live. I think all the endangerment fuss is aimed towards stopping needless destruction (not creating more bees) because they would be fine if everyone wasn't so hell bent on killing every bug in sight. In a way, it scares people into stopping their stupid behavior, rather than putting money into making them people proof.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We basically can/are. As a beekeeper here I can tell you that while there was and is still massive death, we have the ability to create more bees quite easily. The total population isn't so much down, as the death rates are massively up. </p>
<p>Bees are constantly dying year round. We try and start the summer with around 1000 hives, by fall we usually have about 800 left, and after a few months in California we usually hit a low point of about 600.  For some bad years those numbers would be 1000, 600, 300. </p>
<p>Once spring rolls around we split one hive in half, buy a new queen for the &quot;baby&quot; hive, and turned one hive into two. On a good year we can split hives once and by the time spring rolls around our remaining hives are get back up to 1000. On a bad year we might have to split all our hives, wait a few months and then split them all again. </p>
<p>Splitting one good hive results in two weak hives, and spitting a weak hive results in two barely alive hives. The more times you have to split a hive, the longer it takes to reach a productive size. They spend the whole summer growing to the size of a good hive and don't end up making as much honey as a larger hive would. </p>
<p>TL;DR: The CCD problem isn't as bad as it was made out to be. We do have the ability to create new hives but it is expensive and results in less efficient bees.However, If the downward spiral gets out of control it may become impossible to keep up the bee population. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
