Seems like a pretty dark time for that kind of signal-reaching technology, but it's STILL surviving. When will we lose signal with it? I'm just so fascinated by the fact that this thing is so old but still seems futuristic, to this day, in my opinion. The fact that they built this thing and it's so far away at such an incredible speed. </p></div></div>
