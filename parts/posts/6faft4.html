		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm an ironworker. I build skyscrapers and walk on beams hundreds of feet up in the air almost daily and I'm here to tell you... It's all in your head!</p>
<p>We get new guys all the time who can walk the higher beams just fine and also lots of guys who can't. I've seen grown men break down into tears when they try. (Probably chose the wrong profession.)</p>
<p>Also lots of people who have trouble in the beginning get used to it over time. </p>
<p>I see some people saying winds are a factor and they are but less than you might think. It's seriously mostly just a mental thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm seeing responses with 'fear' as one of the culprits. Fear is part of the equation. Your ability to stand and walk relies heavily on sense of sight (try closing your eyes and walking). When you further off the ground your brain has more visual stimulation and I think this interferes with the ability to walk. Walking on a high beam feels a lot like walking with your eyes closed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vision/depth perception is an important factor for balance. You can try standing on one leg or on your toes with your eyes open and then again closed. It is a lot harder with your eyes closed.</p>
<p>When standing on a ledge your eyes might not be closed but the ground is so far away that it's not much of a helpful reference point for fine balance adjustments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it'a an automatic response to the perception of a dangerous situation. For example you wouldn't see crowds of people near a high ledge/cliff although most people don't have an issue with standing a few inches away from a railway platform. Both are potentially as dangerous, we just haven't evolved to have the same fear of trains as we do of large drops </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
