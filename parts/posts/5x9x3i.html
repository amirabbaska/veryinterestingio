		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cambridge!</p>
<p>In or before 1688, Cambridge University used a ranking system for students to help professors keep track of student progress: Fresh Man, Sophmore, Junior Sophister, Senior Sophister.  These terms relate to the Greek &quot;Sophos&quot; meaning knowledge and were meant to reflect the amount of knowledge the student possesses.</p>
<p>Every major English-speaking University copied this in some form or another. It is why we now consider 4 years necessary to obtain a bachelors degree. The actual names of each rank varied from campus to campus. Importantly the names used at Harvard University were &quot;Freshman, Sophomore, Junior Soph, Senior Soph.&quot;  Sometime before 1800 &quot;soph&quot; was dropped from the upperclassmen titles. </p>
<p>In the 19th century the US greatly expanded its high school and university offerings. With many founders educated at Harvard, their system was exported across the US.</p>
<p>So the question should be, why did the British Empire stop using these terms? The answer is Empire. The older Universities in Scotland and Ireland adopted the 4 year system but, because they were not founded by Cambridge alumni, they adopted their own ranking terms. At St. Andrews University, for example, the ranks were bejaune, semi-bejaune, tertiand, and magistrate. As the U.K. sought to standardize education throughout its territory, it sought to not impose one campus culture on another, instead going with very clinical 1st-4th year. </p>
<p>The U.K. Terminology translates easily and is unambiguous even in the US, so it should be used in most cases. </p>
<p>TL;DR - Frontier principals had <del>dilutions</del> delusions of grandeur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These English terms originated during the Renaissance at Cambridge University, which had a three-year course of study. </p>
<p>As other answers have pointed out, <em>freshman</em> is a compound that means &quot;new man&quot;, &quot;novice&quot;. At that time, the upperclassmen were split into <em>junior sophisters</em> (&quot;lesser&quot;, &quot;secondary&quot;) and <em>senior sophisters</em> (&quot;superior&quot;, &quot;greater&quot;, &quot;primary&quot;). <em>Sophister</em> is derived from the Greek <em>sophos</em> meaning &quot;wise&quot;, and in that time meant &quot;arguer&quot; or &quot;debater&quot;.</p>
<p>In the 1600s, a fourth designation came into use: <em>sophumer</em>, which was a synonym for <em>sophister</em>, derived from French instead of directly from the Greek (Think <em>regal</em> vs. <em>royal</em>). This term denoted advanced underclassmen, but at the time was not a separate year of study. Over time, and probably in America first, <em>sophumer</em> became <em>sophomore</em>.</p>
<p>John Harvard, the founder of the university that bears his name, encountered the categories during his study at Cambridge and brought them over to Cambridge, Mass. in the 1630s. Being used at Harvard, they spread to other American universities and came into use in high schools in the early twentieth century.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>in high school, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade are used synonymously with freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior (respectively). in university, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year are associated with these terms.</p>
<p>these terms are used both in high school and college/university and are uncommon outside of the US. canadians typically use grades 9-12, and they'll use first-fourth year (or further, if they've taken extra credits) for university.</p>
<p>a freshman means someone who is new, or a novice. it's a slang term that eventually became official. how it became official? it's unknown but it's likely that because these terms were in use for so long, they started being used in official capacity.</p>
<p>sophomore comes from greek, meaning sophos (think 'philosophy) meaning wise, and moros (think 'moron'). something that is sophomoric, is something that it thought to be a good idea but isn't at all. basically a beginner mistake. why sophomore is used for 2nd year or 10th grade specifically? again: we don't know. it may be that the term was a denigrating term used by juniors and seniors. </p>
<p>junior and senior are upperclassman levels. upperclassmen are people who have been in the school system longer, and may have been a subjective term in the past. now, it's fixed. a junior is a 'junior upperclassman', meaning they're a younger upperclassman. a senior is a 'senior upperclassman', meaning they're an older upperclassman.</p>
<p>so... why these terms instead of year 1, 2, 3, and 4?</p>
<p>in high school and university, one's 'year of study' is not denoted by how many years they've been in the system. it's denoted by how many credits they have toward graduation. this may be an explanation for why 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th year are not as commonly used: their year of study does not adequately describe how many credits (or years of study) they have to graduate. it's not a perfect explanation, though, but it's the best non-etymological one i can think of.</p>
<p>to make things more confusing, there are multiple types of freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors. there are 'redshirt freshmen', who are in their 2nd year of study but play a sport at a freshman level. there are '5th year seniors' (or further on such as 6th year, often called 'super seniors') which are a result of the above paragraph: people which not enough credits to graduate but have been in the program for longer than 4 years. 4th year juniors are often a result of redshirting one's freshman year (or delaying eligibility to play a college sport while still enrolling in the school)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
