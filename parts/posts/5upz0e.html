<p>Which side of Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil should I use, the shiny or the dull side?
Actually, it makes no difference which side of the aluminum foil you useboth sides do the same fine job of cooking, freezing and storing food. The difference in appearance between dull and shiny is due to the foil manufacturing process. In the final rolling step, two layers of foil are passed through the rolling mill at the same time. The side coming in contact with the mill's highly polished steel rollers becomes shiny. The other side, not coming in contact with the heavy rollers, comes out with a dull or matte finish.</p>
<p>The exception is when using Reynolds Wrap® Release® Non-Stick Aluminum Foil. The non-stick coating is applied during manufacturing to the dull side of the foil. Always place the non-stick (dull) side toward the food.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are put through the mill 2 rolls at a time as there is a minimum thickness that you can roll with a foil mill (the rollers are much thinner than a hot mill, including the backup rollers). As /u/Ferk_a_Tawd says the shiny bit are where the foil surface touches the rolls.</p>
<p>Interestingly after they come out of the foil mill they are put into a machine that has rotating saws that cuts the foil to the finished size, but the waste from this process is cubed and sent to paint manufacturers to use in metallic paint for cars :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was told in culinary school that if you wrap something with the shiny side towards the food it'll reflect more heat back at the food and cooks faster. </p>
<p>Meaning for things you want to cook slower, like a braise, you could use the matte side.</p>
<p>Not sure of the validity, I had a few really dumb instructors in school and don't remember which one told me this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
