		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cheating really. Its not a coincidence that mathematics happens to describe reality. We intentionally developed mathematics based on reality. It was quite literally tailored to do just that. </p>
<p>We looked at reality and found relationships , describing those relationships is what math/physics is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because physics follows consistent rules.  No matter what they are, so long as they are consistent, they can be described by math.  Usually, the math comes from the physics, an empirical description of what is happening.  Occasionally, the math fits the physics so well that it can be used to predict previously unobserved physical events.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because mathematics is a tool, like language, that is developed for the purpose of describing things. It can describe real things, imaginary things, and things in between. Thinking of math as a distinct subject, as being separate from its environment, is as much a mistake as thinking of English as separate from its culture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone once asked this in one of my undgergraduate psychology courses, and the professor answered with: &quot;Mathematics is the language of science&quot;, and went on to explain that math is even more organic than language in many cases. If you reach higher levels of physics, you can see that very well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
