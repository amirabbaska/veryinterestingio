<p>I don't get why they need to use THAT much sugar. Wouldn't three spoonfuls do the trick? Yeah, there's more volume in a soft drinks can, but not by a huge margin (let's say 3 spoonfuls for a 200 ml cup of tea = about 5 for 330 ml = half the amount that goes into a can of coke). </p>
<p>Before the Americans come in to tell me about high fructose corn syrup-Coke is still made with sugar over here.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thank you for all your interesting responses, I had never thought that this subject could raise such a debate. The ideas that colder beverages need more sugar than warm beverages, and that carbonation/caffeine make the drink so acidic as to require a 'sweetness counterbalance', seem like the best explanations to me but I can't honestly mark it 'Explained' because there doesn't seem to be any sort of consensus yet. However, I'll check back later. </p>
<p>EDIT 2: Imma call this one explained. I think between you, you've given enough valid explanations to put a bow on this puppy. Well done, go Team Reddit! </p>
<p>To the people asking &quot;who puts three spoonfuls of sugar in coffee?&quot;-that's kind of the point. Three spoonfuls makes coffee undrinkably sweet (for myself and the majority of people at least), but not Coke. To the guy (apparently) calling me a conspiracy nut for asking a question about why Drink 1 is too sweet despite containing less sugar than Drink 2, all I have to say is &quot;What?&quot; (though, of course, we cannot rule out Illuminati involvement).</p></div></div>
