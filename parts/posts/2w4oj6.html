<p>I don't get why they need to use THAT much sugar. Wouldn't three spoonfuls do the trick? Yeah, there's more volume in a soft drinks can, but not by a huge margin (let's say 3 spoonfuls for a 200 ml cup of tea = about 5 for 330 ml = half the amount that goes into a can of coke). </p>
<p>Before the Americans come in to tell me about high fructose corn syrup-Coke is still made with sugar over here.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thank you for all your interesting responses, I had never thought that this subject could raise such a debate. The ideas that colder beverages need more sugar than warm beverages, and that carbonation/caffeine make the drink so acidic as to require a 'sweetness counterbalance', seem like the best explanations to me but I can't honestly mark it 'Explained' because there doesn't seem to be any sort of consensus yet. However, I'll check back later. </p>
<p>EDIT 2: Imma call this one explained. I think between you, you've given enough valid explanations to put a bow on this puppy. Well done, go Team Reddit! </p>
<p>To the people asking &quot;who puts three spoonfuls of sugar in coffee?&quot;-that's kind of the point. Three spoonfuls makes coffee undrinkably sweet (for myself and the majority of people at least), but not Coke. To the guy (apparently) calling me a conspiracy nut for asking a question about why Drink 1 is too sweet despite containing less sugar than Drink 2, all I have to say is &quot;What?&quot; (though, of course, we cannot rule out Illuminati involvement).</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So much fail in this thread. Coca-cola is quite acidic. Sweet and Sour balance each other on your taste buds. If something is too sour, you can add a bit of sugar to take the edge off. If something is too sweet, add some acid to liven it up. The taste profile of Coca-cola is sweet &amp; sour. You need the extra sugar to balance out the sour. Your coffee doesn't have any sour in it, so the sweetness is direct.</p>
<p>Edit: The posts about carbonated water are half correct. The carbon dioxide precipitating on your tongue will also lead to your sense of taste being subdued. In order to keep the beverage's flavor profile and potency, increased seasoning (sweet &amp; sour) is needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Seriously people are dumb.</p>
<p>Simple answer: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Carbonated water is acidic and sour tasting. To balance that out you need more sugar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Temperature matters. Sugar is going to taste stronger in hot water then in cold water.</p>
</li>
<li>Caffeine when cold tastes pretty bad as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine those three together and you get your answer. </p>
<p>Side note: </p>
<p>Now if you want to talk about could they have used less? Well yeah, if they wanted a slightly less sweet product but products aren't always just about achieving 1 outcome. For example why is there so much sugar in milk chocolate? Because it's delicious. Not everyone likes 70 to 90% cocoa chocolate. It's not a fucking conspiracy to addict you. Yes Sugar is addicting, so is Cocoa and you'd wonder why they didn't just make everyone eat 90% chocolate. Companies want to sell more, but it's not really a conspiracy, they make a good tasting product that appeals to a large group of people. Sales come in. Another factor in this simply comes down to if 3 products exist that taste like X, trying to make it less then X or better then X is your new niche market to attack. So if chocolate tastes sweet, maybe some people want it less sweet or more sweet. Target those people.</p>
<p>Basically people try to always find something wrong. Yes sugar is in a lot of foods, because sugar is something you need. We crave it for evolutionary reasons and evolved taste receptors to get it, and brain chemistry to want it. So if they put it in a product fuck them right? People fucking blow me away sometimes.</p>
<p>Sorry for the answer and a rant, but this is getting ridiculous with the answers here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are mistaking the literal measurement of teaspoon with the home utensil. Unless you are using a prepackaged portion, spoonfuls from the sugar jar at home are almost always significantly more than the standardised measurement for a teaspoon which is roughly 5 grams.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola contains 10.6 grams of sugar per 100mL (literally taken from the information on the can). </p>
<p>A commercially available brand of Iced Coffee contains 9.5 grams of sugar per 100mL.</p>
<p>So 3 teaspoons of sugar in 200mL of tea is actually 7.5 grams per 100mL which isn't very far behind a can of Coca-Cola at all. </p>
<p>If we are talking 3 <em>actual</em> teaspoons heaped from the sugar jar, then you are likely adding <em>more</em> sugar than your average can of Coca-Cola.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
