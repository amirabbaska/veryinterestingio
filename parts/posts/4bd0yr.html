<p>During the Cold War the West German-Czechoslovakian border was divided by 3 electrical fences.  Now that the fences are down, researchers following German and Czech deer found that the German deer stay on the German side of the border and the Czech deer stay on the Czech side of the border.</p>
<p>Only 2 male deer have crossed and 1 male German deer visits the Czech Republic once a year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about animals but I read an article a while ago about plants that were dependent on wind to spread their seeds and how the Great Wall actually did prevent these plants from interacting and therefore it created subspecies who were of the same plant, but up to half the genetic make up was different that it's counter part on the other side of the wall.</p>
<p>I'm at work,  but I'll try to get the article and find it when I get home. I can't remember specifics.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Great Wall of China is a fair deal different than people imagine it.  Several of the constituent walls which later joined together to became &quot;The Great Wall&quot; started construction over 2500 years ago, for example, so it's hard to come up with definitions of what's &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; for comparing it's impact, as well as the difficulties associated with gathering good historical data.  Long story short, I don't know of any academic literature that tries to piece together the environmental impact of its construction (comparing before/after).  Here's a paper discussing it as a physical barrier to gene flow, by comparing populations on either side:  <a href="http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v90/n3/full/6800237a.html" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v90/n3/full/6800237a.html</a> </p>
<p>It's easier to address the heart of your question though:  We don't have to look that far for determining the environmental impact of constructing a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, because we already have walls and fences in various locations along the border between the U.S. and Mexico, and people are already looking at the environmental impact of those walls.  <a href="https://law.utexas.edu/humanrights/borderwall/analysis/briefing-The-Environmental-Impacts-of-the-Border-Wall.pdf
">Here's a legal brief that talks about environmental concerns (largely in terms of EPA , though it's a bit dated (from 2008).</a> </p>
<p>If you're interested in looking more at the current US/Mexico border walls and their impact, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico%E2%80%93United_States_barrier#Environmental_impact" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a> on the topic is a good starting point and links to some other concerns not mentioned in the above legal analysis.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Ah, and here's another paper that talks more broadly about walls and their impacts, both human and ecological:  <a href="http://www2.inecc.gob.mx/publicaciones/libros/519/cap4.pdf" target="_blank">http://www2.inecc.gob.mx/publicaciones/libros/519/cap4.pdf</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Raising Tamiami Trail is the key to reconnecting historic sloughs that serve as prime habitat for wading birds and other wildlife</a></p>
<p>In South Florida, Tamiami Trail, the original road from Miami to Tampa, cut off the natural flow of water through the Everglades. <a href="http://www.flgov.com/gov-scott-announces-90-m-commitment-for-tamiami-trail-project-2/" target="_blank">Only now are we raising the road to allow the original flow of water, and animals, to resume.</a></p>
<p>You could also think about how dams on rivers prevent Salmon from swimming upstream to their spawning grounds. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
