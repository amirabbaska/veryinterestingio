		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi reddit! We are developing a multi-sensor robotic vehicle (named Ugo 1st) for humanitarian de-mining in the Eastern Ukraine conflict zone. You can read a bit about it <a href="https://www.fandm.edu/news/latest-news/2018/05/02/ready-to-launch-f-m-helps-develop-land-mine-detection-robot" target="_blank">here</a> and see it in action!</p>
<p>Our system includes an impulse ground penetrating radar array (1Tx+4Rx) for rapid detection and precise localization of buried objects.  Upon detection, the robot automatically halts, and a high-resolution holographic radar is deployed to record images that provide object ID and confident discrimination of mines from clutter (with high probability of detection, and low false alarm rate).  Our system also include DGPS, and two real time, 3-D time-of-flight cameras to aid in navigation, and to provide additional visual detection/discrimination of exposed objects or disturbed earth.  We are following the principles of Industry 4.0, with systems cooperating and communicating wirelessly under remote (often machine) control.  Since we are building using primarily low-cost, commercial off-the-shelf, and 3-D printable parts, we envision not just one Ugo 1st, but a swarm of cyber-physical systems working together to clear vehicle-accessible areas when hostilities cease. Ugo 1st has performed scanning experiments in Firenze, Italy while under control of an operator in Rapperswil, Switzerland, with data processing and image analysis being performed in real time and simultaneously in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and Kharkiv, Ukraine.</p>
<p>We'll be joining you at 3 PM Eastern Time (20 UT), ask us anything!</p>
<p>EDIT: We'd also like to thank our end users and sponsors for helping to support the project</p>

<p>Do you think it will be possible to build a system that could handle mines in very old and overgrown locations, such as in Southeast Asia?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Does your system employ any type of AI or Machine Learning to interpret the data you collect during de-mining operations?  If not, is that something that may be useful in the future?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
