		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read a really good explanation on this sub a while back so I'll take a shot at it (I'm on mobile so please pardon any mistakes). So, you can either walk forwards or backwards. This would represent positive and negative. This is the same for a recording. It can be played forward or in reverse.</p>
<p>-If you play a recording forward of you walking forward, the end result is you walking forward in the video (positive*positive).</p>
<p>-If you play a recording forward of you walking in reverse, the end result would be negative as you are going backwards in the video (negative*positive).</p>
<p>-If you play a recording in reverse of you walking forwards, the end result will be negative as you are going backwards in thw video (positive*negative)</p>
<p>-Finally, you can play a recording in reverse of you walking backwards. The result will be positive, as you are appearing to walk forwards in the video (negative*negative).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Multiplication is just big adding. With that in mind: adding a negative number is just subtracting. Or making it smaller.  </p>
<p>Making less of a negative number is to make it <em>less</em> negative, so that you get closer to zero. Do that a bunch of times (multiply) and you end up in positive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I am giving you 5 dollars a week for 4 week, you get +5 * +4 dollars. Positive 20.</p>
<p>I am loosing money, spending 5 per week. So -5*+4 for negative 20.</p>
<p>But let's look at this from the perspective of next month. </p>
<p>Now, each week back you go, you undo one money transfer. You could say that is negative money, but you could also do negative time.</p>
<p>So a month ago, you had 5 dollars a week times negative 4 weeks, for 20 less that you end up with.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I have negative 5 dollars a week, and negative 4 weeks of that, and end up having started with positive 20.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if ELI5, but complex numbers give us a pretty intuitive explanation. When you multiply something by a negative number, what you're doing is basically rotating 180 degrees around the center of the number line. When you multiply twice by a negative number, you're simply doing two 180 rotations after each other, which gives you 360 degrees, i.e. a full rotation, which will get you back to the same side you started.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
