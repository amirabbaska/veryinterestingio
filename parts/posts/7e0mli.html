		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Proximity to your ear. The volume of air displaced by a large subwoofer is large, but it is many feet / several hundreds of feet away from your ear. If you are too close to something of this size, you will be doing damage to your ears because the volume of sound waves hitting your eardrum is too large.  </p>
<p>Similarly, small earbuds produce a bass sound with a very tiny volume, but that earbud is mere millimeters away from your eardrum. Change that even to a few centimeters and the bass sound waves diffuse too quickly for them to affect your eardrum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually easier for an earphone to produce bass than for a loudspeaker to. The reason is that the volume of a speaker drops off by the square of it's distance. In short, this means moving twice as far, results in 1/4 of the sound reaching you. While bass frequencies travel farther through the air than treble does, it requires much more power to produce them due to the physical excursion required from a driver. </p>
<p>The only way to produce powerful bass in a loud speaker is by moving air. This could be a very large speaker that moves just a little bit, or a smaller speaker that moves in and out very far. Either way it takes a LOT of power to do this and in order for the user to hear it, the speakers enclosure, and placement in the room is critical. </p>
<p>However on a headphone, the speaker is very close to the ear, sometimes even inside of the ear canal. And since it is possible to form a sealed enclosure with the speaker on one end, and the ear drum on the other, powerful bass can be produced with very little excursion (very little air needing to move) and with very low power requirements. </p>
<p>Larger, over the ear, headphones often have driver sizes of 50mm or more, which is a lot of surface area moving very close to the ear canal, and powerful bass can be produced. </p>
<p>The other thing to consider is the tonal balance of the headphone speaker between bass and treble. If you had a perfectly balanced frequency response, and changed the speakers enclosure slightly to reduce the level of treble frequencies, the perception of the user is that the bass frequencies were made louder. They would simply increase the volume control to compensate, resulting in louder bass. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plus all speakers other than monitors or studio headphones have a what you think of as a built in equalizer that boosts specific areas, usually where they are deficient which is why you don't use them for producing. So with an earbud, they boost the bass up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
