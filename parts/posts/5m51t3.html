		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets do some math, per the wiki there <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_trojan" target="_blank">are 1 million</a> that are over 1km in size. They orbit at 5.2 ± 0.15 AU, there are two swarms that are 26° long, and they have orbital inclinations of up to 40° with a width of 0.6AU.</p>
<p>Anyways, those numbers don't agree too tightly to me (orbits should match swarm size, but they don't seem too close, I think the 40 degree number is an extreme and the orbital radius is a small number. So assume each swarm is a cylinder, 26 degrees long (2.4 AU), and 0.3 AU in radius (half the width). That makes each swarm 0.68 AU^3 in volume, and the density of asteroids is 1 million/1.4 AU^3 or 714 thousand asteroids per AU^3.</p>
<p>To get an average distance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_inter-particle_distance" target="_blank">using this</a> I get 0.874*(3/(4*pi*714000))^(1/3) = 0.006 AU  (someone double check me). Anyways, that works out to just under 900,000km between asteroids which sounds right to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
