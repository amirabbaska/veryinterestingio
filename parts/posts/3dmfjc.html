		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because things <em>aren't</em> that clear cut.</p>
<p>Murder is a very specific charge (it requires killing that is premeditated, malicious and wilful). Even if you see someone kill another person, that doesn't mean that person is automatically guilty of murder. Could just end up as manslaughter. Or not guilty by reason of self defence. Or not guilty by reason of insanity. To prove whether it is one over the other, evidence needs to be gathered, witnesses need to be interviewed, psych profiles need to be made, examined, possibly redone. All of that takes a long time. And seeing as the US has double jeopardy laws - as in, you cannot be tried twice for the same crime - it is of the utmost important that this whole process is done carefully and that every little detail and fragment is looked at. Because if the prosecution fails and the guy walks away from this, they can never charge him for it ever again. Even if he admits to it later or other evidence comes out to prove it was him. Criminals have gone free in the past due to the prosecution bungling and rushing into a case with not enough or proper evidence. You really don't want to do that with a guy who is suspect of killing multiple people.</p>
<p>Add in a good dash of how backed up the court system is, the time it takes to find a good jury in cases like this (a jury should be unbiased, but that is hard to find when cases like this have been so hugely reported on in the news) and it should be clear why this all took so long. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, he attempted suicide several times while in custody and his lawyers delayed the trial by pleading diminished capacity. That took a 4-5 months to sort out before the entered the not guilty plea. There was a ton of documentation to review and the judge was concerned about things moving too quickly at the start because it could *lead to issues during the appeal process. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The debate was not over whether he killed the people in the theater. The debate was over whether he was legally insane when he did so.  </p>
<p>Three years ago, Holmes' lawyers offered a plea deal where he would spend the rest of his life in a mental institution, which is where he would end up if he were declared legally insane The State rejected this deal because they wanted Holmes to be put to death. In other words, the State spend $5 million to ensure that a man, who would never see the light of day in any case, is killed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: he waived a lot of his rights</p>
<p>Long answer: 99% of the time, it won't take 3 years to get to trial unless you want it to. You have the right to a speedy trial, this varies by state a lot but in all states it is a matter of months.</p>
<p>Now on to the waiving or rights. The justice system is clogged as heck. Blame it on drugs, blame it on Nixon, blame it on the Cookie Monster, the fact is we have a lot more cases than we have time. If you want to say &quot;I Waive my right to a speedy trial&quot; most of the time we will accommodate. People do this for a lot of reasons, more time to prepare, more chance of evidence discovery, witnesses forget over time, or just because it is your right to waive a right. </p>
<p>The fact is if James Holmes wanted a speedy trial it would have been done in 2012. He (or his defense team) waived the speedy trial right and decided to drag it out.</p>
<p>Edit: there is also no &quot;clear cut&quot; case, in law you have to prove the evil act (the person arrested for th crime did it) and the evil mind (the person knew what they were doing was wrong) </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>just because they arrest a guy with a gun outside the theater doesn't make him the shooter, they could have arrested a homeless guy by mistake. (Think the 1996 Atlanta mistake of ruining that innocent guys life) </p>
</li>
<li>maybe he didn't know what he was doing was wrong. There was a California case of a homeless woman who was arrested for breaking a bunch of windshields of cop cars. Her reason? If she didn't break the windshield than she couldn't get the cops attention and they wouldn't see the aliens coming down from the sky trying to eat our brains and bring in war of the worlds. She didn't know breaking those windows was wrong, so she isn't guilty, she isn't sane </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>His crime was pretty horrific and nationalized. </p>
<p>It is strategic for a defense to ask for postponement of a trial to cool emotions to select a non- biased jury. </p>
<p>Juries are fickle beasts. How a defendant looks influences decisions on guilt and innocence. </p>
<p>Look at the Oscar Grant case (east bay, ca BART shooting). Law states that the trial happens in the area the crime was committed. The cop petitioned for a change of venue to obtain a fair trial and got it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
