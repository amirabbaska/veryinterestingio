		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2n8p6a/why_cant_our_bodies_heal_certain_injuries_nerve/cmbv7uy/" target="_blank">This comment</a> does a really good job of explaining it, but it's suuuuper long, so I'll let you go there to read it. Here's the gist, though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now here is the interesting one: Nerval tissue. Do nerves regenerate? Yeah, kind of! ... but not everywhere. See, there are two compartments to the nervous system: the central nervous system (all parts of the nervous system that are embedded in bone cavities, i.e. the skull and the vertebral column) and the periphery nervous system (all nerves that exit the central nervous system, i.e. all the nerves in the limbs, the torso and the head outside of the skull). Most nerves are embedded in a substance called myelin - basically like cable insulation, increases the conduction speed. That is not all they can do though: the cells that build the myelin - called glia cells - also nurture and maintain the actual nerve fibers. The periphery and the central nervous system has different kinds of glia cells. Central has a variation like oligodendrocytes and others, periphery has schwann cells. schwann cells are capable of repairing lesions in nerval tissue and grow periphery nerves back together, given that they are still in the same place of course. Central nerves and their glia cells... well, simply put they just dont. Have a damage in your spinal cord or your brain? Tough luck, those glia cells just cant. Additionally there are usually no real inflammatory processes in the brain that could kickstart a healing process (and inflammation in the brain is... well, pretty much lethal, so nature kind of had to do it like that). There ARE small stem cell populations in the brain that supposedly can regenerate damaged nerves, but they dont seem to do a significant enough job because spinal cord damage and strokes are pretty much permanent. - u/GrafKarpador</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, to those saying it's impossible, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sandrine_thuret_you_can_grow_new_brain_cells_here_s_how/transcript?language=en" target="_blank">you absolutely can and do regenerate neurons!</a></p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://askabiologist.asu.edu/regeneration" target="_blank">Here's</a> another fun little explanation on how neuron regeneration works, specifically in regards to reacquiring the ability to see, breathe, etc. We're not quite there yet, but it's definitely within the realm of possibility thanks to stem cell research!</p>
<p>Edit: Even without stem cells, you can regenerate neurons, but as a lot of commenters have pointed out, the healing if often clunky and inefficient, so while it is possible, our neurons just can't reproduce quite enough to cure any conditions like OP mentioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As for our vision, poor eyesight can be due to the cornea being misshaped, lens being misshaped, or because the length of the eye is either too short (causing you to be farsighted, or hyperopic) or too long (causing you to be nearsighted, or myopic). It could also be due to a combination of these three, among other things!</p>
<p>All of these primarily cause rays coming from the outside to not hit the back of your eye very precisely, which is where you have cells called photoreceptors (rods and cones). This is why we wear glasses and contacts, which alter these rays so they hit these cells accurately and precisely. These cells can, and are, regenerated and replaced regularly. </p>
<p>However, the neurons that send the signals from these photoreceptors to the brain are not replaced, which is why ocular diseases such as glaucoma, which damage the neurons, cannot be cured. </p>
<p>Other ocular diseases can impact any part of the entire visual process, however, those that affect the neurons usually end up in blindness if not properly treated (or slowed).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neurons (nerve cells) are not generally replaced. Some parts of the brain like the hippocampus (involved in learning, memory, spatial ability) gets new neurons, but peripheral sensory nerves (photoreceptors in the eyes and neurons in the optic nerve) are never replaced if damaged.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Understanding the cell cycle can help to explain this. The cell cycle consists of mitosis and interphase. Interphase is further divided into growth phase 1 (G1), DNA synthesis/replication (S), and growth phase 2 (G2). The transitioning between the different phases is regulated by different proteins called cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) and tumor suppressor genes like p53 and RB. Furthermore there is an additional phase called G0, this is the phase that permanent cells reside in, this includes neurons, skeletal and cardiac muscles, and red blood cells. Permanent cells do not replicate, they don't go into mitosis, and they must be regenerated by differentiation of stem cells. The next type of cell is stable or &quot;quiescent,&quot; this type of cell normally resides in G0 but under certain circumstances they can be stimulated to enter G1 and then to further progress through the cell cycle and into mitosis in order to replicate. Examples of stable cells would be the cells that make up your liver and white blood cells. The third cell type is know as labile, these cells never enter G0, they divide rapidly and have a short G1 phase and continue through the cell cycle. Examples of labile cells include bone marrow, the cells lining your gut, hair follicles, and germ cells. </p>
<p>The reason that we have regulations and checkpoints is to prevent cells from growing uncontrollably. For example if a cell notices that it's DNA is damaged it will trigger apoptosis or programmed cell death. This is what happens when we get a sunburn. UV rays damage the DNA and so to prevent from mutations in the genome (skin cancer) from spreading, the cells sacrifice themselves (pealing sunburned skin). Another point worth mentioning is that labile cells are most at risk for becoming cancerous. Mutations in these cells can lead to colon cancer, cervical cancer, or skin cancer. Mutations in the regulatory genes can also cause cancer's. For example p53 is mutated in most human cancers, p53 blocks G1 to S phase, another example is Rb mutation causing retinoblastoma it also is involved in regulating G1 to S phase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
