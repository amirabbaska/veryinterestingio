		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I watched a documentary of a post-mortem of an obese person. In this, the pathologist lifts the heart and she says the heart is loose and floppy &quot;like a paper bag&quot; due to the heart working hard to pump blood through the body.</p>
<p>When someone does frequent cardio, their resting heart rate drops because the heart has become strong. </p>
<p>What makes the difference in the heart working hard from cardio and working hard from generally being obese? I know blood pressures would be significantly different, but how does this cause the heart to go from a tight, muscular pump to floppy and bag-like?</p>
<p>Link to some information about the post-mortem and the heart. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During cardio the heart increases its workload and all the body's other systems adjust to help support that endeavor.  The blood vessels dilate, the muscles do their best to help the blood along, hormone levels change, some non-critical processes stop or slow down to redirect blood flow to main channels.</p>
<p>It's all hands on deck to keep the heart cruising powerfully and efficiently.  Over time, those support processes will get even better at their job and further decrease the load on the heart.</p>
<p>When the heart is just resting at an elevated rate due to obesity none of that support structure is active.  Instead of a wide open pipe with pumping stations along the way, the heart is now trying to force blood through hundreds of miles of constricted tubing all by itself.  Over time that excessive workload damages the heart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;paper-bag heart&quot; is a result of volume overload. So if there's too much blood in the heart, it stretches, similar to how a balloon would stretch if you filled it up with water. As it stretches, the walls get thinner, hence the paper bag comparison.
A common cause of this is long-standings high blood pressure. The heart has to push against the pressure in your blood vessels to pump blood around, but if this pressure is high all the time, the heart has to work harder to do so and often there's more blood than there should be left in the heart after each beat. The excess blood leftover starts to build up and eventually causes the walls of the heart to stretch.</p>
<p>Now when you exercise, your muscle need more oxygen, which is transported in your blood. It's thought that maybe your body gets your heart to beat faster/harder preemptively when you're going to exercise, but I don't think they have anything concrete about this yet. Anyway, when you use oxygen in the blood during exercise more of it goes back to the heart. There's a mechanism in the heart that makes it pump harder/faster in response to more blood coming back into it, so obviously your heart now does so. This action is similar to working your muscles during a session at the gym and it strengthens the muscle of your heart. Just to clarify that last bit, your heart can't actually get NEW muscle cells, to it strengthens by making the ones it already has bigger - in response to regular, intense exercise/physical activity. </p>
<p>Hopefully that makes sense?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heart you saw was a 'failing heart'</p>
<p>Heart muscle stretch is like elastic. If you stretch it more, it will recoil more. However - stretch it too far and it snaps (or in the heart's case, becomes baggy).</p>
<p>Obesity will cause a persistently higher pressure in the blood's circulation. The heart needs to pump harder to get the same volume of blood into the vessels. This initially leads to the heart getting stronger to compensate. But over time, the resistance gets too high for too long and your heart's chambers stretch beyond the maximum.  The heart has passed it's maximum stretching point and 'de-compensates'.</p>
<p>On the other hand, exercise causes heart muscle to become more efficient and grow healthily. Cardio also improves your entire body's metabolic efficiency, meaning the heart doesn't need to pump as much blood to meet the body's requirements. </p>
<p>So exercise can cause the heart to become bigger (like a failing heart), but the increase in size is from growing muscle units and building the muscle, rather than stretching it out. As a result, exercise will improve efficiency of the pump by challenging it intermittently. Meanwhile, obesity will slowly increase the heart's workload in a persistent manner until it reaches breaking point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>when you do cardio, you give your heart a workout, and that workout is followed by a long period of rest.  During the rest your body heals and becomes strong and better able to deal with intensive activity in the future.</p>
<p>When your heart is working harder because you are obese or unhealthy, it is working harder all the time.  I it doesn't get a break to recover.</p>
<p>You don't get stronger during a workout, you get stronger during the rest after a workout.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll answer one specific part and let the exercise people give you an explanation for the rest. </p>
<p>For the state of the heart, when you are obese, you are probably hypertensive. When you blood pressure is too high for years, you'll have one of two processes going on in your left ventricle (which pumps the blood through most of the body) and which one takes place is determined by a variety of factors.</p>
<p>Concentric hypertrophy is when the muscle thickens and the amount of fluid the ventricle can contain at once is reduced because the walls are thickening inward. This is very bad in its own way.</p>
<p>The other which is the case here, is eccentric hypertrophy. The increased pressure inside the ventricle keeps pushing on the walls and the ventricle enlarges and enlarges, like a balloon, getting thinner as it goes. </p>
<p>Both of these lead to heart failure in their own way</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
