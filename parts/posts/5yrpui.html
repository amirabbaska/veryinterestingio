<p>I'm wondering if the ants are &quot;piggybacking&quot; off the scent markers from the now-dead colony. They appear to have a different origin, but after encountering where the old ant trail was, they seem to follow it exactly. Occasionally another species of ant shows up, too, but they appear to not use the same trails.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm only a uni student, but I'm fascinated by ants, so I think I can give you some insight here. </p>
<p>I don't think they're piggy backing off the old pheramone trails markers because those markers are pretty volatile. The way the system works is that each ant lays a trail and subsequent ants follow the freshest/strongest one, but make some slight deviations. If their deviation is faster, subsequent ants will follow that one, so they wind up with the fastest route eventually. If these pheromones weren't volatile, it wouldn't work.</p>
<p>I think it's simply a matter of independently finding that particular entry point into your home is the fastest one.</p>
<p>As for whether they would follow another ant's trails, I doubt it. Ants as a general rule seem to use both the shared, functional pheromone + a unique, colony identifying one in anything they excrete and as a general rule, ants tend to avoid those markers. While ants are territorial, they generally don't go looking for trouble (though there are some exceptions as u/lionhart280 points out below). It's a special event when an ant colony gets together for an aggressive raid,  at least in most species.</p>
<p>However, if they are Argentine ants or members of another super colony forming species, their cuticle hydrocarbons (chemicals in the ant's &quot;skin&quot; that act like a form of ID card) are so similar, that ants can wander into another colony's nest and it's recognised as a nest mate, which has lead to high levels of co-operation between those colonies. If they are super colonists, then it's quite possible they'd follow a trail laid by another, but again, the substances are volatile and have to be for them to function.</p>
<p>Time scale, species and the location of the ingress and location of the nest from the ingress points would help us answer this question better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am doing a PhD in evol. bio and a number of colleagues in my department are working on ant footprints and cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC's, anti-dessication, communication and identification molecules ants carry on their cuticle).</p>
<p>Ants can tell apart different species by their footprints. They will avoid certain species but follow prints of others, partially depending on dominance (e.i hierarchy, slavery, etc) between the species. They can also use the CHC's to tell apart colony members from foreign ants.</p>
<p>The footprints are not the same as the cuticular hydrocarbons, but will always contain them to some degree. Colony specificity has been shown in several species as far as I know. I am at home and too lazy to remote login to uni to look for papers from my dpt, but google scholar provides at least 1 example:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As /u/prick_pomposity suggests, the colony may be far larger than you think, and you're just killing off a small offshoot of it.</p>
<p>I specialize on chemical ecology of beetles, but I've done some basic research into ants and might be able to contribute a bit. Each ant colony generally has a unique pheromone, often present as a cuticular hydrocarbon &quot;fingerprint&quot; (chemicals stuck to the body of each individual ant which have distinctive odors), but ants produce different types of pheromone for different purposes.</p>
<p>Trail pheromones are different from the cuticular hydrocarbon fingerprint. It seems that there is no hard and fast rule about whether trail pheromones are specific to colonies or even species. In fire ants it looks like it's usually not colony specific, but rather species specific or even shared between species ( <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022191076902535" target="_blank">source</a> ). You'll also find interesting vids of ants respond both positively and negatively to synthetic odors, like ink from a pen, which suggests they may have fairly broad responses.</p>
<p>That suggests that two different colonies of the same ant species may respond positively to a trail left by either. However, if they encounter each other on the trail, their cuticular hydrocarbons will differ, and they are likely to attack each other.</p>
<p>Also, there are slave making ants, in which the queen goes out on a raid with an army and attacks another colony. If successful the raiding queen actually eats the colony's old queen, and begins producing pheromones that match the old queen. This lets her control the colony - effectively masquerading as the old queen.</p>
<p>tl;dr: it's insanely complicated and no generalizations can be made. But it's very possible that the trail pheromones produced by your ant species are not colony-specific, so any individual ants of that species will follow the trail regardless of source colony.</p>
<p>Good luck on your war against the ants. As much as they are an annoyance they sure are fascinating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ants usually have thousands of eggs laid, so even if you kill the queen, there will continue to be waves of worker ants that come. I just went through this in my home. First, there were so many ants, then i started poisoning them and they went away. They came back though, but this time there were a lot of soldier ants, unusual. I kept poisoning them and eventually they went away. Now, once a week or so I get a minute wave of tiny worker ants returning to eat the poison I have laid out for them.</p>
<p>I've been studying a lot about ants in the meantime. The super organism is awesome! I've learned that ants often compete for space and resources with neighboring colonies. Often, the demise of one colony means the growth of it's neighbors. So you may very well be dealing with new ants following the trails of the old ants. Just keep poisoning them.</p>
<p>I use a cheap homemade poison of corn syrup and borax. Works great.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Pheromone production is generally species specific. If the ants <em>are</em> the same species, they should be using the same chemical signals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
