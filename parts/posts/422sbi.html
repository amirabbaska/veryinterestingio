		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Semi-auto sniper rifles in US service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various DMRs based on the M14 (M39/M21/Mk14/M25)</li>
<li>The M110</li>
<li>The SR-25</li>
<li>The Barret M82</li>
</ul>
<p>So, they're not exactly unheard of in US service.  </p>
<p>Hell, Carlos Hathcock shot a Vietcong guerrilla at a range of 2500 yards using a M2 machine gun with a telescopic sight mounted on it. That was a record that stood for over 30 years and <strong>he wasn't even using a specially made sniper rifle</strong>.  This alone should debunk the idea that there's any kind of inherent limitation to semi-auto rifles that makes them not suitable for long range work.</p>
<p>As far as why bolt actions haven't been completely replaced by semi-autos in the sniper role:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>They work okay.</strong>  The disadvantages in volume of fire aren't really that big a deal on a rifle that's set up for long range shooting.  Armys tend to be fairly conservative when it comes to small arms, so &quot;if it ain't broke don't fix it.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>There are a lot more &quot;off the self&quot; bolt actions set up to fire really big rounds</strong>. Rounds like .300 winchester magnum and .338 Lapua were developed from big game hunting cartridges. AFAIK there weren't any semi-auto big game rifles, but there were tons and tons of bolt actions that could be readily adapted into sniper rifles. Why reinvent the wheel?</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Cost.</strong>  Getting equivalent accuracy from a semi-auto design costs more money.  Despite its reputation the military is weirdly tight fisted about spending money on small arms.</li>
</ol>
<p>I realize I'm kind of swimming against the tide here, but there are the facts as I see them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scout sniper here.  Regarding prevalence of bolt action rifles:  fewer moving parts, tighter chamber tolerances, and recoil management.</p>
<p>Fewer moving parts = fewer malfunctions (extremely reliable)</p>
<p>Tighter chamber tolerances = less energy wasted from gas release (among many others)</p>
<p>Recoil tends to be more predictable and easier to manage because the bolt is not automatically cycling through the order of operation after a trigger pull.</p>
<p>Free floating match grade barrels, custom stocks, custom optics calibrated specifically to the rifle, etc. are other perks.</p>
<p>Yes, I have employed the M110 Semi Automatic Sniper System extensively, so please don't tell me about the greatness of semiautomatic sniper rifles.  I prefer bolt action rifles for the sniper role, but the semiautos are excellent in most situations (and often more appropriate ie urban).</p>
<p>Edit:  the &quot;less energy wasted from gas release&quot; portion results in increased muzzle velocity, due to more gas expanding within the barrel itself and pushing the bullet out with more energy.  Most semi auto rifles are gas operated, indicative of gas not exclusively being used to propel the projectile but to cycle the bolt.</p>
<p>One last thing:  this is not always true, but many bolt action rifles have a longer barrel length than their semi auto counterparts.  Longer barrel length allows more gas to stay behind the projectile longer and yields higher muzzle velocities than shorter barrels.  This is why suppressed rifles have higher muzzle velocity than unsuppressed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is totally going to be lost in the literal shit ton of bad information going around right now.</p>
<p>The simple answer is that it's what the sniper community demands. The self-image of a sniper is working in 2 man teams, taking out a target, and quietly slipping away. So per-shot accuracy is prioritized at all costs.</p>
<p>Modern sniping started with the military shooting teams. Carlos Hathcock was a USMC shooter. The rifle he used in Vietnam was the same as the rifle he used to win the Wimbledon trophy. The Army sniper up until the 90's was the M21, which was a national match M14 with a scope on it.</p>
<p>Iraq and Afghanistan changed sniping in two different ways; at least for the Army.</p>
<p>It showed that the concept of 2 men going out alone armed with bolt actions was a dated concept as far as urban warfare is concerned. When your firing position had to be in a city that is occupied by unfriendly civilians, it is almost impossible to stay concealed for long. The battles we were getting involved in required that teams be able to stand and fight to a greater degree, so team size typically got increased to 5 or 6 guys to increase their firepower.</p>
<p>The other thing that Iraq showed is that a bolt action rifle is not the best tool for the job. The added precision of a bolt action cannot make up for the lack of firepower that a semi-automatic can provide.</p>
<p>Afghanistan on the other hand showed the other extreme. Mountain top to mountain top shots across basically devoid terrain. The top 3 longest record sniper shots have been in Afghanistan. One from an Australian team, one from a Brit, and another from a Canadian. In Afghanistan, the 7.62 NATO M24 proved lacking the range required for many of these engagements.</p>
<p>As a result of experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan , the Army adopted a 2 rifle solution. A semi-auto general purpose sniper rifle in the M110, and a 300 Winchester Magnum M2010 that pushes their effective range out by about 400 yards. The effects are two-fold; a M110 equipped spotter can comfortably handle targets out to 800 yards, and what used to be considered a difficult long range shot with the M24 is more routine with the more powerful M2010.</p>
<p>The bolt action still has a niche to fill in large caliber magnums for the militaries of the world. They are proven to be accurate and reliable, which is important for extended long range engagements. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a sniper, but I'm in a scout sniper platoon in the military. First of all most &quot;sniper rifles&quot; are not bolt action. Bolt actions are definitely only used as &quot;sniper&quot; rifles, however. The US army fields 3 primary weapons for its scout sniper platoons, right now, for long range precision fire. The m110, m107, and the m24. Two of those are semiautomatic. The m107 is  50 caliber, and is used primarily for targets like vehicles. It can also be used for long range fire but it is not the most accurate. The m110 comes standard with a suppressor mounted, and it is excellent for any mid range firefight. It is also a decent precision fire weapon under 700 meters. A lot of snipers shots are not going to be at super long range unless the terrain makes those kind of shots necessary. In heavily vegetated areas 300 meters is actually a pretty ideal range to engage a target. Bolt action rifles are utilized when absolute precision is key. A bolt action weapon is a lot more accurate at range, and is the preferable weapon for what you are thinking of as a &quot;snipers&quot; job. You can absolutely use a semi automatic as a &quot;sniper&quot; rifle, and we often do in the military. It just depends on what you have, and what you need for each situation. A sniper rifle is more of a designation meaning it can be used to deliver long range precision fire. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
