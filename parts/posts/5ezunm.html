		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Definitely the latter . A 15 year old human is an adolescent. Cancer in adolescents (14-19) is pretty rare , accounting for less than 1% of all cancers. They also tend to be different types of cancer than what children or adults get. This would be more equivalent to a 1-2 year old dog. A 15 year old dog is beyond geriatric. That's beyond the normal lifespan of many breeds. A better example might be comparing to a middle aged or older dog (10-12) in many breeds. Their rates of cancer are going to be higher, comparable to people above 65. . Age is a big risk factor for cancer; certain cancer types in particular are linked to aging. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An interesting observation is that the number of cells in an organism does not necessarily correlate with the risk of developing cancer. This is referred to as Peto's Paradox (wiki link if you'd like it: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peto's_paradox" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peto's_paradox</a> )</p>
<p>The longstanding theory of the development of cancer is that as you age, your cells acquire mutations that give them a survival advantage, allowing them to proliferate faster and acquire even more mutations, eventually leading to cancer. </p>
<p>However, mutation is a stochastic process in replicating cells, and by the time you are 18, every single base pair in your entire genome has at one point been mutated. Now, the vast majority of these mutations are deleterious and are selected against, some are neutral, but you would expect that the so-called 'cancer mutations' like c-Myc or NRas/KRas or p53 would pop up and provide cells with a survival advantage. But that doesn't happen, as adolescent cancer is extremely rare. </p>
<p>This brings up 2 concepts: Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP), and microenvironment fitness. </p>
<p>CHIP refers to cells that harbor these classic cancer mutations but aren't actively proliferating. Which at first seems to make no sense, because if these cells have the mutations that boost replication, why aren't they constantly dividing? The microenvironment idea may hold a plausible answer. Think of a young person's healthy body and an elderly person's frail body - the younger person likely has healthier tissues and a stronger immune system than the elderly person and will be better at suppressing the growth of these pre-cancerous cells. </p>
<p>Similarly, a lifelong smoker, in addition to causing additional DNA mutations due to tobacco smoke, has broken down their tissue microenvironment and has provided a scenario in which not only is the suppression of cancer cells reduced, but those pre-cancerous mutations now are in an environment in which positive selection may begin to act on them. </p>
<p>These are new concepts that are actively being tested, and if you would like to read more I encourage you to read about CHIP from Dan Link's lab at Wash U in St Louis, and the concept of Peto's Paradox and the pre-cancerous microenvironment from James DeGregori's lab at the University of Colorado </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taking human as a reference, you'd expect smaller animals, that have less cells and live shorter, not to get cancer. But they doâ€”this is Peto's paradox as /u/Shooterdog mentionned.</p>
<p>The general idea regarding why, is that since dogs only live ~15 years, natural selection does not promote mechanisms to suppress cancer for 50+ years. DNA repair systems in dogs keep things together for 10 years and that's all what's needed. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_ageing" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_ageing</a> for more.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright... Essentially cancer is the cells in your body skipping the 4th cell stage. The one in which they should die off and be replaced by new cells. The answers below are inaccurate. Age has nothing to do with cancerous cells. As all of us have seen in life, we have no idea when we will die from cancer, and many patients aren't detected until later stages. A perfect example would be Egyptian Sarcophagus. None of which were killed by cancer. Which we have over 2,000 of. So in modern rates... at least 200 Egyptians should have passed from cancer. So thus, something in our environment must be causing the cells to turn cancerous. Same applies to canines. Considering they are our closest evolutionary relative. We have no ability to prevent the DNA or cancerous cells from replicating. Radiation/Chemotherapy are treatments... not cures. WE SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW! Age is meaningless you could be 5 years old or 105 years old. When the cells skip the stage your done. End of discussion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
