I'll have a crack at it (am psychologist).
One common trait in people who struggle with mood is negative affectivity (NA), seems this can be an inherent trait in people and they are more likely to experience negative emotions /be impacted by events more than others.
Subtle neurophysiological variations in your central nervous system can also mean you have errors in processing social information meaning you might be more likely to interpret things negatively - be more fearful or believe the worst.
Environmental factors IMO play the major role. Adverse childhood experiences (ACES) generally cause some type of stress in a child and impact their ability to regulate their emotions. Meaning they will be hypervigilant or vulnerable to stress, meaning more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, or engage in avoidant coping styles which lead us to feel helpless and depressed. Issues with parents (parents too overprotective or we have had messed up relationships with them) impact ego strength which refers to our confidence in our abilities to make it in the real world as adults and care for ourselves.
Many people fluctuate between depression and anxiety but it is often an issue of being able to regulate their emotions so they are stable. I know I tend to be an anxious person (parents divorced and I just want to be liked) but can generally regulate myself with exercise and self care. Sometimes if I am pushing myself too much /overextending myself I can get depressed but again can regulate that with sleep /hugs. This is referring to mild mental health issues though not serious clinical conditions. </p>
<p>Tldr; anxiety and depression are issues in emotional regulation and those with adverse childhood experiences, tricky parents and genetic vulnerabilities are most at risk. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A psychiatrist put it like this to me: if you get anxious often (panic attacks), after a while you start to anticipate the next one and it makes you more anxious.</p>
<p>Now your anxious all the time.  And when your anxious all the time you start wondering why you can't cope or succeed and you start to feel depressed.</p>
<p>Now your anxious and depressed and start to wonder what's the whole point and start feeling suicidal.</p>
<p>Then you hopefully meet a really good psychiatrist &amp; therapist before it goes any further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Research has shown that it's common for anxiety sufferers to develop depression, while it's much less common for depression sufferers to develop anxiety.</p>
<p>To understand why, it can be useful to consider the differences between the two conditions. Anxiety makes you spend energy preventing something from happening. Depression makes you think it's not worth the effort.</p>
<p>So you can think of anxiety as this state where you still have hope. You think you can deal with unwanted situations. You just have to add a little more steam. Depression appears when you lose hope. Why spend energy when it won't change anything for the better?</p>
<p>I also feel like the role of the environment is overlooked when discussing mood disorders. Organisms are constantly receiving feedback from their environment. They have evolved to change their behavioral strategies based on this feedback. The structures of our brains associated with mood disorders are processing environmental feedback. But we keep looking at the areas and neglecting the big picture.</p>
<p>Take the lateral habenula, for instance. This is an area of the brain that is activated by disappointment, i.e when you get less/worse than expected from an action. In depression, the lateral habenula is hyperactive.</p>
<p>The habenula is really old. Lampreys have habenulae. It probably evolved as a way of conserving energy by not wasting it on things that don't work. Now that we have neocortices, the habenula takes into account our <em>subjective</em> appraisal of success/failure.</p>
<p>And our neocortices are also involved in anxiety. We can &quot;look into the future&quot;. We can find threats that aren't present. We can worry about something that hasn't ever happened to us. And we will work hard to prevent it. And we will feel like we're failing. And, for some of us, we will come to expect failure. And stop trying.</p>
<p>We have become our own source for environmental feedback. We give ourselves status updates that, to the lamprey-old parts of our brains, spell disaster. How wicked mustn't this environment be, that nothing seems to be working?</p>
<p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy, which is the best treatment for anxiety and depression, in principle consists of challenging your beliefs. Your neocortex is your model of the world. How it works. But it might be wrong. It might be very wrong. A skilled therapist can help you see that your expectations are based on a flawed model. Your interpretation of a situation is based on your model. But try finding an alternative, more rational explanation. And you most likely will.</p>
<p>It's about updating your neocortical model. to make it more accurate. People with anxiety and depression usually have false beliefs, and they are so powerful to them that they don't dare challenging them. Maybe you have social anxiety and do everything you can to avoid humiliation? Try standing in an elevator and shout the numbers of the floors as you go up and down. Sure, people will stare at you. But you will see that it's ok. It's not dangerous in the hunter-gatherer sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
