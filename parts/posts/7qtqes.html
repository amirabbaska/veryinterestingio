</blockquote>
<p>No, per definition, they are not inside any event horizon if they can escape.</p>
<p>However, if you imagine the event horizons as spheres, once the two black hole's radii overlap slightly, there will still be a lagrange point in between them and some region where their gravitation cancel out enough that it's, at least in theory, possible to fly between, at least for a photon. BUT because of this effect happening, the event horizon is deformed and no longer spherical, once the true event horizons overlap, there is really no escape.</p>
<p>Here is an illustration of it: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_black_hole" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_black_hole</a></p>
<p>As you can see, as the black holes approach each other, their event horizons are pushed back at first (at 24 seconds in). At this point, at least photons can get between although they pass closer than the usual radius of the black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Just wanted to point out that adding qualifiers like this to the question will lead to a meaningless answer. Pinning them down is impossible. So any assumption that you can will be purely speculation and any answer would be nonsensical, since you've added an impossible qualifiers to the question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
