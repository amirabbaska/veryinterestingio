<p>We are the Ask an Astronomer Team at Cornell University. We are a group of graduate students within the Department of Astronomy that volunteer to answer questions from the public, both online and in various events hosted throughout the city of Ithaca, NY. Our website (<a href="http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/</a>) describes more of what we do and how to contact us. Its been a few years since our last AMA, but we're back to answer your questions about astronomy and the Universe! </p>
<p>Answering questions tonight are 11 graduate students:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cristobal Armaza- My main interests orbit around theoretical astrophysics. Currently, I work on the implementation of a new code to solve the equations of hydrodynamics in astrophysical contexts.</li>
<li>Paul Corlies- I study planetary atmospheres (clouds, hazes, etc), ground based observing, and solar system satellite development/instrumentation</li>
<li>Dylan Cromer- I am interested in cosmology, specifically relating cosmological tests of dark matter and modified gravity theories by examining data from surveys of the cosmic microwave background.  </li>
<li>Andrew Foster - Planetary and Exoplanetary science, with a focus on atmospheres. Specifically, using radiative transfer to probe atmospheric structure and the composition of atmospheres and clouds. Also interested in chemistry and astrobiology.</li>
<li>Avani Gowardhan- I study how supermassive black holes impact the growth and star formation in their host galaxies in the local universe</li>
<li>Matt Hankins- I study massive stars and star formation in the Galactic center using infrared observations from NASA's SOFIA mission (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/SOFIA/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/SOFIA/index.html</a>). </li>
<li>Thea Kozakis- I study the environments of Earth-like planets orbiting newly born and dying stars and their atmospheres.  I mainly work on computer models to determine potential habitibility of planets</li>
<li>Cody Lamarche- I study the interstellar medium in high-redshift galaxies to learn about star formation and supermassive black hole growth at a time when the universe was less than half its current age.</li>
<li>Jack Madden- I study the climate and habitability of exoplanets using computer models.</li>
<li>Ishan Mishra- I am interested in studying planetary science, exoplanets and habitability.</li>
<li>Christopher Rooney- I study the movement of galaxies through the universe, though I'm interested in many different topics in astronomy</li>
<li>Akshay Suresh- I am interested in studying stellar and planetary magnetic fields.             </li>
</ul>
<p>We'll be on from 7-9 PM EDT (23-1 UT). Ask Us Anything!</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks so much for joining us! We're done here but if you still have unanswered questions, feel free to contact the <a href="http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Curious website</a>!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you think commonplace space travel or even colonization will be a thing in your lifetimes? What evidence makes you believe so? Also, would such an advancement simply require more efforts around current knowledge (more time, more funding, etc) or is it dependant on the discovery of entirely new concepts?</p>
<p>I hope those questions make sense. Follow up question, why is bingalee so dingalee?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I ran the observatory at Cornell many years ago.  Went to the engineering department to ask them to reverse thread the eye piece so I could screw in my camera to the telescope.  I took some great pictures of various items and posted them around the astronomy department.  </p>
<p>My question: Is the observatory still there and being used?</p>
<p>Thanks!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
