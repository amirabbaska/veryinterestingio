		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other replies have validity but do not fully answer the question. First, it is true that alcohol acts as a diuretic. It inhibits a molecule called anti-diuretic hormone (Vasopressin) that is responsible for telling your kidneys to hold on to water. As opposed to the other major molecule responsible for this, something called aldosterone, this is acting on water directly and not the electrolytes in your system. As you would guess this is all taking place in the kidneys. Now, when you drink alcohol you are shutting down the effects of anti-diuretic hormone, to an extent, and therefore urinating more water. This is what we would call dilute urine. So as you could imagine it is not losing enough electrolytes, nutrients, and minerals to be the cause of your drunk hunger. </p>
<p>The other part to this answer is more complicated. I will not pretend to understand the biochemistry here, but the theory holds that alcohol actually acts in the brain to stimulate hunger. There have been studies done in mice that many think apply to humans in the same way. Basically, the alcohol, and potentially some of its metabolites (breakdown products), act on the neurons in the brain that are active during starvation. When these brain cells are active it is a signal that you should eat something, which makes sense. As far as I know it is not completely understood why this happens. </p>
<p>TL:DR - You aren't urinating out nutrients, alcohol stimulates the starvation center of the brain</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you eat food you do not use it all at once. Your body takes a little bit of the energy and uses it to keep going but it stores a lot of it elsewhere. Once you use up the little bit of energy floating around you start breaking down your stores. To move these products around you need to turn them back into the bodies favorite energy packages. That way they can be shipped around the bony easily. This process is called Gluconeogenesis. However it takes a lot of steps to make this happen and a lot of workers (secondary cofactors). When we drink alcohol it gets broken down using some of the same workers that gluconeogenesis needs. This means that fewer workers are helping package our energy. This process results in less energy being provided to the body that needs it. This is called hypoglycemia. Now usually this isn't too severe as our bodies fix the problem in time. But while drinking as this happens our brain notices it's not getting the energy it needs. This is because the brain recognizes the low energy levels and tells us we need to add more. More energy is added by eating so we interpret this as being hungry and causing what is commonly called drunchies. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol is actually really 'energy dense', about as dense as fats (about 9 kcal per gram). When your liver processes alcohol, it doesn't  'turn' this energy into ATP (which is what happens normally with foodstuffs such as carbohydrates and fats) but instead, the energy is 'released' as NADH (a high energy molecule). </p>
<p>Now normally NADH is produced alongside ATP and this process is regulated, but production of NADH due to alcohol detoxification is less regulated and so the levels of NADH in your liver cells rise (and levels of NAD+, which is used up in the detoxification to create NADH, lower).</p>
<p>This increased ratio of NADH to NAD+ has several effect, but one of them is the inhibition of a metabolic path called gluconeogenesis. In this path pyruvate is used to create glucose in liver. Since cells need to regenerate NAD+ which was used up in detoxification of alcohol, pyruvate is converted to lactate, 'spending' NADH and givin us NAD+ which the cells need. This then causes the arrest of gluconeogenesis.</p>
<p>The arrest of gluconeogenesis has an important consequence - hypoglycemia. Since many cells depend on glucose as their source of energy and the glucose you get after a meal only lasts for about 4 hours, you depend on gluconeogenesis for the glucose after those 4 hours are up. And since your gluconeogenesis is inhibited, glucose levels in your blood fall.</p>
<p>Hypoglycemia is then sensed by the hypothalamus, which is the 'control center' of your body. It controls, among other things, hunger. Low levels of blood sugar activate hunger centers in hypothalamus and make you hungry.</p>
<p>That's the way we were taught at our med school at least, I hope I didn't make any big mistakes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always believed it was something to do with the effect of alcohol on blood sugar. It will raise it to begin with and then slump hugely. I'm not a scientist though. Also, there must be other, more individual factors involved because not everyone gets the munchies after drinking. I get the opposite effect. I couldn't even think about food after drinking. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m not at all a biologist, but I’ve asked this question of med student friends in the past. The answer I’ve received is that alcohol stimulates a chemical compound called galanin to enter your brain. Galanin is known to both stimulate craving/eating fatty foods and to stimulate further consumption of alcohol. <a href="http://www.because-science.org/blog/2015/3/10/ask-a-scientist-why-do-you-crave-greasy-food-when-you-have-a-hangover" target="_blank">Here</a> is a source that aggregates a number of studies on mice that speak to this phenomenon. It also probably explains it better than I have. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
