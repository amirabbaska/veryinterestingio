<p>Find food source. Avoid fast moving thing on collision course. Breed. </p>
<p>They can't process that there is an entity that doesn't want them to come to a certain spot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A fly's brain has a bag of tricks. One of them is to seek food when hungry. A second one is to avoid being hit. It does not have a trick to remember that food in a single spot might be dangerous. Insects do not reason.</p>
<p>Source: I took a graduate class called &quot;Reverse Engineering the Fly&quot;. Very interesting class.</p>
<p>EDIT: For those interested, you can see a description of the class at <a href="http://www.ece.arizona.edu/ece512" target="_blank">http://www.ece.arizona.edu/ece512</a> . I can't find an online syllabus, but...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always wonder why some flies are more agressive than others. The flies at home are more chill and land on my legs and arms while the flies at work land on my face, ears and also seem to bite sometimes.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It actually can remember food at a certain spot is dangerous. It's called fear conditioning and fruit flies (Drosophila) are extensively researched to understand the mechanisms for that. It involves a wide range of protein synthesis to form long-term plastic changes in the nervous system. </p>
<p>They can learn to associate a stimulus with fear and avoid it.

<p>It might just not perceive your slow human reflexes to be dangerous. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flies, like ants, leave a scent trail with them. It is like a night club: the more people who are there the more people are drawn to it. That is why jar traps work so well. So many flies have climbed in to die other flies think it is a party.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
