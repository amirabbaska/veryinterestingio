		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor, and D.O. here (we kinda love this type of stuff, and are somewhat like massage therapists that wasted more of our lives lol). A knotted muscle is like what these guys are describing, it's just tight when it shouldn't be. The back is a good place to think of an example to conceptualize it, but you also have to understand that EVERYTHING in the body is connected to (and therefore impacts) almost everything else. Think about a muscle in your lower back that starts to contract (when it kinda really shouldn't), no big deal right..? Well sort of yes a big deal! 1st off that means the spine gets pulled to that side, specifically 1 of the vertebrae will be rotated or bent to that side, which puts weird stress/strain on the vertebrae above and below (can cause pain and weird tingling), additionally that muscle also (lets say) attaches to your hip... when it tightens it tries to rotate your hip bone up, now that stretches your hamstring (which doesn't like to be stretched past a certain point) so your hamstring now starts to tighten up and contracts too. Now you have a small (ish) issue with 1 muscle group that has created an issue of pain/tension/bony immobility from your lower back (or higher), through your pelvis, down your thigh, to your knee (or lower). Fortunately for us we have learned that several things can calm those muscles down, #1 being pressure applied to the muscle (or surrounding muscles), somehow our muscles evolved that pressure on/around in gentle and direct focused ways will cause them to relax. Another way almost everyone uses/knows about, stretching! When you stretch a tight muscle it will cause at least SOME of those fibers to relax because they need to relax or they tear (that's why you don't wanna stretch SUPER aggressively if you have a tight muscle, but gentle stretching helps!). Another less well known way is to use an opposing muscle. Going back to our tight hamstring example, if you gently but forcefully use your quadriceps (against resistance is best) it will help your hamstring to relax. Our body is smart enough to know that you shouldn't really use two opposing muscles at the same time (quad/hamstring, tricep/bicep) with the same force, otherwise you wouldn't do anything (this is kinda different for fine motor movements but lets not make this discussion longer than it is :P) sooooo using your quad automatically causes your hamstrings to start to relax, and if you repeat that, it will continue to help it relax. BUT you didn't solve the problem in your back!! So the tight hamstring will come back... this is why (again) everything in the body is connected, and also why some people get the same tight muscles (or the same bones that &quot;pop&quot;) over and over again. Because they treat one of the resulting issues, without treating the main one. Hope this helps!! And hope it wasn't TOO long and boring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To put it in most simple terms, repeated movement of a muscle can cause a knot to form. For example, somebody who is right handed may develop a knot in their right forearm or under their right shoulder blade due to repeated movement by that muscle.</p>
<p>A knot usually contains a very high concentration of lactic acid. When a massage therapist works at a knot, the lactic acid is spread back out into the body and must be flushed out. That is why it is recommended to drink lots of water after a massage; it helps flush the lactic acid from your body.</p>
<p>Knots are possible to feel, so yes, in theory, they do &quot;go somewhere&quot; after a massage. However, it is not the muscle that goes somewhere, but rather the lactic acid.</p>
<p>Somebody who is an actual massage therapist or doctor is definitely in a better position than I am to inform on this, and I may have gotten something wrong. All of the information that I have on the subject is what I've learned from my massage therapist and experience from massaging friends and family.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your muscles are only ever in &quot;flex&quot; mode, tightening up and bringing the anchor points together, or &quot;relaxed&quot;, loosening and allowing connected points to drift/float.  Basically, all your muscles &quot;pull&quot;, they don't &quot;push&quot;.</p>
<p>When you have a really bad knot in some muscle, it's basically never getting to &quot;relax&quot; mode; that particular part of muscle is always pulling it's connected points closer together (though perhaps not as close as if you flexed that muscle, but never reaching a point of being fully relaxed either).  With how a lot of your muscles &amp; movements are interconnected, a knot in your shoulder blade area would only make moving your arm feel tiresome and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It's very similar, with subtle differences, to how a cramp works/feels, just usually described by people as being discomfort in their back/shoulder areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a doctor.</p>
<p>I believe that knotted muscles are muscles that are contracting when they should be constricting.  Think of making a clenched fist.  A massage therapist would be working to relax your fist to extend the fingers out, with the fingers being the muscle itself.</p>
<p>Again, not a doctor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Knotted muscles can be many different things that would probably be tough to distinguish without a biopsy, but generally it refers to unusual or uncomfortable tension in an otherwise relaxed muscle. When they are &quot;worked out&quot;, that just means the tension was relieved. Nothing actually went anywhere.</p>
