<h1>24 Hour Mark</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The consequences of sleep deprivation at 24 hours is comparable to the cognitive impairment of someone with a blood-alcohol content of 0.10 percent, according to a 2010 study in the International Journal of Occupational Medicine and Environmental Health. </p>
</blockquote>
<h1>36 Hours</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Now your health begins to be at risk. High levels of inflammatory markers are in the bloodstream, said Cralle, which can eventually lead to cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure. Additionally, hormones are affected — your emotions can be all over the place.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>48 Hours</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>After two days of no sleep the body begins compensating by shutting down for microsleeps, episodes that last from half a second to half a minute and are usually followed by a period of disorientation. “The person experiencing a microsleep falls asleep regardless of the activity they are engaged in,” she said. Microsleeps are similar to blackouts, and a person experiencing them is not consciously aware that they're occurring. </p>
</blockquote>
<h1>72 Hours</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Expect significant deficits in concentration, motivation, perception, and other higher mental processes after many sleepless hours, Cralle said.
“Even simple conversations can be a chore,” noted Kelley. This is when the mind is ripe for hallucinations. Kelley recalled a time he was on guard duty and repeatedly saw someone standing with a rifle in the woods, ready to sneak into camp. Upon closer inspection, he determined he was actually looking at a branch and shadows.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h1>I started writing about my experience staying up for 90ish hours, but I lost focus on what was important here, which is probably how it FELT... scroll down to the next marker if you don't care about why or how I did it.</h1>
<p>Not really an explanation, but, a first-hand story of someone who HAS stayed up for a stupid amount of time:</p>
<p>When I was 16 years old, I stayed up for 90 hours straight playing a mix of Quake 2 and Baldur's Gate.</p>
<p>I wanted to stay up for 100 hours, straight.</p>
<p>This was 13 years ago so I don't recall everything about it anymore.</p>
<p>I got up at around 2pm (this was during summer vacation) and I was in weird sleep schedule mode already from staying up until 5-6AM playing games online, and then crashing and getting up in the middle of the afternoon...</p>
<p>As long as I had finished school with good grades, nobody gave a rats ass about what I did on my vacation time. <em>Specially</em> if it was inside the apartment, where in theory is &quot;safe&quot;.</p>
<p>I'd stayed up for an entire day before (24 hours) and it didn't feel like too much of a hassle... it wasn't unusual for me to do that during vacation, actually... I'd get up progressively later into the day, until I found myself sleeping around noon, waking up at around 8-9pm, and then just staying up until next day's 8-9pm and get my sleep cycle back on track.</p>
<p>30ish hours weren't too terrible either. I'd pulled that off before (wake up around 1-2pm, stay up until 8-9pm of the next day, sleep and be back on cycle).</p>
<p>I thought I had experience with this stuff, and I wanted to see how far I could push it. That's where the 100 hours came from.</p>
<p>Why? Because I was young and stupid and I just wanted to be able to say I did it.</p>
<p>...so where was I?</p>
<p>Right, I woke up at around 2pm, and this is when I started counting, and I was sure I was going to do it.
Just lounged around the house for the most part. Internet connection wasn't that great during the day because the lines in my neighborhood were prone to being overloaded during the day while everyone was awake, but it played very smoothly during the night after everyone went to sleep. It was playable during the day, it just wasn't the <em>OMG</em> experience it was at night.</p>
<p>I remember the afternoons and nights being the easiest part of staying awake. Because there was so much to do. There was always stuff around the house, friends to talk to, things to keep my mind busy and active... and I found that, that was the secret to staying up. Staying mentally active.</p>
<p>The most difficult times honestly were from around 6AM to 10AM, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Because it was just SO DEAD... nobody online to play with on my usual servers... servers in other timezones weren't an option because they were really bad, connection wise. My friends were all asleep and they wouldn't be awake for hours.</p>
<p>No movement going around my house either.
It made sense to me why this is the hour I usually peaced out and slept.</p>
<p>So that slice of the day... from 6AM to 10AM... ish, that was the real bitch.</p>
<p>But I got the first day done, and now my apartment was bristling with family going around, people coming... and what am I even talking about</p>
<p>You guys don't care about what I did to stay up. You guys care about what I felt.</p>
<h1>Sorry for losing focus.</h1>
<p>I remember distinctly that the first day was OK. Other than that feeling of being slightly tired, there's nothing that I can really remember about it. You know that feeling behind the back of your eyes.</p>
<p>The second day, that feeling was constant, and much higher in intensity. The less active I was, the more it hit me. I found myself having to will through the dead hours of the morning. I never left my computer chair because I was sure I would fall asleep if I decided to lay on my bed and read something. So I just browsed the internet... random things... anything.</p>
<p>The 48-72 period is when things started getting interesting.
I was permanently tired. I felt physically tired, even though I had done nothing to warrant feeling physically drained... I didn't DO anything physically involving in all of this. It was all TV and videogames.</p>
<p>But I felt super tired.. Like I'd just finished playing soccer for an entire afternoon with my friends. </p>
<p>My eyelids felt like they hung from about a third down of where they normally would... my body wanted to shut my eyes and just make me sleep.</p>
<p>I only stayed up during the dead hours of the morning for this period by PACING around the apartment. I just walked from the kitchen to the living room... to the balcony... back to my room... I did this until people started getting up. Then I went back to my room, I didn't want people asking questions about how long I'd been up for.</p>
<p>the 72-90 period is when things got downright scary.</p>
<p>I now had a headache.</p>
<p>Persistant. Throbbing. It didn't start out too terribly and I didn't care much about it at first. But it got progressively worse over a short amount of time. I took some meds and thought I would be alright.</p>
<p>I took a tylenol, and I remember it being one of those extra strenght tablets, and I went straight into the bathroom for a scalding hot shower. That's always been my 'miracle cure' for a headache... take meds + stupid hot water on my head til I don't feel anything... by the time the effect from the shower is gone, the meds have kicked in... and i'm fine.</p>
<p>It did jack shit. Which caused me to take ANOTHER extra strength pill. (Looking back... I'm sure my liver is not happy with me to this day for this)</p>
<p>My eyes hurt. My head felt like it was going to explode. My body felt like it had lead hanging off every limb. Everything felt heavy, everything was hard to do.</p>
<p>Then it was around 5 AM. My computer needed a reebot. It'd been asking for one for longer than I could remember... and I decided... why not. It took forever to do this, it would be a way to kill time. Things were slowing down considerably by now online anyway.</p>
<p>So I started the reboot process, it would take at least 5 mins for this thing to be fully back up and responsive.</p>
<p>I laid down on my bed and stared at the ceiling while I watched the monitor change the intensity of light and color, from the corner of my eyes.</p>
<p>Then I looked to my left, where my alarm clock was:</p>
<p>5:30 AM.</p>
<p>I stared back at the ceiling and kept paying attention to the monitor lights coming from the corner of my eyes. I remember thinking &quot;It's still doing it?&quot;</p>
<p>So I looked back at the clock to see how long it'd been</p>
<p>5:15 PM.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT. THE. FUCK</strong></p>
<p>I jumped up from the bed, because there this didn't make any fucking sense. I had just looked at the fucking thing, it was 5:30 AM, and 30-45 seconds later it was saying 5 something <strong>PM</strong> ??</p>
<p>The alarm must've been malfunctioning and I told myself &quot;just go check the one in the kitchen&quot;</p>
<p>But then it hit me.</p>
<p>The light from outside.</p>
<p>Bright as day. Because... It was, you know, the middle of the day.</p>
<p>Half a day. 12 hours. And I hadn't even FELT it. I didn't even think I lost consciousness because all my thoughts were still in order. I clearly remembered my thought train. I was waiting on the computer to boot back up. I was annoyed it was taking too long, so I went to check the clock again and somehow 12 hours had passed.</p>
<p>But the sun was up. Everyone was up and saying hey to me and asking if I'd slept well... Come to think of it, my bedroom door was closed and I had to open it to get out, and I had left it open because I was always going back and forth from and to the kitchen for a snack, or a drink...</p>
<p>I have no recollection of those hours.</p>
<p>And as soon as the adrenaline lowered from the &quot;WTF!!!!&quot; feeling, I felt my body go heavy again, just not quite as bad... the headache was faint, but still there...</p>
<p>I'd fallen asleep. I fell short of the goal, so I might as well just go back to sleep.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p>My mother came and woke me worried if I was alright. I looked at the clock at it said 8 something PM.</p>
<p>I remember being pissed at her because she'd just seen me when I came out of my room at 6pm, so wtf was her problem.</p>
<p>&quot;THAT WAS YESTERDAY&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I'd slept for over a day.</p>
<p>Now, at age 29, I can't even make it 24 hours without feeling like I want to die and be released from the nightmare.</p>
<p>I read the top comment here, and people listing hallucinating. I never saw anything that wasn't really there. I don't think I hallucinated at all.</p>
<p>But I had the worst headache of my life. And looking back on it, I don't even want to know what that headache meant, but there's no way it was a good sign.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anecdote:</p>
<p>I've had several stints of 3+ days worth of sleep deprivation. None of them were particularly rewarding.</p>
<p>Some people claim you will get headaches. I didn't. I actually didn't experience any deterioration of my normal form aside from the cognitive impairment and the intense feeling of fatigue.</p>
<p>Before you reach 24h, you'll battle an extreme sleepiness. If you overcome this, you will most likely feel renewed. I don't know why that is, but I'd wager it is melatonin-related.</p>
<p><strong>24h-48h:</strong> you will start feeling <em>something</em>. A sort of distant tiredness. You don't feel the kind of tired that you usually do, but you do know that something isn't right. At the end of this period, you'll approach another steep wall of sleepiness, but it will be easier to conquer than the last one.</p>
<p><strong>48h-72h:</strong> if you made it this far, you're going to be a lot more tired than in the previous period. Literally everything feels like an almost insurmountable chore -- even mental tasks. And the tasks that you do get to, you're going to do them so much slower than usual. If it's a puzzle of some kind, or a problem that needs a clever solution, chances are you're not going to be able to solve it. It feels like your brain is so stuck that you don't even properly comprehend the question. On the off-chance that you get through it, you'll have spent probably 10 times as long as it normally would have taken you, maybe more. Someone else mentioned microsleeps, but I can't attest to that. I have no memory of any microsleeps...</p>
<p><strong>72h-96h:</strong> if you haven't already had hallucinations, you're gonna start having them here, almost guaranteed. The tiredness isn't so bad anymore. If you think about it, you will feel like you could probably go like this for a couple of more days. It's not so hard anymore. The permanent fatigue you've been feeling is still there, but it's kind of muted compared to your perception of it earlier. You don't feel it as a tiredness, it's sort of become a feature of reality that is being contrasted to how reality used to be. It's detached from you, in a way.</p>
<p><strong>96h+:</strong> at this point, hallucinations were really amping up for me here. Holy tripping balls. The tiredness will probably not bother you anymore, even though you can clearly feel the cognitive tax it has on you. But at the same time, you get a strange feeling that you're doing okay all things taken into account. You might get an odd notion that you can conquer the need to sleep <em>at all</em>. </p>
<p>But that changes when you slowly become aware of the fact that you can't tell hallucination from reality anymore. You're so tired that your consciousness is shutting down so frequently that, even as you're standing there, you can't explain why you're there or where you just were. You ask people questions about a conversation you had with them not 10 minutes ago, only to learn that you haven't actually spoken to them all day ... meaning that the 30 minute conversation you remember was a hallucination from start to end. But you don't remember &quot;waking up&quot; from the hallucination, begging the questions: when did it start? And when did it end? Are you just now hallucinating about having a hallucination? You have no way of knowing, because you just realized that the previous hallucination that you were just now made aware of bore no unnatural markings; nothing strange happened, nothing to separate it from how you would have expected such a situation to go down in real life.</p>
<p>When I reached this point, I got too scared to go on. Hallucinating shadows in windows and in the cracks of doors is one thing, but not being able to know whether series of events that span larger periods of time are real or not was too much for me. I don't know if they're even called hallucinations at this point. It felt like an involuntary participation in Inception, except I had no control over when I was inside a dreamworld and when I was returned to reality. </p>
<p>The scariest part was that these kinds of hallucinations blended together so seamlessly. I would go from what felt like hour-long bouts of hallucinating life-spanning events, like walking places and seeing things and talking to people, into the next event, to &quot;waking up&quot; and realizing that I'd made it all up. But how then did I get from where I was to where I am now? Who knows what I actualy did during the period of time that my brain wrongly remembers as reality?</p>
<p>The ironic thing is that it took me 2 hours to fall asleep. I wasn't tired or sleepy at all when I went to bed, but I had that really eerie stomach-sense that something was pretty far off mark and had the wisdom to force myself to staying in bed. I don't know what would have happened if I'd done another day, and I don't think I want to know either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
