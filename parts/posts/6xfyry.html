		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kinda related.</p>
<p>Some headsets have a dedicated mute button.<br />
But a lot of them only set the volume to ultra low.<br />
So if you enable it's physical mute feature, record yourself, and amp the volume of the recording to maximum using audacity: you may be able to hear yourself.</p>
<p>Sadly, it means you can spy on someone &quot;muted&quot; with this kind of headset, as long as you're using a voice chat software that continuously transmits audio (Skype for instance).<br />
Teamspeak, Discord, etc... anything with sound-level voice detection should keep you safe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are saying 'no' but that's probably not entirely true.  The DAC in the sound card won't be outputting a signal but unless you have a motherboard that has well designed audio front-end as a feature or the audio front-end is shut off entirely when the channel is muted you'll still be able to observe a signal at your earphones either by listening or looking at the voltage with an o-smell-o-scope.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A sound card is basically a digital-analog converter (DAC) that sends electrical signals to vibrate drivers (magnets) that make the actual sound.</p>
<p>When the computer is muted, no signal is sent to the drivers. The computer can tell the headphones are connected because the ground is still connected.</p>
<p>EDIT. I described analog headphones. USB headphones still acknowledge (or &quot;ack&quot;) a response to the computer to let them know they're still plugged in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
