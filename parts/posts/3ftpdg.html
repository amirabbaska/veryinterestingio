		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well first, there are no victims. It has been well established that hypnosis is an ability of the subject. It has essentially nothing to do with the hypnotist, and in fact even unskilled trainees, students, or the subject themselves can hypnotize a person with high hypnotic ability. </p>
<p>There are two schools of thought about what actually happens psychologically.</p>
<p>1) Social-cognitive theory. Basically, the act represents a very special social situation in which you're allowed to do outrageous things with no consequences. It is socially understood that that isn't &quot;really&quot; you, and afterwards you can claim amnesia or loss of control or whatever and you'll never be blamed for acting like that. This isn't exactly &quot;they're all faking&quot;, because there is also an extreme social pressure to do what the hypnotist says and not be a buzzkill for everyone else. So, the combination of the pressure and the opportunity give rise to all the things you see.</p>
<p>2) Dissociation theory. Basically, you have two aspects of your consciousness: The everyday thinking and feeling part you call &quot;I&quot;, and a hidden observer in the back of your mind that just kind of watches everything. Normally you identify with the I, and have only a faint awareness of the observer. In hypnosis you become the observer - which is an altered state of consciousness - and don't worry so much about the I. The observer cares far less about your social standing, personal qualms, etc, and just notes everything going on. So it is more likely to do far-out stuff, similar to what you might do when you're drunk, high, in a dream, etc (all of which are other altered states of consciousness). </p>
<p>I'm going to reply to this with other facts about hypnosis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was always very skeptical about these hypnosis shows and assumed all the people on stage were basically &quot;faking&quot; it until I witnessed something at a comedy show.  </p>
<p>My friends and I went to one of those comic hypnotists who brings people up on stage who want to be hypnotised and makes them do amusing things.  Its good fun.  As he's hypnotising those on stage, he tells the audience if you want to try to also get hypnotised at your seat you can do all the relaxation things that he is telling the on-stage folks.  None of us follow these commands. </p>
<p>Now fast forward like 30 minutes into show and in between each &quot;skit&quot; he tells the people on stage to go back to sleep and all of them would essentially nod off.  Were all sitting like 500 ft from the stage but look over at my friend Dan and every time they say go to sleep, his head is down also.  At this point were just sort of amused.</p>
<p>Now he's describing the next skit that everyone is going to do and its something around the people on stage being tv critics and the girls hate the show and guys love it.   And then reveals show is Scooby Doo. Wake up and (snaps fingers) go.</p>
<p>Now the girls start talking about how unrealistic the show is.  How do these people even afford to travel around without working?  Why do they even keep Scooby and shaggy around if they always screw things up?  And the guys are saying stuff like, its always an interesting twist at the end.  And where else can you get a mystery and comedy in just a 30 minute episode?</p>
<p>Now all of a sudden, Dan stands up from our table. Mind you were nowhere near the stage.   We assume he's headed to take a piss or something.  But no.  He's headed down the aisle towards the stage.  All of us are wide eyed and dying of hysterics.  wtf he is doing?  He walks on stage and the MC (who must have seen this type of thing happen before) walks over to him and asks his name and if he has something to say.   </p>
<p>Dan, who is a very shy and unassmuming kind of guy, says, &quot;Scooby dooby was the best theme song ever!&quot;  and starts singing the theme song.  ♪♪Scooby dooby doo. Where are you? Youve got some something something♫♫     Gets the whole crowd to sing along until he forgets all the words.  Hands the mic back to the hypnotist, walks back sits down grabs his beer bottle and sits and watches the stage like nothing happened. All of us are about to piss ourselves laughing but arent sure how were supposed to approach him. </p>
<p>After the show, we go out for beers, and we all question him about it.  He remembered everything and to this day swears he wasnt hypnotised but simply really likes scooby doo and was pissed off the girls were bad mouthing it and had to step up.  We all tried our best to impart to him how insane that is and that its not exactly normal behavior to get in front of a crowd of like 1000 people and sing the scooby doo song.   </p>
<p>And thats why I now fully believe that hypnosis is real.</p>
<p>tl;dr friend got himself hypnotized in the audience of a show and defended scoobys honor</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reddit tends to have a very hostile attitude towards hypnosis. As a stage hypnotist, I've learned to anticipate it whenever I see a thread like this pop up. I like to share my genuine experiences, but it tends to get crowded out by people who have no idea what they're talking about. Hypnotists are very used to people not believing them (and, really, it's a ton of fun to make a believer out of those sorts of people), but reddit just gets nasty about it. Still, I'm going to address a few points I've seen in this thread, real quick:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, hypnosis is real.</li>
<li>No, no one is a victim. Although they are in a hypnotic state, they are not helpless. Their inhibitions are lowered, and it's easier to convince them of things outside of their normal reality. But they're never victims. Just volunteers. In my shows, I've endeavored to make sure the volunteers have more fun than the audience. They deserve it, for being brave!</li>
<li>Yes, we do try to select people that are going to be better subjects. We don't want &quot;better actors.&quot; Those are awful for a show. Actors like to let the audience know they're playing along. A wink here or an over-large grin there. It's useless to us. They can ruin the show and ruin your credibility. The simple truth is, some people are more easily hypnotized than others, and that's why we select. No actors, please, we're specifically trying to weed those people <em>out.</em></li>
<li>We aren't perfect in our selection, though. Sometimes we pick someone who has gotten up there to mess with us. Or someone who wants to be hypnotized, but for whatever reason it just doesn't take (every mind works differently, especially under varieties of circumstances). These people tend to be the loudest &quot;Oh my god, hypnosis is fake because it didn't work for me!&quot; in threads like this. Yet you will always find (including in this thread) people trying to speak up saying &quot;It worked for me!&quot; Sadly, they get shouted down as liars (once again, as you can find in this thread).</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the realness of hypnosis scares people, on a core level. The notion of someone going into their mind and changing their reality. It sounds both fantastical and terrifying. So the loudest voice in the room tends to be the one who tells you there's no way it can be true. That's an easier pill to swallow, and so people do.</p>
<p>I love hypnosis. It's one of the most amazing skills I ever set out to learn, and I'm glad every day that I did. I'm glad that I pushed past my own disbelief. The looks of amazement and joy I see on people's faces after their first experience with it is incredibly rewarding. It bums me out sometimes when I see how certain people are that my passion is a sham, but the people who appreciate what I do continue to make it worth it.</p>
<p><em>edit</em> When I first made this comment, the top comment was simply that hypnosis is bullshit. I'm glad that a more level-headed and informative comment has made it to the top since then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, I was once a &quot;hypnotized&quot; audience member in one of those shows and I can tell you without a doubt that I was faking it harder than Mia Khalifa. But the other people on the stage, I just don't know. A few of them may have been faking it like me, a few others. I'm positive they were hypnotized. </p>
<p>The show was during Orientation at my university. The Hypnotist comes every year and every year some people are faking it, and some people seriously do go under. I watched the same show I took part in, a year later, from the audience and watched as several members of the audience who had fallen partially asleep watching the show started responding to his commands in the same way as the volunteers on stage. </p>
<p>I think its about someone who is both willing to relax to an extreme degree, I mean like sleep paralysis levels, and who is also very suggestible and willing to submerge themselves in the game, although I have no idea how to quantify that. I am gullible as hell and managed convince the hypnotist that I was under. Before the show got underway he separated those who he figured were obviously faking, or too tense to relax to the right degree.  The people I interacted with on the stage...well a lot of them remained friends and acquaintances years later. They don't remember what happened. I long since told people that I was acting, but those guys? No recollection at all. And no one is going to maintain a joke about a hypnotist show that happened 5 years in the past. I think some people legitimately go under.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
