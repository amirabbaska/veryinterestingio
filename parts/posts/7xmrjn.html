		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: maybe, maybe not. No one is sure. </p>
<p>Longer answer: The alphabet we use today is something that evolved over ~3,000 years, through 4 iterations minimum: </p>
<p>Phoenician ⇒ Greek ⇒ Latin ⇒ modern languages with letters like J, W, and ß, as well as diacriticals like å and diphthongs like œ. </p>
<p>As a result, there’s no one answer for where the order for a given modern language comes from. The alphabet for English is different from that of French, or Swedish, or Polish. Consider the Hungarian alphabet, which looks like this:</p>
<p>a, á, b, c, cs, d, dz, dzs, e, é, f, g, gy, h, i, í, j, k, l, ly, m, n, ny, o, ó, ö, ő, p, q, r, s, sz, t, ty, u, ú, ü, û, v, w, x, y, z, zs</p>
<p>Now, we can look at that and see that the basic order of the Latin alphabet remains. The additions are just stuck in after the related letters whose sounds they modify. As with English, we have the Latin alphabetical order, plus the later medieval insertions of j and w. The insertions are obvious and easy, because they simply follow the letters they were invented to modify/clarify. </p>
<p>But for the Latin order, it’s trickier. Latin is a blend of Etruscan and Greek, and they adopted neither wholesale. For example, Etruscan had 3 letters for what we would think of a ‘k’ sounds today: C, Q, and K (probably ‘kay’, ‘qoo’ and ‘ka’ but this is a guess since Etruscan remains untranslated). G was a lesser-used sound in Etruscan, but /k/ was very important, so they invented C from G, swapped kappa and gamma in the order, then inserted the ‘other’ k sound further down the line from Ϙ or qoppa , a pre-standardized Greek letter used in some cities. </p>
<p>Long story short, there’s some interesting linguistics research that suggests certain groupings of letters were created intentionally by different groups at different times, and then just kept out of habit by adopters. </p>
<p>So for example, the Beth Gimel Dat sequencing mentioned in a number of other posts was adopted directly into Greek as Beta Gamma Delta, but then the Gamma was replaced with C in Latin. </p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Semiotician W. C. Watt, after much research, concluded that the alphabet ordering descended from an early organization that grouped the letters by their sounds, which might have been used as a teaching tool for language (although that original organization/artifact is now lost). He called it the &quot;<a href="https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/semi.1989.74.issue-1-2/semi.1989.74.1-2.61/semi.1989.74.1-2.61.xml" target="_blank">Ras Shamra Matrix</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>Apparently he hadn't really even considered the question until a student asked him, and he realized he didn't know. However, he thought about the alphabet (A-B-C-D), realized that earlier organizations, like in Hebrew, had Bet-Gimel-Daleth (B-G-D), which are phonetically related, and so it might not be arbitrary. This sent him off on a research quest trying to figure it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi" target="_blank">Hindi</a> alphabets are ordered in two different categories: all vowels preceeds the order followed by all the consonants. The ordering is very clever and when you speak in the order, you can notice the subtle movements of the tongue and muscles in a particular way. </p>
<p>For example, the first four consonants are 'Ka', 'Kha', 'Ga', 'Gha'. When you pronounce it you see your tongue rises with every alphabet.</p>
<p><a href="http://hindilearner.com/images/alphabets/consonant.png" target="_blank">See this chart</a> for all the consonants in order.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The orderings are a stroll through the history of civilisation, likely a partial result of naming things via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrophony" target="_blank">acrophy</a>. The initial block of letters were originally based on Egyptian hieroglyphs, passed through Phoenicia, and onto Aramaic/Semitic languages and proto-European. Later, Greeks (c. 10th BCE) and then Romans (c. 6th BCE)  formalized the ordering, through various tweaks. Monks in the middle ages set the version of Latin letters used in English.</p>
<p>The first letter, &quot;A&quot; is actually the representative of the &quot;ox&quot; (or, rather, it's earlier incarnation, the Auroch, aka the &quot;ur-ox&quot;) -- you can still see the form, if you imagine it turned over: ∀</p>
<p>Consider that oxen were the first large creatures to be domesticated, and the first thing that would be used to create a stable, agrarian community. In Arabic and Hebrew, the word derived from the &quot;Aliph/Alef&quot; literally means &quot;tamed&quot; (animal).</p>
<p>Similarly, consider the Proto-Germanic/Norse rune-system, in which the first character &quot;Fe&quot; (ᚠ) represented &quot;livestock&quot; or &quot;wealth&quot;-- while the second character &quot;Ur&quot; (ᚢ) was &quot;Auroch.&quot;</p>
<p>Likewise, the second Latin letter, &quot;B&quot; represents &quot;house&quot; - and &quot;bet/beyt&quot; in Semitic languages is still the word for &quot;house.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not particularly, no.</p>
<p>Just like most abstract/arbitrary things people have invented, there's no real reason that can be pinned down.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look at other languages, you may not even see any similar correlation. For example, Japanese writing (that isn't kanji) is in the form of phonemes, and the order is completely different.</p>
<p>A(Ah) I(ee) U(oo) E(Eh) O</p>
<p>Ka Ki Ku Ke Ko</p>
<p>Sa Shi Su Se So</p>
<p>Ta Chi Tsu Te To</p>
<p>Na Ni Nu Ne No</p>
<p>Etc. You can look up hiragana on Google if you want to see the rest, but the point is there's almost no overlap in terms of order other than the A(Ah) sound is still first. It's language and writing character set dependent!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
