Whilst using toilet paper alone to cultures/people who are already using bidets will seem equally disgusting because they will never seem properly cleaned.</p>
<p>AFAIK Muslims have a rule of eating only with their right hand as their left hand is presumably used for cleaning. It's probably that countries more exposed to Islam will tend to wash in addition to wiping.</p>

<p>In all seriousness though, I'm in the UK and it's very rare to see a bidet here.  Whenever I've encountered one abroad I have been too unsure about the logistics of it to even attempt to use it.  I think I have only ever seen them in Italy and maybe Spain?  And in all cases it's been a separate unit like <a href="https://www.villeroy-boch.hu/fileadmin/upload/facelift2014/Bad_und_Wellness/Produktkategorie/Bidets/bidet-montage-omnia.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>, rather than an integrated one like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/JapaneseToiletBidet.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of the separate unit, what do you do?  Like turn the tap on and position your arsehole so that the water sprays it?  Wet your hand then use your wet hand to wipe your arse?  Wet toilet paper then use that to wipe?  I honestly don't even know which way you face when you use it.</p>
<p>And if you have an integrated one, how do you avoid shitting on the nozzle?  Is it retractable?  If you have explosive diarrhoea then surely the bidet mechanism has all manner of nooks and crannies in it that you will never be able to clean all the shit out of properly?</p>
<p>To someone who is unfamiliar with them it all seems extremely confusing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a large number of contributors.</p>
<p>Origin point and time of the bidet. They were invented in the 17th century in Europe, and thus they would have spread to regional areas as a custom. Generally when people get used to a bidet (particularly one with warm water), they'll stick with it if it's possible and convenient. </p>
<p>Cultural momentum. If all the houses in a country have bidets rather than plain toilets, newly built houses will usually have bidets rather than toilets. It's the way things were done, so it's the way things will be done. And some countries even go to the point of requiring it by law.</p>
<p>Attachment to cleanliness. In the same way there are massive differences in how the process of &quot;bathing&quot; happen, there are cultural differences in how a person's toilet is approached. Some cultures place a lot more importance and ceremony on acts of personal toiletry like washing and bathing so, like in Japan, they'll lean toward using bidets.</p>
<p>Availability of toilet paper. Here in Canada bidets really haven't caught on because wood and paper are so available and cheap. In other cultures where there's not such a massively available supply, there's a bit more of a preference to save paper by using a bidet.</p>
<p>Aging population. Bidets make clean-up easier and they'll likely become more popular as we have more gray haired people with mobility issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just cultural anomalies. I live in England, and we bought a house recently which came with a bidet. This is unusual in the UK, and we don't use the bidet...we've discussed taking it out when we remodel the bathroom in a couple years, making room for a larger bath, perhaps.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>However, I can objectively see why a bidet would be more desirable, especially if that's what you're used to. If you simply use toilet paper, there will undoubtedly be at least a trace amount of your faecal matter remaining. Realistically, if you're wiping &quot;until the paper comes away clean&quot;, this should be a negligible amount and it will be 'contained' within the buttocks. It's not as though you 'spread it around'. Also, with daily showering, any sane person will be washing the area between their buttocks with soap and water anyway. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This thread has inspired me. May try my bidet out for the first time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In short, they (I'm going to assume it stems from the lumber industry because paper) mass produce toilet paper because it's cheap and we have to keep going back to buy more.
They want our money.
Bidets are so much better, economically and environmentally. They should really be the standard. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
