		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Milliseconds after the big bang everything is well understood - even microseconds afterwards it is fine. Before that it gets more challenging.</p>
<p>There are three issues, sorted by increasing energy where they become relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>We run out of ways to test it experimentally. We can study the energies we can reach in particle accelerators, and studying cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere gives some insight a little bit above that, but the very early universe had conditions we cannot reproduce.</li>
<li>As the energy gets higher, gravity (which acts based on energy) gets stronger. At some point the gravitational interaction between individual particles becomes relevant, and there you have to use gravity and quantum mechanics at the same time. Currently we don't know how this works. Our current physics simply cannot make predictions for this.</li>
<li>Even if there wouldn't be gravity, our laws of physics are limited: While not as fast as gravity, the strength of the electromagnetic interaction increases with increasing energy as well. At some point our current theories predict that it becomes &quot;infinitely strong&quot;. That doesn't make sense, of course - and it means our theories are not valid up to this point.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mathematics is the language we use to describe our universe. In common, everyday cases, mathematics gives us very easy and intuitive descriptions. For example, if you have two points that are 10 miles apart and you have an object traveling between them at 1mph, it will take 10 hours to arrive. If you have another object traveling between them at 5mph, it will take 2 hours to arrive.</p>
<p>When we start using mathematics to describe more complex situations, sometimes the answers are a bit strange or even counter-intuitive. For example, if I'm on Earth and I launch a satellite into orbit, our clocks will no longer run at the same rate, yet neither clock is defective. The mathematics tells us that a person standing on the surface of Earth and a satellite in orbit will experience time slightly differently, but that neither is right or wrong versus the other. That's pretty weird, but we can see it actually happen with real world examples like GPS satellites.</p>
<p>In some very extreme conditions, the mathematical equations we use in describing how things work start producing results that are not just odd, but that are outright impossible. Time becomes a negative or imaginary number, objects become infinitely massive, forces become infinitely strong, densities increased to infinity, and all sorts of other things that do not and cannot exist in the universe. That's what we mean when we say &quot;physics breaks down&quot;: simply that the mathematical equations we use do not produce plausible results in extreme cases.</p>
<p>It's important to point out that this is not an inherent limitation of physics, but rather of the equations we have today. Mathematics is the language, but we use different equations for each specific thing we're describing. We have equations for how liquids flow, how electromagnetic forces interact with objects, and pretty much everything else that happens in the universe. What we don't have is a single equation you can use in every situation. We're trying to find one, and if we do, the expectation is that these extreme cases will produce plausible answers when we plug them into this new &quot;Grand Unified Theory&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of our understanding of the universe as a whole comes from measurements of particles and/or radiation. The problem with this is that these particles only came into existence after a certain time. Imagine you were trying to find out about my life after I had died. You might watch my vlogs, but I only started making them when I was 12 so you can't use them to see before that. You might read my diary, but I only started writing that when I was 8 so you can't use it to see before that. Similar problems plague us when we investigate the early universe. For example, it was only about 370,000 years after the big bang that the universe became transparent to photons (light) meaning that we cannot use photons to 'see' anything that existed before then because they didn't exist. There are other reasons why things are complicated (e.g. us not knowing anything about quantum gravity etc) but this is quite an important factor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“Stops working” is more of a dramatized way of putting it.</p>
<p>Physics is physics. It always works. But what we <em>understand</em> about physics is incomplete in certain exotic situations, including those very high energies. Stuff like particle colliders are meant to gather the data we need to fill that hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quantum mechanics is the language we use to describe the very small, and covers everything except gravity.</p>
<p>General relativity is the language we use to describe the very heavy, and mostly concerns gravity.</p>
<p>E = mc^2</p>
<p>If something small (like a fundamental particle) has a lot of energy, it has a lot of relativistic mass. But we're not sure what to do about that, when relativity and quantum mechanics don't give the same answers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
