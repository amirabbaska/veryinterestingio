It looks like these things have been around for 50 or more years without any Renovations, yet there are definitely cars in the parking lot and somebody must be renting rooms to keep the lights on. Am I to assume that the only traffic here is drug or prostitution related?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your theory is possible... could also be people passing through, people on business, people needing someplace to stay after leaving their spouse. Also, they are often on land somebody owns outright and staffed by the owner, so they may run a hotel that's just not very busy but doesn't need to be to stay afloat</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, keep in mind that they probably have very low overhead costs, If they've been in business for over 50 years, their financial situation could be quite stable and maybe all they have to pay for is wages and some updates to upholstery/linens once in a blue moon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many such hotels/motels change their business model from nightly visitors to long-term weekly and monthly rentals. This way, they can receive a steady income from people who are either in the zone where they cannot afford the financial basics to obtain a rental home or apartment; from people who are traveling for work and who need an inexpensive place to stay while on short-term long term projects; or from people whose interest it is maintaining a low profile due to past criminal convictions or current criminal activities.</p>
<p>Since the motel properties are usually paid for, any monies that the owners receive is profit. Since minimal maintenance upkeep is often what is done by the motel and non-paying clientele are quickly evicted (in some states, such residents don't receive the same protections that regular renters do) the owners can earn hefty profits while garnering minimal expenditures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of those old motels were built during the early days of highway travel, but before the Interstate system. Think Route 66. Cars of the day ('30s to '60s) didn't get good mileage and most cars couldn't do 65 or 75 for extended periods, if at all. Back in the day, there was a big price difference between motels/motor courts and hotels. That line has become a little fuzzier over the years. </p>
<p>Here in Albuquerque we still have a few old Route 66 motels, but they are mostly populated with prostitutes/johns, drug dealers, temp workers trying to maximize their per diem, long term residents who can't qualify for an apartment or just choose to stay off the grid for various reasons. And of course, very frugal travelers who don't care about anything but price. </p>
<p>Many of those old motels were passed down to children and grand-children who didn't really care about the legacy. They either hired a manager on the cheap or sold the property at a deep discount for a quick cash out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I end up at a lot of these places (I'm a cop, not a drug addict) and a lot of people actually live in those hotels/motels.</p>
<p>They're super cheap because they're not advertising and keeping them to bare-minimum standards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
