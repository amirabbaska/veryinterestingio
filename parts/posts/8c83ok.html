<p>This article summarises a journal article I have not reviewed, but appears to claim that the median age of adult Neanderthals (defined as individuals over 20) was 40.</p>
<p>This strongly implies that a significant minority of Neanderthals lived to sixty. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question. As you probably experienced, this is a <em>pain</em> to try to figure out. Searching things like &quot;oldest prehistoric human&quot; gets you a lot of results about the oldest <em>fossils</em> but very little information on the actual lifespan of prehistoric humans.</p>
<p>It's true that very few remains have been definitively dated as being older than ~50 years. However, that doesn't mean that absolutely nobody lived past 50- there might be other reasons for those results. According to <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/108/4/1267.full.pdf" target="_blank">this paper (PDF warning)</a>, elderly bones are more fragile and less likely to be preserved in the fossil record. Also, our normal methods of estimating age in human remains (including teeth wear and skeletal reflections) are likely <em>underestimating</em> the age of our most-elderly fossils. That means that even if we have fossils of humans or neanderthals that have passed middle age, we might not be aware of it.</p>
<p>A few fossils have been identified as over 50. From the book <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd3ZkElJ72UC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=Arcy-Hy%C3%A8ne+8&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JfrIi3Hrn9&amp;sig=uumjY3B6qAj9sF9SWFHReFPJJjc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji48LSjb3aAhVSTt8KHckdCIkQ6AEINzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Arcy-Hy%C3%A8ne%208&amp;f=false" target="_blank">The Early Modern Human from Tianyuan Cave</a>, the human remains Tianyuan 1 have worn teeth suggesting &quot;an age into the fifth decade postnatal and possibly into the sixth decade&quot; meaning 50-60+ years. The book identifies other human and neanderthal remains that are even older, including Dolni Vestonice 16, Ohalo 1 and 2, and ZKD-UC 101.</p>
<p>Regardless, even with a few fossil humans that probably reached 50 years of age, that looks like an exceedingly rare outcome. It looks like our prehistoric ancestors were pretty unusually lucky if they made it into their forties. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
