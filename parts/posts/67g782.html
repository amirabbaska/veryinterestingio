Majority of the serious alcoholics of that time were gin or vodka drinkers, can't remember why, so those clear liquors became more associated with alcohol related diseases </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak for doctors in the early 1900s, but Vodka and Gin go down much too easy and provide far less of a hangover due to their makeup (they are distilled, often, 3-5 times, removing a greater portion of the impurities that cause hangovers).  This is why the greater portion of alcoholics are Gin or vodka drinkers.</p>
<p>Bourbon, however, punishes you if you drink it too much, making you realize the damage you've done. </p>
