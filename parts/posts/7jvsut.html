		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tungsten evaporates from the filament. You can tell a new filament from a well worn one by looking at it under a microscope. As it ages, it develops more resistance at the thinnest spot. Eventually, the filament breaks. Old bulbs can have a dark coating of tungsten on the inside of the glass bulb. Halogen bulbs get so hot that the tungsten doesn't condense on the glass. When the bulb is turned off, some of the tungsten vapor gets redeposited on the filament. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As /u/whitcwa points out the heat of the filament is so great that it results in a non-trivial degree of evaporation of the filament metal itself. This is why tungsten is used, because it has a very high boiling points and thus a low evaporation rate, leading to a longer life. However, that's not the only issue. One of the big problems is that evaporation away from a &quot;weak spot&quot; is a positive feedback loop. The thinner a part of the filament is the higher the resistance will be, resulting in greater ohmic heating and higher temperatures, thus higher rates of evaporation.</p>
<p>To combat this a non-inert gas can be used that forms a compound with the evaporated tungsten and facilitates its redeposition back onto the filament. This is how halogen lamps work, in most of the bulb the tungsten halide exists as a gas, near the filament it's hot enough to dissociate into the halogen and tungsten metal, which can then deposit itself onto the filament, replenishing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a non-detailed reason, high temperatures, means more molecule movement which is why so many failure mechanisms involve heat.  In particular, with the filament, you get material on the filament  vaporizing, and then redepositing on the filament.  Since you don't necessarily redeposit at the same location you lost material, after enough cycles you can develop a weak spot that can't handle the thermal stresses that comes from the thermal expansion with turning a bulb on or off.  Which is usually why bulbs give up the ghost when you cycle power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the reasons already mentioned, it can also come from the mechanical stress caused by stretching and contracting. The filament go through significant temperature changes as they heat up and cool down from being turned on and off, and the metals stretch and contract with the heat. </p>
<p>You can often see this effect when you have several lights where some of them are turned on and off more often, and others are left on permanently. The ones left on permanently sometimes last longer than the occasionally-activated ones, even though they have been running for longer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
