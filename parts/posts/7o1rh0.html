How can whisky producers who start off as tiny companies possibly have enough stock to supply their now huge demand? They couldn't possibly have expected such great success or had the capital to make so much stock when they were only a small business.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You avoid as much as possible, making your name on aged single malts if you are a new distillery and are interested in expansion.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You distill and sell spirits that don't need to be aged for years.  A new distillery can turn out rum and flavoured vodkas in short order.  That pays the bills while your new-make spirit is aging and becoming whisky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You buy up whisk(e)y from other distillers, blend it, bottle it and sell it under your label.  A lot of US whiskey comes from one very large alcohol distiller who sells a dizzying array of ages and flavour profiles.  You blend these to taste, perhaps aging them for a few months in a finishing barrel and then sell them, with or without an age statement, under your brandname. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You try to find interesting new-ish barrels in your rick houses and release a no age statement (NAS) whisky.  Ardbeg does this a lot with their Committee releases and their routine NAS releases (Uigeadail &amp; Corryvreckan).  In Scotland, NAS whisky still has to be at least 3 years old, but 3 years is better than 10 years both for space management and mitigating losses to evaporation.</p>
</li>
<li>If you are &quot;reviving&quot; a defunct distillery, you may be able to buy aged stocks distilled at your distillery in years past that are held by other distilleries and blenders.  Bruichladdich was able to do this as part of the offer to buy and revive that distillery at the turn of the millennium.  If you can come up with the money, there may be thousands of barrels of 10 year old whisky available from past runs at your &quot;new&quot; distillery.</li>
</ol>
<p>Later, once you are fully capitalized, have adequate inventory, sufficient warehouse space and have some feeling for the market, then you can start focusing on aged single malt releases.  Those are some the most restrictive constraints though, so you generally want to avoid locking yourself into those while you are still raising capital and getting established.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a secret sheepishly admitted to by some of the newer whisky brands: for the first few years, they would just buy commodity whisky from other distilleries, bottle &amp; label it, and sell it under their own name, until the whisky they made themselves is ready.</p>
<p>Once established, a small distillery might routinely distill a lot more whisky than they expected to be able to sell (as premium, name-brand stuff), pick and choose the barrels they want to keep, and sell the rest to a bottler that produces cheap blended whisky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the one hand, they often simply don't have enough to meet demand. It's an unavoidable problem in the liquor industry. A company with demand higher than supply can raise its prices, of course, but it's probably still missing out on potential revenue.</p>
<p>Still, there are several ways that businesses adapt to this. Lending and investment in the sector is based on future profits: someone investing in a new whisky distillery is going to be doing their business analysis based on expectations of when the whisky is actually ready for sale. (This is just like with farmers, who often sell this year's harvest before it's even been sown.) So it's normal for a promising distillery with few sales right now to be able to raise some capital to start aging whisky for later. In the meantime, new distilleries will also produce spirits that don't need to be aged as much, like gin, to pay for their regular expenses.</p>
<p>You have to keep in mind that brand name isn't everything, either. If there's more demand than there is aged whisky, a company might start selling a new line of whiskys under the same brand name that don't have an age statement. It could also sell blends from other distilleries under its own name. When you look at the label on the bottle, you've got to be careful about just what is being advertised (or not).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually becoming a problem.  Many of the major Scotch Whisky distilleries are starting to sell a lot more &quot;no age statement&quot; whiskies, such as Talisker Skye, etc.  These are aged using other techniques, and only need a few years for maturation.  Many of these are good quality, although Whisky connoisseurs often turn their nose up at them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a real boom in Scottish gin at the mo as new distilleries look for ways to make money while they wait for their whisky to mature. Harris gin is probably the most well known- their whisky won't be ready until 2020 but in the meantime they're struggling to keep up with the demand for their gin (which is admittedly amazing) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
