		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to Wikipedia, the energy used to keep the train stable above the rails is small compared to the energy used to counteract drag. With an object as heavy as a train, how is this possible?</p>
<p>Edit: Since this thread has gone back and forth with different interpretations of the question, would anyone be willing to mathematically compare the amounts of energy required to accomplish the three goals of the maglev system (levitation, acceleration, and overcoming drag)? I think that would clear a lot of this up.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Now that more people have added their input, it looks like my initial assumption, that a continuous current requires a continuous input of energy, was wrong. The only energy required is the up-front energy to apply the initial voltage to the rails. After that, the circuit continues to run without the need for more energy. Thus, the only energy spent while the train is levitating (not including propulsion) is due to losses from resistance. With that in mind, and with the fact that no energy is required to suspend an object at a constant height, it makes sense that levitation is such a small portion of the energy used. As u/Wheed_O_Whirler pointed out, that amount is actually less energy than is used by the air conditioner. Thanks to everyone who helped explain that.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To start off, as you might expect, the key benefit you get from suspending a train magnetically is that you get less friction than using a traditional track, which in turn can boost its efficiency. But I believe you are asking why this gain is not washed out by the energy needed to keep the train suspended. Without going into the specific details of how a maglev train works, think of the problem in slightly more general terms. The problem is that your question seems to have the implicit premise that supporting a stationary weight requires a constant input of energy. However, while this notion may be in line with our intuition (e.g. we get tired when holding up a weight at the gym), it is not true in general. You do not need to supply additional work to keep a body at rest in a constant force field. After all, a book sitting on your table doesn't require a constant input of energy not to fall through your desk. A combination of electrostatic repulsion and electron degeneracy is enough to overcome gravity and let the book sit still on the table just fine. </p>
<p>Magnetic suspension is not fundamentally any different, except that now you are using a magnetic force to overcome gravity. But the point remains, while it would take work to lift a weight from the ground up using a magnetic force, once the weight is suspended no further work is required to keep it in place. This is why you can suspend a magnetic material <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws6AAhTw7RA" target="_blank">on top of a superconducting surface</a> with no further work required than that to keep the superconductor below its critical temperature.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To answer some follow-up questions, maglev trains come in many types: some  like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductrack" target="_blank">Inudtrack</a> use permanent magnets,  others use electromagnets, etc. But the heart of the answer to OP's question is more general. Regardless of the underlying details, once you suspend a stationary object, no further work is required to keep it suspended. If you use permanent magnets, you can keep a weight <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8wpCIt9.jpg" target="_blank">suspended indefinitely</a> without using up any more energy. On the other hand, if you use electromagnets, you do have to use some energy to maintain the magnetic field. But the reason you need this energy is because the wires have a finite electrical resistance (which leads to energy wasted as heat), not because you need to do additional work to keep the train suspended.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't take any energy to keep something from falling, only a force. When it's on the track there is a force pushing down ( gravity) and one up (magnets). It's in an energy &quot;well&quot; meaning it would take energy to move it up or down but not to make it stay in place. The only energy requirement is powering the magnets and that's easy when you're not trying to move the thing up or down. Giving it kinetic energy in a certain direction will require significant input but we don't want the train moving up or down, just side to side, so the up down doesn't contribute much to the energy cost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
