		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wood is made of very large molecules that are very closely packed together.  While they are combusting, they are not all completely converted to small gaseous molecules like CO2, but rather you get &quot;volatilization&quot; of some larger organic molecules that can collect when they cool down - like on your clothes.  These molecules and particles are what you see in smoke, and in fact you can collect smoke by making a small distillery and that is how you get &quot;liquid smoke&quot;.  You are literally getting smoke to stick to your clothes.  When you collect them, they are sticky and greasy, which makes them hard to wash out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Burning any organic matter releases something called <strong>P</strong>olycyclic <strong>A</strong>romatic <strong>H</strong>ydrocarbons, or PAHs for short. You probably know all about these as it is colloquially known as tar. As I'm sure you know, tar is &quot;sticky&quot; and it will cling to surfaces more readily than your favorite perfume for example.</p>
<p>The unfortunate part is tar is carcinogenic. Yes, breathing in wood smoke from a campfire <em>can</em> give you cancer.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The smoke produces a resume that is sticky and produces the smells. When you're around a fire the smoke passes through clothes and hair and sticks to it. Thus, hair and cotton often absorb a lot of the smell. This is also why the items/people that smell the most usually have a notable black dusting. The same idea is applicable to smoking in a car. The smoke resin smells and sticks more-so to items with a breathable fabric. This is why if you get into a smokers car with cloth seats it is obvious, but when they have leather seats it's hard to notice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The waste from burning wood, on a molecular level, is a bunch of heavy, organic molecules.  You can think of it like tar, but less &quot;syrup-y.&quot;  But kind of like tar, it has a tendency to stick to surfaces.  The clothing we wear tends to have lots of surface area which is a great place for those molecules to get stuck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I'm not seeing here is that smell is a very human experience.  We don't smell everything in the air, and are sensitive to some things more than others.  We're very attuned to burning smells, so in coordination with other factors, we have a strong sense for this smell, also.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
