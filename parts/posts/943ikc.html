		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, what you see with babies and puppies, and baby animals in general, is that they really struggle to find a nice way to lay, as they dont know the comfortable positions yet. You (i assume youre not a baby) know exactly what comfortable situations will suit your body at that exact time from experience. This experience is deep into your muscles, which is why your automatically find that position, which you have previous good experiences with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The urge to move is mostly due to blood pressure and excess heat or cold. When sleeping, blood pressure dips slightly, and doesn't move through muscles as easily, especially in areas where compressed - the side you're lying on, your legs overlapping, and so on. Also, the discomfort of too much heat in the sheets, or moving from cold towards warmth is a motivator in changing position. Sometimes it's an inability to breathe, as in rhinitis or congestion. Most adults make about 500-600 movements an evening while sleeping.</p>
<p>Why you feel the urge to move to specific positions: you've experimented a lot over the years with trying to find comfortable positions that work best for you to fall asleep. You've got your go to positions, which are likely directly opposing the above mentioned motivators - alleviating discomfort from heat or cold, or a subconscious move to prevent muscle cramping from cut off blood supply to compressed muscles, or clearing one side of your sinuses where congestion has cut off air flow.</p>
<p>NOTE: when people are under anesthesia, they don't move at all... </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dunno how accurate this is, but I heard that your brain is sending your body signals saying &quot;hey! You asleep yet?&quot; And if you do not move, your brain thinks you are asleep and will shut itself down for the night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
