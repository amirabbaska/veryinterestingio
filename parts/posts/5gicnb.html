		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reality is moving all the time.  Your eyes can only handle so much resolution and your brain can only process so much at once, but with a high res picture you have a frozen image that you can study up close, so it looks razor sharp.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually because everything's in focus, IRL your brain cuts out a ton of the signal from your eyes. If you had a way of making the image take up your entire field of vision it'd probably be less noticeable</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pick up your phone, put it one foot away from your face and stare at the screen. You can see the phone perfectly fine but all the stuff behind it looks blurry unless you purposely stare at it. This occurs because the eyes will focus on whatever you are paying more attention to. In a movie, the entire picture looks sharp which isn't what would happen if you were there in person.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
