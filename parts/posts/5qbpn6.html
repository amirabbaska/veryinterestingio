		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If they're small enough, they actually do this on their own. We think that quantum fluctuations near the event horizons of black holes cause them to emit mass/energy in the form of Hawking Radiation. For big black holes, this happens really slowly, (many-times-the-age-of-the-universe-slowly) but the smaller they get, the faster they evaporate. Exponentially faster. Eventually, we think they explode, and people are looking for the energy released in such events. In the last second of their life they should emit 100000 times more energy than the largest bomb ever built. We don't, however, have a complete description of the end of a black hole's life, which would need a quantum theory of gravity, which still eludes us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's another way to do itâ€”spin it up past its extremal angular momentum.</p>
<p>At a certain point, the centrifugal &quot;force&quot; will overcome the gravitational binding energy of the black hole. The mathematics say you get a &quot;black toroid&quot; at that point, but it seems more likely to me that instabilities would lead the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergosphere" target="_blank">ergosphere</a> to pinch off at the equator and start spewing out globs of mass.</p>
<p>What happens from there is anyone's guess, but I imagine the end result would look something like <a href="http://www.dailygalaxy.com/.a/6a00d8341bf7f753ef01bb095f4eca970d-pi" target="_blank">this</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Black holes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation" target="_blank">gradually lose mass on their own</a> and eventually explode, leaving nothing behind. You can't really accelerate this process artificially, it's just something that happens on its own and will happen fastest if you just leave the black hole alone and allow nothing more to fall in. Anything you throw into the black hole just makes it bigger, and the bigger it is, the longer it takes to lose all its mass and disappear; the 'lifetime' of a large black hole into which no more material is falling is proportional to the <em>cube</em> of its initial mass, so for instance, if you merge two black holes of equal mass into one of twice that mass, the resulting black hole will take <em>eight times</em> as long to disappear as either of the two original ones.</p>
<p>However, in the real world, everything in the Universe is constantly bathed in the dim light left over from the Big Bang. This is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" target="_blank">Cosmic Microwave Background.</a> This leftover light gets eaten by black holes, so if a black hole is sufficiently large that it emits less Hawking radiation than the equivalent of the CMB, it is actually <em>gaining</em> mass even if no normal atomic matter is falling in. Right now, any black hole with a mass greater than roughly that of the Moon is too large to be decaying yet- it swallows CMB radiation faster than its own mass evaporates from it. Typical black holes formed by supernovas have a minimum mass of about twice that of the Sun, so they are much too large to be decaying yet. However, as the Universe expands, the CMB gradually weakens, so eventually it will account for less than the radiation emerging from any black hole, allowing all black holes to eventually evaporate away. The decay of large black holes is thought to be the slowest process in the observable universe, with the largest ones finally disappearing somewhere around a trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years from now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly; the infinite density means the event horizon will always be bigger than whatever amount of mass you got inside it. But as others have explained, blackholes do lose mass over time, but it's thru a different mechanism, it's not because they get too light to hold the mass in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
