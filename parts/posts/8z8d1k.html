		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you follow a proper sleep schedule and go to sleep/wake up at the same time every day your body gets used to it. Circadian rythm causes your brain to release certain hormones that gradually wake you up over the course of about an hour. An alarm clock jarrs you awake and your body doesn't like it, so over time your brain adjusts to start waking you up before that happens. </p>
<p>Edit: Since a lot of people have been asking why they wake up after changing their alarm here's something from an article I read.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s evidence you can will yourself to wake on time, too. Sleep scientists at Germany’s University of Lubeck asked 15 volunteers to sleep in their lab for three nights. One night, the group was told they’d be woken at 6 a.m., while on other nights the group was told they’d be woken at 9 a.m. But the researchers lied—they woke the volunteers at 6 a.m anyway. And the results were startling. The days when sleepers were told they’d wake up early, their stress hormones increased at 4:30 a.m., as if they were anticipating an early morning. When the sleepers were told they’d wake up at 9 a.m., their stress hormones didn’t increase—and they woke up groggier. “Our bodies, in other words, note the time we hope to begin our day and gradually prepare us for consciousness,” writes Jeff Howe at Psychology Today.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We often wake up early when we have something important like an exam or interview because oversleeping is constituted in our brain as a threat. Just because we're asleep doesn't mean our brain isn't capable of being aware that time is passing and maintaining an awareness of threat, and as you go through your sleep cycle when you surface into lighter sleep you often wake up a little. Your brain at that point in each rotation will be like &quot;hey remember that thing let's not oversleep for that thing!&quot; And if enough time has passed that it's getting close to the time you need to be awake your brain will push that information into your conscious thoughts, in order to avoid the threat that is oversleeping and missing your interview etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have mentioned the circadian rhythm which is most of it, but other factor is more mundane: Confirmation Bias. </p>
<p>When you wake up just minutes before your alarm, that's remarkable, and so you think about it and remember it. But when your alarm wakes you up, that's just another morning and there's nothing special to remember.</p>
<p>So, when you look back, all you can remember is times that it happened, and like a vague sense that sometimes it doesn't. So, you wind up thinking it happens far more often than it actually does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
