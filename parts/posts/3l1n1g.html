		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of misinformation in this thread. The answer is much more simple. Woman's fashion started with dresses. It's kind of hard to label a dress with a waist size and inseam. Designers came up with an arbitrary scale to label the various sizes of dresses. When woman started wearing pants that method continued. That way a woman who wore a size 6 dress could expect to wear size 6 pants. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people don't seem to realize that men's sizes are every bit as inaccurate as women's, that inseam and waist size don't really give an accurate picture of how things fit, and that there are many different sizing systems used across brands and in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>First off, a pair of men's size 36 pants isn't going to have a 36 waist from most places; it'll probably have about a 37.5&quot; waist.  Part of that is vanity sizing - yes, they do it for men, too.  But the other part of it is that most men's pants these days (especially casual ones) have a lower rise and sit on the hips instead of at the true waist.  So, theoretically, someone with a 36&quot; waist would be about 37.5&quot; at the hip.  Since people think they're one size, it probably leads to <em>less</em> confusion.  But there are plenty of brands that don't do that, so you have to know who you're buying from.</p>
<p>Secondly, there's a lot more information needed to accurately convey how something fits than just the waist size and inseam.  Say you're buying a pair of jeans with a 36&quot; waist and 34&quot; inseam.  How do you know just from that if they're going to fit your waist or your hips?  Will they be straight below the knee, or a skinny fit that clings to your leg all the way down?  A better set of measurements would be waist, inseam, front rise, back rise, thigh, and leg opening...but of course that's a little hard to fit on a tag.  Good retailers will usually provide full measurements, but it's a lot of work to get them, and they're probably meaningless to a lot of people.  That's why brands try to come up with descriptions like &quot;slim fit&quot; or &quot;straight cut&quot;.  But they're pretty arbitrary, and an &quot;extra slim fit&quot; from Brooks Brothers is going to fit a lot differently from a slim fit from H&amp;M.</p>
<p>Lastly, the waist/inseam system (or the collar size/sleeve length system for shirts) is far from universal.  Lots of things for men are sized in S/M/L which are just as arbitrary.  Then other stuff is sized by chest size instead of collar size, particularly jackets but sometimes shirts as well.  Also, if you're looking at a jacket, you better make sure you know whether you're looking at American or European sizing...if you're an American size 46, you're going to have a lot of problems if you buy a European size 46.  And then when you get into designer stuff, you start seeing brands use just number sizing, which is roughly like S/M/L but even more arbitrary.  For example, I'm a size 3 in Thom Browne but a Size VI in Stephan Schneider.</p>
<p>TL;DR Men's measurements are just as broken and just give the illusion of being more accurate.  There's not really any way to simply convey the full fit of something.  Know your full measurements when buying online (the easiest way is to measure a piece that fits you well), or try things on.  And consider going to a tailor if you need to tweak the fit on something you like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I own a Tshirt company and the same applies to Tshirts.<br />
All of my men's Tshirts are sized about the same even across different model types and brand names.
WOMEN's Tshrits vary WILDLY in size.  One brand's medium is the size of another's Extra Small.  One's XXL is the size of another's L.<br />
I hate this because when I sell shirts, a guy can walk up, point at a design he likes, I ask him what size he wants, I find that size, he pays, and done.
With women, they need to put it up on their chest, estimate if it's right, and often end up coming back returning the item to exchange it for a different size.  It's a huge fucking pain in the ass to have women's sizes be completely non-standard.  A pain to me and to the women.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marketing. It's all marketing.</p>
<p>For women, (I'm leaving out <em>why</em> this is) smaller has always been synonymous with better. &quot;6&quot; is smaller than &quot;30&quot;. There's even size &quot;0&quot;, or for the <em>really</em> tiny ones &quot;00&quot;. Yes, you can be size &quot;double-nothing&quot;. It's dumb.</p>
<p>And to make matters worse, sizes actually change between stores. One company's &quot;4&quot; can be another company's &quot;8&quot;.</p>
<p>It makes the most practical sense to label clothing dimensions in their <em>actual</em> dimensions, but literally nothing about women's clothing is practical. And it's not because they actually like not having things like pockets.  </p>
<p>Edit: Yes, men's sizes are not all created equal either. If you'd like to read more, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/design/2012/01/clothing_sizes_getting_bigger_why_our_sizing_system_makes_no_sense_.html" target="_blank">here's</a> an article talking about the history of clothing sizes, and how the original sizes were determined. For men they related it only to chest size, and had a hard time doing this with women given how a woman's bust size has almost no relation to other measurements. The single number &quot;measurement&quot; came out, and over time we have constantly &quot;invented&quot; lower numbers to replace the bigger ones corresponding to the same size - which is of course &quot;vanity sizing&quot; - <em>purely</em> a marketing technique. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
