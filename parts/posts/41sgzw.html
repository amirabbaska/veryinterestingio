<p><em>edit</em></p>
<p>thanks everybody, i see it's a complicated question, and i like the material answers that were provided. to those who answer along the lines of &quot;it takes no extra work since the network is always active&quot;, then my question becomes &quot;what is the energy cost of a packet's worth of activity?&quot;.</p></div></div>
