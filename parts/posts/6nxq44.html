<p>Note that there are two different parts involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bulb has two different filaments, with four different possibilities: No filaments lit, filament A lit, filament B lit, filaments A &amp; B both lit.</li>
<li>The wiring in the switch is such that different positions of the switch produce the four different lighting conditions of the bulb.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually you can take a look at the fixture and it will tell you the wattages that it is rated for, say a 50W/100W/150W bulb. You can go to a local hardware store and pick up a 3-way Bulb for them and the CFL and LED 3-way bulbs are getting decently cheap nowadays. The four clicks offer 3 levels of brightness, as others have stated here.</p>
<p>Source: I work in a hardware store. Finally a little relevant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ones that click twice in each position are made for a &quot;3-way bulb&quot;.  That's a bulb with two filaments, low and high.  They are made to do low, high, low+high, off.  </p>
<p>But if you put a regular single filament bulb in that socket, you get off, on, on, off.  (It's only on when the &quot;high&quot; filament is supposed to be.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
