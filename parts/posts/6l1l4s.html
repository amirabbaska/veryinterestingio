		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This mainly has to do with how 4k gives you more bitrate (in the context of youtube), or how much less compressed the video gets when it arrives for you to watch. You know how you can compress a jpeg image to shrink the file size but make it less detailed even though the physical dimensions of the image stays the same? Youtube does mostly the same thing, but to the video instead. When you chose 4k instead of 1080p youtube doesn't compress the files as much when it gives it to you to watch, thus leading into a better video even though the physical dimensions of the video for you is the same (at 1080p) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost all consumer cameras use codecs that do a heavy <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Colorcomp.jpg" target="_blank">chroma subsampling</a> similar to the image on the left.  Because the data demands of unsampled 1080p or 4k are exceedingly high.  </p>
<p>That means in both 4k and 1080p video, the camera throws away an enormous amount of data, but because 4k starts with 4 times as much, the final output looks better.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Subsampling</p>
<p>A 1080p video is usually 4:2:0. That means that for every 4 pixels, there are 4 pixels worth of luminance data. 2 larger pixels for part of the color data and zero pixels for the other part</p>
<p>4k video encoded in 4:2:0 has doble resolution. And obviously double color resolution</p>
<p>So a 4k 4:2:0 video is equivalent to a 2k 4:4:0 video when played in a 2k display</p>
<p>It's sharper because it has more information even though there is the same number of pixels displayed</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has a lot to do with pixel mapping. A scaled 4k to 1080p will have a subjectively better visual appeal than one that's captured natively at 1080p. Super sampling your source and downcompressing later will always yeild a more qualitative superior result. A number of factors are at play when down scaling though. Especially the filters used to render the down scaled image/video.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am going to look for the link I read a couple years back.  But basically it is due to how the sampling works.  Images are broken up into 4 quadrants and interlaced together.  With the 4k it is basically 4 1080p quadrants so when it interlaces them color/sharpness etc is a lot higher.</p>
<p>Will post and edit when I find it.</p>
