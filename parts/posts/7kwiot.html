		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm bipolar 2, and no doctor has ever given me the same answer as another doctor.</p>
<p>It's one of those things where they don't know the direct cause, but they know how to treat it (success widely varies due to so many factors).</p>
<p>Most doctors think it's a combination of genetics and past experiences which cause bipolar (nature loaded the gun, nurture pulled the trigger).</p>
<p>The phases of bipolar are caused... basically by everything. When I enter a mixed state or a depressed state, it's an overreaction of my body to some sort of stimulus. In my case, it's by far a social stimulus as when I send a lot of time alone (and not focused on the past), I'm usually ok.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read a paper recently that asserts, among other things, that a dysfunctional secondary signaling system allows for runaway upregulation or downregulation of certain receptor site. Also, many have hypothesized that a discordant circadian cycle can initiate the swings, but it is still a pretty murky subject.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
