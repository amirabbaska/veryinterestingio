		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is already a device out there that does what you are saying.  A lot of people with severe heart damage will get put on a device called an LVAD (Left Ventricular Assist Device) which can either assist a damaged heart or just replace it entirely.  These devices have a rotor that circulates blood continuously instead of making it pump.  It connects to a battery pack outside the body.  These people will often have no pulse and by extension no measurable blood pressure because there is no pulsitile motion to measure.  These devices are usually used as a temporary measure until a heart donor can be found, but it's getting more common to be used in those that cannot undergo a heart transplant as well.
Here's some more info if you want to read about it.  </p>

<p>I am an ED nurse at an LVAD center hospital so I see these fairly often.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This already exists - it's called a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). It is implanted in people who's heart is too weak to effectively pump blood at a sufficient perfusion pressure. </p>
<p>Basically it consists of a pipe with a motor in the middle. One end of the LVAD is hooked up to the heart (left ventricle), the other end is hooked up to the aorta (largest artery carrying blood to the rest of the body), and in the middle there is a motor which generates a negative pressure which sucks the blood out from the heart (assists the heart) and into the aorta. The motor speeds are adjusted to optimize the pressures in the heart. It is powered by a battery that is worn outside the body, but connects to the LVAD through the abdomen. </p>
<p>It is used in those who are waiting for a heart transplant but would otherwise die waiting. In some it’s also used as destination therapy (they are not candidates for a heart transplant but this will keep them alive longer than if they didn’t have an LVAD).</p>
<p>Complications include hemolysis (shredding of red blood cells) due to the motor. There is also a high risk of infection and also clotting.</p>
<p>Regarding pulsatile vs continuous flow - no one knows for sure. However, it has been shown that continuous flow can lead to more stiffening of blood vessels which is one theory behind why so many patients with LVADs have kidney failure later (but of course, the alternative is death relatively sooner).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer - no, it can work.</p>
<p>With a lot of the early work on artificial hearts and assist devices it was assumed that blood flow had to be pulsatile - which makes sense given the use of stretch receptors in a lot of places to monitor pressure.</p>
<p>However due to elasticity and resistance of the vessels, by capillary level a lot of the pulsatility has gone.</p>
<p>In the end this was solved by people making artificial hearts and assist devices which aren't pulsatile, and there are people walking around with them today.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look up LVAD. They are cool to look at, but if you need to be on one you’re in really, really bad shape. </p>
<p>I did read some interesting things related to artificial hearts in one of my wife’s many medical journals that she gets. From an engineering standpoint, something with chambers that pump like an actual heart is much, much better. Other systems that would rely on blades to keep blood flowing damages cells and there’s the risk of buildup of cells on the blades. </p>
<p>Edit: Sorry; LVAD was mentioned in another comment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, is a device that removes deoxygenated blood from the body and turns it into oxygenated blood via a huge pump and then returns it back to the body. In lay terms, long term heart and lung bypass. There are two kinds, VA and VV ECMO. VA or veno-arterial uses the venous system and the arterial system and can provide cardiac support; both the heart and lungs can rest while this pump does all the work. Then there's VV or veno-venous; it returns blood to venous system and provides no cardiac support, mainly for lungs to rest.</p>
<p>I work at a children's hospital and we use ECMO in all three of our ICUs, the NICU, PICU, and CICU or cardiac.</p>
<p>Wiki for general info. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal_membrane_oxygenation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal_membrane_oxygenation</a></p>
<p>Not sure if this answers the question of if we need a heart beat, but if capable, people can walk on ECMO and don't need to be restricted to a bed but obviously do need to be in hospital. LVADs I believe can be used outside of hospitals, people can go home with those.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
