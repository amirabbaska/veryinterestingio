<blockquote>
<p>It has large black, hairy, pads on its feet that look like baboon feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://animal-world.com/encyclo/reptiles/spiders/KingBaboonSpider.php" target="_blank">Another source</a> has the line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The King Baboon Spider [...] It has enlarged back legs as do most of its baboon spider relatives. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it seems likely it's just about the way their back legs and feet look... And it probably just caught on after the first person decided to start using the phrase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing to keep in mind is that these are vernacular names, in English. They are not the taxonomic names for the various species. For example, <em>Pelinobius muticus</em> is simply referred to as the &quot;King Baboon Tarantula&quot; in English-speaking countries, including Kenya and Tanzania where it is often found.</p>
<p>There are a number of theories regarding why &quot;baboon&quot; was included, but as you're really asking about the etymology of non-scientific terms, that isn't surprising. </p>
<p>The theory that often gets repeated (I had two professors repeat it in separate classes) is that many species of tarantula have legs that are reminiscent of a baboon's fingers. And many certainly do, when you compare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone else already posted the reason(s) for the name 'Baboon', but don't forget those are common names, not the scientific ones.
Also the only tarantula species with this suffix are African species. Nowhere else people call them that. Because of this I've heard people in Africa even claiming they are not tarantula, but another family of spiders. Which is just bollocks as far as I know. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget too, that vernacular names are often given based on characteristics that have nothing to do with how related things actually are.  I'm into snakes.  Old World Rat Snakes and New World Rat Snakes are both called Rat Snakes, because they're big and sometimes eat rats.  And in the past it was thought they are related, but turns out they're not so much.  So the New World Rat Snakes got a different genus name.  Then it turned out several of the Old World Rat Snakes were different too.  They got their own genus name.  So what all used to be <em>Elaphe</em> are now <em>Elaphe, Pantherophis, Orthriophis</em> and several others.  Those names changed to reflect their evolutionary relationships, but the English didn't.  They are all Rat Snakes.  </p>
<p>It could be something like that, where any large hairy tarantula was called a Baboon Tarantula, regardless of scientific name changes happening later.  I don't know specifically if this sort of thing actually happened among tarantulas, but it has happened with other groups of animals and is a possibility.</p>
<p>Also among spider culturists (arachoculturists maybe?) even the English names have changed somewhat, and they have little nicknames for certain types, OBT for example (&quot;Orange Bitey Thing&quot; refers to a number of difficult to identify, typically agressive, orange colored spiders), Pokies for the Poecilatheria, (The oe should be pronounced like in Coelacanth, but the hobby doesn't seem to be aware of this,) etc.  But an awful lot of spiders still have old fashioned Baboon related names.  (If you want a real challenge try to learn all of the different Brachopelma without reference to scientific name.  They are all Blankety Central American Country, Red-orange-brick, body part, Tarantualas.  Mexican Red Rump, Mexican Red Knee, Chilean Rose Haired, etc.  You'll learn to speak science in no time.) </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
