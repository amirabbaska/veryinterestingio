<p>&quot;I'll never forget the day that everything tadted like tofu.  Everything tasted like nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>Source, wife who went through chemo last year. </p>
<p>Tastebuds are fast turnover cells that regenerate and die quickly.  Chemo kills the tastebuds before they can develop and mature.  What taste you lose is specific to you individually.    </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Haven’t experienced it myself, but I thought they purposefully gave abnormal/weird tasting foods to chemo patients because patients start to associate their shitty nauseous feeling with what they ate and they don’t want patients to develop an aversion to normal foods. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Huh... I find this interesting....</p>
<p>My dad was just diagnosed, and one of the reasons was he said everything tastes terrible to him. He went from eating like royalty all the time, to only wanting beefaroni, and oatmeal.</p>
<p>The doctor said the cancer can release enzymes that change the way food tastes, but once the chemo starts he will be back to normal.</p>
<p>How is that possible? Can someone explain that?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Chemo doesn't really discriminate in what it kills.  It just kind of kills everything.</p>
<p>So your brain gets damaged.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
