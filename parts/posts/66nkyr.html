		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most popular theory blames the drop in atmospheric pressure that accompanies rain. Think of it like blowing up a balloon. There’s inside air pushing out, and outside air pushing in. Atmospheric pressure is always pushing on our bodies in a similar way. If the pressure outside of the body drops, gasses inside the body can expand, particularly the gasses dissolved in the fluid surrounding your joints and tendons.</p>
<p>Now consider your injury. Think about pain as nerves that have been irritated. Somehow they didn’t heal right, or they might be inflamed. That expansion of fluid around your damaged Achilles might be microscopic, but it can really trigger these nerve endings by putting additional pressure on them, causing pain.</p>
<p>As for the temperature, the theory goes like this: cold may cause muscles to tense up, and that contraction can also aggravate those damaged nerves.</p>
<p>Long story short: A drop in atmospheric pressure may trigger an increase in the pressure of your body’s fluids on damaged nerves, causing pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Changes in barometric pressure can affect old injuries by exerting more/less force on the injury site.  It isn't a big enough difference for most of us to notice but with someone with an injury it is possible to aggravate it slightly.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a doctor but this is a personal opinion, rather than evidence based science. There are theories about atmospheric pressure, etc, however, I believe that the main reason why joints (and injures) hurt more with weather changes is because cold weather makes your muscles tighter, thus adding pressure to the joints. Heat relaxes the muscles (increasing blood flow to the tissues), so the joints move more easily. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer - we don't know why.  We don't even know for sure if it does, or if its some sort of confirmation bias / Baader-Meinhoff phenomenom.</p>
<p>Interesting answer - there is a current study underway to try to see if it really does exist.  See this <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-39555462" target="_blank">BBC News</a> story.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before we try to explain this phenomenon, is there a reason to believe it is real and not just confirmation bias? A lot of people probably notice when their pain coincides with bad weather, but don't give it a second thought when the weather is fine and they still have pain, or when the weather is bad, but they are pain free.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
