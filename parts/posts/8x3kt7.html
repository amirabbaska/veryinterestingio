		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, when somebody claims to be double-jointed they are referring to having unusually flexible joints. </p>
<p>Double-jointedness can also refer to Joint Hypermobility Syndrome which generally results from abnormally shaped ends of one or more bones at a joint, or a Type 1 collagen or other connective tissue defect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can control every joint in my body and &quot;dislocate them&quot;. Everyone calls them double jointed, but it's simply that the ligaments are allowing the bones to move out of its typical position. In my case it's tied to a genetic thing that starts with a D and I can't remember what it's called. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
