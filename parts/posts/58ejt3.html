		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all boils down to obsidian's atomic bonding energy verses that of metal and how these values compare to the materials' free surface energies. </p>
<p>Think of it this way:</p>
<p>There's a really strong wind storm and two, separate groups of people are caught outside: a group of children and a group of powerlifters. In each group, everyone is holding onto each as to not get blown away. Obviously, the people on the outside of the groups are the most vulnerable because less people are around them and able to hold onto them. </p>
<p>The powerlifters are like the atoms within obsidian - strongly holding onto each other and unwilling to bend. In order to not be blown away, those on the outer perimeter only need the help of one other person. The grip strength of these guys is so strong that their group can form an arrow with only one person positioned at the point, holding onto just one other guy. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the children are like metal atoms. The children on the outer perimeter of their group need to be held onto by at least three other kids in order to avoid being blown away because their grip strength is much weaker than that of the powerlifters'. So, if this group tries to form an arrow, the arrow's tip will have to be composed of several children (instead of one) - effectively blunting the tip. </p>
<p>The second thing to consider is the flexibility of these groups. The powerlifters are all about gainz and rarely stretch. Therefore, if an unusually strong gust of wind hits the group of lifters, their arms will only be able to stretch a small amount before the lifters just let go. This is comparable to how obsidian breaks; it cleaves and forms sharp edges. </p>
<p>Conversely, the kids are very flexible. When that strong gust of wind hits them, they're able to stretch and bend a lot, instead of completely letting go. Rather than breaking cleanly, their group will deform in order to accommodate the strong force. </p>
<p>Hope this helps and at least one person sees it!</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I appreciate the gold! I'm glad that everyone was able to enjoy this. It was a lot of fun to think about!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of good comments but I'd like to add a bit more science if possible ( I know it's ELI5 but I like the subject so have this).</p>
<p>Obsidian can achieve a thinner edge because of its ionic bonds and amorphous structure. Not only are these bonds very rigid, but they are very stable and require but a few atoms, but they will not easily allow the reactions to change the atomic structure.</p>
<p>Metal on the other hand is held together by metallic bonds (i know it sounds silly but it basically means metal atoms share electrons to be somewhat stable so there needs to be a lot of the them together) and has a crystalline lattice. So even if a metal were to be sharpened to be as thin as an obsidian edge, it would not be stable or it would corrode almost instantly (high surface energy is unfavorable).</p>
<p>Tldr: obsidian can &quot;easily&quot; have a few bonded atoms, metals cannot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Obsidian is a type of glass which has no crystal structure as opposed to iron which has a crystal structure. A glass is a material that doesn't have an order to it. Pure iron's structure at room temperature is a variation of a cube. This cube is repeated, like minecraft blocks, for &quot;infinity&quot; whereas glass might have a cube but they're angled and positioned every which way, and sometimes not even cube shaped. </p>
<p>Now imagine a knife made of minecraft blocks. Or just the minecraft sword where you can see the jagged edge because the cubes have to remain cubes and fit almost perfectly with each other. This is like iron where the edge is relatively rough even though it looks smooth to the naked eye. Because glass doesn't have a structure, its &quot;cubes&quot; can stretch and align themselves however they want, which would look like how smooth a fine-blade knife would on the microscale. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Obsidian -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels.
At 30 angstroms -- a unit of measurement equal to one hundred millionth of a centimeter -- an obsidian scalpel can rival diamond in the fineness of its edge.
When you consider that most household razor blades are 300 to 600 angstroms, obsidian can still cut it with the sharpest materials nanotechnology can produce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
