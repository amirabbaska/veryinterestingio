		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well I caught this one way to late so this will be buried but here ya go. I was chef of a very large expensive Manhattan restaurant for several years. I am speaking specifically of tuna. The fish is graded by the wholesaler who buys the fish at auction or by contract at wholesale markets. There is no legal definition BUT we pay higher price for higher grade tuna. It is graded on size, texture, fat content (by appearance), and color. Now believe me, if my wholesaler sells me grade A tuna that isn't up to my sushi chef standards he is gonna hear about it and I'm gonna replace him before the end of the business day. Everyone is working off of professional reputation and any breakdown along the way, whether by fishmonger, chef, or wholesaler will be very detrimental to business. Grade B tuna isn't any less fresh and A grade isn't any safer</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to US regulations, fish that spawn in fresh water must be frozen for a period of time in order to reduce parasite risk (eg salmon for a period of 48hrs).  Tuna does not need to be frozen, you could slice that thing up for sashimi right after you caught it if you want.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong but I believe that sushi grade fish has to be held below a certain freezing temperature for a certain length of time to make sure that parasites are killed and that it's safe to eat raw.</p>
<p>Edit: Found a great serious eats article about it:
<a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/05/how-to-prepare-raw-fish-at-home-sushi-sashimi-food-safety.html" target="_blank">https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/05/how-to-prepare-raw-fish-at-home-sushi-sashimi-food-safety.html</a></p>
<p>So the article states that &quot;sushi grade&quot; is just marketing, but the FDA does have guidelines for fish that are to be eaten raw which specify keeping fish super frozen for a certain length of time to kill parasites.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
