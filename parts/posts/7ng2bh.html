<p>edit: A guy tries this in <a href="https://youtu.be/XjTj-tGPSWE?t=199" target="_blank">this video</a>, you can see that the drone starts moving &quot;backwards&quot; as the car starts moving and &quot;fowards&quot; when it stops (at 4:12) even though the guy is trying to hover it in one place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Would this be any different than tossing a ball straight up and down in a school bus? You toss it up and it comes straight down. If the bus speeds up, slows down or turns, the ball veers off accordingly. I think the drone would behave the same way, lacking any influence from wind resistance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the vehicle is starting from a dead stop and the drone is at a stable, stationary hover, the drone would most likely move to the rear of the car once the vehicle accelerates.</p>
<p>If the drone is not flying, but the car is moving at a steady velocity, the drone would ascend straight up if the directional controls are neutral.  There would be no need to compensate for the vehicle's velocity if there is nothing such as open windows causing turbulent air inside the car.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the drone! There are 3 &quot;main&quot; types of drone &quot;augmentation&quot; systems, Gyroscope, Accelerometer and GPS. All of these <em>can</em> be equipped with optical tracking, but we'll get to that later (it's also usually only done on high-end drones, meaning GPS is standard).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gyroscope Stabilized: Will accelerate somewhat with the car.</strong> A gyroscope tracks the rate of change in rotation. It can tell the drone if it is turning, or if it's <em>rotation</em> is non-changing. However, it cannot get a <em>bearing</em>, meaning everything is done from a reference point, usually when the propellers are engaged. These have to be started from a level surface, and will drift over time, meaning the angle the computer considers &quot;level&quot; will change and eventually the drone will be holding a steady sideways flight. They are also very cheap, typically &lt;$50 childrens toys and almost never have camera systems. This drone will simply keep itself level in the car. The air in the car will move with the car, so it'll effectively act as wind pushing against the drone, edging it forwards, but it won't &quot;grab&quot; the drone 100% (the wind will slip) so the drone can't match the speed of the car.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Accelerometer Stabilized: Will not accelerate with the car.</strong> An accelerometer can tell the drone which way down is, and in which direction it's <em>accelerating</em>. It's usually combined with a gyro for increased accuracy, but doesn't have to be. When the air in the car pushes air against the drone, the sensor will register that it's getting faster in one direction, and will rotate to counter it, therefore keeping it stable relative to its initial vector (IE: Not moving relative to the ground).</li>
</ul>
<p>So far, these two methods will end up at the back of an <em>accelerating</em> vehicle. But if you get the vehicle up to speed, they'll hover/fly happily inside the moving car-as long as it doesn't turn, brake or speed up. This is where GPS is different:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GPS: The drone will remain stationary.</strong> Assuming there is a good signal (which it should be, my drone's GPS is accurate enough to track lane changes at 80km/h) the drone will remain in its exact spot over the Earth, regardless of how the car moves. If you somehow launch the drone while the car is moving (which you probably can't, most drones check to see if they're moving before they'll &quot;arm&quot;), it'll brake (relative to Earth) and turn full-tilt towards the back of the car to stop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optical Ground Tracking also throws in a curve-ball, since it'll react differently in many, many circumstances and much depends on how the drone is programmed, and how fast you accelerate. For example, my drone has a threshold of how far off &quot;normal&quot; a sensor can be before it's considered faulty. So if the Optical says &quot;You're moving at 5m/s!&quot; and the GPS and accelerometer say &quot;No, we're not&quot;, the drone will disable the optical tracker and rely only on GPS.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gyro + Optical: Drone will follow both a moving and accelerating car (though I've never seen one with only these two modules)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accelerometer + Optical: Drone will get mad if accelerating. The accelerometer will say &quot;We're getting faster!&quot; and the optical will say &quot;No we're not!&quot; The drone will likely failsafe; and how that goes depends on its programming. If the vehicle is already moving, these two will make an exceptional combination and the drone will be locked to the chassis of the car.</p>
</li>
<li>Accel, GPS + Optical: If accelerating, the accelerometer and the GPS will disagree with the optical. Depending on the &quot;smartness&quot; of the drone, it'll either failsafe or ignore one device. If launched while moving, the GPS will disagree with the Optical and Accelerometer. Again, it likely won't launch.</li>
</ul>
