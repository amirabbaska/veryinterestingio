		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People take for granted how much our brains fill in the blanks visually when we are perfectly sober. The input our brains get from our eyes actually contain a big <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7jpJ12lBjg" target="_blank">blindspot</a>, and a spiderweb of veins that block our vision. Our brains are rather talented at guessing what is there based on what is around those bind spots and what it knows about the world. It happens so seamlessly that we don't even notice. </p>
<p>Ever see something in the corner of your eye like your dog sitting there, but when you look it's just an object that is somewhat the shape of your dog? Your eyes caught some vague shape, your brain guessed that it was your dog based on your expectations, but just happened to be wrong this time.</p>
<p>On LSD, these functions become far less good at their job, but they're still trying to fill in those blanks. Once a white cat came to lay on my chest while I was looking up at the popcorn stucco ceiling, and the ceiling became a kaleidoscope of cat faces. If I focused on any one face, That face disappeared, but my peripheral vision was full of smiling purring kitties covering everything white in the room. <a href="https://artoferickuns.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/dbb70e92b3b9dd88e1a8afd2c4d0c068.jpg" target="_blank">Google Deep Images</a> come very close to conveying what this is like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>LSD and other psychedelics latch onto a receptor sites called &quot;5-HT2a&quot; which affects the neurotransmitter serotonin. LSD in particular effects a lot of other 5-HT (serotonin) receptors and even some dopamine receptors, but 5-HT2a receptor sites, in particular, is what is believed to produce the hallucinogenic effects of psychedelic drugs. These receptors also affect many other functions in your body and some psychedelic drugs (like the 25-NBMOe series which is more selective and a &quot;full 5-HT2A agonist&quot; (means it hugs onto the receptor harder in certain spots)) can cause all sorts of effects beyond hallucinations such hyperthermia, hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, hypertension, clonus, seizures, agitation, aggression, and even death. LSD (and many other psychedelics) for some unknown reason don't cause these effects (which are symptoms of something called serotonin syndrome).</p>
<p>The why behind the hallucinations caused by the 5-HT2a receptors is fairly unknown, but the most popular idea is that stimulation of this receptor causes a &quot;sensory feedback loop&quot;. Normally your brain takes sensory input, such as light entering your eyes, and runs it through a process in one section of your brain (the thalamus) and fed to another part (the cortex) where it is experienced by you as sight. When on a drug like LSD, that sensory input is not just run through the process once, but is fed back to the start of the process and run again and again. This reprocessing of the original sensory data causes distortions that you experience as hallucinations.</p>
<p>tl;dr, your brain is re-processing and distorting data it receives many times before sending it to the place in the brain where you actively experience the data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>LSD style distortions look like the ones you can see from hypno disks like this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooVCvFLbjO0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooVCvFLbjO0</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh man I am so glad for this question because I literally just wrote my thesis about this.</p>
<p>What you consider to be normal vision is already a hallucination. What you &quot;see&quot; is a jumble of very simple shapes. In the human visual area, these shapes are put together in a stage-by-stage process. Certain shapes occurring together will become an assortment of shapes, and certain assortments occurring together become conglomerates of shapes, and conglomerates occurring together become even bigger assortments of shapes, all the way up to actual objects.</p>
<p>In a sense, your entire reality is fabricated, but luckily this fabrication is pretty accurate, but still a fabrication. On LSD, this fabrication progress is in parts broken down and altered. Many of the kaleidoscopes, geometric shapes, fractals, etc. people see, are actually stages of this fabrication process transmitting information repeatedly, or even transmitting &quot;templates&quot; without input. Much of the geometry itself is also a reflection of the structure of the human visual centre itself. The shape of our retina and our eyes is also reflected, and our &quot;blind spot&quot; can become the centre of an endless tunnel or vortex.  </p>
<p>But, LSD also creates another kind of hallucination in another way. By rerouting information from different parts of the brain TO the visual centre, we start to experience hallucinations that are actually representations of different elements of our mind. What we experience as hallucinations, is the visual centre trying to process the information that is routed to it, whichever it may be. </p>
<p>What LSD ultimately shows you is parts of yourself, things that happen in your brain 24/7 but that you ordinarily don't have access to, or direct access to. </p>
<p>If anyone needs sources on specific parts of this (since all this stuff is still quite controversial) please ask.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what we know at the moment your brain basically tries to crosswire a bunch of stuff while the lsd is active.this is the trip, and you can tell if you get synwsthesia see visuals etc. Just your whole brain using all kinds of pathways at once. </p>
<p>The PNS response, (the body response) is kind of akin to a fever but mentally wired. Your sense of temperature is all messed up, so you sweat feel cold etc, and the seratonin surge can make u feel good sometimes. You might get an adrenaline rush, or just everything feels weird to the touch. If you take enough you can surpass a lot of this, to thw point where you are tripping so hard you dont even realize your body anymore, because your so focused on the incredible trip your mind is going through. Fun stuff. Dont bite off more than your brain can chew, some people just flip at that point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
