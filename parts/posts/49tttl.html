From what I'm gathering, there is no center of the universe. How is this possible? I always thought that if something can be measured, it would have to have a center. I know the universe is always expanding, but isn't it expanding from a center point? Or am I not even understanding what the Big Bang actual was?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that you are a beetle walking around on the surface of a balloon <a href="http://i.imgur.com/H3PCWIi.jpg" target="_blank">as shown here</a>. If the balloon was large enough, the curvature would be so small that locally the ground would appear to be flat. Now imagine that this balloon happened to expand. If you now had <a href="http://i.imgur.com/nMManES.jpg" target="_blank">markers the balloon, like a grid</a>, you would see that over time it takes you increasingly longer to make it from one marker to the other. However, if you are sitting on the 2D surface of the balloon, you couldn't pinpoint any origin from which the stretching originated. In fact, because the fabric of the balloon was stretching like a uniform sheet, no matter where you may be on the <em>surface</em> of the balloon, you would see the same stretching going on around you. </p>
<p>This situation is a very good (even if imperfect) analogy for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space" target="_blank">metric expansion of space</a>. To make things even more accurate, let's say that the fabric that is stretching is not wrapped around itself as in a balloon, but instead is a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/kmJ4kFj.png" target="_blank">flat infinite sheet that is expanding in its plane</a>. Just as in the case of the surface of the balloon, no matter where you might be sitting on this sheet, you would see all other points around you moving away from you in exactly the same way. Because over cosmological distances the universe appears to be uniform (or more technically isotropic and homogeneous), we can model its expansion as the stretching of such a sheet. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle" target="_blank">cosmological principle</a> then states that the universe has no center, for the same reason that the surface of the balloon had no center.</p>
<p>edit: I made it more explicit that in the case of the balloon analogy, it is the 2D <em>surface,</em> where it becomes impossible to define the center. I also tried to show the conceptual transition from the balloon analogy to the more accurate model of flat spacetime. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

To find a center of a shape, 3d or 2d, one must first know the boundary of the shape (the &quot;sides&quot;)

On the Universe having a center, everywhere appears to be the centre of the Universe if you're standing there because all the galaxies are moving away from each other.<br />

If you pick any particular dot as your galaxy, no matter which dot you pick it always looks like everything is moving away from you so it would seem you are at the center no matter where you are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If something is spatially infinite, it won't have a center. </p>
<p>Imagine you have a line, extending off to positive and negative infinity. You can mark a point under your feet on it and say 'this is zero' but that doesn't make it the center - the line doesn't care about your choice of coordinates. Someone somewhere else could mark a point under their feet and say that's their zero - no different than what you did.</p>
<p>The same argument holds for a 2D plane, 3D space, or 4D spacetime. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wrote this reply to a post about the big bang, but I think it's still relevant here:</p>
<p>The big bang is one of the most misunderstand and misrepresented things in all of popular science.  Every time a visualization of the big bang is made that depicts it as an explosion with some center point outwards into black nothingness, the world gets a little dumber.   It's a bit on par with evolution being depicted as one creature morphing into another.  It's flat out wrong.</p>
<p>First of all, the your very question makes a huuuge assumption; that the diameter of the universe is 93 billion light years.  The truth is, we don't know how large the universe is; that's just the size of the <strong>observable</strong> universe.  The universe itself might be infinite in size, it's just that the 93 billion light years bit is just how much we can see.</p>
<p>If you're like most people, you're probably imagining the big bang as an explosion from some center point in space.  If so, I'm sure one questions immediately pop up; if the universe is infinitely large, how did matter move an infinite amount of distance from that point to where it is today?  Nothing can go faster than light, and infinity distance in 14 billion years is clearly faster than light.  So what gives?</p>
<p>Well, the big bang didn't happen from a center point; it happened everywhere, it's just that &quot;everywhere&quot; had a different meaning then than it does today.</p>
<p>First analogy; imagine there's a field that goes off to infinity in every direction.  On this field is an infinite number of people, all pressed together such that nobody can move.  It's hot, sweaty, and smelly.  But then one day, this infinite amount of land starts expanding.  It expands equally in every direction, so that now every single person has a ton of breathing room.  There's still an infinite field and an infinite number of people, but now the ratio between field and people is much larger.</p>
<p>This is essentially the big bang.  Infinite space, infinite particles, but the ratio between space and particles used to be infinitely low.  Then in a tiny fraction of a second that ratio ballooned until suddenly there was a lot of space for every particle.</p>
<p>The next question that follows is &quot;If space was infinite in every direction, what did it expand into?&quot;  and for that question I have a second analogy:</p>
<p>Imagine a globe.  On that globe, pick any two longitudes (vertical lines).  You'll notice that as you trace those two lines from the north pole towards the equator, they &quot;expand&quot; away from each other; only, as they expand, no new lines are being created.  Every single longitude goes from the north pole to the equator, yet every longitude also expands away from each other as they go.  How does that work?</p>
<p>Well, the answer is that the very definition of distance between any two longitudes is dependent on its distance from the north pole.  That means saying something &quot;is as long as the distance between 45 degrees east and 50 degrees east&quot; is meaningless unless you also know its distance from the north pole.</p>
<p>The universe is much the same, except instead of needing to know the distance from the north pole you need to know the amount of time that has passed since the big bang.  Hence, if you said something was &quot;as long as the distance between Arbitrary Point In Space A and Arbitrary Point In Space B&quot;, that too would be meaningless unless you also knew &quot;and X seconds after the big bang&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
