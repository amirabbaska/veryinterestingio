Assume that heat is never an issue because it's sufficiently cooled and that its undervolted like most miners do. What kind of &quot;wear and tear&quot; is applied to the GPU and ram chips through constant use?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, especially modern ones, and it is becoming increasingly problematic. Modern transistors aren't very durable, and they degrade over time (they always have, but that degradation has accelerated). You'll find that a stable undervolted card likely won't stay stable at that voltage for long. How long is a matter of manufacturing variation. Could be months, could be years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a lot. GPUs are built to run at the temperatures they do. The greatest wear and tear on a GPU is done by the rapid temperature swing caused by turning off and on. You can cool it while it's in use, but when it turns off it's a lot cooler than when it's on. Can't avoid that, other than never or rarely turning it off.</p>
<p>For that reason, GPS from miners are usually quite a good deal. Just make sure you replace the fan. That's the part that wears down the most. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
