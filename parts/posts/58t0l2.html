		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know we can induce visual experiences in people who already have a functional visual system, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwOoqkLwL40" target="_blank">for example, in this subject</a>, or those who had a functional visual system but lost some functionality due to disease or injury. However what I am unaware of, is if it's possible to induce visual experiences in individuals who have been blind from birth, e.g. those that have no eyes, via stimulating or inducing the relevant activity in their brain. </p>
<p>Edit: The majority of responses seem to be missing the point of my question. Perhaps I was not specific enough. The question I was getting at is, what is necessary for the having of a visual experience? It is often said that we don't &quot;see&quot; with the eyes because for example one can have visual experiences by stimulating the visual cortex. So from that type of finding it would seem the necessary components, e.g. the neural circuitry, for inducing visual experiences are in the cortex. If that were the case, then in theory it should be possible to create the relevant activity, either by continued stimulation directly to the cortex to create the right circuitry which would then allow for the right kind of activity, or by stimulating the circuitry that is already there, to mimic the activation pattern that is taken to be the necessary component in the generation of a particular visual experience. That is why I asked if we can induce visual experiences in someone who has been blind from birth by stimulating their brain (should have specified cortex). Because if we can, then we really can discount pre-cortical processing in being necessary for the generation of visual experiences. This might prove to be more of a technical issue, especially <a href="http://www.nature.com.sci-hub.bz/nrn/journal/v17/n5/pdf/nrn.2016.22.pdf" target="_blank">as we don't yet</a> have a detailed account of the activity that is at least sufficient to generate a visual experience. However, if it isn't possible to induce visual experiences directly in the cortex, in the absence of external input through the pathway of the retina -&gt; LGN etc., then pre-cortical processing might play a bigger role than is currently thought.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vision is a complex process and any part of the chain being broken can cause blindness. If the blind person suffers from an optical nerve or an eye dysfunction, the visual area in the brain is probably functional albeit not as developed as a normal person, then yes. </p>
<p>On the other hand, for someone who is unable to process the electric signal brought in by the optical nerve, they certainly couldn't &quot;see&quot; even by electrical stimulation of the appropriate area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is an excellent book called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Anthropologist_on_Mars" target="_blank">An Anthropologist on Mars</a> by Oliver Sacks containing several essays about neurological case studies. One of them is about a man who, had lost his sight while very young, had it restored. He exhibited a number of issues processing the information. For example, he had great difficulty in recognizing his dog from moment to moment. If he looked at his dog, and was told that it was his, he was OK. If he looked away and then looked back after the dog changed positions, he could not recognize the dog any more. He had difficulties with depth perception that made it hard for him to judge whether an object (the wall for example) was several feet away from him or inches away.</p>
<p>It's a great book and I highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in some of the more odd ways that our brains can work, not work, and work its way around problem areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oliver Sacks, in one of his typically marvelous books, describes the case of an adult man who was blind from birth.  The details of his blindness were such that a (new and fairly controversial) surgery could reconnect his eyes to his brain.  His visual cortex was now receiving full information.  (I'm obviously glossing over details, both because Sacks doesn't go into the gory details and because it's been a while since I read all this.). </p>
<p>The upshot was, although the man was now receiving visual stimulus, he had no way to interpret what he was &quot;seeing&quot;.  For example, he couldn't understand that a small signal in the visual field could be either a small object close or a large object far away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A person blind from birth given visual images through brain stimulation would experience a confusing flood of stimulation that he would no references for. He likely wouldn't recognize it as sight nor associate with his eyes. A person blind from birth has a sense of what things &quot;look like&quot; through having touched, handled, and examined many objects, but the is no mapping between this touch information and visual information. We experience thing very differently through sight than we do through touch. Sight, for one thing, is essentially two dimensional â€“ we have to learn how depth is represented visually before we can perceive it, while touch is very three dimensional.</p>
<p>A blind person given sight sees a confusing patchwork of colour, luminosity, and movement that is entirely different from his learned ways of perceiving the would. <a href="http://timothyquigley.net/vcs/sacks-seeing.pdf" target="_blank">This</a> is an interesting excerpt of an account by Oliver Sacks regarding a 50 year old man who had been blind for 45 years and had his sight restored with surgery. <a href="http://powers.media.mit.edu/wiki/upload/MindsEye.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is another article written by Oliver Sacks on the subject.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You should read the book Incognito by David Eagleman. It's basically about how your brain works under the hood. Definitely a recommended read. Anyway, he describes devices which serve to substitute your sense of vision. One of them works by delivering image data as small vibrations to your back, and the other fits on your tongue and delivers small electric shocks. In both cases, the patients slowly learn to interpret the strange stimuli as visual information, and can navigate themselves/avoid obstacles/recognize faces.</p>
<p>There's even one rock climber using the back vibration device in his climbs, so I guess it's fairly possible, or even easier to simulate vision by directly stimulating the brain itself. Our brains are very plastic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
