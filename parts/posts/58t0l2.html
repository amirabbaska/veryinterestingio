		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know we can induce visual experiences in people who already have a functional visual system, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwOoqkLwL40" target="_blank">for example, in this subject</a>, or those who had a functional visual system but lost some functionality due to disease or injury. However what I am unaware of, is if it's possible to induce visual experiences in individuals who have been blind from birth, e.g. those that have no eyes, via stimulating or inducing the relevant activity in their brain. </p>
<p>Edit: The majority of responses seem to be missing the point of my question. Perhaps I was not specific enough. The question I was getting at is, what is necessary for the having of a visual experience? It is often said that we don't &quot;see&quot; with the eyes because for example one can have visual experiences by stimulating the visual cortex. So from that type of finding it would seem the necessary components, e.g. the neural circuitry, for inducing visual experiences are in the cortex. If that were the case, then in theory it should be possible to create the relevant activity, either by continued stimulation directly to the cortex to create the right circuitry which would then allow for the right kind of activity, or by stimulating the circuitry that is already there, to mimic the activation pattern that is taken to be the necessary component in the generation of a particular visual experience. That is why I asked if we can induce visual experiences in someone who has been blind from birth by stimulating their brain (should have specified cortex). Because if we can, then we really can discount pre-cortical processing in being necessary for the generation of visual experiences. This might prove to be more of a technical issue, especially <a href="http://www.nature.com.sci-hub.bz/nrn/journal/v17/n5/pdf/nrn.2016.22.pdf" target="_blank">as we don't yet</a> have a detailed account of the activity that is at least sufficient to generate a visual experience. However, if it isn't possible to induce visual experiences directly in the cortex, in the absence of external input through the pathway of the retina -&gt; LGN etc., then pre-cortical processing might play a bigger role than is currently thought.</p></div></div>
