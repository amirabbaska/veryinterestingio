<p>The system can reproduce many of the key quantum mechanical phenomena including single and double slit interference, tunneling, quantization, and multi-modal statistics. These experiments draw attention to pilot wave theories like those of de Broglie and Bohm that postulate the existence of a guiding wave accompanying every particle. It is an open question whether dynamics similar to those seen in the oil droplet experiments underly the statistical theory of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Derek (/u/Veritasium) will be around to answer questions, as well as Prof. John Bush (/u/ProfJohnBush), a fluid dynamicist from MIT.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The last video clip is absolutely stunning, where the droplet  apparently retraces its path backward, &quot;erasing&quot; its previous wavetrain. Cannot this effect be thought of as a kind of spatial analog to the Feynman–Stueckelberg interpretation which states that antiparticles are simply regular particles traveling backward in time?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi /u/Veritasium and /u/ProfJohnBush! I recently worked in Emmanuel Fort's team with Stéphane Perrard in Paris, France. I released a couple weeks ago a two-part video on bouncing droplets and dual walkers, I thought you might be interested in watching them: <a href="https://youtu.be/MP-NZ5EoTm4" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/MP-NZ5EoTm4</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/tLOIPNqIMnI" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/tLOIPNqIMnI</a>. They feature many of the shots you used in your own video, so we have the same base material, but our goal was more of an art-science project. So it complements nicely your video – and it's quite a fun experience to see research I've actually worked on featured on your channel! Keep up the great work, and thanks for inspiring me to do outreach too! :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My QM is very rusty.</p>
<p>Will pilot wave theory always just be an interpretation or is there a real gap with the potential to be filled by pilot waves? What I mean is that is there any potential for pilot wave theory to disagree with copenhagen on the prediction of experiments that copenhagen has gotten wrong.</p>
<p>I suspect the answer is no, in which case does it really matter what we believe?</p>
<p>I suppose the follow on question is that, outwith the examples given in the video does pilot wave theory even have predictions for many experiments or is it not well developed enough yet?</p>
<p>That said, these droplets are EXTREMELY cool and I love them to bits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
