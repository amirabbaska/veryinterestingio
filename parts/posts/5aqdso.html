<p>The system can reproduce many of the key quantum mechanical phenomena including single and double slit interference, tunneling, quantization, and multi-modal statistics. These experiments draw attention to pilot wave theories like those of de Broglie and Bohm that postulate the existence of a guiding wave accompanying every particle. It is an open question whether dynamics similar to those seen in the oil droplet experiments underly the statistical theory of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Derek (/u/Veritasium) will be around to answer questions, as well as Prof. John Bush (/u/ProfJohnBush), a fluid dynamicist from MIT.</p></div></div>
