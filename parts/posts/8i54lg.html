		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you took two bar magnets and pushed their positive ends together. It would take energy to do so right? If you then took your hands away that they would push apart releasing that energy, </p>
<p>The center of atom is somewhat like that. You have positively charged particles called protons. Just like the ends of the magnets they want to repel each other, but something called the Strong Nuclear Force holds them together. For this to happen though the protons have to be close together. Getting them close together takes energy just like pushing the ends of magnets together takes energy. </p>
<p>To split an atom you have to get the protons far enough apart that the Strong Nuclear Force can't hold them together anymore. When you do that the energy that went into getting them close together is released. </p>
<p>If you just split one atom that's not going to release that much energy. However, with certain special atoms, like certain types of Uranium, when you split them they shoot out lots of particles. Those particles can then cause other atoms to split. This is what is called a chain reaction. Each atom causes more to split and those in turn cause even more to split. When that happens slowly you have a nuclear reactor. When it happens quickly you have a nuclear explosion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A single Uranium atom cannot cause an explosion. However, if you hit it with a neutron, then the atom will <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nc0wCrkk00" target="_blank">undergo a few reactions</a> and split into two smaller atoms. These two atoms require less energy to keep the nucleus together (thanks /u/Luminum__), so the now extra energy gets released.</p>
<p>To get an explosion, you need a certain mass of Uranium. It must be the right kind (isotope) that is &quot;reactive&quot; enough. This is called enriched Uranium. When you &quot;clump&quot; together a certain mass of enriched Uranium, you get a chain reaction: one atom releases two (or three) neutrons, which will hit two other atoms, which will release four neutrons, and so on. You detonate the reaction in a big, strong casing to avoid spreading your Uranium all over before the reaction gets strong enough to cause a large boom.</p>
<p>That's what happens in a fission bomb. Of course, not all neutrons will hit other atoms, and not every atom will go under fission. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy" target="_blank">Little Boy</a>, the bomb that was detonated over Hiroshima, had 64&nbsp;kg of Uranium. It is estimated that less than one kilo went under reaction. However, notice that one gram of Uranium contains a ridiculously large number of atoms (about  2,500,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PS:</strong> a lot of people are mentioning E=MC^2, and there's a lot to say about it. I'll keep it short and say just that the energy released is not 1 kg of Uranium times the speed of light squared. That would be the case, for example, of matter/anti-matter reaction, when the entirety of the atom is released as energy, which doesn't happen in atomic bombs. For more details and more precise explanations, read the tens of replies I received.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>edit:</strong> as requested, a follow-up question: What would have happened if all 64 kg of Uranium went under reaction? According to the guys at r/AskScience who actually know this stuff (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3xyjqe/how_powerful_would_the_little_boy_atomic_bomb/" target="_blank">source</a>), the explosion would be &quot;only&quot; about 58 times stronger. It's a big boom, but we actually have made much stronger bombs than this.</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> I know there are a few imprecisions in this reply. A few are on purpose. I know just having Uranium above the critical mass is not enough for an explosion, but I don't know the subject enough to explain in an ELI5 way the detonation process. I have no understanding of the concept of &quot;fissible atom&quot;, so I just glossed over and said &quot;reactive enough&quot;. It was an attempt, and I'm surprised ane happy it was well-received. If you'd like to point mistakes please give me an ELI5 and I'll amend the answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called &quot;nuclear binding energy.&quot; You can take an atom and look at its nucleus and see how many protons and neutrons it is made up of. We know the mass of protons and neutrons, so you can count the number of protons and number of neutrons and calculate how much mass the nucleus should have.</p>
<p>But, if you were to measure the nucleus as a whole, you would find that the total mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of its constituent parts! Where did that mass go? Well, it turned into that nuclear energy (as per E = mc^(2)).</p>
<p>But, this binding energy is different for each atom and it is why both fusion and fission can release energy.</p>
<p>Starting with hydrogen and moving up, atomic nuclei bind more strongly, meaning more mass is &quot;lost.&quot; So if you were to take two deuterium atoms (hydrogen atoms plus a neutron each) and fuse them into a helium atom, you'd find that the mass of the helium nucleus is less than that of the sum of the individual deuterium nuclei. This lost mass is released as energy.</p>
<p>But, once you get to iron, this trend stops and reverses somewhat. If you take a very large atom, like Uranium, and split it into smaller atoms like Krypton and Barium, you'll find that the mass of the original Uranium nuclei is <em>more</em> than the sum of the masses of the Krypton and Barium nuclei and you lose mass by splitting it. Again, this lost mass is released as energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: There is an optimum number of protons and neutrons in an atom to be most strongly bound (like iron). Uranium is far from this optimum, thus when splitting it into smaller pieces (by e.g. a neutron), these pieces are closer to optimum, and the difference in binding energy is released. A nuclear explosion is this happening to many U-235 atoms in a chain reaction when neutrons released in one uranium split are splitting further uranium atoms.</p>
<p>OK so let me try. I try to be simple, but can't promise short.</p>
<p>Atoms consist of protons (positively charged) and neutrons (no charge). These together are called &quot;nucleons&quot;. Nucleons are bound together by the so-called &quot;strong interaction&quot;, a &quot;glue&quot; which acts only over small distances, i.e. imagine all nucleons are only bound to their immediate neighbors, as if they were literally glued together. So the binding force is roughly proportional to the volume of the nucleus, or the total number of nucleons (a.k.a. &quot;mass number&quot; of an isotope).</p>
<p>There are multiple things that counteract this binding force.
1) The protons have similar charge and thus they repel eachother (all of them repel all other ones). The more protons, the increasingly stronger the force trying to break the atom apart. The higher the charge (or &quot;atomic number&quot;) the stronger the protons try to break the nucleus apart. </p>
<p>2) Since the &quot;glue&quot; only acts over small distances, nuclei at the surface of the nucleus are less bound (they only have neighbors on one side) and so the larger the fraction of nuclei at the &quot;surface&quot;, the less bound the atom is. As the atoms grow larger this fraction gets smaller (more fully bound nuclei inside) and thus getting bigger makes this effect weaker.</p>
<p>3) For reasons which I cannot explain in ELI5 fashion (feel free to help), the more close the number of protons and neutrons is to eachother, the more bound the nucleus is. Similarly, and even number of protons and neutrons is better than having an odd number of any of these. So 2+2 is more stable than 1+1, 3+3 or 2+3 in either combination. 3+3 is more stable than 2+3, etc.</p>
<p>Combining all of these is the &quot;liquid drop&quot; or Bethe-Weizsacker model of the nucleon. (go to wikipedia). </p>
<p>Small nucleons have too few fully bound nuclei (almost all of them are on the surface). If one goes larger to increase this bindig force, also the splitting force (number of protons) grows. One can try to compensate for this by adding just more neutrons. It turns out we need more than 1 neutron for any extra proton, which then increases the asymmetry, destabilizing again. For any number of protons there is an optimum number of neutrons, these are the stable isotopes of the elements.</p>
<p>Large enough deviations from the local optimum (that is an optimum number of neutrons for a given number of protons) is the root cause of spontaneaous nuclear decay, a.k.a. radioactivity. Nucleons either expell a part of them (2 protons + 2 neutrons at once -&gt; alpha decay); or convert a neutron to proton or vica versa (beta decay). The excess energy is released in the form of a gamma photon.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the most bound atoms are the mid-sized ones such as e.g. Iron. Therefore uniting (fusing) small atoms into mid-sized ones makes the bond stronger. Similarly, splitting ultra-large atoms (like in uranium fission) into smaller ones also makes the bond stronger. In either case the excess binding energy is released. The first process drives the stars (and the Sun) while the latter powers nuclear reactors and drives the atomic bomb. Fission and fusion are not the same as radioactivity.</p>
<p>Uranium is special, because it has so many excess neutrons (total of 235 or 238, to compensate for its 92 protons) that when it splits, it also emits more than 1 extra neutron. These neutrons can split further uranium atoms, leading to a chain reaction under appropriate circumstances (geometry, isotope composition). A nuclear explosion is an uncontrolled, exponentially growing chain reaction, which leads to a large number of uranium atoms to split and release the excess binding energy.</p>
<p>Nuclear reactors are designed in a way that for every fission there is exactly 1 neutron that causes another fission. I can explain this too, in a different ELI5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 (using simplifications that are not strictly true but easy to understand): </p>
<p>In atoms, there are protons and electrons. Like magnets, protons and electrons have charges (Protons are positive, electrons are negative.) So they are attracted to each other.</p>
<p>However the way atoms are structured are that protons are stuck to eachother with electrons rotating around them.</p>
<p>Problem: How can protons stick to eachother when they should be repelling eachother due to them being the same charge?</p>
<p>Answer: There is some type of glue binding them together. (Imagine a machine that forces two magnets together, even though they want to repel)</p>
<p>Nuclear fission:</p>
<p>With nuclear fission, we fire at these grouped protons (and neutrons) with stuff, breaking them apart.</p>
<p>When they break apart into smaller,  and seperate groups, they are less magnetically repulsive to each other, so this glue that binds these groups doesn't need to use so much energy. This excess energy is released.</p>
