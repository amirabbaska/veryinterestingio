		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone's explaining adverse possession but, honestly, <em>that almost never happens</em> outside of small chunks at the edge of adjacent properties and, let's be honest, you're not going to call your neighbor a &quot;squatter&quot; because a fence got built a foot on the wrong side of a property line.</p>
<p>What most people mean when they talk about &quot;squatters rights&quot; negatively is the difficulty in kicking out squatters (trespassers) from abandonned property you own.  We're not talking about them being there for years and having a legal claim to ownership, just them there a month or two &amp; resisting eviction.  Ultimately, this is an extension of <em>tenants rights</em>.</p>
<p>Now, if you're renting a place &amp; the owner wants you out, they need to go to court and <strong>evict</strong> you by proving you've somehow violated our lease &amp; need to GTFO.  Because there's a large disparity in power between the involved parties, legally, the tenant gets to stay until the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>People who break into abandoned properties, can use this principle to their advantage.  If the cops show up to kick them out for trespassing, all they need to do is provide a minimal amount of evidence that they <em>might</em> be legal tenants, and they can stay on the property until a full legal eviction proceeding has taken place.</p>
<p>We're not talking about people who've spent <em>years</em> on an abandoned property and own it, we're talking people who have been there weeks/months using legal loopholes to avoid getting trespassed.  It's not really a legally defined right, just a side-effect of protecting legal tenants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, the problem there is not the squatters rights. The problem is the claim of an oral contract. </p>
<p>Imagine if the shoe was on the other foot: The soldier is living in the house, and then some random guy (RG) shows up with a deed, claiming the deed is dated before the soldier's deed and gives RG the right to live there instead. Should the police throw the soldier out before the deed issue is settled?</p>
<p>Second, we have squatters rights because sometimes people buy land and don't use it. Or buy land and lose it in the shuffle of deaths and wills and sales so the land ends up wasted. This was especially problematic in old England, where the rule comes from, since people would buy huge tracts of land and it was hard to know where one property began and another ended.</p>
<p>The idea was that, by allowing people to take possession of the land by use, you encouraged landowners to actually check on their land from time to time, and also prevented the descendants of an absentee landowner from swooping in 100 years later and kicking you out of your house.</p>
<p>It also relates to how the law works. There's a statute of limitations on the action you take to evict someone. (another thing that made sense in the past when paper records got lost or were stolen or forged). You can't even begin to have &quot;squatter's rights&quot; to property until that period lapses, and it's usually 15, 20, or 30 years.</p>
<p>Last, in most places squatters rights are really hard to get, even if you wait out the time. So, for instance, if you are there with permission, you can't get squatter's rights. And, in a lot of places, if you're there illegally (meaning you just moved in rather than, say, got confused about where the property line was between your house and the next guy's house) you can't get squatter's rights no matter what.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>'Squatters rights' means if you're on a property for long enough, even without paying for it, you have some measure of protection against being removed (or claim you do as a defense or justification). You're already there, so you have a 'right' to stay there. It most often applies to rented or empty houses or apartments, but can apply to people staying on private property as well.</p>
<p>The squatter often is not ethically, legally or morally correct in saying they have a right to stay on or in the property, and some squatters really abuse it. There are lots of horror stories about often-destructive squatters, sometimes even home invaders, costing legitimate properly lessors or owners a lot of money, sometimes even denying the owner access to their own property. That's why it's usually a highly negative term. </p>
<p>However there are laws on the books in many countries, often differing within individual states or provinces, that say &quot;if you live there long enough and nobody complains, you can legally claim ownership&quot;. Mexico for example has a 5-year law of this sort. It likely exists because it's better to have a person that owns and is doing something productive with some land than have that land owned but completely unoccupied while homeless people that could use it aren't allowed to.</p>
<p>Sometimes squatters can't simply be immediately and easily removed by legal or government enforcement because there's a process those agencies have to follow that is designed to ensure the request for removal is not just an abusive landlord trying to avoid regulations about tenant removal. And some 'serial squatters' take advantage of loopholes in the law to get free room and board, in the same way some people try and eat for free at restaurants by habitually claiming something was wrong with their meal. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that hasn't really been covered yet is to look at it from the perspective of the government/law enforcement/the courts, and you'll see where tenant's rights/squatter's rights come from.</p>
<p>You have two parties to a dispute over property.  One side says that they are the landowner and nobody should live there; the other side says they are tenants and are legally residents.  A court is going to have to decide who is right and who can prove what they've claimed.</p>
<p>Before the court can see the evidence, something has to be done with the property.  Both sides can't get their way.  So the law has decided that the least bad thing to do in that situation is to allow the people claiming tenancy to remain there.  Yes, it denies the owner use of the property until the court rules, but that is considered less bad than throwing someone out of their residence.</p>
<p>This decision to protect legal tenants from getting thrown out by malicious property owners has the side effect of protecting illegal squatters from getting easily tossed out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without going into the technical details of the law here is an argument why squatters can be a positive contribution to society.</p>
<p>I'll compare it to a car dealership to make it more clear. Car dealers own a building in which they store cars but sometimes they will park a car on a public parking spot. Parking a car there is completly legal and it is OK if there are enough parking spots. Now if a cardealer thinks he can save money on his building and park all his cars on public parking spots then this would push people that actually use parking spots for the intended purpose out. This is not fair but also kind of legal. To avoid this certain rules apply to parking spaces to ensure it's real inteded purpose (providing people with a parking spot) is served instead of the superficial purpose (parking a car). In a city buildings are the cars and the owners the car dealers.</p>
<p>The inteded purpose of a city is creating a living and working environment. Things happening in the city should contribute to this, at least to an extend. If someone buys a lot of properties and leaves them unused the inteded purpose of a city is not served so there are rules in place to avoid this from happening. This is done by giving squatters some rights which forces people to take action to avoid there properties from becomming squats, like renting them out. By doing this the inteded purpose of a city is being served again. So optimally there are no squatters because people avoid there properties from becoming squats. Thus giving squatters rights benefit the middle class people way more than the squatters themselves. This is something often not realised by people who are strongly against squatter rights. They themselves gain from these rights by a more liveable city.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
