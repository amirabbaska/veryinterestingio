		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The advertiser uses a geoIP database to get your location and shows you some carefully picked pictures (that are the same everywhere, except possibly between countries with different distributions of skin colours). </p>
<p>If you click it, it'll ask you a number of (very simple) questions specifically designed to waste a bit of time (yes, I want to meet strangers, that's why I clicked the ad) before either redirecting you to a different, similar site or asking for your credit card information. </p>
<p>The idea is that, having wasted so much time already, some people will decide to just enter their damn CC info. At that point you might have you bank account emptied or just charged a dollar, either way it's unlikely there'll be anyone to meet in your area. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: this is by no means a complete description of the possible consequences. Viruses can also happen. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't a scam per se it is just a deceptive advertising. They want you to sign up for something like a site that hosts cam girls and asks you to pay for shows, or perhaps a sleazy &quot;dating site&quot; that also serves advertisements for porn. The tag line is just a hook to get you to click, they aren't going to drain your bank account or something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clicking will probably just redirect you to a website of dubious legitimacy. Giving them any of your contact info probably makes you a target for spam email and likely attempts to get you to give them money in one form or another (via subscription fees, posting fees, etc.)</p>
<p>I'd assume they spend less time/energy/money targeting females as they are less likely to part with money for the prospect of getting laid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
