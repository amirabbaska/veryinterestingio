It does make sense though, since they probably don't have the digestive systems they once had. So how exactly were they properly brought back to normal weight?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an ideal clinical setting, a person with malnutrition will be monitored very closely for changes in electrolytes. These electrolytes, usually potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium in particular, will probably need to be supplemented. Thiamine (Vitamin B1) should also be supplemented. Fluids should be monitored and may need to be limited at first. When you first start feeding someone that is malnourished, you &quot;start low and go slow,&quot; mainly in regards to carbohydrates which will affect the metabolism of those electrolytes. This process is typically the first few days of feeding a malnourished person. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I got really really sick a while back and lost about 40 pounds, dropping below 100. I'm a 6 foot tall guy, so obviously that's a dangerously unhealthy weight. The key is pacing and content. I was forced to stick to easily digestable food, like oatmeals, toast, soft fruits, rice, stuff like that, and i was basically told &quot;eat until you feel full and then stop.&quot; Then i had to wait a certain time period before i was allowed to eat again, give my body time to digest, and then hopefully next time I ate, I would eat more. It was a slow process, and there was a lot of vomiting involved when I ate too fast or didn't give myself time to digest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called refeeding syndrome. It's not that you can't digest the food, but that your body reacts to the increased calories by making enzymes to break down the food. But you're so malnourished that you don't have the right building blocks so you end up with all sorts of electrolyte disturbances which can cause arrhythmia and stuff.
Basically you have to introduce them to food very slowly, and/or monitor them and replete the electrolytes that they need asap.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Starving kids in African countries are fed Plumpy'nut, which is basically peanut butter with added vitamins and nutrients. They use peanut butter because it's fairly easy to eat, doesn't require a lot of chewing, etc., and peanuts are easy for the body to digest. They also help build up fat quickly, which is necessary for survival in periods of starvation.</p>
<p>So starving people pretty much just have to be introduced to food very slowly, a little bit at a time. Peanut butter or something similar seems to work well, so long as the starving person doesn't eat too much at once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
