		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As /u/leonscottkennedy89 mentioned, the division of the day into 24 hours has its roots in the Egyptian timekeeping system. This was a system of 10 daylight hours, 2 twilight hours, and 12 nighttime hours. The Egyptians used sundials, so dividing the day into 12 units made sense: 12 can be easily divided into 2, 3, 4, or 6 to make a half-day, third-day, quarter-day, or sixth-day periods without the need for fractions. The ancient Babylonians used 60 as their base, likely for similar reasons (it's easily divided by 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, or 12 parts).</p>
<p>Greek astronomers were working off of the Babylonian system for their calculations. The problem with these systems is that the amount of daylight in each day fluctuates throughout the year, which meant that the hours weren't equal throughout the whole day. The astronomer Hipparchus proposed a system using 24 equal hours to standardize the measurements. These systems of equal-length hours wouldn't be popular until the medieval era when mechanical clocks began to simplify timekeeping for the average person.</p>
<p>The Romans used a time system based on 24 hours, 60 minutes, and 60 seconds. This is actually where we get the words <em>minute</em> and <em>second</em> (from Latin terms for the first and second divisions of the hour). These systems remained in use after the fall of the Roman empire, and in the medieval era most of Europe and the Mediterranean were using similar systems. </p>
<p>The European empires spread their time system when they took over new territory, which brought it to the Americas, Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. In the 1800s, formal standards were created to aid international trade and navigation, including the more advanced parts of modern timekeeping like time zones. </p>
<p>We don't have much detail on other ancient time systems, but one notable example is the Chinese Shi-ke system. The Shi-ke system broke down the day both into 12ths called <em>shi</em> and 100ths called <em>ke</em>. In modern units, those would be 120 minutes for shi and 14 minutes, 24 seconds for ke. The ke could be further divided into 60 parts called <em>fen</em>. A shi was 8 ke 20 fen long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having 24 hours in a day comes from ancient Egypt.  They had a 10 hour day (which was based on shadows), 1 hour of twilight in the morning and 1 hour of twilight in the evening, and 12 hours of night (based on star groups).  However, the length of these hours varied throughout the year.</p>
<p>The 60 minutes in an hour and 60 minutes in a day come from the ancient Babylonians.  The Babylonians liked the number 60.</p>

<p>Tl;dr Egypt gave us 24 hour days, Babylon gave us 60 minutes and seconds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

1/3 = 20
1/4 = 15
1/5 = 12
1/6 = 10</p>
