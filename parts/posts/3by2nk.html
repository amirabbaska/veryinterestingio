This post is motivated by the events of today coupled with previous interactions AskScience moderators have had in the past with the reddit staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an issue that has been chronically inadequate for moderators of large subreddits reaching out to the admins over the years. Reddit is a great site with an even more amazing community, however it is frustrating to volunteer time to run a large subreddit and have questions go unacknowledged by the people running the site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not gone private because our team has chosen to keep the subreddit open for our readers, but instead stating our disapproval of how events have been handled currently as well as the past.</p></div></div>
