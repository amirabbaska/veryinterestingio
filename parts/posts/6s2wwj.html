		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An algorithm is just a collection of instructions to do something.  But that's pretty abstract, it's not tied to the specific way its done.  For example there's a maze solving algorithm that goes like this: &quot;Whenever you reach an intersection in the maze, take an unmarked path at random if available, then mark it.  If no unmarked paths are available, take a path with a single mark at random and give it a second mark.  Do not follow any path marked twice.&quot;  This is an algorithm, but its not a program, how you perform it, or how a machine performs it will be different, but you can still all perform it.  </p>
<p>However if you take that algorithm and you write it up in a programming language, to perform that algorithm on a piece of hardware, on a system that can execute that code, then you have a program.  </p>
<p>The algorithm is the logic, the program is how its implemented. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An algorithm is a procedure to accomplish a single task when written out step by step so that it can be followed exactly the same way every time given a set of parameters. It doesn't have to even be digital. The precedure for tying your shoelaces is technically an algorithm. The procedure for determining the square root of a number is an algorithm. </p>
<p>A program is a collection of algorithms written in a machine readable format (e.g. a programming language, that can be compiled down to machine code). Which can do something as simple as print a single letter on a tape drive, or a complicated as processing a string of data from over the internet into a video to be displayed on a monitor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By some definitions, there isn't a difference, but the way the words are usually used:</p>
<p>An algorithm is a method of solving a problem, involving a set of logical/mathematical instructions.</p>
<p>A program is a set of computer instructions that a computer can understand and run.</p>
<p>A program doesn't have to contain any algorithms. For example, the beginner &quot;Hello world&quot; program only displays some words. It doesn't take any input and doesn't solve any problem. If you programmed a basic calculator, it probably wouldn't use anything that a computer scientist would call an &quot;algorithm&quot;, since all it does is arithmetic. There's no special method to adding 2 + 2; the CPU just adds them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an algorithm doesn't have to be done with a computer program. For example, I could teach you how to sort a deck of cards from least to greatest. Flip through the cards one by one, and every time you see a card that is out of order, keep moving it up in the deck until it's in order. Do this at most 51 times and the deck will be sorted. That's an algorithm.</p>
<p>If you wrote a computer program that sorts a virtual deck of cards, then you'd be writing a program that uses an algorithm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you needed to wash your hands, I could give you an algorithm of go to a sink, get some soap, lather up, rinse off the soap and dry your hands.</p>
<p>A program for washing your hands would be something like:</p>
<p>-if you're sitting down at a table, put your hands on your seat and move your seat far enough away from the table to give yourself room to stand up. Then, stand up. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if you're sitting not a table, stand up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you're lying down, put your hands on the ground and push yourself up to a sitting position. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you're sitting on the floor, put your hands on the floor and push yourself forward until you can stand. Then stand up. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are not standing, say something that will make the programmer question every decision they've made in their life. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are standing, determine fastest route to bathroom. </p>
</li>
<li>if you do not know fastest route to bathroom, determine fastest route to leave current room.</li>
</ul>
<p>Etc,etc</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Algorithms are instructions that show humans how to do something.</p>
<p>Programs are instructions that show computers how to do something.</p>
<p>Humans translate algorithms into programs through code. When they make a mistake, that's called a bug. To fix it they have to reverse the translation from code back into an algorithm by using a rubber duck. The programmer then compares what they told the computer to do (program) to what a human told them to do (algorithm), and make adjustments until the two match.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p>You can use a linear search algorithm to find a particular card in a deck of cards by turning each card over one by one until you find the one you were looking for. </p>
<p>If you want a computer to do the same thing you need to translate that algorithm into something a computer can understand, like:</p>
<p>var deck = ['2 clubs', '3 hearts', '9 spades', ... ];
var i = 0;</p>
<p>while (i &lt; deck.length) {
if (deck[i] === '9 spades') break;
i = i + 1;
}</p>
<p>console.log('9 of spades is card number ', i);</p>
