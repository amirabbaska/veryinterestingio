<p>The wheels aren't cylinders, they're cones. The side that has to cover less distance in the turn rides up on the narrower end, so it makes more turns in less distance. Meanwhile, the other end does the same number of turns (solid axel), but since it is larger, it can cover the greater distance in the same number of turns. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Train wheels have conical edges, not flat ones like say a car wheel. When the track turns left, this will cause both wheels to pull rightward. For the right wheel that makes the point of contact with the track a larger circle since it's pulling towards where the cone is broader; for the left wheel the circle gets smaller since it's pulling towards the thinner part of the cone.<br />
Now even though the shaft connecting both wheels spins the same amount, the inner wheel covers less distance than the outer wheel. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Above is a simple diagram of a train axle with wheels either side.
The important bit is the '&lt;' shape of the wheel.</p>
<p>When in a car going around a bend you feel yourself being pushed 'outwards' away from the direction of turn. This is a <em>centrifugal force</em> that always works in the same way.</p>
<p>This exact same force 'pushes' a train outwards as it moves around a bend. The conical shape of the wheels ensures that the circumference of the particular point in contact with the rail  is bigger on the outside(the side you feel you are being pushed against) than on the inside.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The train wheels are not flat like car tyres: they have a conical shape, and this helps keep the train aligned through a process called [coning] (<a href="https://civildigital.com/coning-wheels-railways-theory-purpose/" target="_blank">https://civildigital.com/coning-wheels-railways-theory-purpose/</a>). when a train hits a bend, its inertia forces the wheelset outwards, and then the outer wheel has a larger effective diameter than the inner wheel. This allows the outer wheel to travel further round the outside of the bend. It's not perfect and some slippage can still occur - which increases wear on the wheels but is not fatal, since the wheels have the &quot;lips&quot; to keep them on the tracks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been in the industry for 20 years... Contrary to popular belief the wheel actually steer around curves . There is usually a set of &quot;trucks&quot; that bolster a two axel set . The car body ( of many different types ) sits directly into a &quot;bowl &quot; on the trucks . The bowl has a pin in which the car body pivots and more or less turns while curving. It is a simple act of physics ... Weight distribution and gravity , not any fasteners of any kind ( believe it or not) hold the body of the car to the truck. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
