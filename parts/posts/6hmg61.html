		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I also think it has something to do with sports science, if you compare athletes now and athletes wayy back when they trained for their sport by primarily doing there sport, similar to animals in that they only &quot;train&quot; by doing activities their bodies were meant to do ie. Playing, fighting, hunting never consistently pushing their bodies past their genetic threshold. Where athletes now a days are so scientific with their training they routinely pass the limits their body was made for. Living creatures are all fairly durable when it comes to activities their meant to do. Its when we oass those thresholds that injuries such as blown tendons and things of the sort become much more common.  Dont get me wrong there is exceptions to this as there is with most things im just talking about average people and animals</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Less than with humans. </p>
<p>Our whole upright walking thing is fairly new evolutionarily. Our knees especially aren't very good at responding to the stress of quick (for a human) movements. </p>
<p>Adding on to the problem of bipedal running being new is the fact that selective pressure pretty obviously prioritized long distance walking/running over short distance. We can outrun basically nothing in the animal kingdom with raw speed. A tiger could catch Usain Bolt and not even get out of breath, but we can run a goddamn racehorse to death over distance. Since we are so slow, I imagine the only selective pressure for speed would be to outrun slower humans. It would be impossible to outrun some large african predator for anyone.</p>
<p>So in summation, our legs/knees are way less evolved for both time and selection reasons. They are good enough for the job of riding shotgun to our brains that their high injury rate didn't break us. Whereas any 4 legged animal is using a system that was working pretty great since before the dinosaurs. </p>
<p>That's hundreds of millions of years of refinement vs less than 10 million. And to boot, our group hunting strategies were so superior that the selective pressure for our legs was much weaker than it would have been for any other animal during those 10 million years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't provide specifics since it's been a while since I scienced, but I do have a hippie degree in wildlife science.</p>
<p>animals are injured fairly regularly.  Outside of human interference (hunting/auto collision/ etc) the leading cause of mortality is injury related.  Injured animals are more prone to predation, and in general have drastically reduced fitness.  </p>
<p>For the most part, an injured animal is a dead animal.  But the actual cause of death is going to be attributed to predation, starvation, or maybe something else...because of this it is a bit difficult to prove the injury question a direct answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that those animals have been in the wild. We humans are living a more sedentary lifestyle. We were configured to run miles a week. We face atrophy and such becaise we're not active and have a significantly higher risk of injury due to our individual bodies not being used to the hunter-gatherer lifestyle they were meant for. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
