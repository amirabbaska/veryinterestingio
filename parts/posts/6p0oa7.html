		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I've spent the last decade plus studying how scientific secrets are kept by the government and military (it's my job — I'm a professional historian — and <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/about-me/" target="_blank">I'm writing a book on nuclear secrecy in particular</a>). If I were going to generalize it would be along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Very intensive screening procedures that try to ferret out any potential conflict of interest, vulnerable spot, etc. This by itself is <em>not</em> sufficient it should be noted — background checks often fail and what you did in the past doesn't necessarily hold for the future, but it's a crucial first step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Constant warning of the consequences of mishandling the information. Lots of drilling about the procedures of security (&quot;OPSEC&quot;). The development of a &quot;culture of secrecy.&quot; You need people to feel it in their bones that the secrets are important and that really bad things will happen (to them, to others) if they get out. Even today if you talk to ex-military who worked on Cold War defense projects, they'll frequently clam up even though a huge amount of this stuff has been declassified. One scientist who worked on the atomic bomb during WWII told me it was shocking to hear the word &quot;uranium&quot; used after the attack on Hiroshima, because for the previous three years he was not supposed to use it and associated it with essentially swearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isolating the work and people from &quot;everyday life&quot; helps to reinforce all of the above. It also allows more complete monitoring of people. Hence isolated secret labs and sites. This is not <em>required</em> — plenty of people work in classified circumstances in big cities like DC — but it helps. Sites with classified information tend to have plenty of security, etc., to emphasize the importance and increase overall control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active and visible means of checking and re-checking people. Security clearances aren't &quot;one time&quot; — they get renewed, you get reinterviewed, you get reinvestigated. They look not just for who your shady friends are or aren't, but much more mundane things like drug/alcohol problems, large debts, etc., that are sometimes signals for people breaking security in one way or another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on the kind of info in question there are procedures to try and make it hard to move it around, e.g., not allowing USB drives. </p>
</li>
<li>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, limiting the number of people who know the really big secrets helps a lot. Compartmentalization, or the &quot;need to know policy,&quot; basically says that you limit the number of people who know something to the bare minimum who need to know it. The more people who know a secret, the harder it is to keep — every person you let &quot;in&quot; to it is another person who might later leak or spy or screw up. </li>
</ul>
<p>The latter point is really important. The secrets that have really had a chance of being held for a long time tend to be pretty small groups of people. (The Indian nuclear program surprised the CIA in part because it was so small — every scientist was doing two or three jobs, essentially. This made it very hard to detect.) </p>
<p>So for BIG secrets with BIG groups of people, like the US WWII atomic bomb project (Manhattan Project), even with compartmentalization (90% of the people involved did not know what they were ultimately building), the length of time the secret can be held is pretty small. The people who ran the security on the project knew this — they were just hoping to keep it enough of a secret so that when the first bomb was used, it would be more or less a surprise. <em>Even then</em> there were leaks, some very bad, and a diligent intelligence service would have seen evidence of the project (the Germans and Japanese seem not to have gotten much sense of it, but the Soviets definitely did, and a few other groups of scientists — including a number of Indian scientists — totally figured out that it must be going on, just from various leaks and other signs). The Manhattan Project was only secret (to whatever degree) for only 3 years, and it was constantly threatened by the press and by Congressmen (who resented not being told what was going on, but seeing evidence of something big and expensive) blowing the lid off.</p>
<p>The time element is key, too — it's a big difference to say, &quot;I want this secret kept for 50 years&quot; and &quot;I want this secret kept for 4 years.&quot; This is one reason to doubt a priori any assertion of conspiracies that would involve hundreds of thousands of people and yet be &quot;kept&quot; for multiple decades — there are essentially no verified examples of something like that happening. More common are things like the US nuclear program which, while it involved a lot of people, sliced and diced the knowledge up into smaller pieces (and smaller groups of people), and <em>even then</em> had considerable leaks, espionage, etc.</p>
<p>There's no way to <em>guarantee</em> success at this though, at least not in a country with freedom of movement and a free press. It only takes one dedicated leaker or spy who doesn't care about the consequences (or thinks they can get away with it), to make it come tumbling down, as has happened again and again. So there is an open question in many cases as to whether all of this is worth it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The federal government does detailed background checks. You have to fill out the SF86 form about your history going back decades. It is a felony to lie. The fbi (they use contractors to do this) has people contact references and knock on doors. I was a reference for my next door neighbor. For high level clearances they require a polygraph and you can be subject to more polygraphs ( or you get fired). Big things that get people ruled out are debts( you are at risk of being bribed), level of foreign contacts, risky behavior ( recent drug use , alcholism... No one cares if you smoked weed back in the day as long as you dont lie), cheating in relationships( if you are having an affair you  can be blackmailed). </p>
<p>After the check, it goes to a committee to see if you pass. The detail of the check depends on how high your clearance. If you are not a high priority case a Top Secret can take a year. Low level ones where they just do criminal and financial checks, employment checks dont take that long. I have only had low level stuff. Stuff I have had access too was less sensitive than the banking data I get access too now in the private sector. The low level stuff was little more than SSN numbers and I needed a background check( you can steal peoples identity with that). </p>
<p>If you get declined you can appeal and hire a lawyer. People can sometimes win appeals. They appeal because decline means no job. The biggest stuff that causes people to fail are debts and lying. So e idiot posted on a forum about lying about smoking weed. First its a felony to lie, second if you get caught lying, you are permanently unemployable in any sensitive positions( and that is alot of jobs in the DC area).  </p>
<p>Basics of what Area 51 does has been leaked. They use it to test top secret aircraft during R&amp;D. SR71 and the B2 bomber were tested there. They like test of 007 style gizmos ( I am exaggerating) there too. </p>
<p>Its not perfect. We still have leakers. Some woman just got arrested for it for leaking nsa stuff. These are valuable in the IT sector in the DC area because you go to the top of the list for alot of jobs since contractors dont have to wait for you to get cleared. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Specifically from the military side: </p>
<p>By the time someone has risen in their career to the point where they're assigned at Groom (or some other &quot;black&quot; site), they've been thoroughly vetted, and are generally a 'known quantity' from a security perspective.</p>
<p>My stepfather was career Air Force, a pilot, and toward the end of his career was assigned to the 117 program (we later found out) at Groom. For several years toward the end of the 80's, he and my mother lived in Vegas, and he commuted every week from McCarran to Groom on 'Janet airlines'. All he could tell my mom was that he'd be home when he got home. There were a few deployments (probably training) where he was gone for several weeks, and all my mom had was an assurance from other wives that if something happened, someone would let her know.</p>
<p>To this day, he hasn't spoken a word of what he did there; we only figured it out based on stuff that happened afterward. Once the 117 was general knowledge, he deployed with one of the squadrons, and eventually assumed a position of squadron leadership when they moved to their final operational base.</p>
<p>He's been retired since the late 90's, and the 117 has been mostly declassified (not completely, though most of the technology is outdated and no longer used), but there are very few pieces of information that he's ever revealed or confirmed.</p>
<p>For instance, every pilot who qualified in the 117 was given a &quot;Bandit&quot; number indicating a permanent call-sign. Through research of my own, I discovered his Bandit number (listed in two publicly available books about the program I found at the Air Force museum); while the roster of Bandits has been publicly released, he still refuses to even confirm that that's his number. To this day he still won't answer any real questions about the program, even though the plane has been retired for almost a decade.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Compartmentalization.  To anyone who's worked in the intelligence community, you're accustomed to most information being compartmentalized and only accessible by having a &quot;need to know&quot; which is granted by clearance/caveat. </p>
<p>For example, having a TS/SCI clearance obviously means you've been granted access to viewing Top Secret as well as sensitive, yet compartmentalized data.  Your job, responsibilities, and geopolitical focus within work all play a key factor in determining what data/intelligence types you're given access to. </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Bob, Fred, and Karen are all on the same analysis team.  Bob is a SIGINT analyst, Fred is a HUMINT analyst and Karen is a collections manager working in the SCIF all three work at. (SCIF: Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility)  </p>
<p>All three have a common purpose, a goal or mission objective- however all three are able to execute their duties and responsibilities at work, independent of one another and their actions, as well as information they are given access to.  </p>
<p>Essentially what I'm trying to say in how it relates to this question, is that loads of contractors, analysts, and agents can all work on a really secret base, or work all on a really secretive program, and little if any information will ever leak out because most people have threads of information.  On their own, whatever information they possess is relatively useless and extremely disputable without coordination and verification of additional sources.  </p>
<p>Issue is all of these additional sources are unknown to you, mainly anonymous,  all have been threatened with prison if they leak, and usually like their $100k salaries they take home.  Sooooo, they don't talk. </p>
<p>TL,DR -  Everyone in intelligence mindlessly works like chickens with their heads cut off, Big brother makes it a pain in the ass to have coordination of leaked intelligence sources. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
