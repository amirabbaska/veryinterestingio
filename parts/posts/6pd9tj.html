		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While watching The Hunt, I saw the segment where Sand Bubbler Crabs sift food from sand. The act seemed fluid to me as they brought the sand to their mouths and quickly sorted it away to form the inflated pellets they leave behind. I was curious as to how these crabs can seemingly sort small amounts of food and sand with ease, and how their mouths worked at a mechanical level. Are there any good diagrams or explanations as how this is done?</p></div></div>

So, they hold the sand with their mouth spoons and then shoot water out of their gill chambers across the sand and into their mouth. All the bacteria, algae, etc that were clinging to the sand get power-washed into the belly of the Sand Bubby.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
