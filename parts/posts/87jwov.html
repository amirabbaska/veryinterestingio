		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was recently thinking about how the high efficiency of services and goods access in urban areas seem to make their development inevitable, particularly with advancing technology.  And many other potential reasons, but I won't get into the weeds.</p>
<p>But obviously, there are plenty of humans who do still live in rural and suburban areas.</p>
<p>So I'm wondering if other social species have a similar spectrum of living areas, and if so, what contributes to why some animals stay rural whereas others are more suburban or urban.  Have there been any studies published on this?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ants and other colonial insects like bees or termites can and do segregate, but it is based on age and/or caste. Young ants typically spend their time in the nest caring for the larvae and queen, digging tunnels, and cleaning up, while older ones gather food.</p>
<p>However, in some ant species this is very different. In leafcutter ants, some castes evolve solely to live inside the nest, while others spend most of their time outside. The smallest 'minors' are the ones who tend to the fungus gardens, while larger workers harvest leaves. Majors and supermajors spend all their time guarding the nest and trails of workers going back and forth with their leaves.</p>
<p>This isn't necessarily segregation in a derogatory sense, rather this is just each ant doing what it was born to do. Though there are exceptions, especially in ants, most species of colonial insect have evolved communism that works near flawlessly. The workers do not worry about breeding as they lack reproductive organs, and are hardwired to fulfill the needs of the queen and the larvae by any means possible. As others have put it, they are cells of a larger body.</p>
<p>And yet when you watch them...their intelligence is uncanny. They communicate, deliberate, urge decisions (if moving nests, workers will actually move their unruly sisters by force to the new living location if necessary.)</p>
<p>There is something oddly familiar about them if you watch them. Sometimes they really look like they're thinking, pondering the next move...</p>
<p>Then you got termites who stumble around and bite at anything that touches them and doesn't smell right because most species are blind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

(males consider earlier offspring of their mate as 'enemies' and females consider all other offspring as 'enemies') there is probably a lot of mutualism going on to protect against predators.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
