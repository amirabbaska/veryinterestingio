I touched it and it climbed back up the web. There wasn't a loop of web dangling below it. Do they just reel it back up inside like a yo-yo? Eat it? Where does the web go? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is from some museum entry about orb weavers:</p>
<p>That’s where the spider’s genius for recycling comes in. When the orb-weaver takes apart an old web, it actually eats the silk. The protein from the old silk is never wasted, from the spider’s digestive system, it goes to the silk glands to be made into a new web. Even if a spider misses a few meals, it can still go on spinning webs. This is thanks to the efficient recycling program that lets spiders conserve protein by eating old webs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spider dork here.  Others here have mentioned they recycle the web by eating it, but not the method by which they climb up a strand without leaving any behind.   They essentially climb with their forelegs and bundle it upwith their hind legs whilst holding the bundle with their fangs as they go and then hold onto it until they can eat it later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm fascinated just thinking how people concluded that a spider &quot;eats&quot; and re-excretes the proteins from its old web it gathers.</p>
<p>'Cause that shit's TINY.  Well, maybe a huge garden spider could be dissected under an optical microscope, but a lot of the others are tiny, even grain-of-rice bodies.</p>
<p>So, question- if you dyed it web green, and it ate it and recycled the proteins, would it spin green web?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
