		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Circadian rhythms</p>
<p>It's your brains way of interpreting the environment and regulating your internal &quot;clock&quot;. In most people, this is regulated by the general brightness as sensed through your vision. Brighter lights = brain thinking it is daytime and awake time. Blind people can regulate through habits like meal times. I had something in mind before but I'm sleepy. I know that 2pm and 2am are when we are most susceptible to sleepy attacks. </p>
<p>Also from a historical perspective, the early afternoon is the hottest time of day and working outside at this time could be inefficient due to the heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an addendum to other answers:</p>
<p>A lot of people eat nutritionally poor foods for breakfast and/or lunch that are full of simple sugars, like donuts or breakfast cereals. The sugars enter the blood stream quickly and your body immediately tries to bring the blood sugar under control with insulin.</p>
<p>Now the energy necessary for body functions has come, and gone, leaving you with a feeling of &quot;crashing&quot; and a desire to take a nap. </p>
<p>In addition many people drink something with caffeine in the morning. This also runs out around the same time contributing to the crash. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>This article doesn't touch on it, but there probably are benefits to having some people in a group up at night to ward off predators.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are polyphasic sleepers inherently - like babies and most other animals that take naps at various times of the day and not just at night. Unfortunately, the industrial age demanded that we stay awake for longer periods of time in the morning and sleep one large chuck at night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
