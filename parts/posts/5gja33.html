<p>And it worked, it wasn't just confirmation bias or something, it worked every time.</p>
<p>I'm asking because my surround sound system has started to need just one solid tap to work correctly, shows it's on but not all the lights and no sound comes out until I bang on it. Just like that old TV from the 90s, makes it work every single time.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>But why? Why does this work?</p></div></div>
