		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The receptors on our body that detect temperature changes are called Thermoreceptors. There are two basic categories of thermoreceptors: hot and cold receptors. They are found all over the body, but cold receptors are found in greater density than heat receptors. The highest concentration of thermoreceptors can be found in the face and ears (hence why your nose and ears always get colder faster than the rest of your body on a chilly winter day). Temperature perception is very relative. Maybe you remember this <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cold-or-warm-can-we-really-tell/" target="_blank">experiment</a> from biology classes in middle school.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Possibly since the cold water is going right down into your core, it doesn't cool down the surrounding tissue so suddenly, since that tissue is very warm and surrounded by your heart and lungs. Your hands on the other hand have very little fat on them, and cold water cools them down much quicker and suddenly, causing an uncomfortable feeling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
