		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So let’s say you have a good amount of illicit income like selling drugs, guns, sex trafficking, hitman, whatever. Now you can’t really live a lavish lifestyle without throwing up some red flags. Like where do you get the money to buy these nice cars, houses, pay taxes on these things etc. what you do is you have a front such as a car wash, laundromat, somewhere you can really fake profits (it has nothing to do with actual cleaning of money, it’s cleaning the paper trail). So how is the government gonna know if your laundromat has 10 or 50 customers each day? Basically you fake your dealings to have clean money to spend.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are mentioning businesses, but that's usually for low-level, small time crime. Let's say someone makes $100k, but also makes $50k illegally somehow on top of that (maybe selling something illegal on the side), this is common with EU truckers for example, who often smuggle cigarettes on top of their normal stuff across borders. Now this $50k is 100% illegal income, they can't really pay taxes on it otherwise the government might ask questions (how did you make $150k when every other trucker made $100k?). You can't really spend the $50k, because again, the government can be like (you made $100k, how did you spend $150k last year?). So some of them open up mostly sham businesses that they don't care about, like a small coffeeshop, and then claim it makes $50k when in reality it makes way less. A single coffee shop making $50k is completely reasonable and nobody will ask questions. Boom, now this truck driver can use his illegal money.</p>
<p>However, for wealthy, more impactful people, it's different. Somebody worth millions of dollars, suddenly opening up chains of businesses and ensuring each one of them lie about their income is a nearly impossible thing to pull off, especially in the EU. So, one way wealthy people money laundering is through 'fake' purchases that don't raise suspicion. Let's say I'm selling you $5m worth of illegal goods. You can't give me that money in cash as a gift, otherwise I'd have the same problem as the trucker earlier. So I sell you something else. Like a stupid fucking painting that's worth nearly nothing. And you buy it. Boom, you get your goods, I get my money, and the stupid fucking painting was the middleman to make it a legal transfer of money. You can replace the painting with anything, even businesses or houses or whatever. (I'll sell you the title of this shitty, crumbling business for $5m). There's other ways as well, including putting the money into Bitcoin, withdrawing it in foreign banks that have little regulation, claiming it came from investments, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are rich drug lord and earn millions of dollars.</p>
<p>You want to buy a house and fancy cars, but you need to pay through a bank.</p>
<p>You can't deposit more than $10000 without drawing suspicion on where the money comes from.</p>
<p>So you start up Mattress Firm, a scam mattress business with rip off $3000 mattresses that sell to 1 out of 100 suckers.</p>
<p>But you tell teh IRS that you sell hundreds of mattresses every month, making millions.</p>
<p>Now you deposit those millions, thats where they came from!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
