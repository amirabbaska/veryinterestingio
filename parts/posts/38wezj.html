		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your speed is going to depend on your latitude, assuming that your question means that you want to go back one timezone per hour, so that you have some sort of 'never ending hour.'</p>
<p>If you wanted to pick a latitude and stick with it, then the length of your lap around the world is just: </p>
<pre><code>L = 2 * pi * (radius of the earth) * cos(latitude)</code></pre>
<p>where that last piece is the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ewqk5CL.png" target="_blank">cosine</a> of the latitude you want to travel at. Since you only need to do a global lap once every 24 hours, you can divide this by 24 hours to get: </p>
<pre><code>v = 2 * pi * (earth radius) * cosine(latitude of new york city)/24 hours</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*pi*%28earth+radius%29*cosine%28latitude+of+new+york+city%29%2F24+hours" target="_blank">Math.</a></p>
<p>And I plugged in the latitude for NYC, because why not, and it gave me 785 mph. Go ahead and tinker with that angle, try <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*pi*%28earth+radius%29*cosine%28latitude+of+london%29%2F24+hours" target="_blank">London</a> or <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*pi*%28earth+radius%29*cosine%28latitude+of+mumbai%29%2F24+hours" target="_blank">Mumbai</a> or <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*pi*%28earth+radius%29*cosine%28latitude+of+honolulu%29%2F24+hours" target="_blank">Honolulu</a> or <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*pi*%28earth+radius%29*cosine%28latitude+of+stockholm%29%2F24+hours" target="_blank">Stockholm</a>.</p>
<p>Be careful when you pick your latitude though, because some countries span a large degree of longitude but have chosen the entire country to run on one timezone, such as <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cOVtzz5V4uU/Tci4G0K4_PI/AAAAAAAACec/7vRmnpzdgdM/s1600/time_zones.jpg" target="_blank">China and India.</a> If you planned to pass through there in an hour you'd end up getting out of sync.  </p>
<p>Of course, as is common in physics, there is a simple limit for making this easy: go to the poles. <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/3/39/20120104021100!International_date_line.png" target="_blank">The timezones start and end there,</a> meaning that you can walk as slow as you want, provided you're close enough to the pole. If you wanted to be able to do this on foot, walking through one timezone per hour, then the furthest you could feasibly be is 10 miles from the north pole - that would keep you walking at a brisk pace of 3 mph all day. If you were 10 feet from the pole, a snail could easy handle this pace.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Based on your question, I assume you must mean relative to the local time.  While you can maintain your same relative position to the Sun, you cannot stay at a constant <em>time</em>, even in the local time zone.  A particular geography is in a specific timezone.  As you move over the surface of the earth, keeping your position the same relative to the sun, time in the current timezone advances minute-by-minute.  Suddenly you cross over a line defining the edge of a timezone, and time decreases by an hour (in some cases 30 minutes!).  Unfortunately, these lines are not at all uniform (timezones are quite arbitrary), and if you are keeping at the same position relative to the sun, you may end up spending more or less than an hour in each time zone.  Also, it is important to note that as you cross over the date line suddenly the date increases by one day.</p>
<p>So in short, it is not possible to remain at the same time.  The closest you can come to this is repeating (parts) of the same hour (more or less) for 24 hours while the date increases each time you cross the date line.  Others here have already answered the question of how fast you would need to travel to maintain your position relative to the sun.  However, I thought it important to add the information about timezones and the fact that even the local time does not remain &quot;the same time&quot; as you travel around the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on your latitude. If you're within a few kilometers of either pole, you can keep up with the clock just by walking.</p>
<p>At the equator, you have to go about 1670km/h to keep up with the clock. This is faster than the typical cruising speed of commercial airliners (about 900km/h), but not as fast as many supersonic military planes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
