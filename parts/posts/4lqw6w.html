		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is at least one example i can think of off of the top of my head.
The thymus gland is very active in young children, and becomes far less so as we near adulthood. As far as the gland itself actually shrinking, i dont think it does, but The active cells which carry out glandular functions are replaced by adipose tissue as you age.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Growth plates start shrinking after the first growth spurt, and then seal off after the teenage growth spurt.</p>
<p>I suppose ovary egg numbers decrease after birth (after menarche, really). But idk if the actual size of the organ is affected by puberty/early aging.</p>
<p>Not absolute size, but percentage of bone marrow as fat increases with age. A common rule of thumb for pathologists is approx 1% marrow fat per age. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a surgeon's perspective, the thymus becomes much smaller in size and less relevant in function.  The adenoids are nearly gone in most adults, and tonsils also start to shrink after about age 10. </p>
<p>Broadly, organs become less important in some cases due to birth, in some cases due to development (most of these shrink long before birth), development and degeneration. </p>
<p>The right aortic arch is a classic embryologic change, the foramen ovale and umbilical arteries and veins are classic birth related.  Thymus, tonsils, adenoids and hair (in bald men) are classics as well. </p>
<p>Eggs in women are probably the best example of ongoing downward trend. </p>
<p>Hearing and hair cells in the elderly is another example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thymus and the brain in later life are two excellent examples (particularly the thymus) - but that's already been discussed in other comments.</p>
<p>Another fun example is ductus arteriosus. In the developing fetus, a small blood vessel connects the aorta and pulmonary artery. It's a shunt allowing blood to bypass the lungs. It closes at birth, as baby takes its first breath - and after a few weeks, the closed vessel becomes a ligament instead. Smaller by virtue of not being open.</p>
<p>What's fun about ductus arteriosus (or ligamentum arteriosum once it's become a ligament) is that we can force it to stay open! If a fetus has a heart defect, for example, forcing the ductus arteriosus to stay open can save its life and give us time to surgically correct a defect.</p>
<p>Some people are also born with an open (or patent) ductus arteriosus. Here's a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8nmJxHC.png" target="_blank">nice image</a> of it.</p>
<p>Another fun examples of things getting smaller as a human grows older - brown adipose tissue (brown fat) is plentiful in an infant (and in hibernating animals), but scarce in adults. (Brown fat generates heat for infants and hibernating animals)</p>
<p>One last example, because this is sort of fun. It's not a body part, but as we age we lose certain reflexes. Take an infant 2 months old and stroke its cheek. It will turn towards that contact and start trying to suck. This is called the rooting reflex. Do the same to a 6 month old and you won't get the same result - they lose the reflex! </p>
<p>We lose a number of reflexes in our first 6 months of life. Babies are fun to watch in part because they have some funny reflexes (one is called the fencer reflex - like a fencing position). But they &quot;get smaller&quot; in the sense that we lose them :-)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a dental perspective, as we age, our baby teeth and permanent teeth get smaller due to bruxism (the wearing of teeth due to gnashing and grinding). In the primary dentition (baby teeth), grinding serves to expand the arch, as well as to position the jaw foward when enlarged tonsils obstruct breathing (pediatric sleep apnea). In adults, simple chewing, and clenching  wears teeth during day time use, bruxism (nocturnal clenching and grinding) wears teeth down at night. Sleep studies indicate grinding occurs in order to make more room for you to breathe at night often preceding snoring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
