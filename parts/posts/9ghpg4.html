<p>Because you're basically doing the same thing. The pixels in the computer screen are arranged in a grid. The pixels in the camera sensor are arranged in a grid. The pixels in your phone screen are arranged in a grid. Because those grids don't perfectly align with each other you see an effect that is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Moiré pattern</a>. The same thing happens when looking through multiple wire meshes, because those are also grids that don't align perfectly. The holes of the meshes are similar to the pixels, the mesh themselves are the spaces between the pixels.  </p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> to answer a few common questions:  </p>
<p>The strength of the effect depends on the alignment and relative scale between the grids. So you can reduce the effect by better aligning the photo (e.g. making sure the camera isn't rotated or tilted) and by trying different distances from the screen. The effect is stronger if some pixels from the monitor fall right in the middle of the pixels of the camera sensor or phone screen while other pixels fall in-between the pixels of the camera sensor or phone screen. And since the camera app of your phone will show you a scaled down picture (phone screens may have a resolution of 2-4 megapixels, while phone cameras have resolutions of 12-20 megapixels) you may not see the effect in the preview of the photo but later in the actual photo, especially if you zoom in.  </p>
<p>In order to prevent the effect you can basically only resort to trial and error. Snap a picture, open it, zoom in at the size you want to use it and check if a pattern is visible. If not, then try again at a slightly different distance, or change the photo resolution in the camera app. Also you can use the settings to show an alignment grid to make sure the camera looks as straight at the screen as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
