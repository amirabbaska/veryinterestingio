		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure whether to flair as chemistry or physics. Other fine powders like hot cocoa mix will clump together, but even fine ground espresso does not. What causes some powders to coagulate and others not to, and why?</p>
<p>Edit: to be clear, I'm talking about coagulation, i.e. when you pour boiling water over coffee grounds vs other fine powders. Coffee grounds will absorb the near-boiling water, but hot cocoa mix almost repels the water/milk and remains a powder.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I'm not referring to instant coffee, but rather actual coffee grounds, which I would think are similar in nature to ground cocoa. There are other examples of coagulation: cinnamon, nutmeg, and the like. Even courser grounds, such as flour or oats will have dry clumps in water. But for some reason coffee doesn't seem to behave the same way, even espresso. There are of course other powders that don't clump, but rather dissolve in water, such as sugar and salt, but to my knowledge coffee doesn't actually dissolve either.</p>
<p>Edit 4: deleted edit 3 per Mod's request. Sorry for my confusion.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So coagulation only applies to fluids, solid powders cannot coagulate by definition. I believe what you're referring to is clumping, which is almost always due to moisture. The powder will stick to wet surfaces/itself trying to absorb water. This is only present in soluble powders, or essentially dehydrated mixes which usually contain a lot of sugar. Sugar causes the behavior you're describing of cocoa powder, but since coffee grounds do not contain sugar nor are they water soluble they don't have the same behavior to moisture. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Done a bit of work on silica powders and I expect the science is similar. </p>
<p>Different substances have different compounds on them. I donâ€™t know the chemistry behind it but different molecular structures on the surface will give a different attraction to water. Certain molecules will have a surface charge which repels water- this causes the particles to clump and float in an attempt to stay as far away from the water as possible. </p>
<p>Edit: As someone else, the oils present in coffee may be what causes this hydrophobic behaviour</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're likely talking about instant coffee, which is not as prevelant throughout the world as you might expect.</p>
<p>Instant coffee is produced by grinding and boiling roasted coffee beans, then filtering and freeze drying the extracted coffee.</p>
<p>The majority of the extract is soluble in water so dissolves quickly. Freeze drying also creates a porous structure with lots of surface area, this helps the coffee dissolve without clumping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you referring to instant coffee powder vs cocoa powder etc? If so, they are two fundamentally different things.</p>
<p>Cocoa powder is the fibrous, debris left over when a cocoa bean is ground up and has most of its natural oils extracted. These fibers aren't inherently soluble and they may contain a residual amount of oil which makes them hydrophobic. Heat the liquid up and they'll more readily disperse into the water and more or less disappear because the particles are so fine, but they don't really ever dissolve.</p>
<p>Instant coffee is quite different. To  make instant coffee, you prepare strong black coffee by another means, then you remove the water until the dissolved coffee compounds crystallize. So instant coffee is basically that brown crust that forms on the bottom of an empty coffee cup if you forget to wash it for a few days. Because the crystals are composed of compounds that are all soluble and hydrophilic and have in fact already been dissolved in water once, they will readily dissolve again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
