EDIT : Front page in 2 hours! Thank you all guys! To sum up the post so far-</p>
<ul>
<li>Humans have developed like a species as a whole </li>
<li>Humans have bigger brains </li>
<li>Humans eliminated all other 'smart' species </li>
<li>Invention and use of tools </li>
<li>Developed cognitive functions like memory, problem solving, emotions etc</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an insane amount of misinformation here.</p>
<p>First, in the question - we are not the &quot;superior species&quot; on Earth, we are merely the current apex predator (the &quot;top of the food chain&quot;).  Evolving intelligence to become that is no more or less superior than evolving chainsaw hands to become that.  Also, there isn't <em>that much</em> of an intelligence gap between us and other species - we just perceive it as such.</p>
<p>Now, the real question that you should be asking is &quot;why did humans evolve to be so smart&quot; - which is a good one.  Our big brains make fetal development and birth far more difficult, they use boatloads of energy, and they don't exactly help us become faster or stronger to hunt prey.  One good answer to this is simple - there is a huge connection between the size of the neocortex and the size of a group or tribe that a creature can meaningfully connect with.</p>
<p>You see, humans are pack animals, like wolves.  We adapted to the risk involved in hunting and gathering by selecting for larger and larger brains, allowing us to form larger and larger tribes.  Thus, when one human in the tribe failed to bring home food for the day, it wasn't a problem, as someone else in the tribe surely succeeded, and with the meaningful connections that our big brain allows, the two tribe members developed a sense of cooperation that allowed for a far better long-term survival rate than simply being greedy.</p>
<p>tl;dr - We got our big brains so we could form big groups and take some of the risk out of finding food, raising children, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different theories about this. This means we don't know for sure. But one interesting thing ist that we aren't <em>that</em> much more intelligent than other species. Imagine humans without knowledge and tools in a savanna. Would they instantly start chatting and writing books? Probably not. A large part of what we call &quot;intelligence&quot; is actually accumulated knowledge.</p>
<p>In the end, it boils down to intelligence being an evolutionary favorable trait. Those who were more intelligent had higer chances of survival. Also, people compete(d) for resources (especially reproductive privilege) inside of their tribes, which means that the evolution of intelligence has happend in large parts due to inter-human competition. Other animals didn't compete with humans <em>in that way</em>. This may be one cause for other animals &quot;staying behind&quot; (hehe, behind).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're getting a lot of responses along the lines of &quot;Dolphins can do this&quot; or &quot;Dolphins can communicate with sonar&quot;. Yes, that's true, but that is not the same as &quot;smartness&quot;, which I imagine OP qualifies as &quot;capacity for abstract thought&quot;. Dolphins don't have nearly the same capacity for abstract thought that humans do--no other species we know of does.</p>
<p>As to answering the question, there are two theories that predominate, both of which are evolutionary: natural selection and Machiavellian intelligence. Sexual selection could also be part of it.</p>
<p><strong>Natural selection</strong> is the most encompassing of the two theories. There are a spectrum of ways that human behavior could have interacted with the natural and human environment, such that random mutations for greater intelligence get selected naturally. I'll only discuss two: </p>
<p>It could be on an individual level: making tools makes me better able to hunt, which in turns gives me more to eat, which in turn means I can both live longer to reproduce more and take care of those offspring. As such, a random mutation that grants me greater capacity for being able to design more complex tools, use more complex tools, and/or copy someone else's tool creation or development makes me better able to survive--&gt;reproduce--&gt;take care of offspring. Over generations, my offspring will fair better and take over the population. You can probably think of a lot of other individual-level changes like this.</p>
<p>There are also group dynamics at play. For example, perhaps someone in a group has a random mutation that makes her more likely to abstractly think about nurturing the group (e.g. she is more likely to produce dopamine when caring for a child than another person and so is more likely to seek out children to nurture). This doesn't necessarily improve her chances of reproduction, but it does improve the overall chances of the group's members reproducing. And over a few generations, her mutation may spread throughout the group.</p>
<p>The theory of <strong>Machiavellian intelligence</strong> could be considered to fall under natural selection, but it is unique enough that I'll give its own place. The idea is that humans evolved complex abstract thinking because mutations that enabled our ancestors to manipulate others' understanding of the human and natural environment -- via both honest and dishonest communication -- afforded them both material and social advantages for breeding. In short, the ability to communicate abstractly and change the way other people understood their reality gave the speaker some social or material boon that helped her reproduce.</p>
<p>As such, the reason you see Machiavellian intelligence sometimes separated from natural selection is that this selection comes from the ability to change the social selector itself (i.e., the listener). I don't know whether this is sound logic, however, because tools do the same thing to the natural selector (i.e., the environment).</p>
<p>Finally, there is <strong>sexual selection</strong>. Perhaps mutations for greater intelligence did not directly grant advantages to reproducing, but one party to the reproduction found it &quot;sexy&quot; nonetheless. I'll give an example: Man A is smarter and, consequently, paints his dwelling with more intricate, prettier designs than Man B. Woman comes along and sees the two dwellings, thinks the latter dwelling is indicative of better means to support offspring or even just feels more attracted to the latter dwelling, so she decides to mate with Man A.</p>
<p>It's likely that all of these forms of selection played major roles in the evolution of human intelligence; however, the shared component in each of them is random mutation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason we're so 'smart' comes from our use of tools, language and problem solving (these are not limited to just humans, just enhanced). Ancestors of humans were able to use tools in some fashion, much like what we can observe in many of the great apes. Evolutionary pressure which favoured tool use allowed tool using ancestors to have more babies than the non-tool using ancestors. This meant that the tool using ancestors kept having smarter and smarter babies because the evolutionary pressure to use tools was there. This process also goes hand in hand with language and problem solving.</p>
<p>p.s. Intelligence in the scientific world should not really be compared between different species, since we may have a high encephalisation index, but we're not the best at everything. Tigers for instance will dominate us in terms of hunting and stealth, that is their form of intelligence. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
