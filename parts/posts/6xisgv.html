		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's a quite interesting question which led me to making a research but my findings says that spoken language only has a psychological effect. The most solid piece of information I found is in this article: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4321236/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4321236/</a></p>
<p>In this article the researchers have inspected 3000+ languages and they found out climate/humidity has a significant effect on vocal cords' development: shorter and less stretching in humid environments and this causes a larger tonality in that region's languages and so on. So the issue is climate affects vocal cords and that affects languages which later causes habits that make pronunciation of other languages harder for the learner in my understanding.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks iwaka for pointing out my mistake on the outcomes: there is a larger tonality in humid regions, not smaller. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vocal chords do not play big role in forming speech. They only produce base sound which is shaped later in vocal tract. There are witnesses that without throat vocal chords sound like a fluttering peace of paper.</p>
<p>The shape of phonemes (language-significant sounds) is completely formed in mouth and sometimes nose (e.g. in French). It is the tongue that plays main role in that process. Physiologically the tongue is way too flexible to be language-dependant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/15108609?story_id=15108609" target="_blank">An article in The Economist</a> makes a claim that speakers of the !Xóõ language of Botswana and Namibia develop a small node on their larynx. Here is the relevant paragraph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For sound complexity, one language stands out. !Xóõ, spoken by just a few thousand, mostly in Botswana, has a blistering array of unusual sounds. Its vowels include plain, pharyngealised, strident and breathy, and they carry four tones. It has five basic clicks and 17 accompanying ones. <strong>The leading expert on the !Xóõ, Tony Traill, developed a lump on his larynx from learning to make their sounds. Further research showed that adult !Xóõ-speakers had the same lump (children had not developed it yet).</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(emphasis mine)</p>
<p>I have been unable to track down the source of this claim, however, so I would take it with a grain of salt. I have found no mention of a lump of any kind in Traill's <em>Phonetic and Phonological Studies of !Xóõ Bushman</em> or in his <em>A !Xóõ Dictionary</em>. However there is one passage of interest in the former. In describing the articulation of the language's &quot;strident vowels&quot;, he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tip of the epiglottis articulates with the back wall of the pharynx and in the case of Gūhmsâ's [a̰h] with such force that it actually presses into the tissue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is any truth to the claim that speakers of this language develop a lump, it would have to come from these strident vowels. However, the lump would be on the pharynx, not the larynx.</p>
<p>So while this does not affect the vocal cords (vocal folds) as you've asked about, it is an example of a language which possibly affects the physiology of those who speak it, albeit in a minor way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
