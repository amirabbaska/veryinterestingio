		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it could. But we already have <a href="https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/#" target="_blank">moon rock samples</a> from various depths (up to about 200 m for the drill core samples) from the Apollo missions.</p>
<p>The surface material of the moon is fairly homogeneous and the samples from different areas such as mare's and highlands are broadly similar. The interesting thing would be to get samples from deeper in than we already have. Unfortunately you would need a large impactor to get material from below 200 m, and unlike the cores there would be no way of telling if there are chemical changes with the depth. Given that we can land core-drilling robots on mars, I would think the best way would be to do a robotic sample return mission if we ever needed any more moon rock.</p>
<p>It's definitely a good idea though, and has been done for a comet with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Impact_(spacecraft)" target="_blank">deep impact</a> mission, although they used refection spectroscopy instead of transmission spectroscopy.</p>
<p>:-)</p>
<p>Edit: So I misread the table and confused cm with m :-(. So the impactor required to get deeper would be way smaller than what I originally thought :-). It may actually be a better idea than a sample return mission (for fuel requirements etc). I know that the Apollo missions had a look at some crater walls (which would tell you something about the bulk composition) but information from an undisturbed region would go a long way to testing various moon formation models.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's so much reflected light that it doesn't really have much difference, unless I'm not understanding the question. The <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LCROSS/overview/index.html" target="_blank">LCROSS</a> mission did this though. We hit the moon, the science payload had various cameras, and then the debris plumes were visible by Earth too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
