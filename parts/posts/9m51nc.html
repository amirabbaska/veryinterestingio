		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's useful in that QM <em>is</em> a (extended) normalized Hilbert space.</p>
<p>You start by defining a basis of states.  You define them to be orthogonal, meaning the dotproduct of any two different basis states is 0.  The basis corresponds, physically, to physically possible measurements.</p>
<p>For any other quantum state, its dot product with a basis gives the probability *<em>amplitude</em> of finding a particle in that state to have a specific value after measurement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the direct answer to your question is that quantum mechanics is explicitly <em>constructed</em> to be a linear framework, which naturally gives rise to the use of Hilbert spaces when you study concrete problems. This feature of linearity is by <em>choice</em>.</p>
<p>What we found from experiments is that a simple (classical) one-to-one mapping of system states to observable states is an insufficient framework. Some states of our system do not appear to be observable states, but they are &quot;combinations&quot; of observable states. What kind of combinations though? The simplest hypothesis is that they are linear combinations of each other. If you want I suppose you could try out a non-linear framework, but this would get very hard very fast. We understand linear systems much better theoretically and computationally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The dot product is great at filtering out the overlap between states.</p>
<p>For any orthonormal basis, you can determine the coefficients for expanding a given state in that basis by computing the dot product of your state with the basis states. And those coefficients are the probability amplitudes for measuring the system in that particular basis state. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As with most mathematics in science it is used for mathematical convenience, and any “meaning” behind the approach is applied after the fact, since humans crave intuitive causalities (and thats how we publish papers). </p>
<p>That being said, newcomers just can’t stomach the above because it sounds too “trial and error” and they would rather believe QM (or any aspect of science for that matter) is founded on a principled approach to understanding nature. How cute. </p>
<p>Hilbert spaces are successful in describing what's objectively and reproducibly observed in Nature; period. In other words, the Hilbert space is precisely the mathematical structure that is needed to describe matter, from quarks and leptons up to neutron stars. That's why it's used.</p>
<p>Still not satisfied? Ok let’s pretend science isn’t trial and error.  Hilbert space is the only normed linear space that has an inner product. In Quantum Mechanics, inner products of two states represent transition amplitudes from one quantum state to the next. So these transition amplitudes are orthogonal projections of one state onto another. Quantum Mechanics uses the inner product feature of Hilbert. </p>
<p>Remember that measurements in Quantum Mechanics are linear operators on the vector space of quantum states. For each operator there is an orthonormal basis of eigenstates (eigenvectors of the operator). The idea of orthonormality only makes sense in a Hilbert space. These eigenvectors are the possible states that remain after a measurement. When measuring a property of a quantum state, the outcome of the measurement is uncertain. It can be any of the eigenstates of the linear operator. The square of the probability that the measurement will land in a particular eigenstate is the Hilbert space inner product of the quantum state with the eigenstate. So the full suite of features of Hilbert space are used. </p>
<p>How convenient :) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unlike Newtonian mechanics where you describe a system by the coordinates of a particle, in quantum mechanics you describe a system in terms of a probability distribution of where a particle may lie. Probability distributions are functions, but they can also be thought of as vectors with uncountably many coordinates indexed by the domain.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Under both the probability distribution and vector interpretation, there are a number of operations one would naturally want to do such as computing expected values, lengths, and angles. The definition for doing these things over function spaces is simply an infinite dimensional generalization of finite dimensional probability and inner product space computations. We replace sums with integrals. For the infinite dimensional analogues to be well defined, we want functions whose square has finite integral, rather than the natural generalization to functions which have finite integral.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
