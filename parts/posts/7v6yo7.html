		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's ultimately because the military has many laws that are specific to the military; sedition, mutiny, and failure to obey a lawful order being just a few of them. These aren't civilian crimes, so the military needs legal authority to prosecute these charges. </p>
<p>In the event that a servicemember commits a typical crime, let's say getting drunk and assaulting someone, the civilian legal system will get together with the military legal system and determine in which court to prosecute (typically it will end up in the civilian court if the crime was not committed on a military installation). When the crime is committed off-base, the city/county has jurisdiction. They can then choose to hand over jurisdiction to the military, or they can maintain jurisdiction and prosecute normally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what your purpose is in pointing out that the military is being funded by taxes.  All courts (military and civilian) are funded by taxes, too.  Why would the military being tax-funded mean that they should be tried in one type of court over another?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because A) the military has jurisdiction over the individual and their workspaces and B) there are a whole raft of things that are trial-worthy crimes in the military that don't merit being called a 'crime' in civilian life.</p>
<p>A comes up a lot because military personnel can get sent all over the place, including places outside what would otherwise be the jurisdiction of the nation's civilian courts. Say for instance someone is getting deployed and commits a crime during transit in international waters. A civilian government's jurisdiction doesn't cover that, but the military has them dead to rights. </p>
<p>B is especially important; between internal codes of procedure and international treaties, military law is effectively a field of study all on it's own. For instance, say a civilian does a no-call/no-show at their place of work, they just fail to show up one day. They're in trouble when they get back. Most likely going to be disciplined. Possibly fired. If he had a contract, there might be financial penalties. An American soldier says 'fuck it' and skives off with no warning? He's 'Absent Without Leave' and in violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. He's committed a crime worthy of a trial, and could be looking down the barrel of a felony conviction and a multi-year jail sentence. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The military is subject to a separate set of rules. The military does not follow the constitution or bill of rights pertaining to military members, but rather the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). It’s a comparative document to the BoR, but it somewhat limits freedoms compared to the BoR.
Example: 1st Amendment of the Constitution says you can belong to a hate group (KKK) without recourse. The UCMJ says the same thing, but, it also says you cannot be a active member or attend protests, esp in uniform. Also, it covers rules and regulations during times of war and conduct of members while fighting. The UCMJ also covers what is called Rules of Engagement (ROEs) and Law Of Armed Conflict (LOAC) during times of war. They govern your conduct, who you can and cannot engage, standard procedures during war, and the basic wartime rules (example- It’s unlawful to use a .50 Cal machine gun on personal. They are anti-vehicle and material weapons, and using same against personal could make you subject to Courts Marshal action) </p>
<p>The UCMJ also covers conduct in regards to behavior and following lawful orders of NCO’s and Officers, behavior on and off duty, order and discipline, and also allows for what is called Non-Judicial Punishments (NJP) or Article 15 action. Basically instead of going to jail or getting kicked out, you loose rank, get fined, and get extra duty (at the discretion of your Commander) </p>
<p>Also, the military does not have trials, but rather Courts Marshals. Military courts marshals are completely different in terms of prosecution and defense as the UCMJ is more in depth than the BoR. </p>
<p>Lastly, a Courts Marshal is composed entirely of other military members. The Judge, Jury, prosecution, defense and all other officials are Active Duty or Reserve. Civilians would be completely lost as far as rules and regulations of Active Duty, as well as everyday life of active duty. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all comes down to one simple fact: for the general public, killing people is a crime.  For the military, it's part of the job.</p>
<p>There's a whole lot of consequences to this, including the idea that desertion isn't just quitting your job, it could get your coworkers killed, and that refusing orders isn't just going to get you fired, it could lead to the extermination of your country...</p>
<p>The point is that most governments have decided that the high-stakes, life-and-death nature of military service means that many of the rights and legal privileges ordinary citizens are entitled to don't work the same way in the military, so special courts are required.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
