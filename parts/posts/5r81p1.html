I primarily do work outside of the sciences, applying scientific thinking and problem-solving techniques to non-scientific policies. I wish I could be more specific about my background and current role, but I need to remain anonymous, and further information could identify me. I am happy to answer any question that I can, but out of anonymity concerns, please understand that I cannot speak more to my specific scientific expertise. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone from outside the US (but I imagine it applies to many US citizens too!), where does being a &quot;scientist working in a congressional office&quot; place you within the government? Are you a government employee providing advice for the entirety of congress, or are you working more specifically for one group - or maybe even just advising a single member of congress?</p>

Have their been any that surprisingly passed? (Bill No. would be appreciated.) Thank you for your civil service! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Has anyone (lobbyists, special interests, etc) approached you because you are a scientist by training? I heard many researchers are funded by special interests to publish biased studies, not sure if it's effecting scientists working directly in the public sector</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
