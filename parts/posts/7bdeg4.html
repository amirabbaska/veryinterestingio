		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The antiparticle of a particle has <em>all</em> quantum numbers flipped, not just electric charge.  This includes lepton number, color, etc.  So if you had a quark that had, say, blue color charge but no electric charge, it would still have an anti-blue antiparticle.</p>
<p>In the Standard Model, as you note, the only neutral particles are the photon/Z boson of the electroweak force, and the neutrinos.  The photon and Z don't have color, lepton number, or any other relevant quantum number that I know of, so even though forming their antiparticles is well-defined within the theory, you end up with a particle that's identical to what you started with.</p>
<p>Neutrinos are more complex, since they carry lepton number. It currently isn't known whether or not neutrinos are their own antiparticles.  If they aren't, they're called Dirac particles, and they conserve a lepton number that changes sign for an antineutrino.  If they are, they're called Majorana particles, and they violate conservation of lepton number.  (As an additional complexity: it's possible that they're a little of both!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope! A particle may be neutral and have an antiparticle. One example of this is the neutron. A regular neutron is composed of two down quarks and an up quark, but an antineutron would have two anti-down quarks and an anti-up quark. The electric charge of the antineutron is still 0.</p>
<p>However, there are several kinds of charges in particle physics, of which electric charge is only one. The neutron has an isospin of -1/2 (something analogous to an electric charge but for the weak nuclear force), and so its antiparticle has an isospin of +1/2. Additionally, while the neutron has a baryon number of 1 (counting the number of 3-quark particles are in a system), the antineutron has baryon number -1. In general an antiparticle of a certain particle has all the opposite charges as the particle for <em>every</em> kind of charge.</p>
<p>Some particles may be their own antiparticle. The photon is one example of this, and the Z boson (involved in the weak force, but behaves roughly just like a heavy and somewhat rare photon) is another. These particles are called &quot;Majorana&quot; particles, and so to exist they must be have a charge of 0 for every kind of charge. And to address your third question, the jury is still out on whether the right-handed antineutrino is separate from the right-handed neutrino. Right handed neutrinos have never been observed yet to my knowledge. It's worth noting that the left-handed neutrino is charged under the Weak force, and so I'm not sure if it can actually be a Majorana particle since its antipartner would have the opposite charge. But since the right-handed neutrino, if it exists, must not interact with any of the 3 forces, it may be Majorana. The main way we are searching to answer this question, as I understand it, is by looking for &quot;neutrinoless double beta decay,&quot; where a nucleus emits two electrons instead of one. </p>
<p>W+ and W- are indeed a particle-antiparticle pair. Certainly the idea of antiparticles is not restricted to the fermions, but as it turns out, among elementary particles the only bosons which are not Majorana particles are the W+/W- and the gluons, which carry out the strong force (since they are charged under the strong force, and hence their antiparticle partners should have the opposite charge as they do). There are in fact 8 kinds of gluons, and the antipartner of any given gluon can be found by combining the other 7 in some particular way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Particles with zero electric charge can still have distinct antiparticles.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Same field.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do we talk about antineutrino if the neutrino has no charge?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neutrinos have additional quantum numbers which switch between the particle and antiparticle if they are Dirac fermions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or is it the fermions that have an antiparticle, but in this case why the boson W has its own antiparticle?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both bosons and fermions can either have distinct antiparticles or be their own antiparticles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
