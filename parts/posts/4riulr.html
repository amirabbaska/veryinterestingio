		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am in the submarine cable business, and can answer:  No, there is not compensation as drift is inconsequential (2.5 cm or 1 inch per year).  One reason is the bottom of the ocean is not flat - but has mountains and valleys like dry land, so extra cable is 'payed out' (let off the ship) to fill in the valleys so the cable isn't left suspended between peaks.  Think of paying out rope from the back of a helicopter over the alps.  If you just let out a meter for each meter of flight, the rope would be suspended across all the valleys.  If there is any wind (equivalently sea currents for undersea cables) it would rub through the rope where it contacts the peaks.  So the bottom line is there is excess cable laid just to accommodate the topography of the ocean bottom, so the inch/year is not an issue.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's probably some slack in addition to maintenance loops in the cable but comparing the timescales of continental drift to usable life of a cable, it shouldn't be a huge issue. Years down the road (if we haven't gotten better means of doing this) we will end up putting newer cables that support even more bandwidth, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Continental drift is less than 1 inch per year. You're talking about a cable with a distance of thousands of miles. The stretch in the cable alone could take that up for far longer than the cable's service life, but when laying these cables there is slack added. </p>
<p>The cable would have to be used for hundreds of thousands of years for this to be any concern.</p>
<p>Edit: Found a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/SIQQT3h.gif" target="_blank">small gif</a> that shows how slack is added.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The cables are thousands of miles long, so moving 1 inch per year (Europe and North America plates) wouldn't account for much. There would be much more slack just from normal laying.</p>
<p>They wouldn't want the cable abnormally taut near a fault line, but these cables are designed to be able to be pulled up to the surface for repairs, so there is plenty of slack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
