		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Specifically how is likely a state secret, as it's bad policy to show exactly how your security works. However, there are presumptions that can be made.  </p>
<p>Faraday cages and other high-science interference techniques can prevent all but particular frequencies working, and someone can listen for activity on those frequencies.  If someone's sending data from the Oval, they can check to see if Trump is on his phone or not to deduce if there's a rogue sender in the room. </p>
<p>If we assume all data via the White House wifi and cell signals is being heavily tracked and monitored, that means getting any recording data out has to be done via physical means like a spy pen with a Micro SD card. Logically, that means someone of with motive to record has to have access to plant the device, and access again to pick it up.  All without looking suspicious, all while secret service and people who are genuinely good at their jobs are watching you the entire time.  </p>
<p>Further complicating this are the extremely professional and experienced White House maid staff that clean the most presidential bits you're probably wanting to record each day. They reset the rooms, dust everything, and make sure each item is in pristine condition.  It's easy to presume that they know what each item looks and feels like and are trained enough to spot a new listening device or hole in the couch.  I am willing to bet nothing stays in the Oval's couch cushions for very long so good luck getting your spy pen back.  </p>
<p>I'm not saying it's impossible, but to successfully record the president, and extract the information in a timely enough manner to actually use it is really tough.  Especially when the risks far outweigh the rewards.  </p>
<p>Sure you may get some blackmail, or good intel, but if it comes out that Sweden's housewarming gift to Trump of Ikea's latest soap holder was secretly a recording device sending out presidential nudes, that's cause for war and dissolution of several treaties.  Better to just tweet him publicly or submit an official request to the state department and see what happens.   </p>
<p>The real people you want to bug are those feeding the President information.  They know everything before he does, and getting a heads up that Trump is about to find out you are the leak allows you to get ahead of the issue and skip town or spin the narrative before that report hits his twitter feed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Little anecdote (or: cool story, bro!):</p>
<p>in summer/fall of 1989 I worked as a messenger at the U.N. to help pay for my college expenses. At the beginning of the General Assembly, President George H.W. Bush came to deliver a speech as every American president has done since the U.N. was first formed.  There were snipers and spotters on top of every building in the neighborhood.  </p>
<p>I went out at lunchtime to grab a slice of pizza to bring back with me.  As I was walking back, just as i got to the driveway, two US Secret Service guys approached and asked me to follow them.  I followed, downstairs, through the garage, and into the staircase that everyone in the place knows is a bomb &quot;tube&quot;.  Basically it is a vertical tube, solid reinforced concrete, that stretches the entire height of the Secretariat building, opened on top, and the staircase going around its perimeter.  Anything explodes in there, and the shockwave will go straight up into the air, not affecting the rest of the building.</p>
<p>Anyway, once there, they asked to see what I was carrying.  I showed them the pizza, made a joke about how they may be overreacting about how bad the stuff is for my health, and they weren't even close to laughing.  They told me an unusual amount of metal was detected on my person, and asked, always politely, if I was carrying anything they should know about.  I was recovering from a serious accident, and had big, medieval-looking steel braces on both knees.  Looked like something out of a torture museum, or S&amp;M catalogue.  I told them, and without hesitation, dropped my pants for them to see it.  They apologized for the inconvenience, thanked me for my understanding, and let me go.</p>
<p>I had not gone through any metal detectors, or even indoors in any way.  27 years ago they had the means to detect an unusual amount of metal on a person walking outdoors in a city where one is never far from a whole lot of metal.</p>
<p>Edit: details &amp; more better English.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly through physical screening and controlling access, is the short answer. Regarding the Oval Office specifically, you have to be invited in by POTUS, though each has a list of exceptions (but these are his most trusted aides). Even during tours, the Oval is specifically roped off. </p>
<p>What's important though is that the Oval isn't intended for discussing highly classified information. Of course, sensitive political information is discussed there all the time, but you could, if you were invited, bring your phone into the Oval without a blink from anyone. Yes, they likely sweep it regularly when POTUS isn't using it, as a good hygiene practice, but it's not the most sensitive space.</p>
<p>That's not true with Situation Room, however, which is a SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility). The Sit Room likely has a host of countermeasures in place, many of which are listed in other explanations. You're not allowed to bring your phone in to a SCIF as well, and again, access is very tightly controlled.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Tightly controlled access and occasional screening; but more importantly, good OPSEC practices mean the most sensitive info isn't being discussed in the Oval, but rather the Sit Room.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>Journalists don't really get to go into the Oval Office on any kind of regular basis. Certainly not as part of their regular functions as members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Correspondents%27_Association" target="_blank">White House Correspondents' Association</a>, which subjects them to an extensive credentialing process before recommending them to the White House Press Secretary for admittance to regular briefings. So while journalists may, from time to time, make it into the Oval Office, they'd most likely be there with a standing similar to any other visitor.</p>
</li>
<li><em>Everyone</em> that goes into the White House is subjected to a rigorous security screening. Once inside, non-employees are not permitted to just wander around unsupervised. Anti-surveillance sweeps aside, it's exceptionally unlikely that anyone would be able to get a bug into the White House, and even less likely that they'd have an opportunity to effectively plant it anywhere as sensitive as the Oval Office. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many good answers here, but there's one surveillance problem that continues to bug me: sound vibrations can be reproduced by bouncing a laser off a window. Basically, you send a non-visible, slightly divergent laser beam at a window, pick up the signal with a telescope somewhere in the fairly broad reflection cone, and hear everything behind the glass.</p>
<p>The countermeasures are primarily injecting enough noise into the window to completely obscure conversations. Still, the information is still there... just obscured. Hopefully enough</p>
<p>I assume that if you rested your head against a White House window, pretty much anywhere, you'd hear a white noise buzz....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
