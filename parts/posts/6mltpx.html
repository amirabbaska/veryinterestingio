		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This does not answer your question directly, but is tangentially related. We can routinely &quot;accelerate&quot; neutral atoms up to hundreds of keV or even 1 MeV through sequential ionization, acceleration, and recombination. While chargeless particles are not accelerated at any stage of this process, the net result is much faster neutral particles than you began with. This technique, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_beam_injection" target="_blank">neutral beam injection</a>, is commonly used in fusion experiments to heat the plasma. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not based off of our current theories. Electromagnetism works because we are able to create powerful fields with macroscopic tools. The other fundamental forces don't work for different reasons:</p>
<p>Gravity and Weak Nuclear Force: too weak to accelerate particles with such short lifetimes (they don't even lift)</p>
<p>Strong Force: a thing called &quot;colour confinement&quot;, essentially, once colour charges get far enough separated, they spontaneously create a pair of new charges between them to maintain colour neutrality, so we cannot have a macroscopically colour charged object (this is also why Q/G plasma is not something that can be physically separated into constituients that are not colour neutral)</p>
<p>Therefore EM is the only force usable to accelerate particles because it is the only one where we can maintain a strong enough field for a long enough time to be useful. The reason electric fields are used instead of magnetic fields is simply because they are more efficient at accelerating particles. As pointed out by multiple commenters below, it is possible to accelerate neutrons with magnetic fields, but why not just use protons and a more efficient acceleration technique?</p>
<p>Ethos: working at CERN for the summer</p>
<p>Edits for clarity (and jokes)</p>
<p>Edit2: /u/phsics pointed out an indirect acceleration method called neutral particle injection that is pretty rad</p>
<p>Edit3: clarification that where I work is not a real source, but an implication that I have aquired knowledge necessary to answer this question correctly, will return with source links</p>
<p>Edit4: As pointed out by /u/ThatPhysicistTTU , the magnetic field cannot do work on a particle, so it cannot change the energy of a charge (i.e. increase the speed of the charge). However, a dipole CAN be given more an energy by a magnetic field if the magnetic field has a high gradient.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is probably different to what you were thinking of, but you could create a beam of neutral particles (e.g. neutrinos) and slingshot them around a black hole (or any other incredibly massive body) and the result would be more energetic neutral particles.</p>
<p>A similar idea is the
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_process" target="_blank">Penrose mechanism</a>, which is a proposed method of extracting kinetic energy from a rotating black hole.</p>
<p>I know this is kind of cheating but some physicits have spoken about how humanity may eventually resort to using black holes for particle acceleration when we reach the limit of how energetic we can make traditional accelerators</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a physics grad student currently working on something called a Stark decelerator, which can accelerate (we mostly use it to decelerate to rest and trap) neutral objects that have an electric dipole moment. Fundamental particles unfortunately don't* have electric dipole moments, but atoms and molecules can (we study molecules).  There are also zeeman decelerators that can accelerate objects with a magnetic dipole moment, which particles can have (although, since I work on decelerating molecules and atoms I don't know how feasible it would be to use it to accelerate particles. </p>
<p>Both of these work on the same principle. The dipole moment interacts with the field to change the potential energy of the particle. There are many stages where you can create a high field that can be switched off. To accelerate, you time the switching so that the fields are turned on when the particles are in the region of high field. As they move away from the high field they lose potential energy and gain kinetic energy, meaning they were accelerated. To decelerate, you time the switching so that the particle enters the high field region, gaining potential energy and losing kinetic energy, and then the fields are quickly turned off, leaving the particles with less kinetic energy (they were decelerated). </p>
<p>Maybe not what you were looking for, but in principle the answer to your question is yes.</p>
<p>Edit: the asterisk is because I work in a building with people who are searching for the electron electric dipole moment which should exist in some theories beyond the standard model.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well you can accelerate charged particles, and create a beam of neutral particles by having the beam interact with materials and focusing the particles that result from those interactions.
