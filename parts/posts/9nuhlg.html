Is this the muscles tightening or something? They must have muscle tissue because how else would they move? Is there another way for an ant or spider to move their legs? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every animal with a nervous system also has muscles.  From an evolutionary standpoint, they are actually just one system.  There are a few animals that do not have muscles but the vast majority do.  Both of your examples have muscles.</p>
<p>In the case of spiders, they don't have the muscles in the legs.  Their muscles instead pump fluid into their legs which controls the movement.  Kind of like a tiny hydraulics system.  When they die, these muscles relax and the fluid flows back into their body.  If you take a dead spider or mite and gently squeeze the body, you can actually see the legs straighten back out.</p>
<p>With ants, they do have muscles in their legs.  They are on the inside similar to <a href="https://www.deluxeseafoodgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed4.png" target="_blank">crab legs</a> just much smaller.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP - the top comments in this thread are wrong.</p>
<p>Spider legs DO have muscles in them. Hydraulic pressure is the major force for extending the legs, but flexion is driven by muscles in the legs as seen <a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/215/4/578/F1.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" target="_blank">here</a> from <a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/4/578" target="_blank">this paper on spider legs and locomotion</a></p>
<p>Secondly, most arthropods do not use hydraulics - they use muscles for extension and flexion. The muscles are attached to the inside of the exoskeleton in a way very similar to the photo I posted. See <a href="http://aworldofbiology.weebly.com/uploads/3/2/1/4/32143827/1469476551.png" target="_blank">here</a> for a comparison of insect musculature to ours. You'll notice the attachment point of the muscle is what makes it an extensor or a flexor just like ours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxrLYv0QXa4" target="_blank">There is a really cool episode of Smarter Every Day</a>where they show a dragonfly's wing muscles in slow motion and close up. Most flying insects have indirect musculature, which is where muscles are attached to the inside walls of the body (thorax) instead of directly to the wings. To move the wings up and down, the muscles pull down, the wing pivots on the thorax, the body squeezes and then pushes back out, pivoting the wings the other direction, and then the cycle repeats. Dragonflies are unique in that they have direct musculature, meaning each wing is independently controlled by two muscles, so they can push and pull with much more control.</p>
<p>And then SciShow recently talked about this, too, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk-B4baggkA" target="_blank">an episode about why many dead bugs are on their backs.</a>They have pretty robust muscles and coordination to support such top-heavy bodies. They show a beetle that can somersault itself upright, for instance, but as bugs age or when they are sick, they can't do this as well. And because many also have curved bodies that make it easier to roll over and get stuck with such a high center of gravity, many die belly up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insects and crustaceans do use muscles to move their limbs. But spiders, very interestingly, don't! They have a pressurized body cavity, and use hydrolic power to move their legs! Not sure about their mandibles or spinnerets and such. (Although the pressure of the body cavity is generated by muscles. So in that sense they do use muscles to move their legs; just indirectly.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
