		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really short version:</p>
<p>Endorphins block pain receptors.  They're basically natural opioids and function in a really similar manner.  They produce a similar feeling of euphoria to other opioids.</p>
<p>Dopamine controls how much you are rewarded for a positive action.  It doesn't directly produce a feeling of pleasure but rather increases the desire to perform the action again.</p>
<p>Serotonin regulates mood.  More generally means that you're happier while less tends to mean you're not happy.  It doesn't directly cause pleasure either.</p>
<p>Of course, all of these have numerous other functions but you seemed to be most concerned with brain states.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These are natures way to motivate you to survival ,by giving you an incentive  to be happy. These are responsible for your happiness. Imagine you're a cave man preparing for life .
Stage 1 :Endorphins :Physical activity ) . Activities like running climbing hunting, releases Endorphins that makes you feel good just doing physical work.
Results: increase in physical
Fitness and skills</p>
<p>Stage 2: Dopamine:Focus and reward for hunting. you need to hunt and find fruit, which requires physical and mental ability, and dopamine is released when you find the fruit, and figure a way to bring it down. A dopamine shot is given when you eat the fruits of your hard work.
Result: motivated to achieve goals and targets</p>
<p>Stage 3. Serotonin: Recognition for your hard work and hunting fruits. Imagine you have found a way to bring down a fruit from this tree filled with snakes. And once the fruit is down your tribe praises and recognizes your brilliance. A serotonin is given when you feel important and recognized.
Result: Motivation to do things that are useful to the group.and Stay in the group.</p>
<p>Stage 4: Oxytocin: Love for your long term efforts and sacrifice.  Now that the group recognizes you as a good Hunter, you come to the village with pride and the young women are now so attracted to you. You have sex and the women shower amazing love and affection. A oxytocin shot is given when you feel loved.
Result: motivation to do things for the greater good and receive sex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll copy a comment I left a month or so ago on a very similar question (that also inquired about oxytocin):</p>
<p>Dopamine is probably the closest thing to a &quot;happiness chemical&quot; of the four. It is responsible for the feeling of reward when you do something you're proud of, or when you give your body something it wants (food, drugs, sex, etc).</p>
<p>Endorphins generally can be thought of as more of a physical happiness. They are chemicals that calm your body, ease pain, and provide a general comfort physically. This is what gets released in response to pain: after a serious injury, or even by eating something really spicy. </p>
<p>Seratonin can be responsible for happiness because, in general, is is responsible for our overall mood. It is theorized to be at least partially responsible for consciousness in general. It is the reason we feel anything at all. It can be &quot;happy&quot; but it has many many more roles than just that. It is essentially responsible for how we perceive reality, whether that be good or bad. </p>
<p>Oxytocin is responsible for the feeling of love/infatuation, which can be considered as happy, but that is really a different feeling all together. You can be happy and not feel love, and conversely, you can feel love without being happy. </p>
<p>This is all a very broad generalization, as these chemicals have many functions other than this, and there is definitely some overlap, but for the most part this is accurate for the purposes of your question. </p>
<p>You can get a good idea of what these chemicals do by looking at the effects of illicit drugs that work on the same system. Uppers like cocaine and amphetamine affect the dopamine system in your brain. That's why they make you feel good, happy, and energetic. Opiates such as heroin and Vicodin work on the same pathways as endorphins, this is why they are pain killers. Psychedelics affect your serotonin pathways, this is why they completely alter your perception of reality. As far as I know, however, there is no illicit replacement for oxytocin. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is the difference between adrenaline and norepinephrine?</p>
<p>And now regarding the question.</p>
<p>When I fell with my bike, I made a hole in my pants and I got a bruise but I didn't feel pain. It wasn't until 5-10 min later when I got home that I felt pain. What was being released? My guess is Adrenaline but I'm not 100% sure. </p>
<p>When I have a headache and masturbate, it obviously feels good and my headache seems to dissappear but when I stop masturbating I can feel the headache coming back. My guess is endorphins but yet again not 100% sure. </p>
<p>When I listen to music I kinda feel happy. I really love music and I can even stare at a wall for minutes while I have my headphones on and not be bored. I can also just lie on my bed with headphones and just close my eyes and not move a muscle for 2 hours and not be bored. This obviously only works when I have music so my guess is that Dopamine is being released but yet again not 100% sure.</p>
<p>When I was a kid I played soccer and I remember once when I scored a beautiful goal and I could hear my trainer/coach say: &quot;What a beautiful fucking goal&quot;. After hearing him say it, I kinda felt proud and like I &quot;belonged&quot; on the team. I also felt important. My guess is that Serotonin was being released but yet again not 100% sure. </p>
<p>I remember when I finished my last big assignment in school, I felt like I was at piece because I've been working on this for a year. I didn't feel super happy but I did feel content and at piece like a whole chapter was done in my life. This feeling got even more intense when I found out I passed. My guess here is oxytocin but yet again not 100%.</p>
<p>Did I get these things right or where some things wrong? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to point out that the more recent research suggests that endorphins may not be related at all to pain relief and that the real chemicals responsible are endocannabinoids, which are the chemicals produced within our own bodies that bind to cannabinoid receptors. Endorphins have been shown to be too large to pass the blood brain barrier and therefore, despite the correlation between their release in the body during exercise, it is unlikely they directly affect the opioid receptors as initially postulated.
