		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, the problem is, if everything is falling together, how can food 'fall' through the digestive system?</p>
<p>The simple answer is that it dosen't! It dosen't in space and it dosen't on earth either. The food in your mouth is pushed to the stomach by muscles in the lining of the tube between mouth and your stomach. Then, in your stomach the digested food is pushed again into your intestines. While in the intestines it is pushed all the way to the, well, to the end.</p>
<p>As a simple experiment, try drinking water while standing on your head. You will be amazed that you can indeed swallow the water. You could even eat a full meal on your head and you would have no problem getting your food where it belongs. You might want to get on your feet, though, before it all gets to. . . . the end! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stomach got valves on the input and the output, so the valves trap the food in the stomach to be digested.  </p>
<p>Also gotta remember, stomach is full of chewed up food and liquids - if it had gas, a person would burp it back out.  So it's kind of like how astronauts train in swimming pools because it's kind of like space - the environment of the stomach is already not so different on earth than it is in space. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually asked an astronaut this question at a meet and greet in 2009 and his answer was: in space, your stomach and digestion system don’t always know which way it should be pushing food. He complained of this as an early and ongoing issue for his trip to the ISS. So it would seem that at least some of the digestion processes are aided by gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest way to think of this is on earth you stomach will act like a water bag, the pressure in the bag acting down due to gravity. In space your stomach would act more like a balloon, the pressure pushing outward in every direction. That is why most people feel sick when they experience 0g.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
