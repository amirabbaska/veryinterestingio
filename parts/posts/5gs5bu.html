It's great though and appreciate all of you sharing your thoughts on my question. Definitely learnt some new knowledge. One thing I have to say though, I find it sad that some Africa Americans here had to sway to these stereotypes and stop eating watermelon. I think life is too short not to enjoy what is a pretty great fruit and certainly not allow a stereotype to control your life. I'm a minority as well where I grew up and plenty of stereotypes about us too so I know the feeling, but when it comes to food, one of the biggest pleasures in life, I'm not giving any of it up! </p></div></div>
