		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. The US Navy railgun can accelerate projectiles to Mach 6. This is merely 2 km/s. You need 7.6 km/s to get into orbit and significantly more to reach the Moon (haven't done the math but it must be slightly less than 11.2 km/s which is escape speed).</p>
<p>Even if we had a railgun powerful enough to reach orbital speed, at such great speeds and with the high density of air at sea level the projectile would burn up like a meteor and probably never leave the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Some enthusiasts of the rail gun idea affirm that a heat shield could resist this effect and that launching fast enough could account for speed loss to air drag. Honestly I haven't found reputable sources confirming this or showing the math, and I seriously doubt it because of the very high air density at low altitudes. Spacecraft reentering the atmosphere usually burn up at altitudes between 80km and 120km.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Max Q during ascent has been 35 kilopascals. I believe capsules have endured as much as 90 kilopascals during descent. To give you an idea, a severe hurricane has a dynamic pressure of 3 kilopascals.</p>
<p>Achieving orbital velocity (7.7 km/s) would inflict about 36 <strong>thousand</strong> kilopascals. Achieving orbital velocity at the top of Mount Chimborazo would inflict about 17 thousand kilopascals.</p>
<p>The payload would be torn apart, burned up and would never make it out of atmosphere.</p>
<p>However a railgun on the moon wouldn't have this problem. No air. I see in Katinia's comments that these have accomplished 2 km/s. Which is sufficient to achieve lunar orbital velocity although a small burn would be required to raise perilune.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
