		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Money saving tip: just put 1/3 cup kernels in a brown paper bag, roll the top down and microwave on high for two minutes. Perfect every time, healthier (I add EVOO and NaCl as I prefer) and a fraction of the price. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a super thin lining of aluminium foil on one side of the popcorn bag which, when placed downwards, acts as a pan and causes the temperature to rise much faster than just through the microwaves heating up the water. </p>
<p>It took the inventor of microwave popcorn, Jim Watkins, much research to find the exact amount of foil that would act as the accelerator without causing the microwave oven to break down.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a side-note: never place the bag on a plate (eg: if the microwave is dirty). The glass rotating disc on the bottom of the microwave does NOT conduct heat, so all the heat gets transferred to the seeds. A regular plate DOES conduct heat, so the oil in the bag will heat up your plate instead of the seeds. Your popcorn won't pop and your plate will break in half.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually bag construction. The idea is to allow the easiest possible expansion of the bag. If you put it upside down, it's feasible that one of the book folds would get stuck underneath the bag, leaving less room for the corn to expand into. That would then possibly make the rest of the bag break. Not super likely, of course, but may as well just tell people to put it the way up that causes the least amount of potential problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thermal shielding (metal) on 1 side radiates the microwaves better, heating the oil &amp; kernels more proficiently to help avoid unpopped kernels, in theory. It's never 100%</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
