		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wire length, wire diameter, and wire material all effect total wire resistance.  If you know the resistance of the cable, r, you can calculate the maximum theoretical power transfer across that cable to a phone, which is a maximum when the phone appears to have the same resistance as the cable (for an ideal power supply, which isn't the case, but we'll ignore that fact.)</p>
<p>Total Power = v*i</p>
<p>Power in device = 1/2 v*i</p>
<p>i = v/(2*r)</p>
<p>power in device = 1/2 [v] <em> [v/(2</em>r)]</p>
<p>power in device = v^2 /(4r)</p>
<p>For a 5v charger, you get</p>
<p>power = 6.25/r</p>
<p>r = 6.25/power</p>
<p>So, if you want to transfer 10 watts to your phone, you need a cable that has no more than 6.25/10 ohms or .625 ohms.</p>
<p>A 1-meter cheap thin cable might have .6 ohms and be able to charge at 10W (slightly more than 2 amps).  A cheap thin 5-meter long cable might have 1.4 ohms and only be able to charge to 4.5 watts. (just over 900ma).</p>
<p>Real power supplies aren't ideal and have an internal resistance that must be added to that of the cable.  That means the situation is a little worse than we just calculated.  The good news is that while their resistance isn't generally published, it is typically small for a good charger.  Also keep in mind that this is the maximum theoretical power, and not all phones can achieve it.  Between the phone and charger and cable, short cheap cables generally work fine, as do longer heavy-duty cables, but cheap cables longer than about .5 meter may restrict your charging rate.</p>
<p>Whether they are generic or not, the main thing to look for in longer cables is thicker wiring (low AWG).  Harder to check, but also important, are the quality of the USB connectors at the ends of the cable and the quality of the soldering that joins them to the wire.</p>
<p>Incidentally, USB-C generally eliminates this problem by adopting higher voltages as part of the official standard.  Higher voltages mean more maximum power for the phone and less wasted power through the cable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
