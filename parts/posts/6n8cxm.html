		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of animals do have the females raise the offspring, others have both help, or just the male, and others still just lay the eggs and abandon them.</p>
<p>As to why these strategies develop: the simple answer is that it works in regards to the environment they live in. Something to understand about animal evolution is that &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; isn't necessarily about being the biggest, baddest, toughest creature out there and not &quot;fit&quot; in a exercise-y sense, but rather that animals evolve to be the best &quot;fit&quot; to their environment. This can include size, teeth and claws, and brainpower, but it also includes things like social dynamics, integument like feathers or fur, and reproductive behaviors. Because, at the end of the day, an animal could be aggressive and dominant but it's not going to be &quot;fit&quot; to it's environment if it can't reproduce successfully.</p>
<p>First of all, the ancestral strategy and most popular for animal reproduction is the hands-off approach: where the young as eggs are released en masse into the environment to fend for themselves and a few make it to adulthood. This has the obvious disadvantage of most of your young being eaten and you wasting resources, so over time some animals may have started taking care of their young, laying smaller clutches of eggs, and eventually, in some cases such as some sharks, snakes, and mammals, hatching and nurturing the eggs inside (usually) the female's body and giving live birth. Now, with the advantage of your young being more likely to survive to adulthood, you're stuck with the disadvantage of them requiring many more resources from you to raise, so then you start evolving different strategies to minimize effort and maximize offspring that make it to adulthood in your environment and according to your biology.</p>
<p>For example, with songbirds and pigeons both parents incubate and feed the young as they grow rapidly. The eggs they lay are often very large compared to the size of the female and take a lot of nutrients out of her. But with jacanas (a family of wading birds), the female lays several clutches of eggs with different males and the males raise them while she wanders around protecting her territory. She's thought to be able to afford this because of how rich the food and calcium gets during their breeding season. On the other extreme, megapodes (in the same clade as chickens and quails) simply lay their eggs in mounds like crocodiles do and the eggs hatch fully flighted and ready to take care of themselves, even though they do go a step above the ancestral behavior and guard the mound.</p>
<p>So it's mostly about what works in the environment and how much the parents have to invest into creating their young in the first place. It's possible that female mammals especially might have more interest in their young because of how demanding pregnancy is on the mother. Males join in or females opt out according to what best &quot;fits&quot; the environment and the demands of the young.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The majority of species in the world are actually insects, and predominantly don't raise their young at all. Those that do are normally hive based creatures, who often use male drones to provide most of the care of the eggs. </p>
<p>Avian species mostly have both parents performing support roles.</p>
<p>You are likely thinking mostly of mammals, and the reason is that only the female has mammary glands, meaning that for new borns the division of labour is guaranteed to be the female providing sustenance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My time, I guess! </p>
<p>This is true for most mammals and also for some other taxa to some extent. The reason behind the phenomenon is the amount of energy spent by the individual per unit gamete (sex cells). A male human ejaculates close to 35 million sperm cells every time, whereas a female produces one ovum per cycle for about 35 years only. Also, for mammals with menstrual cycle, the male never knows if the child is his. </p>
<p>Biologically, therefore, the female invests more towards one ovum and 'feels compelled' to take care of it until it can live on its own. This is why quality is important for females when it comes to sexual selection compared to quantity for males.</p>
<p>I have tried not to use any jargon to keep it ELI5. No pitchforks please.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time the female is absolutely certain that their baby is their own, and the father almost never has that same kind of certainty. And female eggs are way more expensive resource wise than the infinite sperm males can produce. A female only gets a few good shots at it and it turns their body upside down making sure those few shots land. I think if all these little factors and others applied to males instead of females, then we'd typically find males caring for offspring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not always females! Many species involve paternal, or even biparental care. However, providing for young is inherently costly to parents, as any decision to perform behaviour that helps young takes food/resources/time away from a caring parent. It is therefore evolutionarily beneficial to any one sex to <em>not</em> be the primary caregiver. When an evolving species must &quot;select&quot; one sex to be the caregiver, three main theories come into play:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Parental Investment:
Sperm cells, in general, even when added together in mass, come to less than the mass of an egg cell (consider maternal brooding chickens, with huge eggs and very regular size sperm). This disparity in investment between the mother and father leads to the idea that the male can abandon a brood with little consequence, whilst a female loses out more if she abandons to try and get the male to look after the offspring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 'Race to abandonment'
This idea runs with a continuation of both parents wanting to abandon the brood, leaving the other sex to care for the offspring. If the female incubates the eggs/embryo, the male is actually free to leave the brood behind, whereas the female is tied to her offspring in the womb, and therefore is obligated to care for them. Evidence for this idea comes in seahorses, where the father often carries the developing young (and not surprisingly, often cares for them!), as well as sergeant fish, where males carry young in their mouth after they are born, and thus have to provide food for them. </p>
</li>
<li>Embryonic contact
This is the idea that developing embryos genetically and physiologically 'prepare' their parents to look after them. Because of this, female bodies and physiology are often altered to change behaviour towards a more caring and nurturing attitude. Again, in cases where males carry developing embryos, similar behavioural and physiological changes are induced. </li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this helps, and let me know any further questions/ideas! I'm happy to provide all sorts of interesting example creatures if you're interested :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
