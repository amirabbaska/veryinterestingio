<p>They really are a fucking cool example of modern manufacturing and the evolution of a single product over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some energy drinks and half litter beverages has a resealable lid, that rotates over and off the hole. </p>
<p>The reason they aren't the norm is that they are more expensive to produce, and often you don't need to reseal a 33cl can, as you will drink all of it in one sitting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The one I saw had a plastic tab that could be popped out to drinking the pushed back into place to close the can.</p>
<p>Other option is those aluminum can bottles that have a twist off cap that can be screwed back into place.</p>
<p>In both cases they are rare because of increased cost to manufacturer.   Your standard aluminum can is an engineering marvel that has developed over the last 100 yrs or so.  It takes the absolute minimum amount of aluminum to make the can and still be strong and durable enough transport.  Every aspect of it has been engineered for a specific purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because things in aluminum cans are single serve and generally consumed in one sitting.  There is no need for the extra expense to make something resealable when 99% of the people will never actually need to reseal it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you crack open any soft drink its going to go flat no matter how hard you seal it up again. All bottle caps or seals do is stop more air getting in which only prolongs the effects. </p>
<p>They aren't used that muchmostly because they're expensive to make and not that practical. Useful for sleep deprived college students who want to sip at their Monster throughout the day, but most people would rather just buy a plastic bottle for about the same price. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
