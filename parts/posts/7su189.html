		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble" target="_blank">Filter bubbles</a>, by encouraging you to engage only with content you already engage with regularly, maximize engagement with their services and thus shareholder value and ad revenue.</p>
<p>It also &quot;sanitizes&quot; the content, since censoring controversial or offensive content is taken as part of the tailoring, so it's more friendly and non-controversial for advertisers.</p>
<p>In other words, by tailoring the content you see to be only naively what's &quot;relevant&quot; to you, they create a welcoming and non-challenging content environment where everything is in agreement with you and your personality profile, so you feel rewarded and comfortable in that environment, and thus spend more time in the platforms. This directly rewards them by increasing profit potential.</p>
<p>(In my opinion, it's a really messed up thing based on entirely misguided motivations, but our society is based on misguided incentives anyway, so it's not surprising.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The goal of a social media website is to make as much money from people as it can. One of the ways it does that is by keeping people on the site as long as possible. </p>
<p>With a simple chronological feed of posts they can’t effectively control what content you see, at any point what you see could get you to leave (or fail to make you stay). </p>
<p>The “algorithms” people constantly refer to monitor your time on their site and pay attention to what kinds of post make you like/share, comment, stop scrolling, log out, etc. and will chose what posts to show you to make sure you don’t leave. </p>
<p>Now the scary bit is if you’re the type of person who frequently gets into internet arguments then you’re encouraging the algorithm to deliberately show you things that will make you upset (because they know you’ll stick around to comment). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
