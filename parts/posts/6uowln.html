		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The walls of the cage are a barrier just like with any other cage. If you're both inside or both outside the cage it's like the cage isn't there. If one is inside and the other outside the RF can't get through the cage. Of course, the design of the cage and the conditions it's used under determine its effectiveness but ideally the RF won't pass through the walls of the cage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually use these on a regular basis and also usually carry my cell phone. As soon as I enter, with the door open, my cell phone goes to high power mode (draining the battery) so I don't carry my phone. As soon as the door to the chamber door is closed there is absolutely no signal. No RF energy in or out on a good chamber.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i guess it depends on the cage itself and the wavelength of the radio signals that should pass through it.
Normal radio frequencies are around 100MHz which equals to a wavelength of 3m. With higher frequencies you need smaller meshes in your cage to stop the waves from passing the cage.
Just like the black grid in your microwave does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it is a good Faraday cage it will block the radio signals.  That is basically the function/definition of a Faraday cage.</p>
<p>You can easily defeat the function of the cage by snaking a wire into the cage with a length both inside and outside of the cage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what frequency you are using and how the cage is designed.
If the openings in the cage is bigger than the wavelength of what you what is regarded it will pass through. </p>
<p>A car for example works as a faradays cage regarding lightning but you can use a cellphone without problem. Am/fm radio on the other hand can't pass through so you need your antenna on the outside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
