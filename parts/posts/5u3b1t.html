		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you cook, you're trying to get heat from outside the food to inside the food. There's lots of different ways to do that. Baking in an oven isn't actually very efficient! You can sear a steak on a very hot skillet in 2-3 minutes, but baking the same steak to the right doneness might take an hour in an oven. Because the oven's so bad at getting heat inside food, trying to turn the heat to the same levels as the skillet will leave you with a completely burned outside and a near-raw inside in a hurry.</p>
<p>There's also certain chemical things that happen in food when we cook it. At very high temperatures, beef &quot;browns&quot;, which creates very pleasant and complex flavors. That's why fancy steaks are almost always seared. You can bake a smaller steak in an oven, but you'll never quite get the same kind of flavor that searing creates. Low temperatures also do things! Pot roasts are generally tough cuts of meat, but after being kept in a slow cooker at around 200 degrees for hours, the heat will have broken down much of the tissue that makes the meat tough and turned it into a tender, tasty meal. Brisket and many other cuts are almost inedible unless cooked this way.</p>
<p>That's beef, though. Why do most of the things we cook fall in the 350-425 degree range? Well, I'm thinking of a lot of the things I throw in the oven. Frozen pizzas, frozen snacks... I'm not trying to <em>cook</em> those so much as <em>warm</em> them. But &quot;hot air&quot; isn't super good at getting heat inside food. So if I crank the heat up too high, I'll burn the outside and have a frozen inside. (Microwaves are the opposite: they're better at getting heat <em>inside</em> food. That's why pizza rolls take 20 minutes in the oven but only 2 minutes in the microwave. But that kind of 'heat' isn't so good at browning, so it never crisps them quite right, does it?)</p>
<p>That's what's going on with a lot of foods, too. Go much hotter than 425 and the heat can't penetrate the food fast enough to stop you from burning too much. Go much lower than 350 and it's going to take hours to heat the food enough, and in many foods like bread it might be important to generate some steam before certain reactions finish. That's why a lot of instructions for baking turkeys suggest cooking at two different temperatures. In one phase, the goal is to slowly get heat inside the turkey without drying out or burning the outside. In the other phase, the goal is to brown the outside to create more flavor.</p>
<p>Cooking often involves a LOT of complex chemistry, and delicate balancing acts of temperature.</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>Wow. This is without a doubt my most popular post ever. Thanks for the gold, and thanks for so many comments. I want to address a few things, it seems there's a lot of nitpicking.</p>
<p>In general, I wanted to cover &quot;high heat burns the outside before the middle gets hot enough, low heat takes too long and can't brown&quot;. It's ELI5, not an exhaustive guide to the science of cooking. There's lots of dishes that can't take 300 degrees, lots of processes like denaturing proteins I didn't get into, etc. I already feel like the post is too long for ELI5, I couldn't talk about every potential interaction.</p>
<p>Similarly, I appreciate corrections on how microwaves work, but again that was really a one-off example. I know about how microwaves excite water molecules, and that moisture content matters, etc. It's still true a microwave can cook, say, a chicken breast much faster than an oven but in so doing you miss out on things like browning. All of this makes the post even longer and distracts from answering, &quot;Why do we bake things within a specific temperature range.&quot;</p>
<p>Sometimes, when explaining complicated topics to people who want a rough answer, it helps to make gross oversimplifications. I think /r/AskScience is far more appropriate for the level of detail most of you are striving to find!</p>
<p>And yes, I do cook more things than pizza rolls. But it's a lot easier for people to relate to pizza rolls than &quot;that time I made spanakopita&quot;, and if I'd started talking about baking bread I'd have been WAY too encouraged to get into the chemical details.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bulk of what we eat is actually made of the same or very similar stuff:</p>
<p>Flour, sugar, eggs for baked goods,</p>
<p>Protein, fat for meats.</p>
<p>The big difference is in the thickness of those components.</p>
<p>Ovens are actually very inefficient because most of their heat is infrared radiation that hits the top layer of the thing you are cooking and very slowly that layer conducts heat in.</p>
<p>The hot air conducts some heat too but again it only hits that outside layer.</p>
<p>The higher the temperature the faster that outside layer heats up but the variation in conducting that heat in is very small.</p>
<p>Therefor, with a lot of trial and error since gas ovens were invented (Wood etc before were just not precise enough that the exact temperature mattered versus how long to leave something in), we've learned that that temperature range, 375 +- 50 for wheat, 425 +- 50 for proteins, depending on thickness is the best middle point between letting the heat get to the middle of whatever you're cooking and nto burning the outside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First I'll hit on lower temps: below the range you mention it would either take too long, or more importantly, the food would simply &quot;warm up&quot; rather than have chemical reactions occur (not enough heat to promote browning, crisping, and caramelization... including an important reaction [to flavor and texture] known as the Maillard reaction, as others have mentioned). </p>
<p>You can though, for example, cook a steak at a very low temp, like under 150F, to get it &quot;warmed up&quot; to an internal temp that people like, then hit it with some really high heat in a skillet to brown and crisp the outside, which people also like. But this is more complicated, so it's not as common. (As a side note, a newer method growing in popularity, known as sous-vide, is made to do that first part...  immersing vacuum sealed food, usually meat, in temperature controlled water at lower than usual cooking temps, but again not as common).</p>
<p>As for higher temps that the range you list - for some foods that actually does work (like commercial pizza ovens, that are usually around 800F), but those applications aren't as common so it's not worth the cost and complexity to make home ovens even go that high. Plus it would be more dangerous in a home. </p>
<p>The other issue with high temp, and again even more important, is just that the outside of most &quot;food sized&quot; items will burn before the inside is heated up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cook here! Bacteria starts dying at 130F. That's the minimum temp for being &quot;cooked&quot;. Whatever the outside temp is, the inside generally must reach at least this temperature, however long it takes.  </p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<ul>
<li>140 is  holding temp, also the internal temp for a medium/medium well steak. Not high enough to really break down tissue, but not low enough for bacteria to grow. </li>
<li>160F is the internal temperature of chicken that is safe to eat</li>
<li>180 F is the temp for poaching a food, something delicate that can't handle a boil. Water transfers heat more efficiently than air. </li>
<li>212 is the temp water boils at. Boiled potatoes takes 12~ minutes, same cut/size to roast is 40~</li>
<li>250 is a temp you would cook something at for hours, like smoking a pork shoulder for 6 hours. </li>
<li>350 is a good temp for roasting something over a moderate amount of time</li>
<li>425 won't cook anything to 160 in the middle, but it will make the outside crispy very fast. </li>
<li>500+ is for pizza </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all about chemistry. The Maillard reaction, when sugars caramelize and react with amino acids, is what makes foods brown when cooked. It requires at least around 300°F, and higher temperatures can make it more pronounced. Anything cooked below that temperature is usually something where caramelization/browning is undesired, like Meringues, which cook at about 200°F.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
