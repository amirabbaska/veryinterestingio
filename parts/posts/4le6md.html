		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a fair amount of evidence from fMRI, PET and EEG studies that show involvement of the primary motor cortex in motor imagery tasks. I've performed a bunch of experiments with EEG motor potentials during ballistic movements (they evoke sharp, strong and easy to detect signals in the EEG), and I've even been involved in a brain-computer interface experiment which pretty successfully detects motor imagery so motor imagery is definitely activating very similar regions to what an actual movement activates.</p>
<p>So, looking at the evolution of scalp potentials over time around the time of a ballistic movement, there's a clear bilateral activation of frontal areas up to one second /before/ movement (the (in)famous bereitschaftpotential) that &quot;travels&quot; towards the back of the head as motor planning takes place and gives way to motor execution and, later, the evaluation of visual and proprioceptive feedback from the execution of the movement. At some point, the cortex will &quot;assemble&quot; a motor command which then is, possibly, &quot;filtered&quot; through lower structures and the cerebellum (which seems to play a prominent role in error processing and correction), to be then sent through the wires in the spine to respective muscles.</p>
<p>As far as I know from reading, experiments and the wisdom of my superiors, motor imagery pretty much runs the same &quot;program&quot; up to a point, but the motor command is never sent. Some groups have reported interesting results on motor imagery for motor learning (ie. training), showing that rehearsing, or &quot;visualizing&quot; a movement, seems to have effects closely resembling actual training to some extent. Of course it will never be as efficient as actual training with feedback, but it does inform us somehow.</p>
<p>Since motor imagery is usually dependent on visualizing the movement (more or less vividly), there is some speculation that mirror neurons are more involved than pathways and cells more related to actual movement, but it's all speculation at this point. </p>
<p>So in short, the difference is relatively small, as the brain still has to compute the movement, predict the outcome, and &quot;imagine&quot; the results. A lot of the chips and wires used will be the same as the ones used in actually moving, but we can consciously suppress the motor output, so in a sense, the body doesn't have to differentiate anything, because nothing really leaves the brain. </p>
<p>I just woke up so I might not make sense, I can dig up some interesting sources later if there's more interest.</p>

<p>edit: holy crap that's a lot of questions in the comments! I'll do my best to try and answer as much as i can, thanks for the interest</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One theory, the ideomotor theory, explains this quite well. Every action has an associated idea. Whilst the action itself originates from the motor cortex and is calibrated through the subcortical structures, such as the basal ganglia and cerebellum, it is argued that the action is driven by the idea/intention of the action in the premotor cortex.</p>
<p>What is fascinating is that these neurones in the premotor cortex, 'mirror neurones', will fire to some degree when an individual observes the action in someone else, leading credence to the ideamotor theory.</p>
<p>I would guess that you are only activating the idea/'mirror neurones' when imagining then recruiting the motor cortex neurones when actual movement occurs.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the topic you really should look into the mirror neurone system.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have participated in research that looks at the fMRI of people that are paralyzed attempting to move their paralyzed limbs versus healthy people actually moving their limbs and the fMRI results of our study showed there is no statistically significant difference between the brain's activation pattern for these two actions. However, one could argue this study is not exactly relevant because their spinal injuries that led to their paralysis are responsible for their inability. I have never participated in research that specifically aimed to answer your question. Using the knowledge I gained studying for my degree however, the actual movement of your arm would result in activation of the motor cortex where as only thinking about it would not as much. However, I think what your question is really getting at is &quot;what is consciousness?&quot; This is one of the greatest neurological/biological questions of our time. (Dr. Richard Dawkins did an AMA recently and was asked what he thought was the most mysterious biological question of our time and he mentioned the biological basis for consciousness). The question is, where does the &quot;prefrontal potential&quot;, that is to say the original action potential that sets off the cascade of brain activities that leads to efferent action, come from? Human beings seemingly will this action potential of origin into existence whenever they want. Yet conservation of energy laws tell us that energy can not be created. Our existential will some how creates forces? Our very will changes the electrochemical gradient between the intracellular fluid and our extracellular fluid in order to produce this action potential of origin?  Why can I stare at the water bottle at the end of my desk for 20 minutes but on the 21st minute I choose to pick it up? I am not reacting to a changing environment, there is no changing stimulus to which I am responding. I have been to a conference where one speaker believed that the &quot;prefrontal potential&quot; is a scientific basis for a soul. That is a little too metaphysical for me but it is a fun thought experiment don't you think? You figure this question out and you will win yourself a Nobel Prize Mr. PiratePenguin.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP's question asks what is the difference between thinking about a movement, say moving your arm and the difference between actually willing your arm to move. We know most of the major parts of the brain that enable conscious movement to happen, we even know the full (superficial) anatomical pathways that lead to it. I will generalize/simplify the process into 3 parts and their function below using the example of moving your arm:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Prefrontal cortex: This is where you consciously think, experience emotions and sums up what makes you human. This is also where you express the first desire to move your arm, but haven't actually moved anything yet or planned it out. You are merely saying to yourself &quot;Hey I want to move my arm&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-motor cortex: This brain area exists between the pre-frontal (conscious thinking) and the motor cortex. This is where movement is planned out. It receives the command that YeOlePiratePenguin wants to move their arm from the pre-frontal cortex and has the instructions for how to move it including which way all the muscles and joints need to move in space or simple put it says ok, &quot;this is how you move your arm&quot;. BUT you still haven't moved yet, you have planned out the movement only. (I posted this earlier in this thread, but theres decent evidence that just by thinking about a movement a lot and engaging the pre-frontal and pre-motor cortex, you can actually improve proficiency of that movement without physically moving).</p>
</li>
<li>Motor cortex: This is the area that receives the instructions for movement from the pre-motor cortex and actually activates the neural tracts that run down the spinal cord to your arm muscles and activate the proper muscles from the instructions it received or simplified as &quot;I will follow the instructions and move OP's arm&quot;. There are actually designated areas in the motor cortex that are specific to each area of the body, i.e. an arm area, a leg area etc, that are &quot;wired&quot; to the corresponding muscle groups through the spinal cord, this designation of areas is called a homunculus.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is still debated about what the difference is from thinking about a movement versus actually doing said movement in a healthy person. However, it is currently believed that, plot twist (dramatic pause) it is the prefrontal cortex that also halts the thought of movement from becoming real movement! Case in point, the prefrontal cortex sends a desire to move, but also at the same time is saying that I don't really want anything to move, I just want to to think about it. You will activate the pre-motor cortex and there will be instructions for movement accessed but you will also access instructions for non-movement as well which will win out since you mentally don't want to move. A fun way to test this is to have your friend think about moving their right arm for like 2-3 minutes in total silence and then scare them. Their whole body will startle in reflex, but their right arm usually will twitch and move more then the rest of their body. This is because you have just momentarily exposed them to the fear stimulus which besides activating certain reflexes, has &quot;convinced them&quot; for a split second that they want to move and thus movement will happen.</p>

<p>Note: I horrendously oversimplified everything and left out major components of the nervous system involved in movement i.e. cerebellum, basal ganglia etc, for the sake of focusing in on OP's question. The human brain is currently the most complex organ and simultaneously the most complexing computational entity in existence and we only have superficial knowledge about how it all works.</p>
