Laika, the first animal to orbit the earth, died after around six hours in low earth orbit from overheating. Her death was inevitable as there was no plan to de-orbit, but the original plan was to euthanise her with poisoned food. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While reading this, I got pretty interested it and back-tracked some more. As much as it probably sucked pretty bad for these 3 in Soyuz 11, imagine being this man from Soyuz 1.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Soyuz 1 was launched on 23 April 1967 at 00:32 UTC from Baikonur Cosmodrome carrying Komarov, the first Soviet cosmonaut to fly in space twice.</p>
<p>Problems began shortly after launch when one solar panel failed to unfold, leading to a shortage of power for the spacecraft's systems. Further problems with the orientation detectors complicated maneuvering the craft. By orbit 13, the automatic stabilization system was completely dead, and the manual system was only partially effective.</p>
<p>The crew of Soyuz 2 modified their mission goals, preparing themselves for a launch that would include fixing the solar panel of Soyuz 1. However, that night, thunderstorms at Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan affected the booster's electrical system, causing the mission to be called off.[7]</p>
<p>As a result of Komarov's report during the 13th orbit, the flight director decided to abort the mission. After 18 orbits, Soyuz 1 fired its retrorockets and reentered the Earth's atmosphere. Despite the technical difficulties up to that point, Komarov might still have landed safely. To slow the descent, first the drogue parachute was deployed, followed by the main parachute. However, due to a defect, the main parachute did not unfold; the exact reason for the main parachute malfunction is disputed.[8][9]</p>
<p>Komarov then activated the manually deployed reserve chute, but it became tangled with the drogue chute, which did not release as intended. As a result, the Soyuz reentry module fell to Earth in Orenburg Oblast almost entirely unimpeded, at about 40 m/s (140 km/h; 89 mph). A rescue helicopter spotted the descent module lying on its side with the parachute spread across the ground. The retrorockets then started firing which concerned the rescuers since they were supposed to activate a few moments prior to touchdown. By the time they landed and approached, the descent module was in flames with black smoke filling the air and streams of molten metal dripping from the exterior. The entire base of the capsule burned through. By this point, it was obvious that Komarov had not survived, but there was no code signal for a cosmonaut's death, so the rescuers fired a signal flare calling for medical assistance. Another group of rescuers in an aircraft then arrived and attempted to extinguish the blazing spacecraft with portable fire extinguishers. This proved insufficient and they instead began using shovels to throw dirt onto it. The descent module then completely disintegrated, leaving only a pile of debris topped by the entry hatch. When the fire at last ended, the rescuers were able to dig through the rubble to find Komarov's remains strapped into the center couch. Doctors pronounced the cause of death to be from multiple blunt-force injuries.</p>

<p><strong>TL:DR</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Guy plummeted from space at about 90mph  (140 km/h) towards earth from space in a small capsule, fully aware his parachute was not working and what was coming soon. In fact, he knew before even going on the mission that he would probably die. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of people have mentioned Soyuz 11, but I wanted to add that it depends on your definition of &quot;in space&quot;.  Technically they died in the thermosphere, not in a full vacuum.  This is where most satellites and other space vehicles orbit. But technically it is considered part of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>So if by &quot;in space&quot; you mean away from any layer of the atmosphere, then the answer to your question is no.  If you use the more common definition of &quot;outer space&quot; meaning anything above the mesosphere, then see the other answers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
