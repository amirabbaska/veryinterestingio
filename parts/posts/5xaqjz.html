		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A neutron is fired into a cluster of unstable radioactive particles. HOWEVER it must go at a certain speed; too slow and the bomb won't explode, tok fast and the particle will go right through it. The amount of energy released will split the rest of the particles in the reaction, causing the huge energy released. The neutrons are fired from a small cell within the bomb, via electricity (or magnetism)</p>
<p>This is what prevented Germany from figuring out how to make the bomb and the US being successful; Germans fired the neutron as fast as they could while the US figured out it has to go at a certain speed</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an ideal ratio of protons to neutrons for an atomic nucleus to be stable.  Even when their protons and neutrons are at the right ratio, big atoms have a nucleus that is kind of wobbly and unstable to begin with.  Over time those big atoms, left to their own devices, will tend to split into fragments.  This is called <em>radioactivity</em>.  Exactly what fragments an atom splits into depends on what kind of atom it is (which is determined by how many protons and neutrons were there in the first place).</p>
<p>When a big atom gets hit by a neutron, an already-unstable atom has its proton-to-neutron ratio suddenly be &quot;wrong.&quot;  Which causes it to become extremely unstable and split into fragments almost instantly.  A bunch of binding energy is released which causes the fragments to fly apart, like what happens when you cut a tight-stretched rubber band.  How fast atoms are moving determines <em>temperature</em>, so when an atom is split, it creates heat as well as fragments.</p>
<p>Leo Szilard, a Jewish physicist who left Germany when Hitler became chancellor, realized that if we could find some atom that splits into fragments that include multiple neutrons, you could create a <em>chain reaction</em>.  In a chain reaction, one atom breaks and releases two neutrons, which breaks two more atoms, which releases four more neutrons, which breaks four more atoms, which releases eight neutrons...Szilard convinced other influential physicists, including Einstein, to advise the US government that this was possible and might be able to be used to create a powerful bomb.</p>
<p>If you have only a small amount of the right kind of atom, the chain reaction can't get properly started -- too many neutrons escape off the edges of the sample.  But once you have enough atoms -- a condition called <em>critical mass</em> -- the chain reaction will be able to sustain itself.  If you're just over critical mass, the sample will start to heat up and get hotter and hotter until it melts itself and its container, this is called <em>meltdown</em> (the flow will eventually spread it out enough that it stops being critical and cools down, but before that it can cause lots of damage in places that are difficult / impossible to safely repair because of radioactivity).  If you have way more than critical mass,  then incredible amounts of heat and neutrons will be produced very quickly, which causes an enormous explosion.</p>
<p>One use of this chain reaction phenomenon is to build a power plant:  Use neutron absorbing rods which can be inserted/removed from a sample to keep it near critical mass, enough so that it heats up enough to boil water to create steam and generate power, but not to the point of meltdown. Another use is to build a bomb:  Use regular explosives to smash two samples together to create a single sample far above critical mass, which will cause a very powerful explosion.</p>
<p>The right kind of atom for this process, a kind of uranium, turns out to be fairly common all over Earth, but since it is unstable, a lot of it has split into fragments over the billions of years that have passed since it was formed.  The remaining amounts of useful uranium are mixed with large amounts of useless uranium that doesn't release multiple neutrons.  So the useful uranium needs to be separated from the useless uranium.</p>
<p>Normally when scientists or engineers want to separate things, they will rely on different properties of the things they want to separate.  For example, you can melt the sample and let the liquid settle into different layers (taking advantage of different liquid density).  Or by making the sample hot enough for only one of the mixed things to boil away (taking advantage of different boiling points).  Or by adding chemicals which react differently with the things they want to separate (taking advantage of different chemistry).  But none of this works for uranium, because the two kinds of uranium are very similar and have almost identical properties.</p>
<p>The best method they found for separating uranium involves vaporizing the uranium into gas and then spinning the gas really fast with a machine called a <em>gas centrifuge</em>.  The two different kinds of atoms weigh different amounts, allowing the right kind of uranium to be separated and purified.  This process is incredibly expensive and inefficient, which is a good thing.  Hobbyists or terrorists can improvise regular bombs fairly easily, but can't feasibly build a nuclear bomb in their backyard.  Even for a government, in the age of satellites it's not really feasible to hide the enormous facilities needed, so countries basically know which other countries can / are trying to build bombs, and can pressure each other not to create weapons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So a nuclear weapon uses fissile material. A fissile material is one that both undergoes fission (the atoms of a given isotope are unstable and will decay) and can sustain chain reactions (a decay byproduct includes neutrons that strike adjacent isotopes that cause them to decay). This is primarily Plutonium and Uranium, and I think there's one or two others that are fissile. You can also &quot;breed&quot; fissile materials, which is how we get plutonium from uranium, and thorium will break down into uranium.  So of the few isotopes that are fissile, U235 is preferred over U233 because it's more energetic, and Pu239 is preferred over Pu241 for the same reason. Plutonium is preferred over uranium because it's much more energetic, meaning they need a lot, lot less, but uranium is used often enough because it has a longer shelf life and is more abundant.</p>
<p>The goal of kicking off a nuclear explosion is to get the fissile material to go &quot;super critical&quot;, in that chain reactions occur at an exponential rate. They do that by compressing the &quot;configuration&quot; (shape is as important as total mass) to where the neutrons from decay can't be avoided and there's a cascade effect.</p>
<p>There are two ways of doing this.</p>
<p>One is the &quot;gun type&quot; weapon, where a &quot;puck&quot; of uranium is fired into a &quot;plug&quot; of the same. The puck is fired using conventional explosives down the barrel of a cannon, and the plug is at the end. The two smash into one another and compress. It takes about 90-120 lbs of uranium to pull this off. It can't be done with plutonium because reasons...</p>
<p>The other method is the &quot;implosion type.&quot; A hollow sphere is encased with conventional explosives which are detonated in a precisely timed sequence so the shockwaves evenly compress the fissile material. It takes about 30 lbs of uranium or as little as 4.5 lbs of plutonium. The configuration is extremely important, the shape of the mass, the explosives, the shockwave, the timing... These are complex weapons to get right.</p>
<p>A hydrogen boosted weapon uses a glass bead of hydrogen inside the fissile sphere, the nucleus of hydrogen is a neutron. It only takes about 100 hydrogen atoms to get a sufficient multiplier in efficiency.</p>
<p>There are other things you can add to increase efficiency, such as beryllium on the outside to reflect neutrons back into the mass, and lithium-6 and lithium-7 which rapidly decays, releasing neutrons. Castle Bravo was the largest test shot by the US because we miscalculated what lithium-7 would do. At 15 MT, it was several orders of magnitude larger than expected.</p>
<p>A thermonuclear bomb uses hydrogen like a boosted weapon, but the goal is to use the nuclear explosion to generate heat and compression to cause the hydrogen to fuse into helium, lithium, and beryllium. Castle Bravo was also the first thermonuclear test.</p>
<p>You can actually use a nuclear weapon to kick off another nuclear weapon. Instead of surrounding a core with conventional explosives, surround it with nuclear weapons! These are multi stage nuclear weapons, and they make very big booms. Russia built the largest such weapon called the Tsar Bomba, and it used 3 stages. The bomb itself was so big the carrier had to be gutted and modified to hold it, and it hung out the bottom of the plane. They wanted to demonstrate a 100 MT explosion but such a detonation would have covered the Earth in 1/4 worth of all nuclear fallout of all weapons ever tested to that date, so they dialed it back to a 57 MT explosion.</p>
<p>In 1815, Mount Tambora, a volcano, exploded, completely obliterating the island it was on and killing <em>everyone instantly</em> in the surrounding <em>100 or so miles</em>. So much ash was thrown into the atmosphere, 1816 was in perpetual winter, world wide. It was called the year without a summer. That explosion was estimated to be around 400 MT, just for comparison.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear fission starts when a neutron hits a heavy nucleus, the reaction produces more neutrons and so on and so on. The more atoms you have in a contained space the faster fission will be and more energy will be created. Uranium fueled nuclear bomb is a ball of uranium surrounded by an explosive. During ignition the explosive is pressing the atoms together going to critical mass(when fission is self sustained) and over that to the point when a lot of fission happens at once producing a lot of light and heat. Little boy contained 64.1 kg of U-235 but only 0.8 kg went through fission and only 0.1% of that was changed directly to heat and light. The rest 63.3 kg was scattered around Hiroshima during the blast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first neutron hits an atom of U-235 or Pu-239.  These are special, unstable atoms.  The atom splits in half, and releases 2 neutrons.  These hit the next 2 atoms, which release 4, ...  Many atoms are split.</p>
<p>The rest of the special physics is trapping the very rare and unstable radioactive materials in a casing where they can be forced together well enough that the first 10% of the reaction doesn't just vaporize the rest of the weapon.  It's very difficult, and mostly against international treaties, to make them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
