<p>Are those two distinct versions of Sleep Paralysis or one and the same? And what causes the intense crippling fear? I'm talking about fear to move before even attempting to do so.</p>
<p>edit-Thanks for the valid answers everybody!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep paralysis is an inaccurate label for the experience that has simply caught on as a broad descriptor in common language. &quot;Night terrors&quot; is another term sometimes used for this experience.</p>
<p>The more accurate term for the overall phenomena is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia" target="_blank">hypnagogia</a>, which is essentially the broad term for what happens to our consciousness and mental processes when transitioning from awake to asleep and vice versa (sometimes called &quot;threshold consciousness&quot;). To be pedantic, hypnagogia is sometimes used only for the awake -&gt; asleep transition, and hypnopompia for the asleep -&gt; awake transition, but hypnagogia is typically accepted as a general term for both.</p>
<p>Hypnagogia includes multiple things, including hallucinations, lucid dreaming, altered mental states, and sleep paralysis (i.e. the conscious awareness of REM atonia).</p>
<p>So the different things people experience are potentially caused by very different mechanisms during this state. In the vernacular this entire state has picked up the label of &quot;sleep paralysis&quot;, even though that is technically only one small subset of what could be happening during the transition and many hypnagogic episodes don't actually include sleep paralysis at all.</p>
<p>As for what causes the various emotions and experiences, it's hard to say with certainty. The feeling of being unable to breathe, paralysis, or something &quot;heavy&quot; on the chest are all pretty clearly tied to the physical mechanisms of sleep paralysis. The overall sense of terror and fear are possibly a combination of sleep paralysis along with the general altered mental state of a sleep transition. The audiovisual hallucinations are probably being caused by the same mechanisms responsible for dreaming and may be effectively thought of as a lucid/waking dream.</p>
<p>The fact that the nature of the hallucinations is relatively consistent across cultures/people is pretty interesting and has lead to a lot of common myth. Most full blown hypnagogic episodes include hallucinations of entities or presences in the room, sinister voices, and a general sense of dread/fear/terror.</p>
<p>I don't know of any specific research that explains <em>why</em> these are the common hallucinatory experiences of this state, but it's easy to see how this would create the shared myths of demons, banshees, succubi, etc. and the modern shared myths of alien abduction.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thread locked but I wanted to clarify a thing brought up in several replies here. I'm not saying sleep paralysis and night terrors are not well-defined things. I'm saying people inaccurately use these labels for a number of other hypnagogic episodes, which is why, as the OP describes, there are conflicting/differing reports of &quot;sleep paralysis&quot;. Because essentially some reports are inaccurately calling their hypnagogic episode &quot;sleep paralysis&quot;, when it was actually something else. This gets further muddied since hypnagogic episodes can share a lot of common aspects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
