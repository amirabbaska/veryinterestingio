<p>a voltage is induced in a conductor when the conductor passes through a magnetic field. </p>
<p>Seeing as the earth has magnetic properties (in the atmosphere?) wouldn't a conductor (or frame of a space lift) have voltage induced on it? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nitpick: Voltage is already a difference in (electric) potential. So what you're asking is &quot;what is the voltage between Earth and space&quot; or &quot;what is the difference in electric potential&quot;, but not &quot;what is the difference in voltage&quot;.</p>
<p>The answer is around zero. If Earth had a positive potential, the free hydrogen nuclei (protons) in the upper atmosphere would just fly off until it's zero. If it was negative, the protons and helium nuclei from solar wind would fly towards us until it's zero.</p>
<p><del>In related news, the capacitance of Earth is around four farads. That is, the amount of charge needed to change our voltage relative to space by one volt is ~four coulombs.</del> [edit] unreliable source, should not have mentioned that</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a beauty of a question, because your title asks one thing, but the body asks another.</p>
<p>I'll cover both!</p>
<p>Space has no voltage, but it does have magnetic fields which can induce voltages into conductors. It also has charged particles, which vary in intensity, which can also induce a voltage. If you're a satellite or interplanetary spacecraft hit by a solar proton event, you'll find yourself charged to millions of volts.</p>
<p>A tether between space and the ground has less to consider. It is wholly within Earth's magnetic field, but does not move within it (assuming a geostationary tether), so won't generate anything from magnetism other than that generated from the field itself moving, which is quite small. </p>
<p>The ionosphere is one of the outer parts of Earth's atmosphere and, as the name suggests, ionized. As movement of ions if the definition of an electric current, they can also produce a voltage. A grounded tether would definitely discharge the ionosphere to some extent.</p>
<p>However - You said ungrounded! This means the tether is what electrical engineers call &quot;floating&quot; and will simply try to assume the potential of whatever is the strongest influence. Without giving it some kind of path to ground (e.g. through a useful load!), it'll produce no useful work at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
