		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most terrestrial mammals need to drink water at some point. Some desert adapted animals like cats can obtain most of the water they need from their diet (i.e. fresh meat), but will still drink water when available.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/diet-and-primate-evolution-2006-06/" target="_blank">For most primates, vegetation comprises their main source of food energy, typically as fruits and leaves</a>. Plant biomass typically contains a high proportion of water, which reduces the need to drink water, but most will at some point. Humans are no exception, and our modern diets may involve a lot of processed foods that are higher in salt and lower in water content, leading to a greater need for water intake.</p>
<p>This is of course influenced by the ability of primates to sweat to regulate body temperature, and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-naked-truth/" target="_blank">humans are the best sweaters</a>. This leads to high water losses, which increases our need for water intake. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_and_heat_adaptations_in_humans#Heat" target="_blank">This wikipedia entry suggests human heat adaptation may be relatively recent, and not a lot research has been done on this</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
