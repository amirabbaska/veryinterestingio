		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had an interesting experience with ants yesterday. They have been coming in through my kitchen window to feed on food in my kitchen. I closed the gap in the window that they were coming in through, but some ants were still inside the house. I found the behavior of these remaining ants interesting: They huddled into &quot;groups,&quot; as if they were talking, and then they started to spread out, as if they were searching for a way back to the colony.</p>
<p>I have two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What do ants usually do when they are separated from the colony (e.g., as above)?</p>
</li>
<li>What were the ants who were trapped in my house probably doing?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a scientist, but I am an avid ant keeper. As a result, I've done a lot of ant research. </p>
<p>Firstly, most ants navigate outside of their nests using two methods: pheromone trials, and counting their steps.  </p>
<p>Pheromone trails will be laid by ants when they find good, a danger, etc.  They can follow these trails for quite some time, until the scent disperses. </p>
<p>Ants, as mentioned, count their own steps. Scientists figured this out by giving ants stilts, and also, cutting their legs shorter.  If they have the returning ants stilts, they would overshoot their nest.  The reverse occurred for the poor cut ants. </p>
<p>If ants lose the scent, and cant count their steps back, they will most usually begin to walk an ever-widening circle, in an attempt to find their nest or a pheromone trail.  </p>
<p>The ants in your house are likely grouping up because they realise they are unable to return to the nest by either usual method.  The grouping is likely a natural response - they are attracted to others with the same smell. </p>
<p>A few species of ants will allow outside ants of the same species to join their nests. However, most will kill outsiders. </p>
<p>The ants in your house will eventually start to wander around looking for a new way to enter their nest.  They will likely do this until death by misadventure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
