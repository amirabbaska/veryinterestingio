		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was reading about the Parker probe and it's amazing just how close that thing is going to get to the sun; but it of course made me wonder how much closer we could get. The Parker probe basically uses a big oriented shield to protect itself, and behind the shield it's more a normal spacecraft.</p>
<p>Is it conceivable that anything could be constructed that could survive passing through the corona? It seems stuff must be whipping around like crazy in there, plus the insane temperatures. To my knowledge the highest known melting points are in the thousands of degrees, but I figure there is also some kind of blast force or something going on there.</p>
<p><em>Edit</em> and if the corona is so easy, can you conceive of a spacecraft passing through the <em>photosphere</em> and surviving?</p>
<p>Not that it is possible with any known technology, but is it even physically conceivable that something could survive a close approach towards the surface of the sun? What would be necessary (special materials? some kind of super-magnet?)?</p>
<p><em>edit 2</em>
Thanks all for the entertaining and informative comments! I will let you all know when my machine is completed and ready for launch.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you have a good heat shield and heat transported to the back of your spacecraft, you can essentially get to the point where friction is a problem. Typically these spacecrafts are in a very elliptic orbit so they are are only very close for hours at a time. Tungsten alloys or some high melting point ceramics will do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For comparison, Parker Solar Probe will only get 6.2 million km from the Sun. Comet Lovejoy went 44 times as close. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what technology you're allowed to imagine yourself using.  Ultimately it's how much energy you can remove to keep the probe from melting.  Can we take a couple million tons of lead to melt to protect a 1mg payload?  I remember reading a story where they built an intelligent probe that used wormhole technology as a heat sink, and basically formed a separate sun next to the real one by piping heat through it.  You can stay inside indefinitely in that case...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, it's not really a proper citation but Isaac Arthur did an excellent video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ap4JhPoPQY" target="_blank">colonizing the sun</a>.  </p>
<p>TL;DW: we can probably colonize down into the upper photosphere with known materials and physics.  </p>
<p>We can deal with heat pretty effectively but gravity starts to become a big issue.  At the top of the photosphere, the gravitational attraction is about 28 times Earth standard.  By using rotating orbital rings, you can negate that gravity down to 1G.  By having nested rings, you can transfer heat from the lower rings up to shadowed radiators further up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
