		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of ambiguity in your question in regards to how the object is spinning, but I will phrase my answer to address that.</p>
<p>If the object is spinning in such a way that the person in the same setup would be dizzy if they were awake and had their eyes closed for a long time, then they will also be dizzy during the setup you described.</p>
<p>Basically - your balance organs are working even when you sleep. Whether they are recognized by the brain during unconsciousness is more difficult to answer and is likely to be dependent of the cause of unconsciousness.</p>
<p>But once awake and assuming that the person is in a &quot;normal&quot; state, the balance organs definitely work.</p>
<p>Dizziness like this comes from situations where your senses provide conflicting information to your brain. This can be because your eyes see a different movement pattern than your head experiences (which explains why some people get dizzy during movies) or because your balance organs (one set in each ear) provide conflicting information (so one organ says you are spinning in one direction and the other says you are spinning in another direction or not spinning at all).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you wake up, you'll have gotten used to the spinning platform (I assume constant angular speed) so you might get dizzy if/when you see beyond the platform, which then isn't spinning. The equilibrium organs think you're not spinning while your eyes tell you you clearly are, so you might get dizzy from that. </p>
<p>Personally I only get dizzy when stepping of eg. a spinning chair. Here the situation is slightly different. So first you along with the fluid in the semi-circular canals is spinning at the same speed, so no response. When you step of you will very quickly slow down and stop spinning, whereas the liquid in the semicircular canals moves much more freely and takes longer to slow down, during this time you'll feel that you're accelerating rotationally counter to the earlier direction, because the fluid is now rubbing against the sensory hair-like cells on the inside of the semicircular canals. This will continue for a while until the liquid slows down and stops. </p>
<p>Another thing you'll also experience is involuntary saccades, that is eye movements that are trying to retain your gaze at one location, but because they rely on sensory input from the equilibrium organs, which are sending wrong signals, from the perspective of another person it looks like your intermittently glancing to your side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
