		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Respiratory therapy student checking in. There are a few factors which may compound with eachother causing symptoms ranging from simple snoring, to severe sleep apnea. As mentioned earlier, the snoring sound comes from a closing airway in the back of your mouth/throat.   </p>
<p>While we sleep we have different stages of sleep we cycle through every 90 minutes or so. The last of these is called REM sleep. During REM sleep our body is at its most relaxed and muscles that normally support the throat and tongue relax as well and collapse the airway. As air is forced past these now flappy tissues, they make sound we hear as snoring.  </p>
<p>Other factors which we look at are usually related to things that would cause the mouth and throat to be small. A small or recessed jaw doesnt allow for as much space to begin with. Obesity fills the neck area with fat pushing in on that space.  </p>
<p>To fix this we can use specialized mouth guards which pull the jaw forward, pulling the tongue forward with it, opening that space. CPAP machines use constant air pressure to force the airway open from the inside, enough to allow for adequate breathing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people do snore while awake!  This is called stertor.  It is usually associated with airway narrowing or loss of muscular tone.
The true question then becomes:  Why do people snore more often when asleep?  This is because our muscular tone is lower while sleeping.
In short, snoring/stertor comes from vibrations of the throat, palate or tongue. The Bernouilli effect causes tissue collapse and vibration (sound). This is most likely to happen with air flowing past narrowed, flaccid tissue.  Our muscular tone decreases while sleeping which may lead to snoring or frank obstruction (obstructive apnea).

<p>When you inspire there is negative pressure in your respiratory tract which allows the air to enter( because atmospheric pressure is more than inside). But this negative pressure also tries to collapse the larynx</p>
<p>To counteract when you are awake your brain is active and it is sending impulse to laryngeal muscles, chest wall muscles, and palatal muscles to keep your larynx open. </p>
<p>When you are asleep, there are various phases of sleep with different levels of brain activity. During stage 4 sleep( deep sleep) and rem sleep, there is least amount of brain activity and hence no muscle activity and hence the larynx collapses.</p>
<p>To dig in a little deeper, when larynx collapses as above there is build up of carbon dioxide and hence this activates the brain and your snore terminates eventually for the process to start all over again. But as the brain was activated, it does not get enough rest and you end up feeling tired the next day.</p>
<p>Any further questions please feel free to ask.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with a few factors:</p>
<p>Posture, while asleep your throat is affected by gravity in different ways than when you're vertical.</p>
<p>There's a chemical your body makes while you sleep that paralyses you and another that relaxes muscles.  These contribute to snoring.</p>
<p>If you started snoring while awake you'd react and stop it, probably so quickly you don't even realize it was snoring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
