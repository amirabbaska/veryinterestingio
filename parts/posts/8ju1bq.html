		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have already explained how, so hopefully you don't mind me explaining why not to for precise measurements due to the phones limitations.</p>
<p>This is a common debate amongst Geologists. In the field we generally use Brunton Compasses (one of the geological transit models) for their incredible accuracy. </p>
<p>Lately many have been using their phones with compass apps because it's... &quot;Close enough&quot;. </p>
<p>The issue is you can easily be off a few degrees if your compass or phone is not perfectly level. The Brunton solves this by using a planar level for measuring bearing. The phone however does not have a particularly accurate digital level, and the level they do have isn't necessarily on the compass apps.</p>
<p>Another point which is more of a measure of convenience is that you can manually adjust your compass to the magnetic declination of wherever you are at. Most phone apps don't have this feature so you'll have to add or subtract the value accordingly for each measurement. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Employee who works for the Magnetometer company that's in 80% of the world's smartphones here.  The ECompass is highly dependent on both layout and the SW algorithm that is used.  Layout needs to be done correctly, (away from hard and soft iron sources).  For instance, you can't put it next to anything a magnet would stick to, and you can't stick it next to a high power trace.  </p>
<p>So, with layout done correctly, it's up to the algorithm to calculate north.  Accuracy can be accomplished via the, &quot;figure 8&quot;, (or any random movement).  That figure 8 thing goes back to a few meetings with customers years and years ago and became the standard explanation.  Honestly, any random 3D movement calibrates the part.  There have since been improvements in the algorithm that figure 8's aren't needed anymore.  (But, this depends on who uses which part and which algorithm.)  An error of &lt;5 degrees is typical with a correctly implemented design.  But, remember that a lot of smartphone companies do not request help with this and implement it horribly, as it's usually though of too late.  As for algorithms, many of the biggest smartphone and chip companies claim to have SW that implements an ECompass, but we've yet to see it comparable.  I've seen one algorithm better than ours.  Also, the algorithm needs to have dynamic calibration.  The magnetic environment changes constantly as you move, thus compensation needs to change.  (For instance walking into a huge steel building will completely change the magnetic fields vs. outside.)  So, in the end, the biggest problems with an ECompass is usually just bad implementation.</p>
<p>The ECompass in smartphones rely on the accelerometer for tilt compensation.  It can be done without it, but then the ECompass function would only work on flat surfaces.  The accel lets you hold the phone in any position and still calculate north.</p>
<p>(edited to add a bit about dynamic calibration)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm also curious as to how the altimeter works on a smart phone. I've been in the middle of nowhere with no service on 13/14,000ft peaks, and it seems to be spot on with the altitude measurements. Would love to know the science behind that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
