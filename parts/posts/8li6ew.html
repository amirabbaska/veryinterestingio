		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure. Used to work in visual neuroscience, and this is my best guess. I'd love if someone has a definite answer though!</p>
<p>I think the main culprit is visual glare. Light travels in straight lines, but you get glare when light is scattered in a disorganised pattern (usually strong light, like car headlights in rain).</p>
<p>Your brain has to process everything you see, and its less work if you can see everything clearly. If you have to perceive an indistinct shape, your higher visual processing areas have to work harder. Glare from bright light will make it harder to perceive things around you.</p>
<p>So what I think might be going on is that glare (which again is disorganised, scattered light) means that you're perceiving a different pattern of scattered light from each eye. Your brain has to interpret and combine both images, which is a lot of work (this is normally easy because they're usually the same). Shutting off one eye (half the signal) means you have less work to do, and might make it easier to see.</p>
<p>Either that or its something really simple that I've missed, like shutting one eye makes it easier to decrease the pupil size in your open eye!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is basically just concerned about how much light your eyes are taking in. If you can halve the amount one way or another (some people squint, some close one eye, some block the light) then your brain's happy. Your brain doesn't particularly care how you go about it as long as the perceived amount of light/its processing load goes down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That sensation that you feel is over stimulation of the nerve. With both eyes open, both sets of nerves are over stimulated. With one eye open, only one set of nerves is over stimulated. It's easier for you to handle the sensation and maintain operation of one over stimulated nerve than two.</p>
<p>Similarly, it would be easier to make gestures with one hand in very hot water than it would be to make gestures with two hands in very hot water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>pretty simple defense but inaccurate mechanism by the body;</p>
<p>brain says: hey woah woah too much light you're going to break something</p>
<p>body says: ok lemme cut that in half</p>
<p>brain says: good job buddy</p>
<p>meanwhile your open eye is still getting baked by the sun because the brain is only looking at <em>total</em> light coming in, not the total light exposed to an individual eye. read up on pterygium/surfers eye on why closing one eye and thinking everything is a-ok is bad</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
