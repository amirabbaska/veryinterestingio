Is that craggy surface made of stuff that the solar wind will blow out into a tail?  Are things pretty much as we've always been told, but we've got way better images and are learning way more detail, or is there some completely new comet science going on?</p>
<p>When I try to google things like &quot;rosetta dirty snowball&quot; I get a bunch of Velikovskian &quot;Electric Universe&quot; crackpots, which isn't helpful. :\</p></div></div>
