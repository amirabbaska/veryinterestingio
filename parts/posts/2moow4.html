Is that craggy surface made of stuff that the solar wind will blow out into a tail?  Are things pretty much as we've always been told, but we've got way better images and are learning way more detail, or is there some completely new comet science going on?</p>
<p>When I try to google things like &quot;rosetta dirty snowball&quot; I get a bunch of Velikovskian &quot;Electric Universe&quot; crackpots, which isn't helpful. :\</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't look like anyone has chimed in yet, and this is getting a lot of votes. So let me just say this for now:</p>
<p>Rosetta got there 3 months ago and Philae landed <em>last week</em>.</p>
<p>Scientists have had the data from the lander in their hands for less than a week, and whatever science Rosetta is doing from orbit is just getting started (and the really exciting stuff is going to happen as the comet gets closer to the sun and we can watch how things change when you shine more light on it).</p>
<p>Science is not an instantaneous process. It takes many, many months/years to properly analyze all the data and figure out exactly what it's telling you.</p>
<p><strong>While there may be some press releases with pretty pictures and preliminary results as things come in, &quot;our understanding of what comets are&quot; isn't going to change until the peer-reviewed papers start coming out</strong> after scientists have had plenty of time to process the data, understand its limits and systematic errors, compare it to everything we knew before, and figure out how this new data fits in with/changes our perspective of comets as a whole.</p>
<p>Scientists have been waiting 10+ years for this data, they are very excited, and you have no idea the absolutely insane hours over the next couple months some of them will work without getting paid any overtime just to push out initial findings. But the bigger picture is going to take years to sort out. <strong>This process will play out starting in probably 3 months and continuing for the next several years</strong>.</p>
<p>Edit: I say 3 months just because that's my bet on the turnaround time to get the first/coolest results pushed through <em>Science</em> or <em>Nature</em> with a minimal/expedited peer-review process. Then the bigger picture/more detailed analyses will start to trickle in more slowly.</p>
<p>Edit 2: As /u/maep brought up in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2moow4/has_rosetta_significantly_changed_our/cm69kgu" target="_blank">comment below</a>, it appears that the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting in San Francisco will have a Rosetta results session. You can view <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm14/webprogrampreliminary/Session1556.html" target="_blank">all the abstracts here</a>. <strong>It appears all the Rosetta preliminary results are scheduled to hijack the meeting on Wednesday, December 17 with talks going from 10:20am to 6pm PST.</strong> They will be preliminary results and not peer-reviewed yet, but that will be the day you'll start to have a sense of what the most exciting science seems to be from the first part of the mission.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question, and I think the general consensus of &quot;wait and see&quot; is the correct answer. Completely apart from that, I would like to say that a space exploration mission like this is <em>not</em> a failure or a waste of time if it <em>doesn't</em> significantly change our understanding. Having our hypothetical understanding become factual understanding without significant change is a cause to celebrate our skills of prediction. In terms of catchy PR headlines, pop culture, and media it may seem a little, well, boring. But real progress and real scientific advance often is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of people on here have made comments on how organics were observed on the comet. To be really honest, this is not unexpected and not new. We have known and observed organic molecules in space forming on dust grains for years. I don't think that they at all have said what type of organic molecules were observed, or if there were only able to say that the molecules detected contained carbon. Now if they observed simple sugar molecules forming in space, that would be an earth shattering discovery. But, if it was something like methanol, methane, ammonia, formaldehyde, carbon dioxide etc., than it is nothing unexpected or something that previously was not observed already.</p>
<p>We have a pretty good idea on how organics form in space (at least we think we do). It's difficult for these sort of objects to implant a planet at the Earth's distance from the sun without having them evaporate before they arrive. These molecules are solid ices that form on water-ice. My master's adviser seems to think that organics formed in space played a large role in the formation of complex organics and eventually life on this planet and I agree to a certain extent. There are probably a lot of things that we just don't know that were necessary or had to happen in order for life to form here.</p>
<p>I have done extensive research on this subject (organics forming in space) and would be happy to answer questions that I can on the subject.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
