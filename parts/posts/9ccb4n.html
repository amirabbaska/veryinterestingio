		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nutritional content is all still there, but the nutrients in unripe fruits are more difficult to digest for us, and hence they don't taste as good. Starches breaking down into simple sugars, complex enzymes denaturing into amino acid chains, all this helps us digest and absorb the nutrients easier. This is also the same reason we cook meat vs eat it raw (aside from the chance of infection).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><del>Avocados are unusual amongst fruit because they only begin to ripen once they have been picked</del> .^((see below)) As to what happens during ripening, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.2740291007" target="_blank">this review</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The oil level in the flesh generally increases (\~10%) during ripening, but the increase varies between fruits and occasionally small decreases have been observed. The oil is the major energy store of the fruit and is involved in ripening but it does not appear to fuel the respiration. The quantity of oil probably remains unchanged with the apparent increase due to the weight loss by respiration.  </p>
<p>Respiration seems to be fuelled largely by degradation of the sugars and possibly hemicelluloses and pectic  substances. Keto sugars fructose and mannoheptulose were the sugars mostly consumed in ripening. The fall in total sugars during ripening varied from 50 to 85 %.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What that means is that the carbohydrates are being broken down and respired, so the oil percentage of the fruit increases, but the total weight decreases.</p>
<p>This seems like an appropriate place to mention that avocados evolved to be eaten by <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/why-the-avocado-should-have-gone-the-way-of-the-dodo-4976527/" target="_blank">giant ground sloths</a> which is why the seeds are so large. It's a very clever strategy for trees as the seed lets a seedling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shade_tolerance" target="_blank">wait it out in the shade</a> until another tree dies and creates a gap.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whatever the process is which causes avocados to ripen, putting a banana in a bag with them <em>greatly</em> increases the rate at which they ripen. </p>
<p>I thought it was an old wives tale until earlier this week. Nope. It works very well. My rock-hard avocados were good to go in under 48 hours.</p>
<p>Pretty sure it has something to do enzymes... but after that, no clue.</p>
<p>Hey everybody - what's the deal with bananas and avocado ripening?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a very good question and one that I would like to see references for the answers. The heat from most peppers is from a capsicum molecule. It only is produced late and is also a long carbon chain, like a fatty acid. It is reasonable to think that other nutritional content similar to spicy sensations, such as fat and saccharides only evolve upon ripening. But, there are obviously exceptions, as is mentioned for the avocado. Clearly the saccharide content that we taste is different as the fruit ripens. Too, wheat changes its composition as it's seeds mature. </p>
<p>So without doubt, the nutritional content is different as the fruit (avocado) ripens as is stated by the differences in taste. Whether the Omega-3 and -6 fatty acids are the same is not known to me. Can this serve as a &quot;focusing the question&quot; answer, or is it a different question. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it just occurred to me that I have a 2 year old avocado tree growing on my windowsill in BC, Canada. It'll be a house plant for sure, but im amazed the leaves are <em>huge</em>! easily a foot long. and it's <em>beautiful</em>, such deep emerald green leaves. </p>
<p>Dont forget with all this avocado eating, it only takes a month or two to root a pit and theyre really easy. might try to make mine a bonsai</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
