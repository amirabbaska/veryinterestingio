Why would someone when presented with irrefutable proof that their belief is wrong continue to believe that thing? I can't wrap my head around it.</p>
<p>*Edit: I'm not talking about belief in things like ghosts, aliens, or god, for which there is merely no proof of their existence. I'm talking about believing something that is false on its face and easily provable as such.</p></div></div>

<p>Do you have any examples for this? Most things in the world today require you to put your trust in someone else who is an expert, or require you to become an expert yourself.</p>
<p>Consider the concept of the solar system. I absolutely believe that there are 8 planets (and Pluto), but I have only personally seen four of them. I'm choosing to trust astronomers and scientists and physicists who tell me that there are more, and I have no issue with that trust, but there's always a possibility that they are lying. </p>
<p>Throw in 20 years of action/crime/drama movies where nothing is ever what it seems, and huge organizations all have agendas and manipulating the herd is how people get ahead, and then remove a great education that teaches you to think critically and you can end up with a natural distrust of everyone who isn't exactly like yourself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been grappling this and I wish I could give you an answer.  I'll respond to it, but I've been hoping to understand this more myself. </p>
<p>Opinions seem to be tied very closely to people's identities.  So if you provide people with data that refutes their claims or beliefs, they would have to admit that the premise on which they've based their identity, their purpose, and their goals we're all a sham.  I dont think people consciously have this thought.  I believe it's an automatic psychological defense mechanism. </p>
<p>There is something called the 'Back fire effect.'  Check it out here. <a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/" target="_blank">https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/</a></p>
<p>It basically states that when you present proof suggesting a person's opinion to be other than correct, they will grow more convicted in their views.  Basically the opposite of science!</p>
<p>What really boggles my mind is when I see this behavior in college educated people.  Not because I believe non-college educated people are less intelligent.  Far from it actually.  But a college degree, more than anything, should confer upon a person proof to society that they know <em>how</em> to think.  That is to say that I hold them to a higher level of responsibility, that their opinions should be backed by facts, with room to be flexible should new facts be presented to them.  In practice, proof (however it is presented) should affect a person's conclusion.  But unfortunately, that is applies to theory more than reality. </p>
<p>I see this mostly happen mostly with political views.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have faith in our caregivers:  Caregivers are looking out for our best interests</p>
<p>We have faith in our senses: Seeing is believing  </p>
<p>We have faith in our memories: &quot;I remember when it happened&quot;</p>
<p>And Faith is a virtue.</p>
<p>When suddenly confronted with irrefutable evidence it is easier to reject the new information than it is to lose faith because losing faith makes me weak. And it means that either my caregivers were wrong, that my senses were wrong, or that my memory is flawed.</p>
<p>It is easier to me to go with what I know than to question my reality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm not being snarky. That's why. People's &quot;opinions&quot; are so wrapped up in their identities these days, admitting to backing the wrong idea is tantamount to calling your whole worldview into question. It's <em>way</em> simpler to just go &quot;<em>LALALALA</em>&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would argue it's a lack of interest in properly educating oneself. I had 2 conversations with a 20 year old delivery driver the other day. In the first he was absolutely DUMBFOUNDED that Hawaii was a state and not a continent/country.</p>
<p>In the second I had to explain that germs cause sickness, not cold weather. Cold weather will weaken your immune system to some extent but you need to get germs in your body to get sick. He basically just said he didn't believe me, then when he saw me wearing a light jacket the next time I went out for a cigarette he said &quot;cold huh?&quot; in a very snarky tone.</p>
<p>This is what you get when you combine the NYC public school system, a lack of interest, and an already &quot;not the sharpest razor in the cookie jar&quot; kinda person.</p>
<p>On the plus side, after explaining the germ thing further he did say &quot;learn something new every day!&quot; so I think he knew I wasn't looking down on him. I hope this doesn't come across as hubris or a holier than thou up on a high horse kind of mentality but I feel like it's partially on me to help get him interested in learning these basic sorts of things. It's up to you too, assuming you can do it without being condescending. I can't speak for anyone else but if someone explains something well to me that I previously didn't understand, or gives me evidence that disproves something I already believed, I always appreciate it. I think most people do as long as the other party isn't being a jerk about it.</p>
<p>I guarantee that a large percentage of people who cling to these falsehoods do so because there's an animosity toward people who talk to them like they're stupid for believing it in the first place. I'd wager there's a ton of people reading this who still think urine is sterile. You're not stupid, you just never double checked. That's ok, cuz guess what? You learn something new every day!</p>
<p>Or you don't...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
