		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For me it's just easier to think when I'm moving. So activities that require a lot of focused thought, like a phone call, are easier when I'm moving. At the same time, doing something that is all hands and no real thought is EXTREMELY boring because the motion activates my brain but doesn't give it something to focus on. Which is why I started listening to audiobook when I clean.</p>
<p>I can't find the study but I read once that this seamed like a trait of people on the autism spectrum, which is part of where the &quot;hyperactive&quot; idea comes from. ADD kids can't &quot;sit still&quot; because it is literally harder for them to think when they do so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
