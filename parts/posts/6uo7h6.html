<p>It's called gravitational lensing, so one could think it works in the same way lenses bend light, but lenses bend light because of an interaction between light and particles in the lens.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light follows geodesics, which are spacetime equivalent of straight lines in space. It's a bit - but only vaguely - like riding a motorbike around a wall of death - you keep the wheels straight, but your path - observed from outside - is circular.</p>
<p>Just as there are many straight lines through a single point depending on your direction, there are many geodesics through a single point depending on your speed. So while a satellite passing through a point near a star at a certain angle will find itself following a tight geodesic, a beam of light is not bent (as observed from outside) so much, even though it too is also following a geodesic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light follows geodesics, or the curvature of spacetime.  It's not the light that's bending, but the spacetime upon/within which it travels.  The more spacetime bends, say due to gravitationally-massive objects, the more it will appear that the light bends.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
