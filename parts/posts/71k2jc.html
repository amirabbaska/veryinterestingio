This allows an employee to work without paying union dues (but they will not have the benefits of being in a union - well this is a point of contention but beyond the scope of an ELI5). </p>
<p>Were you thinking of at-will employment?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right to Work Laws mean that you can't be required to join a union as a condition of employment. </p>
<p>In many industries, union contracts with employers state that they're only allowed to hire members of the union. So you can't work for those companies unless you're a dues-paying member of the union. Right to Work laws make these clauses in the contract illegal.</p>
<p>In general, I'd say it's bad for unions, because it means they get less dues, and it's bad for people who want to be in the union because it means the union has less negotiating power if only some of the workers are in the union. It's good for the employers, because the union has less power and it's good for people who don't want to be in the union because they aren't forced to pay dues in order to work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>EDIT: Right-to-work laws are <em>not</em> about prohibiting employers from requiring employees to join the union as a condition of employment. They are about whether unions may deduct union dues/fees from non-members paychecks. Requiring union membership as a condition of employment (i.e., the creation of a &quot;closed shop&quot;) has been illegal since the passage of the federal Taft-Hartley Act in 1947.</strong></p>
<p>TL;DR: They are intended to reduce the influence--both economic and political--of organized labor by making it harder for unions to collect dues/fees. </p>
<p>Unions deduct dues directly from employees' paychecks. For union members, this is no big deal. They signed up for the union, they agree to union dues.</p>
<p>But what of non-members? The Supreme Court has ruled that unions cannot deduct fees to be used for political purposes from non-members (that would violate non-members First Amendment rights), but can be permitted to deduct &quot;services fees,&quot; (EDIT: also sometimes called &quot;agency fees&quot;) which are theoretically the costs the union incurs in negotiating the employees' collective bargaining agreements. </p>
<p>What &quot;right-to-work&quot; laws say is that unions can't deduct <em>any</em> fees/dues from non-members' paychecks. Employees have a &quot;right&quot; to work without paying unions a dime unless they voluntarily decide to join the union. Sure, if fewer employees choose to join, that means fewer dues for the union, which means it might not be able to secure as good a collective bargaining agreement for the employees, and might not even be able to represent them at all. </p>
<p>The reason this is such a problem for unions is that a lot of employees don't <em>want</em> to join the union. Yes, they'd certainly prefer to gain the benefit of the collective bargaining agreement without paying anything for it. But unionized employees know damned well the nature of their collective bargaining agreements and many <em>still</em> don't want to join the union. Why? Maybe because while unions themselves direct pretty much 100% of their political donations to Democrats, unionized <em>employees</em> are almost as politically diverse as the American electorate as a whole. </p>
<p>On top of that, unions political affiliations are known to pretty much everybody. That includes elected politicians. Including Republican politicians. Who control both houses of 33 state legislatures and one house in another 7 states. I can't think of any reason they <em>wouldn't</em> want to take an enormous whack at the single most reliable source of Democratic campaign contributions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With work, there is capital, labor, and management. Capital is the investors. Management works for the investors and runs the company. And labor does the actual work. The investors pool lots of money together to enable the creation and funding of the company, and authorize management to hire and fire labor to get the work done. </p>
<p>If labor wants to get better working conditions, management and capital are far more powerful than them. America is a &quot;at-will&quot; country in general, so management can hire and fire for just about any reason (except for some limited discriminatory or retaliatory reasons). </p>
<p>So to actually have any ability to stand with an even footing against management and capital, Labor has to organize. It has to present a united front. &quot;You can't fire one of us for asking for better work conditions because if you do, all of us will quit and the business breaks down.&quot; </p>
<p>Right to work laws are meant to fracture union power so that labor can't unite. It uses free riders to say &quot;I won't fund the union...but i'll benefit from their work.&quot; And the people who do pay union dues then get annoyed with the free riders and want to stop paying dues as well. Furthermore, the union may try to strike, bu the with so many people opting out, a strike with just 15% of the workers doesn't have the same impact as 95%. It becomes much easier for management to just pick off and harass the key union leaders and get them out of the organization. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right to work laws are a product of the struggle between the labor movement and businesses opposing them. Labor unions want to organize workers to protect them and gain benefits, better wages, health care, retirement pensions for the workers. So they advocate closed shops. If a union signs up a majority of workers they want to be able to close the shop, all workers must belong to the union. New hires have a certain time period to join a union. There is a logic to this. A union shop pays better wages and has better benefits due to work by the union. </p>
<p>However in states with weak labor movements the legislatures will outlaw union shops. The law is called a right to work law. An employer can hire anyone they want. That is true in both cases. But in a right to work state no worker is required to join a union to work somewhere. So after a union has achieved better working conditions the employer can attract good workers who do not have to join the union which got those benefits. Union shops exist in those states. Peer pressure, and appreciation for the benefits of belonging to a union can get enough workers to join the union to make a business a union shop. But the law in those states says no one has to join the union to work. So maybe there is more freedom in those states.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
