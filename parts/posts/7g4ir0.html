		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question has two parts to it, depending on how you phrase it. You can ask how testosterone affects the male mind and body during development, and you can also ask how testosterone affects the male mind and body behaviorally. I'm going to answer the 2nd one, but if you're curious I can also do the first.</p>
<p>Testosterone has a lot of interesting implications in parental behavior</p>
<p>In general, in the first month of fatherhood, men experience a huge decrease in testosterone, and fathers in general also have lower testosterone than non-fathers. Fathers with more testosterone also tend to be less caring than those with less testosterone. That is to say, fathers with higher testosterone tend to touch and look at their babies less, and use less &quot;motherese&quot;.</p>
<p>So one effect of testosterone seems to be that it impairs direct caregiving. However, fathers have sharp testosterone spikes when hearing their infants cry, so testosterone also seems to have a role in protection.</p>
<p>Testosterone also seems to play a crucial role in aggression. Male monkeys tend to have more rough and tumble play than female monkeys, and exposing female fetuses in utero to androgens (a class of molecule that testosterone belongs to) increases their rates of rough and tumble play. Blocking androgen receptors in males will decrease their rates of rough and tumble play.</p>
<p>During mating season, where males have to fight each other for mates, many monkey species experience a surge in testosterone. Higher testosterone monkeys tend to be more aggressive, and injections of testosterone produce aggression in monkeys. In humans, criminals who commit violent crimes tend to have higher testosterone levels than those who commit non-violent crimes. </p>
<p>Another cool thing to consider is the Ultimatum Game.</p>
<p>In the ultimatum game, the first player receives X amount of money, and can choose to give any amount they wish to the 2nd player. If the 2nd player accepts the offer, then they both receive the money, but if the 2nd player rejects the offer, then neither get any money.</p>
<p>So, for example, if the first player gets 40 dollars and offers the 2nd player 20 dollars, if the 2nd player accepts, both get 20 dollars but if the 2nd player rejects, both get nothing.</p>
<p>Now suppose that the first player only offered the 2nd player 10 dollars, or 5 dollars. It's still in the 2nd player's best interest to accept, since they earn a small amount of money instead of no money, but men with higher testosterone tend to reject more. This is another example of how higher testosterone can lead to more aggression.</p>
<p>One reason that this could work is because there are androgen receptors in the medial orbital frontal cortex of the human brain, and testosterone inhibits MOFC activity. The MOFC is the emotional regulation centre of the brain.</p>
<p>Testosterone also plays a big role in male sexual behavior.</p>
<p>Testosterone influences the development of &quot;male&quot; characteristics. It makes men have more angular faces, have more forward protruding eyebrow ridges and central faces, and gives them a more pronounced jawline. </p>
<p>Removing testes from monkeys will kill male sexual behavior, but injections of testosterone back will restore it. However, In studies with mice, the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus has a large density of androgen receptors. Lesioning this area of the brain will kill male sexual behavior, and no injections of testosterone will restore it. This implies that one crucial part of male sexual behavior is testosterone binding to the MPOA.</p>
<p>Additionally, in humans, when men have higher testosterone, they tend to find more feminine faces more attractive. This is because females with more feminine faces tend to have higher estrogen levels, which is a sign of fertility. Unsurprisingly, higher testosterone levels also signal an increase in fertility.</p>
<p>Reading over this its kind of just a bunch of rambling studies, and I'm sorry about that, but</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm probably one of the best people to ask since I've had both low testosterone and relatively high (on hormone replacement). During my adult life with low T, I would give up on things easily. I'd get very frustrated if I couldn't figure stuff out and would throw my tools on the ground and huff and puff. When my sports team would lose, I'd become very distressed; for days! I had difficulty holding relationships with guys and girls due to my emotional instability. Now that my levels are in the normal range I keep going when I have problems, I have the drive to succeed, and I don't hold grudges, when my sports team loses I get over it within an hour and move on, and much more emotionally stable. I have a much bigger desire for competition and winning, which I get into more now. I'm able to speak my mind when something is bothering me, my communication is better. I also am able to look further into my future to plan ahead, which is nice. </p>
<p>People talk about &quot;anger&quot;, but that doesn't really happen until people are at 3x normal testosterone levels, which only happens in r/steroids, but even they don't seem to have this issue as much as it's stigmatised to be. Usually people report that when they're antagonized, it's easier for them to brush it off and not worry about it rather than want to be in a fight. </p>
<p>As for body, testosterone plays a crucial role for bone strength, red blood cell count, and of course, sexual wellness. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>daily life</p>

<p>every morning i have to scrape a blade across my face to get rid of the hair that grew the day before. </p>
<p>when i put my muscles under stress, they grow larger and stronger quickly.</p>
<p>when i'm challenged in a social or work environment, i experience the urge to respond with aggression or violence.  this has been going on my entire adult life, so it's easy to keep this under control.  it's there when i need it, though.  </p>
<p>when i see a pretty woman, i get a hit of energy and am suddenly more conscious of my posture and bearing.  i get the urge to be nice to her and come on to her.  this has also been going on my entire adult life, so it's easy to respond appropriately.  </p>
<p>i enjoy taking risks.  it's fun.  this, you may have guessed, has been going on my entire adult life, so it's easy to take calculated ones and not stupid ones.  i channel this behavioral urge into positive activities like volunteer fire fighting and approaching strangers in my job and social life.  </p>
<p>overall, i wouldn't trade that particular hormone for anything.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
