As a matter of religious faith and moral conviction, some people believe that “human life begins at conception” and that an embryo is therefore a person</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>To the extent that the US is &quot;hesitant&quot; with stem cell <em>research</em>, this has mostly to do with <em>embryonic</em> stem cell research. Why? Suffice it to say that, simply as a matter of fact, the issue of embryonic stem cell research is closely linked to the issue of abortion, which has been a political hot-button for the past forty years. But stem cell research based on non-embryonic sources continues apace with very little controversy. </p>
</li>
<li>To the extent that the US is &quot;hesitant&quot; with stem cell <em>therapy</em>, it is hardly unique. Other than bone marrow transplants (which have been performed for quite some time now), there really aren't all that many actual stem cell <em>therapies</em> that have been approved for clinical use anywhere in the world. The technology still in its infancy. <a href="http://www.closerlookatstemcells.org/stem-cells-and-medicine/nine-things-to-know-about-stem-cell-treatments" target="_blank">Very few usable therapeutic applications/uses have been definitively identified and perfected.</a> From that link:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The list of diseases for which stem cell treatments have been shown to be beneficial is still very short. The best-defined and most extensively used stem cell treatment is hematopoietic (or blood) stem cell transplantation, for example, bone marrow transplantation, to treat certain blood and immune system disorders or to rebuild the blood system after treatments for some kinds of cancer.</p>
<p>Some bone, skin and corneal (eye) injuries and diseases can be treated by grafting or implanting tissues, and the healing process relies on stem cells within this implanted tissue. These procedures are widely accepted as safe and effective by the medical community. All other applications of stem cells are yet to be proven in clinical trials and should be considered highly experimental.</p>
