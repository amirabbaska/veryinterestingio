		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. <del>There's actually a specific example of this happening in the real world â€” the Lower Merion School District outside of Philadelphia. Back in 2010, the school issued hundreds of MacBooks to their students with security software installed. It turns out that this software could <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1146666/macbook_spycam.html" target="_blank">record from the camera while disabling the indicator light</a>.</del></p>
<p>EDIT: It appears that the software in question didn't actually have the capability of turning off the green light, but researchers <em>inspired</em> by this incident actually <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2014/01/08/macbook-webcams-vulnerable-to-peek-hacking.aspx" target="_blank">proved that it could be done</a>.</p>
<p>Most laptop webcams use software to control the state of the light, since they are almost always 'powered on' at some level, regardless of whether the camera is taking images or not. Modern Macs, and many PCs, use the same camera module to collect ambient light information for screen/keyboard brightness control. For this reason, it is possible for software installed deeply within the computer to control the light separately from the camera. </p>
<p>There are also (unconfirmed) rumors that Apple's new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar includes security features specifically designed to prevent this kind of low-level access to the camera. EDIT 2: A quick explanation of how this works. The keyboard-screen-thing on the new MacBook Pro is actually an Apple Watch under the hood. The camera is connected through this, rather than directly to the computer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It can happen, but how <em>often</em> it actually happens is up for debate. In general, most people who are using computers for illegal spy-ish type things are trying to make money doing so. Targeting and watching <strong>one</strong> person is not a very efficient way to do so, it's much more profitable to send a few thousand scam emails and wait for someone to be dumb enough to tell you their credit card. </p>
<p>If you have a job that's a few rungs up the ladder (ie the kind of person who's closing their office door from time to time for important business conversations), or you're a celebrity or other particularly interesting person... that might be cause for concern. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth, it was recently pointed out that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/technology/personaltech/mark-zuckerberg-covers-his-laptop-camera-you-should-consider-it-too.html?_r=0" target="_blank">Mark Zuckerberg puts tape over his webcam and mic jack</a>. So, the man that runs one of the biggest tech businesses in the world is a little paranoid about this. </p>
<p>If I were an internet billionaire, I guess I'd be more concerned about spying too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of my friends was being watched for a week by a some random person. </p>
<p>He get's messaged one day from a girl he didn't know on Facebook, but he accepted her friend request because she was hot. When she started talking to him she started naming off shit in his room and what he was wearing. He freaked out and searched his house and outside but no one was there. Then she sent a bunch of screenshots from throughout the week of him.</p>
<p>He deleted her, covered his camera and nothing ever came of it. Probably just some kids fucking around or something but from that point on I put a post it note over mine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
