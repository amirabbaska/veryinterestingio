<p>Blankets don't &quot;trap heat&quot; as we're commonly told.  The main mechanism through which blankets keep us warm is by preventing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convective_heat_transfer" target="_blank">convective heat transfer</a>.  When you cover yourself with a blanket, it (mostly) prevents the air under the blanket from mixing with the air in the room.  Your body heats the air under the blanket, and that air pocket remains trapped, so you feel warmer.</p>
<p>This works in the exact same way for a cold object.  The cold object cools the air in close proximity to it, and the blanket prevents that cold pocket from escaping and mixing with the warmer air of the room, which keeps the object cold longer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This question was begging to be answered using the scientific principles and experimentation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get two cold objects (icecreams, sodas, icecubes, beers whatever)</li>
<li>Wrap one in a blanket.</li>
<li>Leave the other one unwrapped.</li>
<li>Leave system for 60 minutes.</li>
<li>Examine, and measure (use thermometer, or visually inspect ice cubes, or icecream, or taste beers etc).</li>
<li>Voila, you are an experimental scientist, and you are much more likely to remember the result. You may also come up with other variations that you never thought of just asking a question.</li>

<p>To test this. Take 2 can of soda/beer in the fridge and wrap one in a blanket. Set them somewhere and comeback later. The unwrapped one will be at room temperature and the other one will be much colder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good time to talk about the boundary layer.</p>
<p>The air isn't all at the same temperature.  Obviously.  Some places are warmer, some are cooler.  The thing is, air is actually pretty bad at conducting heat.  If you heat up some air, it will do a very bad job of heating up the air around it!  However, warmer air is less dense than cooler air, so it rises, and when it does, cooler air comes in and takes its place because low pressure sucks in what's around it.  This means that the difference in temperature causes air to move around.  And if you take hot air here and put it over there, then over there becomes warmer.  This is basically what convection is.</p>
<p>But if you have a hot <em>object</em>, it will heat up the air around it -- but <em>only</em> the air immediately around it.  That's because, again, air is bad at transferring heat.  That bit of air around it is called the boundary layer.  The object will lose some of its heat to the boundary layer, but as long as that boundary layer doesn't move, the object is in equilibrium: it's losing heat to the boundary layer just as much as the boundary layer is heating the object.  But boundary layers, generally, <em>do</em> move!  If you blow some wind at them, for example, you sweep away some of the boundary layer, and the object has to lose more heat to basically bring the new boundary layer to equilibrium.  (That's how fans work!)  If you put some water on them, the water will eat up some of the heat to evaporate, which will, again, cause the object to lose more heat.  (That's how sweating works!)  On the other hand, if you put the object in a blanket, it'll help keep the boundary layer undisturbed, because it won't have anywhere to go.  So it'll keep a warm object warm.  In the case of a person, remember that a person is a machine that turns food into, among other things, heat.  So a person is constantly producing heat, and if you put a person in a colder environment, the person will need to produce more heat to stay warm.  Put the person in a blanket, and now the boundary layer doesn't go away so the person doesn't need to produce as much heat to stay at the right temperature.</p>
<p>But will it work on a cold object?  Actually... yes.  Let's define &quot;cold&quot; as just colder than the ambient temperature.  Something cold has less heat than something warm (basically).  The very same processes will bring the object to equilibrium -- except that the <em>air</em> in the boundary layer will lose heat to the object until it's cold enough that the air and the object are in equilibrium.  But the boundary layer mechanism is the same.  So blowing air at a cold boundary layer will sweep it away just like with a warm boundary layer.  Similarly, wrapping it in a blanket to preserve it will work whether it's a cold boundary layer or a warm one.  But putting water on a boundary layer will only work to make it lose heat, though.  However, if you put enough water in the <em>air</em>, depending on the temperature and moisture on the surface, you might make it so that the boundary layer is drier than the air around it, so in equilibrium, the air gives more water than gets evaporated, and you could see a warming effect instead of a cooling effect.  This happens when you fog up some glass, for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
