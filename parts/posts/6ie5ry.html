		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microscopic(or larger) corrosion can occur between the battery ends and the controllers contact terminals.</p>
<p>This corrosion increases circuit resistance - making it harder for charge to flow from battery to device. Basically more resistance lower voltage, and every electronic device has a minimum operating voltage.</p>
<p>By wacking the controller, you are repositioning the contacts ever so slightly and may get a better contact between power source(battery) and the controller. This better contact lowers resistance, allowing a slightly higher voltage to flow in to the controller, letting it work a little longer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're referring to <strong>Percussive Maintenance</strong>, which is just a clever way of saying &quot;hitting the device a couple of times and see if it works.&quot; </p>
<p>For a VCR, it's probably a gear or a ribbon that's gotten caught. For a vending machine, it's probably a coin or snack that's become jammed. For a computer, it's probably a connection somewhere that's gotten dusty or misaligned. Haphazardly hitting/jostling the device can sometimes correct whatever has gotten out of wack. </p>
<p>In the case of the very simplistic remote control, it's likely a cruddy or misaligned battery connection that needs to be shifted back into place. It could also be another very small connection (to the IR emitter, for example) that needs to be moved a bit. That's the best part about Percussive Maintenance, you'll never know and you'll never care!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an alkaline battery like the one explained in the energizer datasheet below, the battery works by having a chunk of oxygen pop off a manganese plate, cross through a goo, and and stick to a zinc plate. It's sort of like starting with a clean dish and a dirty dish in a washpan and ending up with two dirty dishes in that at the atomic level there are chunks of oxygen that need to break off of or stick to chunks of metal. Shaking/shock can help release microscopic particles of manganese and zinc and expose enough new metal surfaces to get another sip of power.</p>
<p>It really is, however, more likely that you are just pulverizing the corrosion off of connections.</p>
<p>It is even more likely that it's luck. Remotes are slow. Sometimes the rubber buttons don't feel smashed down until almost a quarter of a second after the electrical connection has happened, then the infrared signal getting received is a lucky-shot thing. You tried something, then it worked, but it might have been intermittent all along.</p>
