		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beyond the generalized sex differences, there are a number of hormones that affect where and how we store fat - for ex. estrogen encourages the more 'classically feminine' fat storage patterns (hips and thighs) whereas stuff like cortisol and insulin production lead more to belly fat. As the latter two, cortisol in particular, are highly stress-dependent, people may even notice different fat storage patterns at different stages of life, depending on things like diet and levels of stress or of sex hormones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a graduate student studying human nutrition, and I just finished a class on nutritional biochemistry where we studied the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and energy balance regulation in great detail. To answer your question, I'll need to start by explaining a couple of small details about fat digestion, and then I'll move on to answering your actual question.</p>
<p>When you consume any amount of fat in your diet, the cells in your small intestine will package those fatty acids into things called chylomicrons. When you think of a chylomicron, think of the fat-equivalent of a water balloon, but at the molecular level. Chylomicrons have a number of different molecules, but you might say that their primary function in the body is to transfer any fat you ingest to wherever the body needs it to go, be it for energy use or energy storage. All the fat that's being transported via these chylomicrons is done so in the form of triglycerides, which are three fatty acids attached to a 3-carbon molecule called glycerol. </p>
<p>After the small intestine cells package the fat into these chylomicrons, the chylomicrons are sent throughout the body by entering the lymphatic system, which then eventually pours into the blood stream via the subclavian vein. The blood takes these small packages of fatty acids throughout all tissues in the body. (Side note--this is oversimplified: fatty acids of different lengths have different pathways, but this will give you the basic idea without overloading you with too much detail that you don't care about.)</p>
<p>The main way the body regulates where this fat is stored is by regulating the specific protein that these chylomicrons dock to that will cause the fatty acids to be transferred to whatever cells are in a given area. Keep in mind that these could be any cells in the body, including skeletal muscle cells (which would primarily metabolize the fatty acids for energy production), as well as adipocytes (the name for cells whose primary function is to store fat in the body for use during periods of fasting, starvation, or simply between meals in a given day). The name of the protein that is responsible for transferring these fatty acids from chylomicrons to neighboring cells is called lipoprotein lipase, and you'll see it commonly abbreviated as LPL. </p>
<p>This protein is located in capillaries throughout the body. When a passing chylomicron encounters LPL, a receptor on the exterior of the chylomicron known as Apo-C allows for the chylomicron to dock to the LPL protein, and LPL begins to drain the chylomicron of the triglycerides it contains and hydrolyze them to make free fatty acids--they're not attached to a glycerol molecule anymore. These free fatty acids then float near cells that are found near that capillary where this is all taking place and are free to pass through the membrane of whatever cell is in the vicinity due to how similar they are to the general structure of cell membranes. Once inside the cells, these fatty acids are restructured into a triglyceride by using a glycerol molecule that was created within the cell, and the triglyceride is now able to be stored or used for energy.</p>
<p>So now to your question: how does the body regulate where fat is stored? Why do we accumulate fat in our stomachs, butts, and thighs instead of our foreheads or the backs of our hands? This is primarily determined by where and to what degree LPL is expressed. I believe there are several ways LPL is genetically regulated, but they only ways I've learned about are hormonal regulations. For example, when you consume a diet containing both carbohydrate and fat molecules (which will be most any meal you eat, really), the insulin that's expressed will spread throughout the body and interact with all the cells it reaches in several different ways. One of those ways is going to be by inducing an upregulation of LPL in those parts of the body that the body desires fat to be stored or taken up. As others have mentioned, other hormones affect the body's fat distribution in several ways, and I admit I don't understand the specific mechanisms for how these hormones all work on LPL, but I know that insulin is one of the major hormones involved.</p>
<p>Now, out of principle I try to admit there may be errors in my explanation, but I'm fairly confident in this description overall. If you have further questions--be it about this topic or any other in the field of nutritional science--feel free to PM me and I'll see if I can answer your questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, as both males and females get older the bone marrow fills with adipocytes even as peripheral fat is lost. In the bone marrow you have cells called mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that serve as progenitor cells for both adipocytes and osteoblasts (bone building cells). As you get older the MSCs can become more predispositioned towards becoming adipocytes, partially due to changes in signaling that promotes the adipocyte transcription factor Ppar gamma while decreasing the osteoblastic transcription factor Runx2. This happens very often in pathologic conditions as well, such as diabetes. In addition, a lack of mechanical signaling through weight bearing activities can shift the balance towards adipocytes. Yet another cause for increased bone marrow fat is likely caloric deficiency as people with anorexia accumulate bone marrow fat but lose fat everywhere else. Functionally little is known about fat cells in the bone marrow versus other sites, but I did much of my PhD work studying them so I figured I'd share a bit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fat storage is decided by many factors, but the biggest factor is how you use your body. an endurance athlete will have a lot of fat stored near muscle tissue to get an instant supply of aerobic energy, and not so much fat under the skin because lipolysis (burning fat for energy) is constantly active which would make fat storage under the skin very inefficient. </p>
<p>Sedentary people have less fat in their muscle and more visceral and subdermal fat because the excess amount of energy just has to be stored somewhere. On top of that their ability for burning fat in an aerobic way is impaired, which means they will hit their anaerobic threshhold a lot faster and will skip the burning fat for energy phase a lot quicker =&gt; (maintaining factor for obesity). </p>
<p>Another factor for fat storage is hormones and i think this factor answers your question. Female hormones will stimulate storage of fat in hips and thighs and breasts, while male hormones will stimulate muscle mass, which in turn will stimulate burning fat =&gt; less subdermal fat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
