		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly, it won't. I've answered a question before about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4wnw3w/what_advancements_could_quantum_computing_provide/d6928vq/?context=3" target="_blank">What advancements could quantum computing provide for future videogames?</a></p>
<p>The short answer is nothing directly, because quantum computers will, for any even remotely foreseeable future, be specialized research devices. They will not be in your computers.</p>
<p>That said, somebody has to program the specialized devices. Right now they're so small that they get programmed directly: the quantum circuits are constructed for a specific purpose (i.e. not a programmable computer, even if it's doing quantum computation).</p>
<p>At some point they will probably get more programmable, but we'll likely follow a similar path as normal computation: people will write directly in the machine language of the quantum CPU, at first.</p>
<p>But of course, we do actually have research in quantum programming languages. Here's a handy scholar link: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C24&q=quantum+programming+language&btnG" target="_blank">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C24&q=quantum+programming+language&btnG</a>=</p>
<p>From that, you'll see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.3390.pdf" target="_blank">Quipper</a> for trying to make an actually-useful quantum programming language.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
