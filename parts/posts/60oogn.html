		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might want to hold off on the explanation.</p>
<p>Your nipples and penis get darker when you go through puberty. The sex hormones cause a surge in Melanin (which is the pigmentation in your hair and skin).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You should emphasize to your son that people naturally come in different shapes and sizes, and it's all well and good, hardly ever anything that warrants pointing and gawking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
