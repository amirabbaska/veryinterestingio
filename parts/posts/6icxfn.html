		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Argentina was one of the destinations for Nazis being smuggled out of Europe in the closing days and aftermath of World War II. Nicknamed <a href="https://goo.gl/V5FWep" target="_blank">ratlines</a> and identified collectively as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODESSA" target="_blank">Operation ODESSA</a> by the Allies, many different organizations and outfits existed to help Germans who should have been tried for war crimes escape justice, and many ended up being able to set up shop in South America instead, living under false names among the German descended minority populations there. </p>
<p>Argentina was a popular destination because it had a sizable and well established German minority (which actually predated the creation of a unified &quot;Germany&quot;), and also because the Peron government wasn't philosophically opposed to the then-collapsed fascist governments of Nazi Germany and Vichy France, and saw the chance to recruit foreign talent (including scientists and technology experts, akin to the American Operation Paperclip) by either turning a blind eye to their crimes or in some cases actively aiding and abetting their escape from Europe. The former meant that Germans (both legit expats and ratline smuggled criminals) had a community they could integrate into, and the latter made it easier to hide from the international community by giving them a legal buffer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Argentina is culturally connected to Germany: Many Argentines are of German descent. The Nazi regime made use of this to strengthen ties between the 2 countries. The Pèron government at the time admired the fascism of the Nazi government and shared their anti-Semitism. Sympathy was not the only reason for the regime's willingness to accept Nazi escapees: money (much of it being war loot) was also involved and Pèron hoped that the Nazi military officials, businessmen and scientists they were taking in could play important roles in the Argentine state. He also hoped to obtain advanced German military technology to modernise the Argentinian army. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Vote for Knife Party already explained it for the most part.
Nazi commanders had an escape plan to Argentina, the government sheltered them after WWII.  What was left of the Nazi elite that made it over settled into the country and attempted to start the 4th Reich.  A few years into this the local government was overthrown from a coup.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
