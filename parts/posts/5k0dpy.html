<p>On the other hand, some quick intuitive properties we know do change: in base 10 numbers that end in 0,2,4,6,8 or 5 are just not prime, simply because the way base 10 is constructed (except for 2 and 5 of course), the first set are even so multiple of 2, and numbers that end in 0 and 5 are right away multiples of 5. In base 3, numbers that end in 0 aren't prime because they are multiples of 3 (expect for 10=3), but it's not so easy to recognize an even number.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What defines prime number is if you divde them by other number rather than 1 or itself, it will leave a reminder.</p>
<p>Putting them in another base system only changes how you represent them, but their real value is the same.
As we say here in Mexico: It's the same cat but rolled.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they are. Here's a way to think about it:</p>
<p>You have a pile of beads. You want to write down how many beads you have. This may seem obvious, but it's an an important point: How you write it doesn't change anything about the pile of beads. You can write the number using any base system or language and the quantity of beads won't change.</p>
<p>Your question, then, is this:</p>
<p>Is &quot;primeness&quot; property of the pile of beads, or is it a property of how you write down the number of beads?</p>
<p>Here is a way to think about &quot;primeness&quot;:</p>
<p>If you arrange the beads on a grid, how many different kinds of rectangles can you make using ALL of the beads?</p>
<p>If you have six beads, you can make a 1 by 6 rectangle or a 2 by 3 rectangle. (We won't worry about 6 by 1 or 3 by 2, because those are just different ways of looking at the rectangle. If you don't believe me, make a 2 by 3 rectangle on your table. Now walk one quarter of the way around your table and look at your rectangle. Presto! Now it's a 3 by 2 rectangle)</p>
<p>So there are only two rectangles you can make: 1 by 6 and 2 by 3. I'll use &quot;x&quot; instead of &quot;by&quot; from here on.</p>
<p>What about twelveve beads? They can be arranged as 1x12, 2x6, or 3x4 rectangles.</p>
<p>What about fifteen beads? 1x15 or 3x5.</p>
<p>What about 20? 1x20, 2x10, or 4x5.</p>
<p>What about 5? There's only one rectangle you can make: 1x5. That's what it means to be a prime number: you can only make one rectangle out of that number of beads. And it doesn't matter what name you give to the number; it doesn't matter how you count the beads. The quanity of beads determines how many rectangle you can make.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
