I can understand why using your voice for a long time causes a sore throat, from it getting dried out, hence why water is so helpful to broadcasters. But even if I yell for a  short period of time, my throat becomes sore. Why?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, a lack of proper breath pressure (support) and proper glottal (that is, vocal fold) closure. In this case, the folds either slam together, causing swelling, or come together incompletely, causing irritation and possible homorrhaging.</p>
<p>Opera singers sing unamplified over orchestras of up to 100 players without feeling pain, but if they shout without proper breath pressure and glottal closure, they experience the same pain you do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The others have already got you the most of it about the vocal cords colliding etc. </p>
<p>The really interesting thing is that like anywhere else you can build callouses if you do this too often. This is what causes singers to need surgery as these nodules can make singing almost impossible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
