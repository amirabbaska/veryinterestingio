		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, that was never the premise on which ruling out large quantities of anti-matter in our Universe was based.</p>
<p>The space between galaxies may seem empty, but all of it is chock full of matter, just at very low densities. However, intergalactic gas clouds do interact with each other from one galaxy or galaxy cluster to the next. Most of the time this is a very mild interaction because the gases are at very low densities and typically not traveling at any great tremendous speeds relative to each other.</p>
<p>However, if one galaxy, or galaxy cluster, were made of anti-matter there would most definitely be an observable effect. At some boundary between the two oppositely composed regions there would be an interface where one side would be a gas cloud of matter and on the other side would be a gas cloud of anti-matter. And the properties of matter and anti-matter are such that these would continuously interact. And by &quot;interact&quot; I mean they would continuously annihilate, releasing vast quantities of energy in the process.</p>
<p>Now, you might imagine that a super low density gas as surrounds a galaxy at hundreds of thousands of light years distance would not have many molecules per volume, and you'd be absolutely right. Such gases would be considered extremely good vacuums here on Earth. And that might lead you to think that the total quantity and rate of annihilation reactions would thus be small. But that's not thinking on astronomical scales. We're not talking about a boundary interface that is a few square meters or even square kilometers in area, nor even a few square light years. We're talking about areas that are on the scale of hundreds of thousands of light years on a side and thus many billions of square light years. Millions of trillions of <em>moles</em> of square meters in area. When you do the math you come to the conclusion that these interfaces, if they were to exist, would glow as brightly as any galaxy, and would be quite distinctive in their very specific gamma ray emissions (especially corresponding to the electron-positron annihilation energy) which would be detectable across the visible Universe.</p>
<p>Simply put, we see absolutely nothing like that, which means that unless there is some bizarre unknown process keeping anti-matter and matter galaxies separate from one another then we can fairly conclusively rule out the existence of any anti-galaxies in our visible Universe.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: adding in some additional material to answer some common questions.</p>
<p>First off, as mentioned galaxies / galaxy clusters are surrounded by gas (actually plasma) bubbles. These bubbles have a pressure and a temperature (from about 100 thousand Kelvin to 10 million Kelvin), and are mostly made up of ionized Hydrogen. Because they are under pressure if you take away material from some area the intergalactic medium will continuously fill it, just as any time you release a gas into a vacuum. And because of the high temperature of the IGM the matter is travelling fairly fast, on the order of 10s of km/s. Even though the density of the IGM is very low, a few atoms per cubic meter, that high speed means that a significant flux of atoms would be continuously hitting a boundary layer between galaxies. If that boundary layer is just another bubble of IGM plasma then the two will press against each other and find an equilibrium. If the other side of the boundary layer is anti-matter then the atoms and anti-atoms in the IGM/anti-IGM will rapidly attract one another and ionize, with a rate on the order of the density of matter and the molecular velocity of matter in the IGM due to its temperature. A simplistic &quot;napkin math&quot; calculation would be: 5 atoms / m^3 <em> (100000 light-years)^2 </em> 50 km/s, times 2, or roughly 4e47 Hydrogen/anti-Hydrogen annihilations per second, which corresponds to roughly 10^38 Watts, or about 250 billion times the Sun's luminosity. And keep in mind that this is a fairly low estimate. But it indicates how bright such an interface would typically be, which would be on the same scale as the luminosity of a galaxy. Additionally, as I alluded to, because of the very specific gamma-ray emissions of electron-positron annihilation (at 511 KeV) even if it was many orders of magnitude dimmer, it would leave incredibly distinctive &quot;spectral fingerprints&quot; in gamma ray emissions.</p>
<p>Also, I should mention that the IGM is observable, so we know that these bubbles of plasma between galaxies do exist and we have measured some of their properties, it's not merely a matter of assuming they are real.</p>
<p>Second, currently we have not conclusively demonstrated that anti-matter is affected by gravitation exactly the same way that normal matter is. However, that is the model that is consistent with our current best understanding of the laws of physics. So much so that if anti-matter and regular matter were to, say, repel each other gravitationally that would actually be a vastly more significant result even than the existence of huge swathes of the Universe that were made of anti-matter. And in general it falls under the &quot;extraordinary claims&quot; banner. It's not 100% ruled out as a possibility, but then again neither is the explanation of, say, aliens who are hiding the evidence of anti-galaxies from us using extremely advanced alien technologies.</p>
<p>Additionally, I should address the fact that observing our entire visible Universe being made up almost entirely of matter (well, the non dark-energy / dark-matter part of it anyway) is itself a somewhat significant result, due to the fact that the laws of physics seem more or less symmetrical with respect to matter/anti-matter. Naively we would assume that matter and anti-matter should always be produced in equal quantities, so the Universe should be 50/50 even today. However, that's not entirely true. We do observe so-called CP-violations in particle physics experiments which show that some of the things we think are always 100% conserved are not and there is a slight bias to the laws of physics. We haven't been able to come up with the complete chain of events which connects the CP-violations we can observe to the net abundance of matter over anti-matter in the Universe but it is essentially a smoking gun in the case of the &quot;death&quot; of anti-matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
