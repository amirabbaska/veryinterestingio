		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, because it turns out that that isn't how the universe works.</p>
<p>It <em>appears</em> to do so, because we're used to really, really slow speeds. If you're in a train travelling at 100 km/h and you walk towards the front end at 2 km/h, you expect to be able to add the speeds and say that you are moving at 102 km/h (relative to the tracks, that is).</p>
<p>But in fact, that's not quite true, because the universe isn't constructed quite as simply as that. You're actually moving at <em>very slightly under</em> 102 km/h. The difference is so tiny, you can't measure it; but it's there.</p>
<p>The faster you go, the more pronounced this effect becomes. And once you reach the speed of light, this effect is so huge that you can't actually go any faster. No matter how much you try to accelerate, you can't: the speed of light is the fastest speed possible in this universe.</p>
<p>This is a bit mind-blowing, but here's a thought experiment for you: If you and I stand back to back and then start walking away from each other, at a constant speed and in the same direction, what's the furthest we can get from each other?</p>
<p>You might say that, at least in theory, we could continue getting further away from each other for all of eternity, but you'd be wrong. In fact, the furthest distance we can get from each other is 20,000 kilometres. Once we've reached that distance apart from each other, we can continue walking in the same direction at the same speed, but the distance between us starts to <em>decrease</em>.</p>
<p>Why? Because, contrary to appearances, the earth is not flat. And although it has no edge, it has a size, and that size means that 20,000 km is the greatest distance possible between two people or objects. There is no such distance as, for example, 25,000 km -- it doesn't exist on our earth.</p>
<p>In a very similar way, the fastest speed any two objects can move relative to each other is the speed of light. There's no force stopping you getting past that, in just the same way that there's no invisible wall stopping us from walking more than 20,000 km. It's simply the way the universe is constructed: it's a fundamental property, as fundamental as its size, that c is the fastest speed, and no speed faster than that exists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people say in sci-fi movies that &quot;time is the fourth dimension&quot;, it's not just a metaphor or analogy. It's quite literal. Time is intimately tied to the geometry of our universe.</p>
<p>This means that moving through space affects how you move through time. At everyday scales, we don't notice the difference, but when you start going very very fast, time also begins to bend.</p>
<p>You cannot go faster than c, because the closer you get to c, the slower time runs for you. To use a geometry analogy, you can fold a paper in half, until the two halves touch each other. Can you fold the paper <em>past</em> that? Well, of course not. You've already folded it as far as it will go.</p>
<p>The same applies to space-time. Time is part of the <em>geometry</em> of our universe, so it bends along with space, meaning that trying to go faster than c is like trying to fold a piece of paper past 180 degrees.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light doesn't accelerate. Photons are already traveling at the speed of light the instant they are created. They don't behave like ordinary matter with mass, which can accelerate forever and approach arbitrarily close to the speed of light but never reach it.</p>
<p>As for why light has a speed at all and why the speed is what it is and not any other number or infinite, we don't know. It's simply one of the fundamental properties of our universe. It's not a satisfying answer, but it is what it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You would thin that, but it turns out that the universe does strange stuff as you approach C. Time starts to slow down for objects approaching C and distances get shorter, and it only gets more drastic the faster you go. The end result is that no matter how fast you travel light speed is always faster.</p>
<p>You ask where the force that's preventing you from accelerating. The answer is there is no force. The universe itself distorts in such a way that no force is necessary. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
