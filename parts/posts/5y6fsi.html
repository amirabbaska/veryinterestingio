		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A film director is more in charge of the artistic &quot;vision&quot; of the film. Often on sets, the director won't even be looking through a camera feed, instead focusing on the script and performance - leaving things like sound and visuals up to all the others working on the film (assistant directors, cinematographers, editors, special and practical effects people etc.) but acting as a middle-man to help coordinate them towards a goal.</p>
<p>So animation or any other medium with a &quot;director&quot; job title is similar - they're in charge of realising the message, themes and artistry of the performances, while there are subordinate directors who focus on the other stuff - eg. director of animation.</p>
<p>That said, there isn't really a hard and fast rule about these things. Some film directors are also basically the director of photography, or sitting in the editing room or even acting in their own films, and some animation directors are hand-drawing keyframes alongside the animation team.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty similar, they plan out the film, storyboard, and so on. Animation is done with simple models at first, they work on the shots, camera movements etc.
The big difference is the finalized shots take hours or even days to render out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A relatively new thing that has come about for 3D animation is a special roll called &quot;previs&quot; short for pre-visualization.  Between the story-board and the final animation, a previs sits down and does a &quot;crappy&quot; run through of many of the scenes in the movie (basic lighting, low to no texture, really low poly count, unrefined animation with only key time points).  A few previs takes can be made of a scene in just a few hours covering with lots of variations to run by the director.  The director either approves of one of them or gives a bunch of suggestions to adapt things (almost like a director of a live action movie) and the previs goes and tries a few more takes of the &quot;crappy&quot; animation to adapt to these suggestions which only takes a few more hours.  Previs shots that are approved by the director get handed off to the final animators who spend incredible amounts of time getting all the details to their final level and refinement.</p>
<p><em>EDIT:</em> Source: I occasionally hang out with the guy who was previs on Sausage Party.  He was the one who had the surreal work experience one point of coming in every day for a few weeks to animate food having an orgy, and then sit in a room with a director and talk about which food-sex shots worked or not and why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in the animated film industry at a major studio, so I can definitely shed some light on this.</p>
<p>An animated film has a defined pipeline, which is loosely broken in to Story/Editorial, Asset Departments, and Shot Departments. The Director has a 9-5 on the Studio Lot, and breaks his time up (rather, has his time broken up for him) among all of the working departments. </p>
<p>Story and Editorial is where the Director spends roughly ~80% of his time (in most cases). Story is concerned with writing the script and boarding the script, while Editorial is concerned with Editing the boards together to form the blueprint of the film, and recording talent (or &quot;scratch&quot;/standin dialogue, if talent is not available). Nothing goes in to production without boards to inform. </p>
<p>The last ~20% of the Directors time is used as an approvals bottleneck for the Asset departments, who build the Assets (ex. modeling / texturing), and the Shot departments, who ingest the built assets to create the final film (ex. animation, lighting). This ~20% usually rises to 100% in the last couple months of production, as Story/Edit drops away. </p>
<p>In terms of an approvals process, it usually begins with the individual department's Head of Department, moves on to the Production Designer (sometimes in concert with the Art Director), and finishes with the VFX Supervisor / Producer(s) / Director(s). Depending on how featured or otherwise important what is being shown is, it may not require the full treatment. A characters hairstyle would require the full treatment, but the texture of a basketball might not necessarily need approval past the Head of Department for Surfacing, as it will be seen in a final shot later on by everyone. </p>
<p>tl;dr The Director spends most of his time with Story/Editorial, and trusts a multi-stage approvals process below him to show him only what he needs to see, and one that should be staying within his vision. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Starts off with a storyboard which are basic drawings outlining key information. Then comes ADR and basic sound effects, after those are recorded the storyboards and sounds will be put into something called an animatic. And animatic is basically the important camera positions frames and movements within an animation without all of the small details because its simply made in order to get a feel for what the film will look like and make it easier to plan. Once the animatic is done the keyframes from the animatic will be made into proper drawings/models (depending on whether it's 2D or 3D). Once the keyframes are done they will be sent elsewhere where the inbetween frames are made (this takes the longest ). Once the inbetween frames are put in the film is ready to be lit and textured (or be coloured). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
