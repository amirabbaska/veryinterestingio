		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tl;dr: We don't know but it could have something to do with reduced energy supplies, a build-up of waste metabolites and reduced synaptic pruning  (impairing removal of old connections to make room for new ones).</p>
<p>We know that people need sleep as all animals do it or at least have some equivalent of sleep. For example, insects don't have REM and dolphins sleep by turning off one brain hemisphere (since they breathe voluntarily, one hemisphere must be active at all times to avoid drowning). The thing is, we know a lot about what happens during sleep, in terms of the electrophysiological, biochemical and psychological markers, but not an awful lot as to why we actually need it. There is no single theory that explains why exactly we need it, but the most popular ones tend to revolve around fighting infections, reducing energy consumption and clearance of waste products from the brain.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head I can think of three pieces of evidence for this (I'm sure there's more). The first two are pretty obvious. Firstly, we fight off infections best when we are asleep and we consume less energy while asleep. In terms of clearing waste products, changes in neuroglial behaviour suggest that they clear waste products from the brain while sleeping, as many regulate cerberopinal fluid; the main mechanism of removing waste metabolites from the brain (as this organ requires different conditions from the rest of the body). It's perfectly possible that all these theories are correct and we need to sleep for all three reasons.</p>
<p>Another more recent theory suggests that synaptic pruning occurs during sleep, whereby unwanted connections are removed from the brain (this also happens in babies: they are born with something like 10 times the amount of neurons they and only the strongest neurons and connections between them survive into adulthood). So for example, it may not be necessary for me to remember a certain conversation I had with a friend that day, so the synapses conveying that information may be pruned during sleep. </p>
<p>So I can think of two reasons as to why cognitive performance declines when sleep deprived. The brain could be working inefficiently when sleep deprived due to an energy deficiency and build up of waste metabolites which screw up the carefully designed molecular machinery that keeps your brain functioning. It could also (or additionally) be due the reduced synaptic pruning consequent of sleep deprivation: the unnessecary synapses don't just create clutter, they take up space and this may make it harder for new synaptic connections to form. This would impair cognition as a large chunk is dependent on synaptic plasticity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Daniel Kahneman’s book “Thinking Fast and Slow” answers this question from a psychology standpoint.  Essentially, cognition is hard for our brains, so whenever possible we avoid it.  Most of our decision making is done in System 1 thinking, which is quick but often lazy.  It’s where many of our biases reside.  When we actually think hard about something we enter System 2, which requires more of your body and brain.  Kahneman and his partner Amos Tversky did a whole bunch of experiments where they watched the subjects’ eyes while they were engaged in the Add-3 task and found that our pupils dilate when we enter System 2 thinking.  System 2 thinking requires a lot of effort, which is why we mostly avoid it unless we have to.  In addition, the more we enter into System 2, the less likely we are to go back into System 2 for the next task, since our brains are tired and don’t want to work hard again, which is why we often make poor decisions at the end of a long day or when mentally or physically tired.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I preface this by saying that we don’t know, because this is something very difficult to study with limited resources, so take what you read with a grain of salt. The science is by no means clear, and we’re not even sure that conscious thought is anything but an emergent and ultimately useless property of brain function (if the brain is an engine making things run, consciousness might just be the heat coming off of it).
That said, one more cognitive theory I’m partial to is the very vague idea of energy allocation/attention. Your brain does everything from complex strategizing to keeping you breathing. The functional organization of the brain is (very) roughly basic to advanced from causal to rostral (and from inside to out). Looking at the development of brains across evolutionary time scales, you’ll see that the more “intelligent” the animal, the more the front of the brain grows it and develops (intelligence is also poorly understood and ill defined). These frontal areas appear to provide the means for complex cognition as well as direct attention and processing power in some way. These areas are also the most developed in the sense that they can compensate for simpler areas, but simpler areas can not compensate for them.</p>
<p>Imagine processing power to be like a finite jar of water and brain processes to be like cups. You have to keep some of them (like staying alive) full, no matter what. The rest can vary, and in theory, you can have infinite cups. To be efficient, however, you’ll be very careful with your allocation. Now let’s say that with a full night’s sleep, you get a full jar of water. You fill your basic life function cups, your sensory processing cups, and your motor function cups, and can use the rest for things like asking questions on Reddit or pondering your place in the universe. You can’t completely fill many other cups,  but you have a good amount. You can also share what you have depending on needs. Say you suddenly have to pay close attention to sound. More water goes to the hearing and listening cups, at the temporary expense of other cups, then settled back to normal.
Now, consider that the water in the cups does get depleted through the day. You will always keep your basic life function cups full because you would like to stay alive. This means you have to give some water up from these more cognitive processes to more basic areas. By the end of the day, you’re functioning, but you start feeling a little fuzzier on the tougher things. The next morning, if you get a full nights sleep, your jar is refilled and you start over. </p>
<p>Now let’s say you haven’t slept very well. Your jar isn’t completely full, but you would like to stay alive, be able to perceive what’s going on in the world, and be able to move around and interact with it. Those cups get filled first, leaving just a little for more complex processing. You’ll get by, but you might struggle some. As the day goes by and the water starts depleting, it gets harder to focus, as you’re expending more of it on basic things. Thinking clearly is a luxury. Breathing, having reflexes work, being able to see/hear/feel are necessities. You allocate more processing to those and suffer a bit cognitively. Too tired and you’ll basically be a zombie, alive, but on autopilot, so to speak.</p>
<p>If that analogy makes sense, then it might also make sense that the frontal cortices may direct information processing, cognitive load, and energy consumption across the brain. When the whole brain is tired, it directs more towards more basic areas, leaving less for these complex processes to work with. Your brain’s primary function is to keep you alive. Abstract cognition is not its highest priority. And since energy resources are limited, and these control areas can compensate for more basic areas (but basic areas can’t compensate for more developed regions), you’re going to suffer cognitively at the expense of keeping you functioning.</p>
<p>Caveats to this analogy: we don’t know what the water is or what form it takes. We don’t how it gets refilled when you sleep (a few theories are floating around on this post). We don’t how you choose what cups to fill, or even how many cups there are. The only things we think we know are that attention seems finite, cognitive abilities improve with better sleep/suffer with less sleep, and that resources can be allocated depending on need. The rest is very difficult to understand even from a cognitive point of view, much less from a neurobiological perspective. </p>
<p>To give you an idea of why it’s hard to study: for the most part, in the technology we use to study the brain, we have two axes of investigation: time and space. Processes like vesicle fusion at the synapse are inconceivably short. Action potentials take a couple of milliseconds. Visual processing takes a few dozen milliseconds. Basic math takes a second or two, etc. If you want to look at synapse dynamics, with our current technology, you can only look at a few synapses max (out of trillions in the human brain). If you want to look at action potentials, you can look at quite a few cells (say... around 100), but you’ll lose some temporal specificity. If you want to look at circuit dynamics, you can use calcium imaging, which will lose some AP specificity, but give  you access to even more cells. You can look at the BOLD signal, which takes entire seconds, lets you see the whole brain, but loses temporal and spacial resolution. EEG is great time-wise, but only lets you see a thin layer of cortical cells, with shit specificity.  A few other methods are spaced around those, but the problem is the same: the more of the brain you can see, the less you know about the temporal or spatial specificity if a function. It’s obvious that sleep has important biological implications, on the level of individual cells. But it also has effects on entire networks. And we can’t study both at the same time, making it hard to pin to one mechanism, or integrate across scales. Our technology is simply not good enough to answer questions like this— we have some theories and guesses, and people have tried to make progress using what we do have, but that’s about it. We can’t answer these questions to satisfaction. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if anyone has said this already, but our bodies also go through the process of gluconeogenesis while we’re asleep, which is the production of new glucose from non carbohydrate sources. Glucose is the brain’s preferred energy source and without sleep, the glucose stores begin to get low and the brain is forced to use other, less efficient sources for energy. This is also why we wake up tired and disoriented after a night of drinking, because gluconeogenesis is less of a priority compared to removing ethanol while you’re asleep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain is a neural network that learns.  As you go through your day, your brain is constantly firing neurons in response to whatever you are experiencing, directly or indirectly.  &quot;Neurons that fire together wire together.&quot; This means that as each neuron is excited, it has a strengthening effect on the connections that caused it to fire.  This makes the inputs more likely to fire again later in response to the same stimuli.  This is a critical part of the learning process.  Note that throughout the course of a day, all of these excitations build up on each other, especially if the same ones fire over and over again.  Learning is not only additive.  Pruning of spurious connections must also occur.  If this did not happen, then at the end of our lives, all the neurons in our brains would fire in response to everything, and it would be a meaningless, jumbled mess.  In one of the phases of sleep (light or deep, I don't recall which), all of the neuronal connections in the brain are dampened.  The relative connection strengths are maintained, just the whole system is brought down to a normal level to start the next day with.  REM sleep, on the other hand seeks to refire novel connections that were made the previous day in order to strengthen them even further.</p>
<p>So, when you reach a tired state where you seem to have difficulty thinking, this indicates that your day has been long and full of novel experiences.  Your neuronal connection weights are at capacity and are starting to overfire and interfere with each other.  And, overall, you are in a state whereby you need a sleep cycle in order to finalize the day's learnings and reset for tomorrow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
