		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wood houses are built using wood skeletal frames,  the &quot;bones&quot; of these houses are studs.  They provide sufficient structural support to keep the building standing and intact for decades, even centuries. You dont need to build housed out of solid wood, as it would just be unnecessarily expensive.</p>
<p>Drywall replaced <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lath_and_plaster" target="_blank">lath and plaster</a>. lath are thin wood planks that would be nailed to the studs in ceilings and interior walls.   They don't provide structural support, they just create a flat surface between the studs, which would then be plastered.   This was a multistep process that took several days to complete a room.  Drywall, on the other hand, prefabricates the walls, ready to install.  Just nail the sheet to the wall and you're basically done.  Experienced drywallers can do i ln a day what lath and plaster-ers could do in a week, while offering a comparable result. This dramatically cut down construction time, required less labor, and thus saved money, so it was widely adopted. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Many of the answers in the thread are correct, but one of the big reasons everyone is missing is the fire rating of drywall. Drywall is made of gypsum, a hydrated form of calcium sulfate. When the gypsum is exposed to heat, the crystalline water begins to calcine off. This reaction consumes a TON of energy, and prevents fire from spreading across the sheet for considerable time. You can aim a flamethrower at one side of a typical 1/2&quot; sheet of drywall, and the opposite side of the sheet won't rise above 220F for about 30 mins. Hopefully the fire department has arrived by then. </p>
<p>Feel free to ask more questions, I find pleasure in explaining this kind of stuff!</p>
<p>Edit-to kill some misconceptions, I work in capital projects engineering for a drywall manufacturer. &quot;Drywall engineer&quot; doesn't exist, and would be way too general of a field!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Buildings began as solid wall construction using logs or stone to as the structure, and a bonding agent to fill the gaps and add structure.  But solid walls require a lot of heavy material and they don't insulate temperature or sound well, and it takes a tremendous effort.  Also, every house was constructed individually so logs were hand shaped on site, and stone was assembled based on the available materials.  </p>
<p>When the hollow wall came into practice, precut (milled) lumber could be used as the 'bones' of a home dramatically reducing the work time,  weight, and variations due to materials.  With just the bones in place, the walls needed to be covered. </p>
<p>For a long time, small, rough thin boards were used (lathe) to cover the walls, then a layer of plaster was applied to make it smooth, attractive, and air tight.  But cutting/buying thousands of boards, nailing them up, and artfully spreading plaster is time (and money) consuming.</p>
<p>Using large, premade sheets to cover the walls would make installation easier and cheaper.  When drywall offered all of these benefits, it became to predominant material.  However, other materials have come &amp; gone with trends.... real wood (knotty pine is in my house), manufactured (fake) wood paneling, etc.</p>
<p>Thoguh I didn't mention it above, the advent of electricity, indoor plumbing, and insulation all contributed to the development of these materials &amp; styles.  Likewise the scale that was needed to serve the growing population.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone seems to be ignoring your other questions.</p>
<p>Walls have a surprising amount of stuff in them. Ductwork, wiring, plumbing, and insulation.  If you made walls thinner it can be difficult to run all of this stuff. Also if you used less wood inside the wall it would be more flexible and wobbly.  Some walls are actually framed thicker to accommodate for larger pipes. The wall behind a toilet is typically framed with 2x6s rather than 2x4s because the main plumbing stack is very large.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I find it interesting that we in the Nordic countries have pretty much the same tradition of building single family homes as in the US (and Canada?), but our friends farther down in Europe (Denmark and south) prefer stone.</p>
<p>I guess it is mostly relying on tradition, sparsely populated countries with lots of forest had easy access to, and the tradition of using,  lumber. Also, it wood might be better suited when the winters are long and cold.</p>
<p>Out homes evolved from log houses  with external wood panel and interior clay/paint to studded frame(?) with interior cladding with either lath+drywall or OSB+drywall or drywall+drywall. Single drywall sucks. Outer wall have room for 30cm insulation (one feet for the metrically challenged). To remove problems with condensation in the wall, a plastic foil is needed behind the drywall on the inside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
