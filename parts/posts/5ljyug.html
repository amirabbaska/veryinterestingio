		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the really important word there is &quot;inelastic.&quot;</p>
<p>Suppose that protons and electrons were really &quot;fundamental&quot; particles.  Then we'd expect high energy collisions of electrons with protons to be elastic because fundamental particles shouldn't have any internal structure that can &quot;store&quot; energy.</p>
<p>However, in experiments at SLAC where protons and electrons were collided, there was inelastic scattering - which means that the proton or electron took up the energy in some way, and that contradicts the hypothesis that they are &quot;fundamental&quot; in the sense of having no internal structure.</p>
<p>You can read about the experiment on wikipedia.  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_inelastic_scattering" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_inelastic_scattering</a> )</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can't actually verify their existence. We can only create a mathematical model that proposes them and then measure the results of an experiment. If the mathematical model's predictions match the results of the experiment, we say the model is correct.</p>
<p>What we actually do is calculate the probabilities for an amount a of particle ys to be measured given an amount b of incoming particles. </p>
<p>If we shoot 100 billion protons at 100 billion protons, we expect a list of particles to be measured as resultants. IE 100,000 photons with this energy range, 100 delta kaons with this energy range etc. If the theory matches the experiment, we know that the theory is a sufficiently accurate depiction of reality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Deep inelastic scattering is basically taking leptons (electrons, for instance) and shooting them really fast at hadrons (like a proton or neutron). The electron essentially breaks apart the hadron and sends quarks flying. But the tricky thing with quarks is due to something called quark confinement, (or &quot;color confinement&quot;) they can't actually exist as an independent particle. So as the quark is being &quot;kicked out&quot; by the electron smashing into the hadron, all that matter/energy/mass (definitions get slippery at this scale) reforms into a new hadron, usually something a little more exotic than the protons or neutrons we're familiar with. Based on the scattering of these hadrons, we can infer that this is how they formed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
