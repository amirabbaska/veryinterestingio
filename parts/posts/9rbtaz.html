		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diamonds have a <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XGpzf.png" target="_blank">three dimensional covenant bond between atoms</a>, this allows heat to be easily transferred through phonons (vibrational waves through the crystal), basically, if you jiggle one atom it causes the atoms next to it to jiggle too. </p>
<p>Graphite on the the other hand forms <a href="http://som.web.cmu.edu/structures/S022-C-graphite_web.jpg" target="_blank">two dimensional sheets stacked on top of each other.</a> (graphene is a single isolated one of these sheets). Since graphite has no direct bonds between sheets, it is not very efficient at transferring these phonons in the vertical direction. This causes it to be a much worse heat conductor that diamond.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the plane where the carbon atoms have the same bonding as diamond atoms have, the thermal conductivity can be very good. Going through vertically through the vertical sheets the atoms are not bonded in the same way. The sheets can slide against each other. So the thermal vibrations called phonons can’t travel efficiently vertical and the thermal conductivity is much lower in that direction. If you are careful you can make large pieces of this pyrolytic graphite. </p>
<p>If you want to make graphene ( a single layer of carbon atoms bonded together like diamond) you can take a piece of scotch tape and pull off one single layer since the adhesion by the tape is stronger than the bonding the single layers of carbon atoms that are bonded in the 2d plane in the same way as diamond.  </p>
<p>In ordinary graphite you have a lot of very little sheets that slide against each other, but the little piles of sheets are jumbled together and the thermal conductivity isn’t that great in any direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
