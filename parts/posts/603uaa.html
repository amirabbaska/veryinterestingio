So for some reason I thought that objects accelerating in space would continue to accelerate, turns out this isn't the case (unless they are being propelled infinitely). Which made me think that there must be tonnes of asteroids that have been accelerating through space (without being acted upon by another object) for billions of years and must be travelling at near light speed...scary thought. </p>
<p>So from what I can understand from your replies, this isn't the case. For example, if debris flies out from an exploding star it's acceleration will only continue as long as that explosion, than it will stop accelerating and continue at that constant speed forever or until acted upon by something else (gravity from a nearby star or planet etc) where it then may speed up or slow down. </p>
<p>I also now understand that to continue accelerating it would require more and more energy as the mass of the object increases with the speed, thus the FTL ship conundrum. </p>
<p>Good luck explaining that to a five year old ;)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't be able to accelerate at a constant rate without slowing. As you get faster, it takes more and more energy to accelerate. Assuming that the object has some engine with a constant energy output, the acceleration will reduce as the speed increases. It would keep getting closer and closer to the speed of light, but never get there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the responses everyone! So from what I can tell objects travelling through space do not just continue to accelerate without being acted on by some force (like gravity or propulsion) as I previously thought. So I then assume they will hit a certain speed dependant on their mass and will remain at this speed until acted on by another force.
