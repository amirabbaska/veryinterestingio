		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons I have seen it that way is because of the frequent inclusion of small tables and pictures. If you had traditional page width text, you would wind up with wasted space because of these things, or you would have to cram more tables/pictures in one row, even if one of them isn't referenced for another page.</p>
<p>One could argue that, since most papers aren't actually printed, space isn't an issue like it is for print versions of journals. But that would be extra guidelines for editors and overall extra work. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i have no idea but as a graphic designer i can tell you that smaller columns of text with a shorter amount of words per line (like a newspaper) is easier to read and format. i know you and many people prefer to read one solid block of text, and i don't know why this is,  but i've always been told that having more than 50 words per line is a big no no. The only time i would do it is if i was writing a paper for a class in school or something and was formatting in Word but if i created a book of research papers or something I might be formatting in a more powerful program like InDesign and choose to make it look fancier. </p>
<p>I could be completely wrong and it could just be a &quot;it's two columns because that's the way it is&quot; but i can't help but feel like it has something to do with it actually being formatted to look more respectable -or published in some sort of larger format maybe?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part science, part tradition.</p>
<p>The science part, as others have mentioned, is line length.  Research shows lines that are too short or too long reduce comprehension.  While there isn't one exact size, less than 50 characters per line seems bad, while more than about 80 also seems bad.  If you look at professionally typeset material you'll find 99% of it with lines around 60-70 characters long.</p>
<p>The other half is tradition.  Scientific papers are typically typeset &quot;densely&quot;.  That is relatively small fonts and figures.  The idea is to fit a lot of information on the page.  The smaller font size would make one column's lines way too long, so the two-column format makes sense.</p>
<p>Newspapers, with large pages and a desire to be information dense use small fonts with many columns.  Books, which are designed to be easy to read use single column with larger fonts.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Graphic designer here. There is a certain width of s line that works best for reading. Having the text be the width of the page causes your brain to work harder to complete and comprehend the line. Breaking it into two columns makes it easier for comprehension</p>
<p>Imagine the two extremes, like if the whole paper were written on in line. Eventually it’s going to really bother you. The same is true if it was one word per line and caused you to read downward. Both are just not natural for our own brains to be comfortable with.  </p>
<p>I can’t speak for any particular journal, but typically two or three columns on a page are in the sweet spot for reading comprehension. </p>
<p>As for your comment on white space, just know that often times white space is a good thing. Good design doesn’t mean filling in everything. Often times it’s just the opposite; letting things stay empty so that what IS there is understood or followed more easily. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the journal.  Some like Nature and Science use the multi column format, while some others do not for example the journal Sensors.  I often see a mix of the multi column style and single column style.  I agree that I prefer single column style as I mostly read them on screen and find it a pain in the butt to have to zoom in to read the tiny text in multi column papers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
