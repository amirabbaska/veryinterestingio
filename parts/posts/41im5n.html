		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It makes no sense in my eyes. I know taxes make up for the majority of the price but still its a change of 73%, while the price of oil changed for 35%. If all the prices of manufacturing stay the same it should go down more right?</p>
<p>Edit: A lot of people try to explain to me like the top rated guy has that if one resource goes down by half the whole product doesnt go down by half which i totally understand its really basic. I just cant find any constant correlation between crude oil over the years and the gas price changes. It just seems to go faster up than down and that the country is playing with taxes as they wish to make up for their bad economic policies.</p></div></div>
