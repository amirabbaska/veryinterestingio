<p>With the LHCb run 2 dataset and Belle II, it's possible that one or several of these anomalies could reach 5σ statistical significance (if they're real effects, of course). What happens next depends a bit on which process it is. If it's the tree-level b→c anomaly (R(D), R(D*)) then it's a bit easier to explore the nature of the new physics in these decays. If it's the loop-level b→s anomalies (R(K), R(K*), P5´) then it could be some very heavy new physics entering the loop which might not be directly accessible at the LHC.
Either way would motivate direct searches for new particles. If nothing is seen at ATLAS or CMS after the HL-LHC is finished, then this motivates building an even higher-energy collider.</p>
<p>Popular suggestions are: Z´ (&quot;Z prime&quot;), leptoquarks, 2HDM, charged Higgs, SUSY etc. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06861" target="_blank">here</a> for another summary.</p>
