		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A ballpoint pen needs the friction of the paper to roll the ball, inking it. </p>
<p>It leaves an indent in the paper after being drug across it that smooths the paper out and reduces the friction available to roll the ball a second time. No rolling, no new ink on the ball.</p>
<p>Also oils can reduce the friction on the paper preventing proper inking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you press down with a pen on paper, you create a small trough where the pen was moved. This trough has then been created, and makes it very hard for the ball on a tip of the pen to press against the paper, as instead of pressing on the paper it is just forming a bridge across the gap. This then means that the tip of the pen, where the ink is, cannot touch the paper and thus cannot draw a line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
