		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As /u/rantonels stated, special relativistic effects are insignificant. </p>
<p>I wanted to add, that relativistic mass is an outdated concept and should be avoided as it is prone to lead to misconceptions and inconsistencies.<br />
Firstly, it suggests the intrinsic properties on an object change as the object moves faster. This is not the case. Dynamic mass is a purely mathematical trick.<br />
Secondly, it applies the name mass - belonging to the magnitude of a 4-vector - to a very different concept, the time component of a 4-vector.</p>
<p>It is a lot more more useful to simply stick to rest mass and consider the increase in kinetic energy of a fast moving object. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thinking about the effects of relativity on mass-energy is important, but it's also really key to remember the scales we're talking about. Before the relativistic effects get to the 10% range, we need to start talking about velocities on the scale of 100,000 km/s.</p>
<p>That's fast. Almost 500x faster than the Sun's orbital speed. It's the kind of number you don't see much for macroscopic objects outside the context of catastrophic events like supernovae. So while it's important to keep relativity in the back of your mind, it's rarely going to give you an explanation for problems on this scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are thinking of the faster moving outer stars, keep in mind that the mass of the object in orbit does not matter to its radial speed. Kinda like how geosynchronous man made satellites are all the same distance from Earth, orbiting Earth at the same speed, and are different masses (weigh differently).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
