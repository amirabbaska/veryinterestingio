		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thunder is a form of colored noise, which often has a relaxing effect to people who don't fear said thunder. It's like listening to the rain hit your window.</p>
<p>However, some people simply have a strong fear of lightning due to its potential destructive force. For them, the thunder and lightning makes them feel in danger.</p>
<p>It mostly boils down to whether they have a fear of thunder/lightning or not</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that one of the reasons people find thunderstorms relaxing is that, in nature, most animals hide out during storms, including the predators, so we evolved to feel safe and secure during a storm. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans react differently to different things. Some people prefer strawberries, while other prefer bananas. Some might even dislike one of these. Just like this, the environment and weather can be liked or disliked by people. Especially thunder and lightning, as it happens so fast, and the sensation of the forces of nature can be too much for some people</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From living along the Gulf Coast most of my life I was exposed to thunderstorms and hurricanes from an early age.  As a kid I loved the raw power of nature, and being a kid I never really appreciated the preparations my parents did to keep us safe.  </p>
<p>I wish they were still alive so I could thank them for that.</p>
<p>To this day I still feel a calming sensation of a roaring downpour, lightning and thunder, hurricanes not so much.  I've only evacuated for one and that was <a href="https://imgur.com/d58fqEv" target="_blank">Katrina</a> when I took my 91 year old grandmother to stay at my cousin's house in Florida.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
