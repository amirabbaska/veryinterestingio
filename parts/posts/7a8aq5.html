		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some organ transplants (such as heart transplants) need to be reasonably size-matched between the donor and the recipient. That means that a baby can only receive a heart from another baby - there's no room to stick an adult heart in. In these cases, yes, the organ does grow with the child. When they first started doing heart transplants, they weren't sure if this would be the case or if they would have to re-transplant every few years as the child grew, but it turns out that the heart will grow. The donor heart maintains its own DNA (hence the need for organ recipients to take anti-rejection medication for life), and would grow according to the donor's genetic makeup. That being said, the organ would also be receiving input cues from its environment (i.e., the recipient's body) that may influence how it would grow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was actually a big legal case over something like this. A child couldn't get a lung transplant from another child so the mother sued to get her daughter on the adult list.
Thing is, the adult lungs would have to be &quot;trimmed&quot; to child size and when the child started growing in puberty in a few years (that the kid didn't have) they'd need yet another lung transplant for adult sized lungs because they wouldn't grow with the kid like their own lungs or another set of child lungs would.

<p>Downside is that it was not really capable of doing much. </p>
<p>Upside is she kept making &quot;take my strong hand jokes&quot;. Oh and also became a world record holding Paralympic Swimmer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Limbs don’t generally get transplanted. Amputation and prosthetics would be much more common. When a limb is cut off, the nerves can’t be grafted together in the same way that major arteries/veins/bone can. And most prosthetic solutions are pretty functional. Certainly better than a limb that doesn’t respond to neural input.</p>
<p>If an organ were to grow, I’d bet that organs from children transplanted into other children or adults would grow. I haven’t worked in transplant for a while, but they would occasionally get an infant (not alive) donor and take both kidneys to put into an adult on the transplant wait list. I would expect those kidneys to grow a little over time, but probably not reach the full size of adult kidneys.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do transplanted organs ever get their DNA replaced with the new body's DNA? I know organs have separate cycles, some take a couple years, some up to a decade or more, to 'refresh' all the DNA with new. So does that apply to donated organs eventually?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
