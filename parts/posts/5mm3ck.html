		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right now artificial wombs aren't anywhere close to being a reality. Organizations that do want to clone endangered or extinct animals at this point need to use closely related species as the artificial womb. For instance the people working to clone mammoths will use an Asian or African elephant as a surrogate mother, that is one of the reasons they are considered clone-able. But for other animals like the Steller's Sea Cow or the giant sloth cloning is not considered an option yet because there are no closely related species that are large enough to be the clone's surrogate.  You can read about specific criteria and species at this website. </p>

<p>EDIT- as far as the giant panda goes, you could hypothetically set up some IVF program with their closest relatives, the Spectacled Bear.  They could be birthed from Spectacled Bears and potentially nursed by them, or there may be some kind of hormone therapy you could give pandas that would cause them to lactate so the tiny pandas could be weened by their own kind/on their own milk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't understand enough of what happens during development to be anywhere close to making artificial wombs a reality. DNA isn't everything, and early development plays a huge role in determining how animals will turn out. Genes are turned on and off (and up and down), sometimes permanently, as a result of conditions in utero.</p>
<p>In humans, we know that conditions experienced by a grandparent can impact disease risk and mortality through a process known as transgenerational epigenetics. We also know that this process is really complicated.
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Överkalix_study" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Överkalix_study</a></p>
<p>RadioLab did a nice treatment of this recently, discussing how human embryos will only develop in the laboratory up to a certain (early) stage, and then die. Scientists have recently been able to extend this period, but not by much, and we don't really know what the barrier is.</p>

(Bonus RadioLab including the grandparent story.)</p>
<p>So, a major part of why artificial wombs won't save endangered species is that they aren't likely to exist for a very long time, if ever. Turns out DNA sequence is only part of the picture - you need just the right developmental conditions to get that DNA to make that endangered individual, and right now, a real mother* is the only way to get that.</p>
<p>*Can possibly be a mother from a very closely related species, but still: you need the real deal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Leaving physiology aside because I know very little about it, artificial wombs may aid in stabilizing a small captive population but I feel wouldn't play a very large role is saving a species as a whole. I think that there are a couple of things that limit the success of a captive breeding program more so than just getting the numbers up but I am definitely not an expert and would love to talk more about them if someone disagrees.</p>
<p>First I think that creating more individuals without understanding the reasoning why the mating behavior isn't being expressed would be synonymous to treating a symptom of a symptom instead of working towards the actual cure. I don't know much about the panda example but I do know another one where numbers were low (can't remember the animal, I'll edit later) because female preference was low for males below a certain body-mass. which all of their males were. Understanding more about what these animals are all about is part of why we want to keep them around and so I think working with the animal's instincts should be a top priority. Not only preserving the physical animal but also that animal's behavioral culture.</p>
<p>The other issue I have is that I am picturing an animal raised in an artificial womb being raised either in non-ideal groupings or by humans. We already know the importance of avoiding human imprinting and the people running the best programs put a lot of work into doing that (see Whooping Crane). An artificial womb I feel would increase that risk and brings up more questions like: If the animal is raised in a lab environment will it be lacking in information that would be otherwise be passed down by herd-mates or parents? Can the animal survive as well once it is time to be released without that information. </p>
<p>I guess the key things that make me skeptical after all that rambling are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>could the effort be better spent on addressing the 'why' behind the lack of breeding success (or the 'why' of it's endangered status)</p>
</li>
<li>is the risk to the animal's social knowledge worth the increase in the animal's physical numbers</li>
