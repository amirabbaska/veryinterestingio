Made the rock clear, put light in, made the rock not clear and you have light trapped in a rock. That's as eli5 as I can make it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Light</em> always travels at c. However, when you talk about &quot;light in some medium&quot; (i.e. not in a vacuum) what you're really talking about is the interaction of electromagnetic waves of the photon and the medium. This results in something &quot;like an object&quot; but which is actually the movement of the interaction, in this case a polariton. </p>
<p>That interaction can move at a speed slower than c, even though a specific photon cannot. This is then described as 'slow light' as a simplification. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The truth is, all matter and all energy are just points on a wide spectrum. </p>
<p>Far on the &quot;energy&quot; side, you have Light. Most of the time it acts as a wave, but occasionally it exhibits the properties of a particle.</p>
<p>Far on the &quot;matter&quot; side, you have sandwiches (and other Things). Most of the time sandwiches act as delicious particles, but occasionally they exhibit wave-like properties (theoretically, at least).</p>
<p>Everything in the universe falls somewhere on this spectrum. Everything can be described as either a wave-like particle, or a particle-like wave.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't get it either. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
