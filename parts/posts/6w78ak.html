I've also heard the same from Arab and Spanish English speakers. But when it comes to emotional whinging or rage cursing, or even just writing a sentimental poem, I find myself switch back to Chinese. </p>
<p>Does this have to do with the culture that shaped the language? Or does this have more to do with personal linguistic development? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have studied bilingual language development so I think I can help with this one. When we learn a second (or third, or fourth) language, we tend to learn those for analytical situations, usually school. Therefore when you are thinking more analytically, your brain has an easier time switching over. Growing up speaking Chinese, you probably learned most of your emotional language in Chinese first, so your brain is more comfortable with using Chinese. I studied one of my colleagues children who grew up tri-lingual, her mom was deaf so she learned sign language, both parents spoke Spanish as their first language, but both were fluent in English and English is the predominant language where I live. The girl, who is now 5, uses English for all learning vocabulary (math, science etc) and is extremely comfortable with it, more emotional thought or family related things are in Spanish, and any bad words or &quot;love&quot; type words are in sign. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This hasn't got to do with the language itself, but your own knowledge of the language and how you've been exposed to it.</p>
<p>You presumably got your education in English or have mainly read in it, so your logical vocabulary and thoughts are molded by that. Your home I'm guessing was a Chinese speaking one, so you're used to being emotional in it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd argue they aren't.</p>
<p>I've encountered people convinced that Romance languages, Greek, German, and English were the only valid languages of philosophy and science, and that all the rest is objectively dumb babble.</p>
<p>But this is nonsense.  </p>
<p>Greek and Latin are held up as the best, most scientific languages evarrr.  But if we break down seemingly fancy Latin and Greek words, we find that they're no more objectively scientific than Germanic equivalents.  </p>
<p>Take &quot;calculator.&quot;  A very scientific, precise-sounding word indeed, and what sounds more objective than &quot;calculations?&quot;  The German word for &quot;calculator&quot; translates to &quot;pocket reckoner,&quot; (Taschenrechner) and &quot;calculations&quot; are &quot;reckonings&quot; (Berechnungen)!  Ha, those primitive Germans!  They sound like they just crawled out of the nineteenth century and were introduced to our superior Latinate technology for the first time.  &quot;Calculator&quot; is much fancier--it means, well, er...&quot;pebbler,&quot; and calculations are &quot;pebblings.&quot;  Because you count with pebbles and stuff.</p>
<p>Well, alright, maybe that's not that scientific, but what of animals and Greek? The Greeks were very sophisticated, and knew better than to call the great African beast a &quot;river horse,&quot; since it is so obviously not a horse; it is properly called a <em>hippopotamus.</em> Which, clearly, means, umm...&quot;horse of the river.&quot; </p>
<p>Dammit.</p>
<p>Point is, Latin, Greek, and other languages of prestige are held to be the best languages for topics of importance and thought, but that's really just snobbery.  There's no reason you couldn't have perfectly good philosophical debates in, say, Basque, or Vietnamese, or Navajo.  If anything, borrowed Latin, Greek, and other words are often <em>less</em> effective at clearly conveying an idea because their meaning is not always as readily apparent.</p>
<p>George Orwell wrote a great essay called &quot;Politics and the English Language.&quot;  It's full of good points, but here is one in particular that stands out:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Now that I have made this catalogue of swindles and perversions, let me give another example of the kind of writing that they lead to. This time it must of its nature be an imaginary one. I am going to translate a passage of good English into modern English of the worst sort. Here is a well-known verse from Ecclesiastes:</em>&quot;</p>
<p>'I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.'</p>
<p><em>Here it is in modern English:</em></p>
<p>'Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account.'</p>
<p><em>&quot;This is a parody, but not a very gross one. Exhibit (3) above, for instance, contains several patches of the same kind of English. It will be seen that I have not made a full translation. The beginning and ending of the sentence follow the original meaning fairly closely, but in the middle the concrete illustrations — race, battle, bread — dissolve into the vague phrases ‘success or failure in competitive activities’. This had to be so, because no modern writer of the kind I am discussing — no one capable of using phrases like ‘objective considerations of contemporary phenomena’ — would ever tabulate his thoughts in that precise and detailed way. The whole tendency of modern prose is away from concreteness. Now analyze these two sentences a little more closely. The first contains forty-nine words but only sixty syllables, and all its words are those of everyday life. The second contains thirty-eight words of ninety syllables: eighteen of those words are from Latin roots, and one from Greek. The first sentence contains six vivid images, and only one phrase (‘time and chance’) that could be called vague. The second contains not a single fresh, arresting phrase, and in spite of its ninety syllables it gives only a shortened version of the meaning contained in the first. Yet without a doubt it is the second kind of sentence that is gaining ground in modern English. I do not want to exaggerate. This kind of writing is not yet universal, and outcrops of simplicity will occur here and there in the worst-written page. Still, if you or I were told to write a few lines on the uncertainty of human fortunes, we should probably come much nearer to my imaginary sentence than to the one from Ecclesiastes.&quot;</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm Portuguese and I speak exclusively in Portuguese, but definitely think it's a lot easier to write technical documents in English. One of the features of the English language that contributes to this is that you can use pretty much any word as a verb (e.g. Google, Netflix) since there is no verb conjugation. In Portuguese, if you wanted to use random words as a verb you would have to say something like Googleate, Netflixate, etc. which doesn't really work. Then you would have to conjugate the verb according to the subject which brings even more difficulty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
