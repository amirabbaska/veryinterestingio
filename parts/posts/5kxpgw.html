		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't really anything else that proposes a ToE. String Theory isn't some crazy invention. If you start with the Standard Model and try to expand it to start including gravity or to unify the Strong interaction with the Electroweak interaction, you inevitably come across failed theory after failed theory after failed theory. String Theory is the simplest approach that unifies gravity and the gauge theories (Strong and Electroweak) without failing other requirements.</p>
<p>There are a handful of theories that attempt to quantize gravity and connect it to the standard model, but those aren't ToEs. They are just quantum gravity theories.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown.</p>
<p>The simplest extension of the SM is supersymmetry. It is a system that identifies bosonic particles to fermionic particles and identifies them as two different aspects of one object. This is a very natural and theoretically satisfying theory that many think will be the next experimentally verified piece of fundamental physics (although many don't.) </p>
<p>Susy has nothing to do with a ToE, however. It simply proposes some new particles (i.e. one that can be identified as a fantastic candidate for dark matter) and can simplify a few mathematical oddities in the standard model.</p>
<p>We also have a topic called grand unification. We have a history of finding ways to merge different branches of physics. Starting with electricity and magnetism merging to become electromagnetism, space and time merging to become spacetime under the influence of the equations of electromagnetism, QM and relativity to become quantum field theory. The same principle that defines electromagnetism mathematically also perfectly defines the weak theory and the strong theory. The weak and electromagnetic interactions merge to form the electroweak theory. Grand unification proposes that somehow the Strong and Electroweak theories merge to form a merged one unified interaction that splits into the rest.</p>
<p>However, GUTs (grand unified theory) just don't work. I haven't really studied GUTs in any detail, but the most popular version is pretty much excluded because it predicts that Protons decay into other particles. In the history of physics, there has been a grand total of 0 measurements of decaying Protons. This pretty much rules out a simple GUT.</p>
<p>Another approach is called supergravity. Supergravity takes supersymmetry and applies a subtle mathematical principle that occurs elsewhere in physics and just so happens to spit out the equations for gravity on top of supersymmetry. However, it requires that the number of dimensions is expanded to 11 and (much worse) it fails completely because the theory is &quot;non-renormalizable.&quot; That means that when you try to do calculations with supergravity you find spurious infinities popping up all over the place which, obviously, ruins your ability to calculate anything. IE when trying to make a prediction for the experiments at CERN you find the probabilities are nonsensically infinity.</p>
<p>So, no luck yet. We have a maybe result saying that Susy could possibly exist but it hasn't been found and has some other unsatisfying predictions. We have to find a new approach.</p>
<p>So we get creative. So we turn to String Theory. Our normal standard model is based off quantum field theory. </p>
<p>Quantum field theory studies the interactions of quantized 1,2 or 4 dimensional fields that are functions of 4 variables on a 4 dimensional spacetime. A natural thing to attempt is to vary some of the these numerical values. </p>
<p>Varying the first values (1,2,4) gives us different particles. The 1 value is, for example, a particle like the Higgs boson. The 2 value could be a neutrino or electron. The 4 value could give us a photon. We've exhaustively studied this variation.</p>
<p>Next, we try to vary the next numerical value: the &quot;4 variables.&quot; When that value says 1, we are looking at a simple particle theory. This doesn't do anything useful and can be made to be just a more cumbersome version of quantum field theory. Changing that value to 2 gives us strings. When we analyze the theory with the value 2, we miraculously find that it accidentally spits out gravity. With some messaging and adding supersymmetry we find it also spits out the all of our fermions and all of our bosons. However, we find that this theory also fails. That is unless we vary the &quot;4 dimensional spacetime&quot; to be 11 dimensional. Now it still provides gravity and all our particles, but it also includes some incredible mathematical niceties that are absent from the standard model which are more complicated to explain.</p>
<p>String theory has TONS of problems, but it really is our only approach that unifies everything. Nothing has invalidated String theory while all these other theories have been invalidated. So it's our simplest approach at a unifying theory. I'd say there's still a 50% chance that it's entirely wrong, but there isn't a great competing candidate anyways.</p>
<p>I hope this made sense, I probably was just rambling incoherently. But oh well!</p>
<p>Also, on a technical note to any string theorists: I didn't study ST, I studied Loop Quantum Gravity and quit before finishing my PhD. Feel free to make corrections as I only have studied ST/SG in my spare time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thousands. There really is a sea of generalizations and alternative theories that can't yet be verified experimentally. For example, my bachelor thesis was (in part) about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F(R\)_gravity" target="_blank">f(R) gravity</a>, a theory that generalizes our accepted, experimentally verified theory of gravity. You might have heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry" target="_blank">Supersymmetry</a>, a further generalization of our Standard model of particle physics.</p>
<p><em>Edit</em>: Damn, not sure if I have misinterpeted the question. Neither f(R) gravity nor Supersymmetry are candidates for a theory of everything. I just used them as examples that there is an insane amount of alternate theories you maybe have never heard of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so a lot of these posts don't really answer the question. OP wants to know what other candidates there are for TOEs besides String Theory. A lot of the posts on here don't even come close to being TOEs, they are for the most part either useful tools with applications in theoretical physics (e.g. Hairy Ball Theory and Invariant Set Postulate) or generalizations of existing theories (e.g. F(R) gravity and SUSY) that do expand on the theory but don't actually achieve (or, quite frankly, even <em>try</em> [at least intrinsically]) anything close to a TOE.</p>
<p>As for OP: The reason why you rarely hear of alternatives to String Theory is because there really isn't one. There are alternatives to <em>individual components</em> of ST (e.g. quantum loop gravity is an alternative quantum gravity hypothesis, and is arguably ST's biggest competitor with respect to quantum gravity), but insofar as I am aware, there is no hypothesis or as-of-yet proposed model besides ST that is capable (or really even attempts to) of unifying everything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big one that isn't super popular is Heim Theory, developed by Burkhard Heim, who was blinded, deaf, and lost his hands in an accident at a factory during WWII when he was 19. </p>
<p>He spent the rest of his life working on his Theory of Everything. A lot of his predictions are hard to confirm, but many of his predictions for the weights of certain subatomic particles were surprisingly close to what ended up being measured. It has been mostly dismissed for a lot of issues that more mathematically minded people could go into more clearly.</p>
<p>But he developed his own flavor of Calculus differentials for it, and it utilizes 6th dimensional spaces. One of his big motivators was his obsession with wanting to develop a way to travel through space and Heim Theory allows you to (in really simplified terms) to use extremely powerful magnetic forces to make a Star Wars style Hyperdrive. </p>
<p>Really interesting fringe physicist who lived a very interesting life.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
