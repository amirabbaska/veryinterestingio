		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like some other people have said, most Christian sects and related religions (like Judaism and Islam) are largely against religious art, since they see it as a slippery slope to worshiping idols. The Catholic Church is different because during the middle ages, Western Europe had terribly low literacy rates, so pictures were used as reference material for teaching history and belief to the common people. A depiction of a saint, or a scene from the bible, was full of information and would help viewers learn and remember that information. So while other churches were willing to destroy their icons, the Catholics would have been giving up a valuable teaching tool, and felt it would hurt their followers to get rid of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short version: the Iconoclasm controversies of the 8th and 9th centuries. Tons of debate over whether icons are good or bad. Ultimate conclusion, they're good, we should make more pretty pictures that look like our heroes. (The Ten Commandments actually say you can't <em>worship</em> your graven images, not to not make them. See: <del>Exodus 23</del> Numbers 21 for God commanding them to make graven images) On the other hand, Islam outright forbids imagery, and Judaism just isn't as common. The other guy got the reformation bit right though </p>
<p>Edit; Thanks for calling me out guys, that was a pretty eggregious mistake. Don't know where that came from.</p>
<p>Also, just FYI, if you think Catholics have a lot of imagery, you should check out the Orthodox.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Catholicism is actually comparable in their relatively liberal use of imagery/iconography in depicting religious subjects with many other sects/religions. Eastern Orthodox, Judaism, Buddhism, various Shamanistic religions and Hinduism all use large amounts of physical representation</p>
<p>The perception that Catholicism is bigger on imagery in large part stems from the predominance in the West of Protestant Christianity which emphasizes austerity and simplicity in worship, eschewing the pomp and ceremony of Catholicism. Islam contributes to this contrast as it similarly emphasizes austerity and simplicity in places of worship. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>No one's mentioned it so far, but the deepest rationale for sacred iconography (images), in addition to a number of other sensible elements (e.g. incense, candles, sacred architecture, etc) is what might be called the &quot;incarnational analogy&quot; of faith. Because we believe that God, in an earth-shaking way, took on flesh and became human (which we refer to as the incarnation), God has decisively restored and reclaimed broken humanity, and creation as a whole, as good. In light of the incarnation, Catholics can't (or at least shouldn't) treat matter and the material world as something to be shunned or avoided as tainted/evil/weak <em>simply speaking.</em> The positive side of this is we love employing created things, if they <em>work</em>, in our liturgy - the service and worship of God.</p>
<p>Another central aspect is the basic idea that God reveals Himself in a way and manner that humans can understand (in part - divine &quot;mysteries&quot; like the Incarnation by definition can't be exhausted by our intellectual investigations). God desires to be known, and even though He in Himself is spirit (not material), He nonetheless condescends to the limitations of human thought and language in order to be better known and loved. Art and imagery are essential to the human experience and our coming to fully know and appreciate that which is beautiful, including God. As such, the Church takes seriously the challenge of communicating divine truths across a number of mediums, acknowledging their various inherent limits.</p>
<p>I didn't get into some of the doctrinal discrepancies we have vis-a-vis Protestants or other faiths, but I hope this was helpful!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well I think you'll find that in non-abrahamic religion, imagery is in fact a massive part of the faith. I mean like nine of the top ten largest statues in the world are of Buddha, right? Hindu shrines are very ornate and depict the gods, same with many other Asian cultures. Catholicism is only unique in this aspect compared to the religions just around it. Protestantism and Islam are unusual in this respect. </p>
<p>Your perspective may be biased by what artifacts you've been exposed to. Lots of Asian, African, and pre-Christian European religious art work hasn't survived to modern times, while  the Catholics have  been able to preserve theirs very carefully.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
