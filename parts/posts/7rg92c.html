		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You only need to look at our ancestor's teeth and general size to determine what our diet most likely would have been.  Homo habilis being the most recent hominid that didn't use fire, their dental structure and damage shows a diet of tough plants.  Their small size indicates it wasn't all foliage, as a diet only in grasses and leaves would make them much larger.  Like gorillas, animals need a large gut to breakdown plant fiber.  Most likely a diet of high calorie fruits, nuts, roots, and the occasional meats was the norm along with the much more available rough greens.</p>
<p>Regarding when did homonids start cooking, it's unknown.  However we do know the affects it had.  Eating cooked protein greatly increased their physical size as well as promote an increase in myelin protein growth.  This was the key factor for the increase in homonid intelligence.  Animal protein has Neu5Gc, a Sialic acid that the human body normally rejects.  By cooking meat, this protein is broken down, allowing the body to use the amino acids to create Neu5Ac.  An important Sialic acid for neuronal growth.  Neu5Ac also is the key factor in preventing simian malaria and other diseases.  This is where the unknown knowns issues occur.  Did malaria create Neu5Ac to start the increase of human intelligence, or did cooking meats create Neu5Ac that helped fight off malaria.  No one knows.  (it always made me laugh that it is possible that mosquitoes created modern man)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>He next stooped down to feel the pig, if there were any signs of life in it. He burnt his fingers, and to cool them he applied them in his booby fashion to his mouth. Some of the crumbs of the scorched skin had come away with his fingers, and for the first time in his life (in the world's life indeed, for before him no man had known it) he tasted—crackling! Again he felt and fumbled at the pig. It did not burn him so much now, still he licked his finger from a sort of habit. The truth at length broke into his slow understanding, that it was the pig that smelt so, and the pig that tasted so delicious; and surrendering himself up to the newborn pleasure, he fell to tearing up whole handfuls of the scorched skin with the flesh next it, and was cramming it down his throat in his beastly fashion, when his sire entered amid the smoking rafters, armed with retributory cudgel, and finding how affairs stood, began to rain blows upon the young rogue's shoulders, as thick as hailstones, which Bo-bo heeded not any more than if they had been flies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
