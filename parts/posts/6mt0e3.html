		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Power to weight ratio has a big impact on acceleration but little effect on the ultimate top speed. </p>
<p>What matters is the resistive forces, like aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, and friction. Aerodynamic drag in particular becomes the dominant factor at high speeds, because it is proportional to the square of velocity, so disregarding it is not appropriate here.</p>
<p>The power required to overcome the resistance is proportional to the resistive force and the current speed. The resistive forces themselves may increase with the speed (as is the case with drag), so power requirements can grow quite rapidly with increasing speed.</p>
<p>When the power requirements exceed what the engine can produce, the car will be unable accelerate any further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is really not as tricky as everyone is making it. Acceleration will be the same at low speeds because power and weight are the most significant factors. Top speed is a function of power and aerodynamics, weight is not part of that equation, so the car with more power will have a higher top speed as long as the aerodynamics aren't significantly worse than the other car. Faster around a track is trickier, since the the heavier/more powerful car will have an advantage on the fast straight-aways and the lighter car will have an advantage in tight turns. Generally smaller racetracks with more turns favor light cars and larger more spread out tracks favor powerful cars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>With regards to the top speed the aerodynamics is the biggest force to the car so if you disregard aerodynamics it would be impossible to compare them. What would happen is that they both cars would continue accelerating towards the speed of light. But assuming you meant that they have the same drag coefficient, essentially the same shape, then it is possible to compare them. Bigger cars have bigger volume and thus a bigger cross section and therefore more drag. However this relation is not linear but follow a cube/square law. So an increase in volume means a smaller proportional increase in aerodynamic drag. So if you increase the size of the car and keep the same power to weight ratio, density and drag coefficient you will have a faster car. This is obvious if you have seen a motor race or a bike race as racers will clump together to take advantage of the slipstream and effectively &quot;merge&quot; their aerodynamic drag to become bigger and therefore faster.</p>
<p>There is also another way to compare what cars are faster and that is with acceleration. For example comparing the 0-100kph time or a timed drag race, etc. The low speeds means aerodynamics is not that important in those cases. In this case it is as simple as force and mass which determines the acceleration. However horsepowers is not a measure of how much force you get from a car but how much energy it can output. What you want for acceleration is torque. But if you assume that the engines in the cars are similar and set up similarly you can extrapolate that the torque is comparable. In that case the cars would perform very similarly with the same power to weight ratio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think all the answers here disregarding friction and aerodynamics misunderstood OP. I think OP meant that if you have two identical cars, with same aerodynamic properties and rolling friction, but one has more hp, but proportionally same hp/weight ratio, which would be faster? </p>
<p>I'll try and answer as a phyisics and car enthusiast but not as a professional at all. Acceleration should be pretty much the same at first, but as I recall from Gordon Murray making observations about the Veyron, after a certain point hp doesn't translate directly into speed, but closer to an exponential factor, hence the Veyron needs a big chunk of its power to get those ultimate 30km/h. </p>
<p>The difference in power between the two would be the most defining factor, if the power is not enough for it to crack certain air resistance after X velocity, then they might be the same, I think weight is not a huge of a factor making a difference at top speed, but I might be squarely wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
