		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They expand upward when land is scarce or expensive, and they expand outward when the opposite is true.</p>
<p>In most cases, it is the later.  The US is <em>huge</em> and available land is not a problem that we have to deal with.  Most major cities have more than enough surrounding land to expand on to at a fraction of the cost of a skyscraper.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions, like New York where the value of being on Manhattan Island warrants the cost of upward expansion, but it just doesn't make financial sense for most cities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add that in addition to building out being easier and cheaper than up, some cities in the US have local ordinances forbidding buildings above a certain height.  Boulder, CO is one such place, which restricts buildings to no taller than 55 feet.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few reasons that this has and continues to happen in the United States:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The value of land. The city of Phoenix, for example, has relatively cheap land compared to the city of New York. Thus, there is little motivation to construct tall buildings, which can cost much more (wood frame vs steel frame).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>City and State zoning ordinances. Some cities have extremely relaxed zoning laws, allowing builders and developers to do as they please. A great example of this is the city of Houston, where zoning laws have been almost non-existent. This is referred to as urban sprawl.</p>
</li>
<li>Finally, and this is something I have not seen otherwise noted, a massive portion of the United States has been developed along side the automobile. This has allowed you to live 5 miles from the grocery store with no problem at all and you can see that trend with urban sprawl as a whole. This example makes a lot of sense when you apply it to older cities vs newer cities. Chicago and New York, for example, compared to San Diego and Seattle, which are sprawled geographically.</li>
</ol>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The replies so far are on point. But let me tell you a little story of my neighborhood.</p>
<p>I live in an European city with around 2 Mio people. Rent costs kinda exploded in the past 15 years and apartments are hard to find. People are quite upset about that. Furthermore in my neighborhood there was this old, ugly building. It was built in the 70s for a discount furniture store that closed in the 90s. There was a gym in until like 2002 and since then it's empty. Next to it is a small 60s house, the ugliest thing you've ever seen, also empty. So the city decided to buy the land and build affordable housing there. Good thing, right?</p>
<p>Houses in the neighborhood are around 8 stories, the proposed house is about 10 stories, same as the building that is to be demolished. Additionally there's a slim tower on top of that at the corner, that's anoiter 5 stories. This should create a bunch of affordable apartments, the architects chose a very subtle approach that's neither overly ugly nor overly showy or noticeable. That architect didn't try to compensate their personal issues nor were they trying to set themselves a landmark.</p>
<p>So there was a neighborhood initative to prevent this building from being built because it's ugly (compared to an abandoned discount store building that has the charm of a rusting shipping container), because it takes away all the sun or just because it's new. Local newspapers picked up on this and discovered that the &quot;announced specs&quot; were off, the building is 10cm higher than the old one and their calculation from the door to the subway station was off about 2m. If you went to the article on the homepage of the newspaper or their Facebook page you could literally find dozens of people who were condemning any building with more than 3 stories and idealizing the suburbs and one-family-home as the only acceptable style of building. </p>
<p>So often enough the reason not to expand upwards (as they do in Asia quite often) is because of morons who complain because of boredom and change itself. I've seen several buildings and plans not making it to construction because of citizen protests. It's ridiculous and stupid and my sole goal in life is to never become one of those people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here’s the explanation for my Canadian city, which I’ve been told is one of the most sprawling cities in the country:</p>
<p>The fire code requires higher water main flow rates for higher density streets. Streets with only houses are built with the smallest possible water lines, for $$ reasons of course.</p>
<p>So if you want to tear down a block of houses and build a block of apartment buildings, you also have to tear up the road on that street and install larger water pipes...</p>
<p>...but unless you picked juuuuust the right location, you’re going to discover that you have to also tear up and replace the next street over, because the water on your street comes from a street with a small water pipe...</p>
<p>...and then you look at the next street over and the next street over and you realize it will cost 5 million dollars extra to build your block of apartments, just because of the fire code. And then you realize that you’d actually make more profit from buying empty land on the edge of town and building McMansions, so you do that instead.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s cultural too. In my city unfortunately, living in apartments is seriously frowned upon. The majority of society hates them. If people liked apartments, they’d sell for so much money that the extra $5mil cost of tearing up roads wouldn’t even be a problem, because those apartments would sell sell sell!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
