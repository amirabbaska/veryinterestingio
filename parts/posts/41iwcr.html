<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19830025642.pdf" target="_blank">The 14 bees aboard STS-3 were observed to walk only on the
screen surfaces inside the flight box. They appeared to be
unable to cling to the smooth plastic surfaces. <strong>Brief attempts
at flight resulted in unstable paths, tumbling about their body
axes, and floating with little or no wingbeat. Floating was
observed for long durations and appeared to be a result of
inability to cling to a smooth surface when they came into
contact with it (with wingbeat ceasing at contact).</strong> The lack of
relative-motion visual stimuli necessary to maintain flight may
also have been responsible for the floating responses of the
bees. In addition, it may have been that the food supply
provided was inadequate for the bees and this may have led to
fatigue with resulting poor flight control responses and
floating.</a> </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFzDaBzBlL0" target="_blank">This video</a> shows an engineer who made a bike where the handlebars work oppositely to a normal bike and documents the process of learning to ride a bike. He then shows what happens when he tries to go back to a normal bike. It's a fascinating demonstration of brain plasticity and from the looks of the discussion on this thread I think it would interest you guys. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The fact bees cant fly in zero g makes me think that they cant more because of flying being far more hard-wired into their brain. Physically, could a bee controllably fly in zero g, disregarding the apparent inability to react and adapt to it? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actaully interned for a short time with a research lab that put fruit flies on the International Space Station for something like 180 days.
The fruit flies began to evolve to the conditions and once their journey was complete we found that (just like astronauts) the fruit flies hearts were significantly smaller. </p>
<p>During re-entry most of them died but the ones who lived either died very shortly after landing or were unable to do anything. </p>
<p>To answer your questions, from my understanding they pretty much just float around and are unable to control the flight path well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
