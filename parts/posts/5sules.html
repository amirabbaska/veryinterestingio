		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a business standpoint, how exactly does it help your company more than a &quot;no BS&quot; policy would?</p>
<p>A customer is unreasonable and/or abusive, and makes a complaint. Despite evidence of the opposite (including cameras and other employee witnesses), why does HR or management always opt to punish the employee rather than ban the customer? Alternatively, why are abusive, destructive, or otherwise problem-causing customers given free stuff or discounts and invited to return to cause the same problems?</p>
<p>I don't know much about how things work on the HR side, but I feel like it takes more time, energy, and money to hire, train, write tax info for, and fire employees rather than to just ban or refuse to bend over backwards for an unreasonable customer. All you have to say is &quot;no&quot; and lose out on that $1000 or so that customer might bring every year rather than spend twice that much on a high turnover rate.</p>
<p>I know multibillion dollar companies are famous for this in the sense that they don't want to &quot;lose customers&quot;, but there are plenty of mom and pop or independently owned stores that take a &quot;no BS&quot; policy with customers and still stand strong on the business end. </p>
<p>Where did the idea of catering to customers no matter what start, and is there a possibility that it might end?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this question confuses 'The Customer is Always Right' with 'Customer abuse of Employees'.  Those have always been two separate things.  I'm speaking from the experience of working at Customer Service Desks at two different supermarkets:  Whole Foods and Wegmans.</p>
<p>'The Customer is Always Right' is the general approach to a customer complaint or concern.  There are a couple of things going on.  First, if it is a matter of bad product, the cost of the product in question is usually trivial compared to the buying power of any given customer.  So if someone comes in with a dozen eggs and says one is cracked, I would tell them to go get another one and mark it paid.  I don't know if it cracked in their car going home or it was cracked in the store, but it doesn't matter.  I just spent a few dollars to make that customer spend a lot more dollars in the future.  </p>
<p>Could that system be abused?  Yes.  And people do abuse it.  It happened on occasion that someone would buy prepared food and eat it in the store, but return to the customer service desk with half a plate and complain the food was bad.  Of course you know they're angling for a free meal.  But again it is risk/reward.  The cost of appeasing an abuser is usually less than the cost of accidentally rejecting a real complaint.  It also serves to get that customer out of the store as quickly as possible.  If they create a scene, it will make other customers unhappy too.</p>
<p>Another case is an angry customer.  Either they felt like they were treated rudely, or bad product had ruined some plans, or any of a myriad of reasons.  'The Customer is Always Right' in this scenario means deescalation.  You need to resolve the anger first before resolving the issue.  The quickest way to get this done is appeasement and empathy.  Tell them you understand and you apologize and that they're right:  it never should have happened.  You invite a manager into the mix - which also has the benefit of outnumbering them.  People shopping in supermarkets often don't want to be there.  Go in with the assumption that someone is having a bad day and you're usually right.  If you can make them happy and they leave happy, well then you're the one bright spot in the otherwise crappy day.  This brings them back to the store tomorrow.</p>
<p>'Employee Abuse,' however, was NEVER tolerated in any place I worked.  Cursing out an employee, yelling and screaming, inappropriate behavior (I had one guy lie down on the service desk as if to take a nap once), or anything physical would get a customer escorted out of the store.  At Wegmans, that would have involved a cop and Whole Foods had their own security.  Whenever a customer got abusive, the customer was always wrong.  It's a health and safety issue at that point.  And yes, people do get banned for life.  Both stores also have their own 'inventory control' people:  essentially undercover shoppers looking for shoplifters or scammers.  You didn't want to confront shoplifters yourself, but notify a manager who would notify these folks (we rarely if ever knew who they were).  </p>
<p>Why does this work at big retail chains and not Mom and Pop stores?  It's really economy of scale.  Large retail stores are making a lot more money per transaction and doing a whole lot more of them, such that they can absorb the cost of a 'Customer is Always Right' policy.  And in the end, you encourage people to return and spend more money with the policy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some decent posts here but I think one key thing is missing.</p>
<p>As a business owner, you do not control the impact that a dissatisfied customer has on your business when he or she recounts the experience. A customer can be 100% wrong in their interaction with a business. You could ban that customer or simply ask him or her to leave. However, when they go out into the world and recount their experience to their friends and family, those people will only hear the customer's side of the story. You as a business owner don't get a seat at they table to explain what actually happened. This can easily dissuade other people from visiting your business and buying from you. </p>
<p>So it often makes sense to placate a customer who is not &quot;right.&quot; That customer leaves satisfied and may even realize later upon further reflection that he was being a jerk. If he ever recounts his experience to another person, his story is now unequivocally positive. &quot;Man I was super pissed off the other day after a long day at work. Went to Mike's tacos, and I accidentally ordered the wrong thing. When the waitress brought it I was kind of snotty and told her she better fix it. She did it with a smile even though I was being a dick. She went out of her way to try and give me a good experience. Those are good people at Mike's Tacos.&quot;</p>
<p>Word of mouth is extremely important for local businesses and really any place that has direct customer interaction. Since you can't control the customer's message to the outside world, sometimes it is worth taking a small loss of a rude or wrong customer to help your reputation. This doesn't excuse those people for being assholes, but it is the reality of doing retail business. </p>
<p>This doesn't always apply and some customers can really take advantage of satisfaction policies. Repeat bad customs are often banned. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: I've been informed by some alarmingly angry profanity enthusiasts that the origin of the phrase does in fact refer to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_customer_is_always_right" target="_blank">customer service usage</a>. </p>
<p>So instead please refer to the original answer below as the most USEFUL version of the phrase, rather than the original. </p>
<hr />
<p>The &quot;customer is always right&quot; is an often abused and misunderstood sentiment.</p>
<p>The &quot;customer is always right&quot; originally meant that what the customer wants (and thus buys) is more important than what you think.</p>
<p>For instance, you're a shoe store. You stock green boots, black boots, and pink boots. Green is your favorite color. You always wear green boots.</p>
<p>However, your customers only buy black and pink boots. Those green boots sit dead on your shelf, but you keep stocking them. Even when you could be using that money to stock more black and pink boots.</p>
<p>The customer is always right means it doesn't matter that you like green boots. Buy more black and pink and suck it up.</p>
<p>The saying got twisted through misunderstanding into some kind of customer service truism that it was never intended as.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have widely misconstrued what &quot;the customer is always right&quot; axiom actually means. Not surprisingly, the party mostly responsible for this has been... consumers. We live in an entitled culture. (In the West, anyhow. Sometimes the rest of the world isn't so lucky.)</p>
<p>Around the turn of the century and before, shopping for a lot of items was not a self service affair. You were helped by a salesperson or shopkeeper, who was counted on to be more or less knowledgeable about whatever the product in question may be. Even if that item was mundane (a sack of flour, or a pound of nails) it was probably located behind a counter or in a storeroom or otherwise inaccessible. Naturally the customer would tend to turn to this person for advice, particularly with goods like clothing. &quot;The customer is always right&quot; really means that despite what the salesperson's opinion or prior experience may be, he should ultimately sell the customer what they ask for. Regardless of how silly or unfashionable it may look on them, or if there is a higher quality version or another product that would earn a fatter commission, whatever -- if the customer wants a specific item, that is what you sell them.</p>
<p>Somewhere between the 1960's and 1980's, possibly due to the rise of chain stores, corporate culture, and the possibility for bad word of mouth to spread fast and far via the telephone, TV, nationally syndicated letters to the editor, etc. this got twisted around to the current &quot;bend over backwards and do anything to prevent the customer from complaining&quot; compulsion. That's what everyone thinks it means now, but that's not what it originally meant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Customer is Always right phrase came around during the 50s when the ad business started to boom. It's a similar sentiment as &quot;you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink&quot;. You may think your customers want a product done a certain way but they buy what they want, and you can't always predict that. You may be selling a superior product in every way but if the customer is only buying the inferior product, then you are wrong. Cater to what the customer wants, even if you the business think you have a better product for them, they want what they want and since they are paying, they are right.</p>
<p>This is used as a business model and never intended to be taken literally at a personal level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
