The pictures I took all look like they just have a sepia filter on them, but in reality the only word that could describe it was yellow. In fact it was a little bit disorienting. <a href="http://imgur.com/yJb7s7D" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/yJb7s7D</a></p></div></div>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most thunderstorms occur in the late afternoon. By this time of day, the sun is beginning to set. The orange hue is caused by the same process that causes the vivid colors at sunsets. Shorter wavelengths of light (blue) are scattered quickly, leaving only the yellow-orange-red end of the spectrum.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just looked this up last night after a thunderstorm rolled through Baltimore. I believe it has to do with the scattering of light by water molecules in the atmosphere. Just as the atmosphere already scatters light to give the appearance of blue during the day, extra water makes the area around us look yellow or green. That's the most detailed explanation i can give. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
