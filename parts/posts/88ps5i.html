The signal from that would be amplified and then modulated onto a carrier wave.</p>
<p>The camera tube worked in a similar way to the picture tubes that used be in televisions.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same way it was done with other video transmissions at that time. Scan row by row, and keep everything analog.</p>
<p>The most notable step (and Apollo-specific) was probably the frame rate conversion: Show the original video on a screen on Earth, and film this screen with a different video camera.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is actually a bunch of Wiki articles you might be interested in.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_television" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_television</a></p>
<p>First TVs and faxes were mechanical - they used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipkow_disk" target="_blank">Nipkow disk</a> invented in 1881 to transmit images, but they were very slow and the resolution was very low. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelford_Bidwell" target="_blank">Bidwell</a> used a similar idea for a fax machine in 1880 but his machine used a cylinder with a hole to scan documents. Early TV systems in 1920 - 1930s were mechanical and used one or another mechanical system - Nipkow disk or a set of mirrors. They scanned images line per line and focused it on a selenium photocell that sensed brightness of a particular image spot. Then you used another disk coupled with a lamp to project the image on a TV set. In most cases you had to slow a disk down by varying pressure on it to synch the rotation speed and thus your image.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube" target="_blank">CRT</a> was invented in 1897 and had better image quality (after some time was spent improving it, of course) than the Nipkow disk <del>camera</del> display. It recreates an image by sweeping a beam of electrons across the screen covered by phosphor, which glows when hit by electrons. Separate the phosphor into lines or dots and you can recreate the lines from a Nipkow disk.</p>
<p>Some thought went into making a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_camera_tube" target="_blank">CRT tube that can sense images though</a>. The idea was to use the same tube, but cover the screen with something that will change its` charge based on how much light falls on it. When an image was focused on the screen of those dots and an electron beam swept across it, you could tell which ones were charged and which ones were not, measure the current and sync it with a display CRT. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconoscope" target="_blank">A version by Zworykin</a> was more sensitive than early devices and subsequent camera tubes were based on the same principle. Then came a whole torrent of refinements - Orthicon, Vidicon, Your-own-name-con, etc. But they were essentially the same CRT tubes that swept a beam of electrons accross a screen.</p>
<p>Early satellites used ordinary film, then dropped a canister of film down, because the TV systems were very low-quality. Then someone had a bright idea to make an ordinary photograph or film, then use a CRT tube to slowly scan it with better resolution and send wirelessly to Earth. Enter first Moon probes and spy satellites! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television" target="_blank">SSTV</a> was used to send those images, since they were otherwise too bad to be of any use.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you actually want a CRT TV in action at 60,000 FPS high speed... it’s amazing that TVs even work.  The person(s) involved in bringing this tech from dream to reality are brilliant.  </p>
<p>Only one tiny dot on aTV is on at any given time.  What your seeing is persistence of vision... kind like a sparkler at New Years even is moved in a circle pattern fast.  It looks like the sparkler is a sold O.. but in fact it’s only a tiny tiny section of that O at any given time.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The CCD is not a digital sensor. Neither are CMOS sensors. The conversion to digital happens after the analog levels have been shifted pixel by pixel out of the sensor. </p>
<p>That said, the camera used a vidicon tube which was basically the same being used by TV stations. It was slow scan and had to be converted to 60 Hz vertical scan for broadcast. The later missions used a field sequential color camera which had a rotating filter wheel. The same principle as DLP projectors. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
