		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you misunderstand the meaning of &quot;checks and balances&quot;. Checks and balances is a philosophy that states that each branch should have the power to regulate the actions of each other branch. It does <em>not</em> give power to the parties in any way.</p>
<p>The entire purpose of the structure of the government was to prevent a single organization from supplanting the power of the others, meaning that governmental power could be as decentralized as possible. If a party wins control of the majority in the House, Senate, and Presidency (yes, I know that's not the three branches of government, but it's the real focus of this discussion, so bear with me), then it is entirely within their rights to push their agenda. The government was built precisely to allow for this type of change. The support of a wide variety of people in disparate states was necessary to pull off the current Republican domination of the government, and the Constitution was written specifically to allow the people to enforce the desired change by electing representatives that support their wishes.</p>
<p>As much as it may upset you, there is nothing unconstitutional about the current situation in government. In fact, the Democrats were in much the same position in 2008. The constitution was written precisely so that this type of radical shift in policy could be implemented by the voters if they felt that the government acting in accordance with their wishes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some constitutional law theories that may allow it, but they haven't succeeded in practice. They stem from the fact that while the federal government has 3 branches, that's only half of the picture. The individual states have rights as well (although they can really only challenge the federal government if they act together).</p>
<p>The first is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullification_\(U.S._Constitution\)" target="_blank">nullification</a>. This is a legal theory that each state has the right to nullify any federal law that the state believes is unconstitutional. This isn't explicitly laid out in the constitution, and has been rejected by both state and federal courts every time it's been tried.</p>
<p>A similar option is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interposition" target="_blank">interposition</a>. This involves multiple states acting together to prevent the ability of the federal government to enforce laws considered unconstitutional. This would buy the states time to go through the process of challenging laws. It would also wait out the clock until the next election which could correct the issues (the members of the House of Representatives have two year term limits).</p>
<p>Then there's an option that's never been used and is rarely discussed in Article V of the Constitution. Article V discusses how amendments to the constitution are proposed, and so far they have all used the first option - a two-thirds vote by both the House of Representative and the Senate (then ratification by the states). But there's a second option, often called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_to_propose_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution" target="_blank">Article V Convention</a> - If two-thirds of the state legislatures apply for a convention to propose amendments, the states could decide to directly change the Constitution <em>without any say from federal government</em>. The state governments would be able to restructure the government at will, as long as three-quarters of the states agreed on new amendments proposed.</p>
<p>Changing the Constitution directly isn't something to do lightly, of course. An Article V Convention is really just a last resort in case the three branches of government unite to do something extreme, like amending the constitution themselves to make the president a dictator for life. But it's a good reminder that the federal government is only given power by the states, who are given power by the people of the states, which is noted in the very first line of the Constitution. The power comes from &quot;We, the people of the United States&quot; - nowhere else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That said, it's kind of intentional. If they're popular enough to get all 3 branches of government, the thinking goes, people must want them there for a reason.</p>
<p>You don't even need all 3!</p>
<p>All it takes is ~2/3 of Congress(or 2/3 to propose, 3/4 to pass state legislatures), and voters willing to keep voting you in, to make literally any changes to the Constitution/government you want. Again, the founders thinking was &quot;don't like it? vote for someone else&quot;</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do that, and you can do whatever you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
