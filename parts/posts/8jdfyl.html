		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand there might be a number of approaches to a question like this, with a variety of physiological and psychological takes, so I'll give you a little context as to why I'm asking the question to help you clarify things for me.</p>
<p>Firstly, I should reaffirm the fact that I am asking this question that has been on my mind for a while with regards to the notion of a 'crush', a social term used by youths (like myself).</p>
<p>Secondly, the point is I was wondering if there is a discrepancy (and scientific explanation) between 'romantic' and sexual attraction. More specifically, I want to know if a straight person can have a 'crush' on a member (and only a certain member) of the same sex while still being heterosexual.</p>
<p>So, to link back to the titular question, I want to know what physiological and psychological factors influence a 'crush' and if those factors can include things that seem completely unrelated to sexual attraction like simply identifying with them/seeing yourself in them or empathising with them.</p>
<p>Sorry if this isn't clear at all, but I would appreciate any helpful responses, even if you can only answer the question from a particular field/point of view.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I love this kind of question, because it makes you realise how complicated people are. To answer it as best I can for you, I'll give you a bit of an overview of attraction research. Although before that, for you and any other young person that may see this, if you ever wonder if your behaviour is &quot;normal&quot;, the answer is almost always yes. Also, I'll leave a reference at the bottom of this, from which I will be liberally borrowing. It's a solid article for this topic if you want more information.</p>
<p>First up, we need to decide what we mean by &quot;attraction.&quot; It can be used in many different ways and take different meanings, so we need to establish a definition for this question. Typically, psychological research uses &quot;attraction&quot; to refer to a person's initial assessment of another person. The term &quot;attitude&quot; is generally used to refer to your long-standing feeling toward someone else. So &quot;attraction&quot; (in a research context) is a measure of &quot;first impressions,&quot; so to speak. It isn't necessarily romantic, but merely how much you like the person right when you meet them. You could of course discuss sub-types of attraction like &quot;romantic attraction,&quot; &quot;friendly attraction,&quot; and so on.</p>
<p>Your instantaneous attraction to someone is often based on a whole host of factors. Have you heard about them before? How do they present themselves? What are the circumstances of your meeting? and so on. However, given our restricted definitions, I think you're more concerned about attitudes than attraction, so let's move on to that bit.</p>
<p>Attitudes are quite similar to attraction, but refers to your long-lasting and consistent perception of another person. Again, an attitude will be coloured by a litany of factors. How many positive interactions have you had? How positive/open is the other person? How receptive are they to your needs? If you look into models of attitude formation, you'll normally find attitudes described in terms of the ABCs. That is, an Affective, Behavioural, and Cognitive component. All of these summed up determine how you feel about someone.</p>
<p>I'm sure you've noticed by this point that I've not made much distinction between romantic attraction/attitude and any other kind. That's because there isn't much of one. The factors leading to positive attractions and attitudes are basically the same in both cases, but may activate some slightly different markers (for example, romantic attraction may be fueled a bit more by physical appearance or some specific trait you like). If you feel a sexual attraction to someone at first, that may then build into your long-term attitude about them as a potential partner. If you feel a friendly attraction to someone, you may build up an affectionate attitude. So on and so forth.</p>
<p>I hope this helps answer your questions. Let me know if you want more resources. As a final note, you questioned if you could have a &quot;crush&quot; on someone of the same sex while being heterosexual. Yes. Heterosexual just means that you have a predominant leaning towards the opposite sex. It does not mean you never have feelings/crushes on a member of the same sex.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a more technical term for a crush:  Limerence, a term coined by psychologist Dorothy Tennov in her 1979 book Love and Limerence: The Experience of Being in Love. Apparently, it is not possible to feel limerence for someone you are not sexually attracted to. Limerence would thus be radically different from the term 'squish' described By /u/Retinator99. Limerence can be destructive when suddenly, in the middle of a healthy relationship, you fall and get infatuated with a non-reciprocating person. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Have you ever heard the term &quot;squish&quot;? It's a fairly newly coined word to describe nonsexual crushes. So like a friend who you admire the hell out of and want to be super close with them, but don't want to date.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
