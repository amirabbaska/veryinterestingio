		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple expanation. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When an animal is being hunted, if they blend in well they have a lower chance of being caught. Humans are not in need of this trait now. So it has simply disappeared.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Humans do change their hair color.</em> &quot;Children born with some hair colors may find it gradually darkens as they grow. Many blond, light brown, or red haired infants experience this. This is caused by genes being turned off and on during early childhood and puberty.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Changes in hair color typically occur naturally as people age, eventually turning the hair gray and then white. This is called achromotrichia. Achromotrichia normally begins in the early to mid-twenties in men and late twenties in women.&quot; </p>
</li>
<li>&quot;The change in hair color occurs when melanin ceases to be produced in the hair root and new hairs grow in without pigment. The stem cells at the base of hair follicles produce melanocytes, the cells that produce and store pigment in hair and skin. The death of the melanocyte stem cells causes the onset of graying. It remains unclear why the stem cells of one hair follicle may die well over a decade before those in adjacent follicles less than a millimeter apart.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why do some people have red beard and black/white hair?</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The genes that determine hair color are so-called ‘incomplete dominant hereditary traits.’ This means that there isn’t one single gene that’s dominant over the rest, but all genes influence each other”</p>
<p>&quot;The red hair itself is caused by a mutation in what researchers call the MC1R gene. Having two mutated genes gives someone all red hair, but having just one can give a person red hair in unexpected places. In non-Gattaca terms, that means even if a gene that signals brown hair is dominant in your family, another gene for red hair may still be present in your genetic code.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So if you've got a red beard, someone at some point in your family had red hair, but those genes can express themselves differently in different people across different generations. &quot;It’s entirely possible that one distant ancestor had a hair color that suddenly appears again through a certain combination of genes—and that can be quite unexpected for parents”&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cats evolved patterned fur to better camouflage themselves. Think how hard it is to find your tabby cat that got outside. Wildcats look a lot like domestic tabby cats. Humans don't need patterned hair to get an advantage hunting or hiding from predators. </p>
<p>The various cat colors like white, orange, calico, and such are mutations. A domestic calico cat gets fed as much as a tabby cat so there's no pressure to eliminate the mutation, and in fact humans actually encourage it because they like other cat colors besides brown tabby. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apes, which are our nearest kin, almost entirely have monochromatic fur. Animals evolve colored fur and skin for two reasons- stealth and sex. Apes have little need for stealth and evolved other characteristics to attract mates besides colors or patterns. Basically, like apes, humans don't need colored hair to procreate or survive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking about calico cats (varying spots of different colors), it's a phenomenon to their fur color gene called X-inactivation (credit to u/sammg37). Normally cats are supposed to be monochromatic, like humans and apes, but with this gene mutation, everything gets messed up. </p>
<p>Other animals evolved varying colors for various reasons like defense. Think bright colors to indicate to predators that they are poisonous (poison tree frogs, snakes, bees). They can also evolve different colors to attract a mate (the peacock with the biggest and brightest tail feathers will attract more mates than an average peacock).</p>
<p>Humans never needed to do either of those as we choose mates for different reasons and don't need protection as we are the apex species (except for few exceptions, I'm not fighting a bear to prove this). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to your question doesn't really exist because it is based off of a false premise. People, particularly women, don't have a single hair color. It might look solid from far away, but if you look closely different hairs have different colors. When looked at farther away, it takes on the appearance of a single color. </p>
<p>The reason this happens is because of incomplete dominance in the genes that code for hair color and texture, as another commented already posted. I say that it is more common for women to have more variance in hair color due to having two X chromosomes. During gene expression, only one X chromosome copy is expressed at one time for each hair follicle while the other becomes &quot;deactivated.&quot; This deactivated X chromosome us known as a Barr body. This phenomenon of X chromosomes being expressed in different hair follicles is also what creates coat patterns on calico cats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
