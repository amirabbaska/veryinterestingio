		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question about superheavy elements has nothing to do with an expanding universe or neutrinos.</p>
<p>We can produce elements up to 118, and beyond uranium (92) their lifetime decreases with increasing element number - while uranium has a lifetime of billions of years the heaviest elements just live fractions of a second. Even heavier elements could live a bit long<em>er</em> (maybe several seconds, maybe even days - &quot;island of stability&quot;), it is not expected that there are elements with a long lifetime. Even if supernovae can produce elements beyond 118 (which is unclear on its own), they would probably decay quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
