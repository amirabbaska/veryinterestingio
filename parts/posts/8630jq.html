		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This means the medicine is formulated as the hydrochloride salt.  Many drugs are organic amines, which would otherwise be basic, so neutralizing them with hydrochloric acid to form the corresponding salt is part of formulating them into a neutral form patients can take.  This also makes them more water soluble for better bioavailability, and more crystalline for better stability and compounding.</p>
<p>Tetracycline, for instance, <a href="https://www.drugs.com/pro/tetracycline.html" target="_blank">is only very slightly soluble in water and has an amine group</a> that makes it a base, with a pKa corresponding to a pH of 8.3.  But hydrochloric acid neutralizes this, and the hydrochloride salt is crystalline (good for making into a pill) and &quot;freely soluble&quot; in water.</p>
<p>Similarly, the beta-blocker, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propranolol" target="_blank">propranolol</a>, has an amine group and is formulated as the hydrochloride in <a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-10404-9168/propranolol-oral/propranolol-oral/details" target="_blank">Inderol</a>; the anti-depressant, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion" target="_blank">buproprion</a>, has an amine group and is formulated as the hydrochloride in <a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-13507-7155/bupropion-hcl-oral/bupropion-extended-release-antidepressant-oral/details" target="_blank">Wellbutrin</a>; etc.</p>
<p>A lot of science goes into properly formulating drugs, including the <a href="http://www.pharmtech.com/salt-selection-drug-development" target="_blank">salt selection</a>.  Some things you may target for are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aqueous solubility measured at various pH values, depending upon the intended pharmaceutical profile</p>
<p>High degree of crystallinity</p>
<p>Low hygroscopicity (i.e., water absorption versus relative humidity), which gives consistent performance</p>
<p>Optimal chemical and solid-state stability under accelerated conditions (i.e., minimal chemical degradation or solid-state changes when stored at 40 °C and 75% relative humidity)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not all drugs are basic, some are an acid and must be neutralized with a base instead of an acid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned before, that’s the hydrochloride salt. Speaking from a chemist’s point of view, preparing a chemical as the salt is often convenient. Many chemicals are noncrystalline solids or oils in the basic form, and these are hard to work with. So called “street chemists” are familiar with this as well, since syntheses of illicit drugs often have a “salting out” step where the drug is converted to the hydrochloride or other salt and precipitates from the solution as crystals. There are several pluses to this: </p>
<ul>
<li>A crystalline solid can be easier to measure and mix than an amorphous solid or oil</li>
<li>“Salting out” results in the final product precipitating from the reaction solution (so you can then pour off the reaction mixture with all the solvent, unreacted starting materials, and side products) making it a lot easier to isolate the product</li>
<li>The crystalline product is a salt, which can reduce its solubility in nonpolar solvents, so you can rinse the crystals in the appropriate solvent to further purify them without losing a lot of material </li>
