		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here talking about radar seems to be overlooking the fact that ATC radar <strong>cannot</strong> determine the size of the aircraft, and literally thousands of aircraft in the US operate without Mode C transponders. If you are operating in airspace that has no Mode C transponder requirement (Class E and G. Technically class D as well, but someone would just <em>see</em> you there), in VFR (good weather) conditions, private aircraft have no legal obligation to file any paperwork with, nor ever contact, ATC.</p>
<p>If you took off from an uncontrolled airport away from large metro areas or busy airports, planned your route very carefully, and stayed in Class E and Class G airspace, you would likely be breaking a number of FARs, but you might just be able to pull it off. People do it with small aircraft while trying to relocate something that technically isn't 'airworthy', and stories about such shenanigans abound. It's illegal, immoral, and generally stupid, but I'd love to see sources for many of the claims being made here regarding low level radar coverage of the CONUS, as well as ATC identification capabilities. I was a radar engineer first, then went to school for ATC and commercial aviation, and I am hereby officially throwing the bullshit flag.</p>
<p>All this says nothing about the actual feasibility of it. You'd have to get in and out of airports to refuel with your big airplane, and many of the most remote airports wouldn't be available, as many small airports would not be able to support a commercial jet aircraft due to limited runway size. You'd have to refuel frequently as well, as you'd have a fraction of the range that the same aircraft would have at 35,000 feet, as jets aren't nearly so efficient at low altitudes. Refueling such an aircraft is also not a trivial matter, and the guy at the FBO is certainly going to wonder WTF is up. He's also going to laugh at you when you ask him to put 50,000lbs of Jet-A on your aircraft when he hasn't got a fuel truck. A large aircraft flying below 10,000 feet (5,000 feet in many areas to avoid airspace that is more carefully observed) over vast stretches of populated terrain is apt to generate a bit of interest on the ground as well, so you'd likely get reported in fairly short order to someone who'd take enough interest to track you down, and once they had an idea of where you had been and when, finding you wouldn't be all that difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you mean by unauthorized. I'll try to keep this basic.<br />
If you start an end at smaller uncontrolled airports, stay below 18000 feet MSL, and out of the controlled airspace rings around major airports and restricted areas, then you don't need to file a flight plan and no one would care what you do.  You could easily fly across the country this way. </p>
<p>However if you don't file a flight plan and decide to go fly over the White House it won't matter if you are a small plane or a jumbo jet, you will find yourself being escorted by USAF Fighter jets before you can blink. </p>
<p>There are a lot more complexities to how all of this could work but that is the basic version.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That depends a lot. If you know what you are doing you might get across the US unnoticed. I would not think many professional airline pilots could do this without serious preparations beforehand. The system is built so that you are monitored and talk to ATC all the time. In addition the Air Force have radars hidden all over the country which looks for things like this. So you would be lucky if you were able to get into the cockpit, would not have a chance at taking off and would not last ten minutes before you got a fighter escort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You will be notice the moment you get into the airspace of an airport. If you are flying out over wilderness or farm land you might, and I say might go for a bit without being noticed. But if you are near the international border or near any airport you will be noticed.  </p>
<p>If you do not respond fighter jets will be dispatched to visually observe you, and if you still do not respond then you will either be forced down or shot down. And yes you will eventually be shot down. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: As soon as you power up the plane and talk to the ground control for taxi clearance.  </p>
<p>Because each plane has a registration code that is used in communication with the ATC, something like ROT452, it is embedded in the transponder. This way, the ATC knows with what plane is communicating, because the usual discussion with the ground goes like this: &quot;Heathrow approach, this is ROT452 entering your airspace, requesting permission to land.&quot; Notice that the pilot is using the airplanes registration code so that the ATC can correlate the voice with what he sees on the radar.  </p>
<p>If something happens and the airplane loses it's ability to send information to the ATC, a power failure, terrorist take-over, or just incompetence, the person responsible for that piece of airspace has to contact it a number of times and if it does not respond it hat to notify the military or the air force that they have a rogue plane.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
