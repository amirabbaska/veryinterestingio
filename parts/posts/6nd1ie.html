		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're talking about the difference between Physical and Mental dependence. A Physical dependence occurs when a drug is taken often enough that the brain stops producing a chemical it normally would (most often dopamine) without the addict taking drugs. A Mental dependence can be thought of as your brain adjusting to what is normal. Think of how if you get really stressed you have trouble functioning. If you used weed for a long period of time its relaxing effect would cause the amount of stress you were dealing with the past to begin to seem overwhelming, causing you to &quot;need&quot; the weed to function properly again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another way to split it out..  addiction is a psychiatric behavioral problem, marked by
Inability to consistently Abstain;
Impairment in Behavioral control;
Craving; or increased “hunger” for drugs or rewarding experiences;
Diminished recognition of significant problems with one’s behaviors and interpersonal relationships; and
A dysfunctional Emotional response.</p>

<p>Physical Dependence is <em>not necessarily</em> addiction, though often the two over lap.  Physical dependance is is marked by withdrawal if the substance is removed.</p>
<p>For instance, some people with chronic pain are physically dependent on their meds, they will get sick without them.  But they do not abuse their meds, they dont take more than prescribed, they wont try to steal to get more, if it comes to that.</p>
<p>On the other extreme, cocaine is very addictive in terms of causing awful behaviors in some people, but the physical dependence on cocaine is very mild, even for regular users.  </p>
<p>There is some evidence that cannabis causes mild physical dependence in heavy users, but it also causes addiction behaviors in some users.  But overall, it is very rare that people show any signs of either addiction or dependence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Concerning Marijuana Addiction:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Estimates of the number of people addicted to marijuana are controversial, in part because epidemiological studies of substance use often use dependence as a proxy for addiction even though it is possible to be dependent without being addicted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Definitions</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Addiction</strong> is a primary, chronic, neurobiologic disease, with genetic, psychosocial, and
environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized
by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use,
compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Physical dependence</strong> is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a drug class specific
withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction,
decreasing blood level of the drug, and/or administration of an antagonist.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Physical Dependence Distinction</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>... as tolerance increases, eventually the body's ability to maintain this equilibrium is exceeded and the body becomes dependent on that external source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Addiction Distinction</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uncontrollable cravings prompt the destructive behaviors of addiction. There is no addiction without cravings.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not physically addicting (your body won't be messed up by withdrawal if you stop), but it is psychologically addicting. That is, once you get used to its powerful relaxing effect, it's very hard to give that up. You get stressed out and wish you had some weed again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
