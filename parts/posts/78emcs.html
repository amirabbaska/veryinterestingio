		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In hot planet with high mass transport, you would get a more uniform distribution of elements.</p>
<p>The reason you see stratification of elements, like gold in California, is because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Earth has cooled to the point where different elements have stratified in the macroscale.  For instance, the plant has a core of hot metal, then a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Earth" target="_blank">series of different spherical layers going outwards until you come to the crust</a>.  Each layer has a different composition related to its relative energy (pressure and heat). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small fluctuations, on a geologic-scale, act to unevenly mix the layers.  For instance, volcanoes allow the mantle to bring material to the crust in localized areas.</p>
</li>
<li>Chemical and physical properties of localized areas of the crust act to concentrate certain compounds.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor" target="_blank">For example</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Over time, the crust can be re-dissolved into the mantle, such as at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction" target="_blank">subduction zones along continental plates</a>, which keeps the process of local distribution going indefinitely. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you're asking what geologic process acts to concentrate so many elements and minerals in narrow veins, rather than distributed throughout larger geologic structures. </p>
<p>The simple answer is fractional crystallization. Many of these elements are highly incompatible. This means that rather than  forming nice crystals, they stay in the melt phase. As a large amount of melt cools, the concentration of incompatibles in the melt phase increases. At the end of fractional crystallization you get left with a small amount of fluid that is highly concentrated incompatible elements. This fluid then goes on to form veins. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before there was the Earth, or any of the other planets in our solar system, there was basically a large dust cloud surrounding our star. Over time, that dust coalesced into larger and larger clumps which eventually combined into the planets. Due to gravity, the heavier elements tended toward the center. </p>
<p>As the mass grew the pressure at the center became higher and higher. High pressure equally high temperature and so the center of the mass liquified. Because the cloud that formed the earth was spinning, and because of lots of collisions with other masses, the earth spins at a pretty nice clip. </p>
<p>So the ball of liquid metals and other elements at the center of the earth is a pretty dynamic place with lots of mixing and moving around. If you've ever tried to mix things you know that some mix easily, others won't mix at all, and some combine to form new things. The metals and elements in the earth's crust are no different. </p>
<p>The part of the earth we live on, the crust, appears to us to be pretty solid, but in reality it is fractured into &quot;plates&quot; and quite thin in places. This is why there are volcanos, geysers, hot springs, etc. In many places the crust is simply not strong enough to contain all the heat and energy of the core. So it breaks through and comes out. Sometimes that's dramatic, like a volcanic eruption, but most of the time it's slow and barely noticeable. Along the boundaries of the plates you have places where they are <a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/jimbrau/BrauImNew/Chap07/7th/AT_7e_Figure_07_15.jpg" target="_blank">literally spreading apart</a> with material from the core filling in the gap. </p>
<p>The reason what comes out is not an even mixture is that elements and compounds are all different. Some bond easily with other compounds or grow into crystal formations, others do not. Some will dissolve into water at certain temperatures and then leave when it cools down, others won't dissolve at all. Gold, for example, will dissolve into water at very high temperatures. As the water heads towards the surface, it cools and the gold is deposited into veins. </p>
<p>There are also heavy elements that came to earth after the planet was formed. Space is full of rocks including some made of heavy metals. When they smash into the earth they leave those metals more or less at the surface. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The segment in this video does a good job of explaining how gravity and weathering would have sifted/gathered elements in various concentrations over time rather than maintaining an even mix (as it was in the beginning when the Earth was still very hot/high energy).  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here are a couple articles I just found. I was actually researching this a month ago because I was looking until gold and where it comes from. Unfortunately, I'm not finding the exact articles I read at the times.</p>
<p>I know that we thought that gold and other heavy metals (above iron) were formed by supernovas, but recent studies suggest that this isn't the case (the conditions for large amount of heavy metals aren't meant in a supernova). The merger of two neutron stars is actually where the majority of the universe's heavy metals come from. </p>
<p>So, neutron star merger = lots of concentrated heavy metals. Supernovas = small amounts of even distributed heavy metals.</p>
<p><a href="http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=169" target="_blank">Article 1</a></p>

<p>Edit: This is just to show the reason for heavy metals found in high concentration in the universe vs. evenly distributed. I know you asked specifically about the Earth, so I found <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110907132044.htm" target="_blank">this article</a> about that situation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
