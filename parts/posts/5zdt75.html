If so is pi used in random number generating algorithms?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know if every digit is equally likely in pi, but it is conjectured that this is the case, we just can't prove it yet. We think that this is the case mostly because every digit is equally likely in almost all numbers, so there would have to be some kind of specific reason or obstruction to this for pi if it weren't the case. But we don't think that pi should have a special reason not to have every digit equally likely. So we think that every digit in pi is equally likely because we think it's like most every other number and not particularly special (at least, when it comes to digits).</p>
<p>I don't think you would want to use it as a random number generator, because it's still a well known sequence of numbers and you don't really want that when you are trying to get random numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That's not to say this is proof, but it is a large sample size, so you can make some statistical conclusions.</p>
<p>tl;dr: The frequency is near even, and a chi-square test shows they are evenly distributed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I see that /u/GoAheadMakeMySplay mentioned it in a comment already. Bedford's Law does not apply to Pi, but it applies to many, many places where one might think the digits would be random, but they are not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In accounting we used to apply <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford's_law" target="_blank"></a> to catch fraudsters. </p>
<p>&quot;The law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading significant digit is likely to be small. in sets which obey the law, the number 1 appears as the most significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the most significant digit less than 5% of the time.&quot;</p>
<p>We could catch fraud in a balance sheet because randomly generated numbers follow this law. If someone was cooking the books, the number 9 might appear as the most significant digit 10-20% of the time. When this occurred deeper investigation usually found fraud in action.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
