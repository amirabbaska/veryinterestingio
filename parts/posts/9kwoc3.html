		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat can be transferred two basic ways.  One is conduction, like when your body is in contact with cold air. As you realize, you need something to conduct the heat <em>to</em> for this to work.  </p>
<p>The other mechanism is radiation.  Your body is constantly radiating infrared light, carrying away heat energy.  (This is known as &quot;black body radiation&quot;.) Black body radiation isn't all that fast, so freezing in outer space will take a bit of time. </p>
<p>All objects that have a temperature above absolute zero will emit black body radiation, so this process will eventually freeze you, probably after you've died from some other issue like running out of oxygen to breathe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's still blackbody radiation. But you're not wrong, if you were exposed to space there'd be a number of problems, but being cold isn't one of them. It is true that the ambient temperature is very low, and you'd eventually radiate away all of your heat, but that would take a while.</p>
<p>The ISS, in fact, has large cooling fins and complicated cooling systems, and not heating systems, for this reason. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see all of these answers talking about radiation and while that's true, I'd like to mention the fact that exposing body temperature water to vacuum will boil the water off, leaving only low-energy water molecules, which are cold and freeze.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people have mentioned that you would still lose heat by your body radiating heat away. Which is true. But the real reason why you would &quot;feel&quot; cold in a vacuum is because all the moisture and sweat on your skin would immediately evaporate taking with it a lot of your heat. You would feel an extreme painful cold sensation.</p>
<p>Space is cold because of a lack of heat, not because of vacuum. If you are a small object then the Sun's radiant heat isn't enough to keep you warm. Even the Earth is only just large enough to stay warm to keep you alive and a lot of that is due to the atmosphere keeping a lot of heat trapped inside, instead of just bouncing off back into space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The temperature of a system doesn't actually show how &quot;immediately dangerous&quot; it is. That just tells you the end result if you remain in it long enough to get to that temperature.</p>
<p>For example, going outside in -40C air is pretty damn cold, but you'll be fine for at least a couple minutes, even in the nude.</p>
<p>But jumping into a vat of -40C super chilled liquid would freeze you to death almost instantly.</p>
<p>But surprisingly floating in space in regards to freezing only would not be that dangerous at all.</p>
<p>The reason is because whats actually dangerous is <strong>change</strong> in temperature.</p>
<p>You equalize temperature (convection) based on the system you're in and some things are faster at transfering heat than others, water is much faster than air for example. Or metal is faster than wood. Touching cold metal feels colder than touching cold wood because it saps your heat much faster, and your body detects change in temperature, not actually the temperature itself.</p>
<p>People mentioning radiation is just a different kind of losing heat, but the main one is convection, and in space there's (almost) nothing there for convection to work. Meaning the only way to lose heat is very slowly via radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
