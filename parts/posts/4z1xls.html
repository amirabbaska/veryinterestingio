<p>edit: well then, this blew up last night lol. a TON of great replies and a lot of information showing just how much information there is to know and still learn about the human body as most &quot;truths&quot; with our physiology are still just accepted theories. Big thank you to u/cthulhubert for the great response, spawning the 3rd best analogy to use midgets that i've ever seen. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the basic theory is that you damage a muscle just enough, it repairs itself and adapts to the stress that caused the damage. Very very roughly: a nearby <del>blastocyte</del> <strong>myosatellite cell</strong> is primed (including with the type of adaptation needed) by chemical signals the cell releases during damage, and after a threshold is passed, it grows in size and then fuses to the original, damaged cell.</p>
<p>Pushing the absolute limits of your muscles' basic work capacity (low reps, high weight), means that after refusion the muscle cell will have more myofibrils, the basic element of a muscle cell that causes contraction. The thing is, myofibrils aren't really big, and your muscle can increase their concentration without changing in size much.</p>
<p>Testing muscular endurance, draining the reserves of the muscle cell itself (high reps low weight, high time under tension), means the new cell with have additional sarcoplasm (sarco = muscle; plasm = goo; cytoplasm is the generic name for cell goo). Sarcoplasm is filled with stuff that exists to maintain the cell and keep the myofibrils supplied and repaired. But it's mostly water, so double the sarcoplasm means double the muscle fiber size.</p>
<p>Note that if you go another step out—conditioning, stamina/endurance training, cardio, whatever you wanna call it—the muscular endurance itself is no longer being tested, but only the rate that the body can resupply the muscle, so you get better heart and lung health, and denser capillary beds in the muscle itself.</p>
<p>Power training is a mild outlier, though only compared to people that don't generally do strength training anyways. There's a certain minimum amount of sarcoplasm your body needs to do the extremely high energy rate required of stuff like Olympic lifting.</p>
<p>edit: Oh, I almost forgot my final note, which is that while this has been generally accepted fact for quite some time, and reinforced by various studies, there's been a recent meta-study that found other studies that showed &quot;high reps low weight&quot; did not produce significantly more muscle mass increase than &quot;low reps high weight&quot;. I wouldn't completely accept its conclusion yet, but it's easy to understand how confusion could persist in the sports science and physique competition community (in either direction). There are many confusing factors. Individual differences (some people just are genetic miracles); different methods and goals between the body building, power lifting, olympic lifting, and other sport training communities; the <em>incredible</em> proliferation of nonsense from laypeople and pretend-expert magazine writers; the beginner effect (almost literally anything with weights, the dumbest shit imaginable, will work beautifully for anybody... for about six to twelve months); performance enhancing drugs, pressures to lie about them... the list goes on.</p>
<p>edit2: Another point of confusion is that there's no such thing as pure strength lifting or pure hypertrophy lifting. If you're lifting to the point where repair (and thus adaptation) is required, both will be improved, just one more than the other based on the type.</p>
<p>edit3: /u/arcflash90 pointed out it's not blastocyte (which is a word I guess I made up). It's a kind of muscle stem cell called a myosatellite cell.</p>
<p>edit4: I'm getting a lot of complaints like /u/Evil-Imp's &quot;I just read this to my 5 year old, and now he's crying.&quot; Sorry it's a bad habit of mine. In the engineering spirit of not reduplicating work, I'm going to steal /u/Almae's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4z1xls/eli5why_does_working_a_muscle_to_exhaustion_with/d6sl2qr" target="_blank">great breakdown</a> (please upvote them if you like it):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Training for power repairs muscles similar to adding more cylinders to the engine block of your car.<br />
Training for muscular endurance is akin to making your gas tank bigger<br />
Training for stamina is akin to building more gas stations along your route.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess it maybe needs something like... muscle engine cylinders are small so you can pack them in tightly, which means muscle don't grow?</p>
<p>edit5: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4z1xls/eli5why_does_working_a_muscle_to_exhaustion_with/d6sg3no" target="_blank">an even better metaphor</a> (with midgets!) by /u/ElbowStrike</p>
<p>edit7 ^(had a few people ask so) <strong>TL;DR</strong>:<br />
few reps per set (1–7ish) = stronger muscles<br />
lots of reps per set (like 8–20)  = bigger muscles<br />
<em>You always lift as much weight as you can handle for that number of reps!</em> High reps just means the weight has to be lower, high reps low weight isn't the same as actually going <em>light</em>.<br />
More than 20 reps affects muscles relatively little (some, but not much); it's primarily a cardio work out at that point. Your muscles might get sore from lactic acid, but it's not really the muscle itself that's being taxed, so they won't grow (at least not much).<br />
A lot of exercise programming confusion is because weight training for intermediate lifters is totally different than it is for beginners; which is why advice aimed at people lifting for years is confusing for a beginner.<br />
And one of the most common reasons for a beginners muscles to stop growing is because they need to eat more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
