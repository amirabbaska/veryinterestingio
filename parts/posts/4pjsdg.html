		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not really a new theory, more like an observation that gives some credence to an old dark matter hypothesis. It will take a lot more research and evidence to make it to the status of theory. </p>
<p>So the <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160615" target="_blank">LIGO</a> project at Caltech detected gravitational waves for the second time. </p>
<p>It turns out that these particular G waves appear to have been generated by a merger of two black holes. These black holes are really big - bigger than your typical black hole formed when a huge star collapses, but not big enough to be the supermassive type of black hole that lies in the center of galaxies. </p>
<p>This particular size of black hole falls right in the range of a hypothesized third type called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_black_hole" target="_blank">Primordial Black Hole</a>. They are thought to have formed right at the birth of the universe as massive gas clouds collapsed.</p>
<p>Now the cool thing is, these black holes also fall right into the expected mass range of dark matter. Up to now the most popular candidate for dark matter was particles called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particles" target="_blank">WIMPs</a> or weakly interacting massive particles. But no matter how hard we've looked for wimps we've not found any. It's <em>possible</em> that the extra mass in the universe isn't in the form of wimps at all, but instead in the form of primordial black holes. The fact LIGO just apparently detected primordial black holes now gives them as much, if not more, credence than wimps as the candidate for dark matter.</p>
<p>This is really exciting because if we can crack what dark matter really is, it will probably be a guidepost towards solving other huge mysteries in physics, such as how gravity is related to quantum field theory, why the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, and even how the universe got started in the first place. </p>
<p>Edit: well this blew up overnight bigger than I ever expected! I want to be very clear that I'm <em>not</em> a physicist or in any way professionally affiliated with LIGO. I'm just an armchair science fan/amateur astronomer who enjoys this stuff. A lot of the questions in response to this are outside the scope of my knowledge, I'll do my best to answer those that I can but please understand that my responses may need additional verification before you accept them as fact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the early 20th century, when telescopes finally got powerful enough for us to see that there was more out there than just our own galaxy, they quickly realized that all the &quot;stuff&quot; we could see didn't have enough mass to explain the motions of galaxies.  Since we couldn't see it, they called it &quot;Dark Matter&quot;.</p>
<p>They looked around for all the stuff they figured we could not see if it was really far away - asteroids, stellar remnants, gas clouds, etc.  For those hard to see things, if they did make up all of this &quot;Dark Matter&quot;, there would be so much of it scattered around that we would see a lot more of it in our neighborhood - like way more asteroids and comets and such.  Since we don't see that locally, they were stumped.  When they did the maths, it turned out that about 5/6 of all the matter that should be out there was made up of stuff we just couldn't see - thus, &quot;dark matter&quot;.</p>
<p>New thoughts emerged all the time to explain it.  Stephen Hawking, way back in 1971, proposed that in the very earliest period of the universe, when it was seconds old, a lot of the gas collapsed into black holes.  These generally were in the middle range when it came to size - bigger than a stellar black hole, but smaller than a galaxy anchoring super-massive black hole.  It was not a popular theory because it didn't fit the maths real good.  But, it was always a nagging suspicion.  Better maths said it must be WIMPs or MACHOs or something new and exotic.  So, that's what everyone looked for.</p>
<p>Now, a particular part of Hawking's idea was that based on the how these middling black holes must be spaced around the universe, they should merge once in a while.  As a matter of fact, the rate at which they merged fell into a pretty specific range of time.</p>
<p>It just so happens that LIGO is detecting gravitational waves that would be produced by such mergers right in the range of Hawking's idea.  So, everyone is like, hey, wait a second, maybe we should look at this, since it is quite the coincidence.</p>
<p>There is no good, solid, &quot;a ha!&quot; evidence either way right now.  There is just a good reason to check out an old idea by the most expert of experts on black holes - Stephen Hawking.</p>
<p>It still might be WIMPs, but we can't find them no matter where or how we look, which is getting annoying and disheartening.  It could be some other weird thing too, but there are no maths around that lead us to better ideas.  It could be these Primordial Black Holes, but other experiments and some maths that cast doubt on their very existence.  Although, those are inconclusive too, since it was a lack of evidence, rather than a solid refutation.</p>
<p>So, it might maybe be that good old Stephen was right about these primordial black hole things, since there is a piece of real data that supports his maths, but one piece of data is just a decent reason to take a look, since all other paths to the maths have proved fruitless so far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The new theory essentially is that there are FAR more black holes than we thought and they are evenly distributed throughout the universe. </p>
<p>Dark matter is just a variable in an equation. It could be a number of things including a roughly equal dispersion of black holes, or maybe far more neutrinos than we think there are. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: Small black holes are hard to see with a telescope but they have a lot of gravity.</p>
<p>A bunch of small black holes evenly laid out across space explains the missing &quot;dark&quot; matter really well.</p>
<p>The recent gravitational wave study was possibly able to detect all of those small black holes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
