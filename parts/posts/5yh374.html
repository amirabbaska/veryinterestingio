		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Fresh</em> water is densest at 4C.</p>
<p>As one increases salt content, the temperature of maximum density lowers, and <a href="http://sam.ucsd.edu/sio210/gifimages/rho_lows.gif" target="_blank">at salinity 24.7 PSU the temperature of maximum density equals the freezing point.</a>.</p>
<p>The water at the bottom of the ocean is cold, often below 4C.  This is mainly due to the fact the the ocean is cooled from the surface.  When ice begins to form it excludes the salt, so the surrounding water becomes more dense, sinks, and stops cooling.  This is one way deep ocean water forms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually water 4 degrees is the maximum density of water at 1 atm of pressure, further down in the ocean the pressure is higher <a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/fluid-density-temperature-pressure-d_309.html" target="_blank">so the temperature of maximum density decreases</a> and the freezing point drops (which is unusual).  Also the salt concentration affects this as well.</p>
<p>While the fact that water is densest at this temperature has some effect on the temperature at equilibrium, the temperature is determined by many factors.  <a href="http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Water/images/sm_temperature_depth.jpg" target="_blank">The temperature drops the further in the ocean you go</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While salinity in the ocean complicates things, in many lakes this is the case - the bottom water stays at roughly 4 degrees C.  But for deep lakes, pressure effects can become important, which change the temperature of maximum density - very roughly this is a 0.1 degrees change per 100 m depth so a 500 m deep lake has bottom water closer to 3.5 degrees C.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
