		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quite possibly, yes, if the insect is a member of a colony, then being whisked away may result in a futile search for home and eventual starvation or death by predation, misadventure, etc. </p>
<p>In some specific species, something like an ant might be accepted at a different colony than that of its birth, but in other circumstances, they'd not be recognized and seen as another threat to remove.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This really depends on the insect. In north America for example, there is very little genetic diversity, so generally Argentinian ants are accepted by other colonies. From memory there are about 4 super colonies that span most of the territory the US. So generally good chance of stumbling a friendly colony.</p>
<p>Lost honey bees might join a different colony by bribing the guards with some nector.

<p>Others it's highly species dependent. So there isn't a universal answer</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time the bee will die or find another hive. Bees, especially bees that collect pollen and nectar are more likely to find another hive and be accepted into the fold. Ants are the same way as far as I know, wasps and such however are more independent, so I'm uncertain what they would do. They might be fine on their own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some bees are known to bribe their way into other colonies with gifts. Usually after getting drunk one to many times knowing that if it's caught this time it's death. This is real by the way. not some abstract joke.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
