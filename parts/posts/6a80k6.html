		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can only try and explain from the Grammy point of view as a voting member there. Basically voting for the Grammys becomes more of a political manner in the industry than simply voting for the &quot;best&quot; record in each category.</p>
<p>The way the voting process works for the Grammys is that there are these sub-committees for each and every category. I have no idea how someone gets onto one of these sub-committees but the people on them don't seem to change much. Every year these committees convene and decide which albums out of the hundreds in each category get nominated. Then around fall of each year the rest of the voting members get sent a packet and we're allowed to cast our vote for the nominees in 5 (I think?) categories - to seemingly keep everyone from voting on every category that they couldn't have an opinion in. (Like I probably shouldn't vote for best &quot;world music&quot; album since I have no idea who any of the artists are there) As a side note everyone gets a free vote for some popular categories like artist of the year, album of the year, etc. </p>
<p>Because of these subcommittees whittling down the voting pool, by the time the vast majority of the academy gets to vote on the winners - the most &quot;popular&quot; artists seem to be the only choices. I think it's due to the fact that the sub-committees don't change very often and so the members on them try and pick the nominees not based on what's best but who they know who worked on the albums. It's definitely an odd way to vote and I'm not sure if the oscars are any different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason is that there are far fewer movies made than albums.  There are around 100,000 albums released per year, while Hollywood makes something on the order of 700 movies per year.  (Given, there are more movies than just Hollywood, but that's the bulk, at least of what would be considered for Oscar nomination.)</p>
<p>It's reasonably easy to narrow down 700 to the few that are truly excellent, especially when you're ignoring stuff that was never intended to be excellent in the way that an Oscar category is looking for.  It's even vaguely possible, if unlikely, to watch every single one of those movies.  And it's reasonably easy to come to a consensus about those movies.</p>
<p>If you have 100,000 albums, that's way more music than can be listened to over the course of a year.  (Assuming an average of 45 minutes per album, that would be over eight years of constant music.)  At that level, you have to find things that are already being promoted external to the voting system to come to any sort of consensus.</p>
<p>This is not intended to contradict /u/Carbonm8's answer.  It's just another aspect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Years ago, my company moved to a new location, and I was tasked to order a snack and beverage machine.</p>
<p>Due diligence, I sent out a companywide survey, asking what they wanted for sale in this machine.</p>
<p>THe overwhelming answer included juices, healthy snacks, low fat/carbs, etc.</p>
<p>I dutifully and proudly prepared a list of all the healthy items our smart employees had requested and presented it to the guy installing the machine. He smiled, gently.</p>
<p>&quot;They're all like this, every poll I've ever seen, but the truth is they say they want the healthy items, but everyone's really buying the Coke and Cheetos...&quot;</p>
<p>As the <em>vox populi</em> had spoken, I resolved to put this to empirical test, although the vendor's words had a definite ring of truth.</p>
<p>A month later, the healthy snacks and beverages so popular in the survey were unsold, while the sodas and fatty snacks were all gone.</p>
<p>The point, I guess: people say they &quot;love&quot; opera, when they just really love &quot;Con Te Partiro&quot; sung by Andrea Bocelli, or maybe Pavarotti's last <em>insane</em> performance of Nessum Dorma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My take is that Oscars have a lot more prestige as an award whereas most musical artists have more prestige than the Grammies themselves. </p>
<p>As such the Oscars will get ratings regardless of who wins, but the Grammies rely on the popularity of the awardees to get ratings. </p>
<p>Like, an Oscar winning director has pretty much automatically 'made it' and is going to have a certain level of respect for the rest of their career. Christopher Cross won five grammies for his debut album, and is now so obscure his new albums don't even get their own wikipedia page. Can you imagine a director getting five oscars for their debut movie ever releasing anything that didn't have a wikipedia page?</p>
<p>As a sidenote Cross also won one Oscar for writing the theme song to Arthur, and most people probably know the tune (or at the very least are aware of the movie).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is my contrarian view: very often they do not favor artistic movies. This year's win is a pretty big deviation from the norm. </p>
<p>Traditionally, bigger budget films with mass appeal are the ones to be nominated and to win. Going farther back, think of &quot;It Happened One Night.&quot; From the 1990s: Forrest Gump, Braveheart, Titanic, Shakespeare in Love, Gladiator. </p>
<p>Starting in the 2000s, the Academy broadened its voting membership to include a lot of people less directly tied to the major studios, and so now the films are more diverse. Typically there is a 50/50 mix of more independent fare and well-received mainstream film. Even films like Argo and 12 Years a Slave had decent budgets. </p>
<p>I'm not saying these are bad films -- not at all. But they wouldn't be considered particularly outside of the mainstream by serious film buffs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
