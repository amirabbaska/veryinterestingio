		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It mostly boils down to cost.<br />
Natural fruit juice is expensive and usually does not have a long shelf life (longer shelf life is usually a good thing because it leads to less waste and more important less write-offs (a write-off meaning a product has reached the sell-by date and now either has to be 'sold' for free or thrown away, depending on laws and store policy).<br />
Even if they have high amounts of actual juice it's often concentrated apple juice because apple juice is relatively cheap (especially if it's from concentrated juice) and it also has a quite neutral taste so it doesn't overtake the other fruits in taste.<br />
This way they can legally claim &quot;80% real fruit juice&quot; even though 95% of that is apple juice and only 5% is the actual fruit they are marketing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's marketing. All marketing. Some here have said cost but if it was done <em>exclusively</em> for cost, said juice would not even be in there. HFCS and sugar was way cheaper on a <em>solids</em> basis.</p>
<p>As far as the other ingredients in there, some ingredients (ascorbic acid (vitamin C), sucralose, cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) are effective at very low doses (think milligrams &amp; micrograms worth).</p>
<p>If you're drinking tea that you've purchased, there's a good chance that there is only a small amount of &quot;spray dried&quot; tea in there and caramel color added.</p>
<p>Drink water. (not alkaline water... more marketing).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly a case of cost savings and the public being used to it. In Germany, for example, you can get a drink called Apfelschorle, which is half soda water and half apple juice. For example, <a href="http://das-ist-drin.de/ja-Apfelschorle-0-5-l--429106/" target="_blank">this</a> brand uses a mixture of 57% apple juice, 3% lemon juice, 40% soda water and some extra apple flavouring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Natural juice is expensive compared to just high fructose corn syrup or powdered asorbic acid.   You're not thinking in bulk.   A difference of even 1 cent per bottle multiplied by 6.5 billion  bottles of Coca-Cola sold annually makes a big difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other issue that hasn't been mentioned is seasonality. Sure, juice can be stored and packaged year round (orange juice is one of the most &quot;processed&quot; foods, not matter how much branding goes into making it seem like it was picked yesterday), but the fruit is only harvested in certain months of the year, and every harvest produces juice with different acid and sugar levels that have to be adjusted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
