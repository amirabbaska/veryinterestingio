		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that you've gotten some great answers so far, but I wanted to give you a bit of the calculus explanation and how beautiful this question really is. If you don't have a calculus background, don't worry, I'll try to explain this intuitively.</p>
<p>Generally, we think of <strong>velocity</strong> (speed with a direction component) as how far we've gone in a given amount of time, change in x divided by change in t, if x is how far we travel, and t is how long it took us to travel that distance.</p>
<p>So if I travel x = 10km in t=2 hr, 10/2 = 5km/hr, and that would be my velocity.</p>
<p>But here we're focusing on velocity at an instant. <strong>Velocity at any instant</strong> is actually defined to be the instantaneous change in position, which we can denote with dx, divided by the instantaneous change in time, which can be denoted with dt. This is where the calculus comes in. It's just describing what your velocity is at any instant in time, kinda like the speedometer on your car shows you at a certain moment how fast you're traveling. This is actually called a derivative in calculus.</p>
<p>We can then set up a differential equation which describes your motion. This is an equation that can relate a rate of change in a quantity with the actual quantity.</p>
<p>Velocity at any point in time = (how far I am from my destination at any point in time)</p>
<p>If we start at 0m, at any distance x we've traveled, how far I am from the destination is just 100-x. For example, at x=25km from where you started, you are moving at 75km/hr. And our instantaneous velocity at any time is just dx/dt, as I explained above.</p>
<p>So we can write this as:</p>
<p>dx/dt = 100-x</p>
<p>This is our differential equation, and I'm not going to get into how to solve it, but I'll tell you that the solution in this particular example is:</p>
<p>x(t)=-100e^(-t)+100</p>
<p>&quot;e&quot; is Euler's number, around 2.71828. </p>
<p>x(.632) is 50m, so you'd be halfway there in .693 hours, or about 42 minutes. If you plug in t=10 hours, for example, </p>
<p>x(10) = -100e^-(10) + 100</p>
<p>which, if you calculate, is about 99.995m to our destination after traveling for 10 hours.</p>
<p>As t gets infinitely large (as an infinite amount of time passes), x(t) gets extremely close to 100km, but never reaches it, and so it's consistent with the other explanations. But if you're curious what the graph of position vs. time looks like, check <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/h1icybh65l" target="_blank">this</a> out.</p>
<p>Bonus: if you're still curious about this, /u/3blue1brown is going to release an &quot;essence of calculus&quot; series on YouTube soon. He explains all this super well and how beautiful all this is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Question. Are you constantly decreasing every second along the way? So at 93km you are going 93km/h? Or, are you doing this in legs of every 10km. So, from 100km to 90km are you going 100km/h that entire 10km leg?</p>
<p>That would be two entirely different answers. Your question is a bit vague on which is the case.</p>
<p>If you are decreasing at a constant rate, like the others replied, then you wouldn't get there. If you are only decreasing every 10 km, then it's a simple stair step function.</p>
<p>It's just a sum of hours traveled during each 10 km leg of the journey.</p>
<p>100 km away, the first 10 km takes 0.1 hours. The next 10 km you're going 90 km/h and that takes 0.111 (repeating) hours.</p>
<p>Then each leg after is: 0.125, 0.142857143, 0.166666667, 0.2, 0.25, 0.333333333, 0.5. And the final leg you are going 10 km/h for 10 km. So that leg takes an hour.</p>
<p>Total sum: 2.93 hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Never. You can think of it like this, since you're constantly changing your speed, your destination is constantly 1 hour away. If it is one hour away, then you can't be there, so you can never get there.</p>
<p>More precisely, if v is your current speed, and d is the distance from your destination, then d/v is the time remaining if you continue at your current speed. In general, d/v is a function of time. Our velocity v depends on the distance d as v(d)=cd, where c=1/1hour. This means that d/v = 1/c=1 hour, and this is constant, fixed at one hour regardless of how far away you are from the destination. So you will never get there.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/66wqc9/if_my_speed_is_100_kmh_and_my_destination_is_100/dgly57q/?st=j1tvjnwx&amp;sh=3d9ec46c" target="_blank">OP remarked that he meant it to change continuously, not every 10km</a>. If you did change it every 10km, it would take 1/10+1/9+1/8+1/7+1/6+1/5+1/4+1/3+1/2+1 hours to get to the destination, which is ~2.93hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on if the steps are continuous or discrete.  If you are changing your speed every 10km, you'll arrive in around 3 hours.  If you CONSTANTLY are decelerating based on the distance away, you will never arrive at the end because your distance remaining gets infinitely close to, but never exactly, zero.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
