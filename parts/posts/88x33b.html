Often there are added herbs such as saw palmetto in mens for prostate support, etc. Women dont have a prostate, and their products often contain additions such as cranberry for UT health</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I develop multi vitamin and mineral tablets. I tend to leave iron out of men's tablets but that is about it.</p>
<p>Women lose iron from menstruation. Haemachromatosis (abnormal iron levels) is more common in men.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I sell vitamins and you don't start to see major differences until you get Into the men and womens age specific vitamins (e.g. 45/50+) which is generally where companies start to include added prostate support for men and menopausal support for women. There are a few other differences but honestly they are quite negibile and there is no harm in taking a women's multivitamin if you are a man and vice versa as long as you check the label. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
