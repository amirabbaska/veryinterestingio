		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, I don't think there is a ELI5 version of this but I'll try my best. In short: There's you (your self). And then there's everything else that comes from you, but that you don't feel like is you (your shadow self).</p>
<p>We can imagine a person with tourettes syndrome. The words they shout when they have their ticks are not voluntary. So for the person with tourettes, the actions resulting from ticks don't feel like their own.</p>
<p>But obviously those actions do, in fact, come from the person with tourettes because, well, who else would be shouting those words? The answer, in short, is the shadow self. This gives us a basis of understanding the difference between self and shadow self. </p>
<p>Since there is no way definitive way to tell from an outside perspective which actions are come from the self and which actions come from the shadow self, the only way we can tell the difference is what it feels like to us. When we do an action and think &quot;Yes that's me!&quot; We can call that action as arising from our self. But when we do an action and think &quot;Well, that mistake was just because I was tired&quot; (or something like that). We can call that action as arising from our shadow self.</p>
<p>But more importantly, there are things like greed, for example, which exist in the background of our minds. To one degree or another, our greed is a factor in all of our decisions and actions. But it isn't until we do something that's totally greedy that we can think &quot;I don't know what came over me.&quot; That's the shadow self. </p>
<p>The whole point of making this distinction between self and shadow self is to say that you, fundamentally, are both the self and the shadow self. Like the person with tourettes, there really is no other person inside your mind causing you to do things. Once we recognize that the self-that-we-want-to-be and the self-that-we-don't-want-to-be are the two parts of our whole, then we can begin to get ourselves in order enough to make the shadow self disappear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is difficult to ELI5 but I can try.<br />
Carl Jung believed in the alchemical concept that a thing divided was an incomplete thing.<br />
In other words, the only way to be a “complete“ and healthy person was to recognize your entire self, both the good and the bad.</p>
<p>Your Shadow is composed of the negative qualities about yourself you may not necessarily want to associate with yourself, but are a part of you nonetheless.<br />
(Or, more accurately, your Shadow is the inverse of what you believe to be your “true” self.)</p>
<p>Every person has these natural and animalistic aspects of ourselves inside; this sort of raw creative or destructive energy that opposes our ordered and structured view of ourselves.<br />
The antagonist to our own protagonist.</p>
<p>The Shadow is the culmination of the unconscious aspects of your personality which your conscious ego does not identify in itself.<br />
Because people tend to reject the least desirable aspects of their personality, the Shadow is usually largely negative. There are, however, positive aspects that may also remain hidden in the Shadow.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Even if you’re not normally a greedy person, and strive to be selfless, you still possess greed.<br />
That greed is part of your Shadow.<br />
The key here is not saying; <em>”I’m not greedy,”</em> because that’s a lie, but rather accepting that you have greed and striving to overcome it.<br />
Accepting your Shadow as a part of yourself rather than repressing it, because repressing aspects of the self is detrimental to the health of your true self.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you are normally a greedy person, and you perceive that to be your true self, the side of you that is selfless and generous is part of your Shadow.<br />
It’s not necessarily objectively negative qualities, but rather qualities that you perceive to be negative, and antagonistic to your true self, that you don’t want to associate with yourself, and thus repress.</p>
<p>In order to have a complete and healthy “self“ you have to acknowledge your Shadow, and come to peace with it, rather than hide from it or push it into the back of your mind.<br />
Because the reality is, you can never escape your own Shadow. It’s always behind you.</p>
<p><em>”Knowing your Shadow can greatly help you, but be ready to see what you’d rather not be.&quot;</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An instructor of mine once used this poem to help explain the concept:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51759/i-am-not-i" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51759/i-am-not-i" target="_blank">https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51759/i-am-not-i</a></a></p>

<p>The shadow self isn't bad necessarily. It is the inverse of you.  It compliments you.  Most importantly, it is part of what makes you a complete person.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The shadow of a noble generous king might be a scheming selfish tyrant. But, the king needs his selfishness in order to put his subjects above others, and he needs his guile in order to navigate hostile political environments.  Those elements live in shadow because they don't govern the king, he doesn't choose to live fully in those impulses. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Importantly, a selfish tyrant likely has a generous king living in his shadow. I recommend watching Disney's Robin Hood with that in mind.  Prince John and King Richard are embodiments of each other's shadow. Other popular pairs include Data and Lore [Star Trek TNG], Edmund and Edgar [King Lear], or Sasuke and Naruto [Naruto]. If you ever had the thought, &quot;if I could combine those two characters into one character then they would be a complete and fully actualized person and all their problems would be solved,&quot; then you've found a shadow pair.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>To find your shadow a therapist can be very helpful. I've done some cognitive behavioral work that is very well suited to exploring the question, &quot;how would I behave if...?&quot; which is a great path to the shadow. In a more physical sense, Viewpoints is a theatre technique that is useful for revisiting scenarios from complimentary or inverse perspectives.</p>
<p>Your shadow is you. Just not you. :) </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was a core concept in a sci-fi/fantasy class I took in college, in which we looked at novels and films as collective dreams of society’s subconscious, analyzing them through a Jungian lens. </p>
<p>As part of it, we read Man and His Symbols. My understanding of the shadow is that it consists of all the behavioral and thought patterns you have which cause your life distress and prohibit you from achieving your “bliss,” as Jung called it. </p>
<p>Examples may include a tendency to deflect when people criticize you, fear of social situations, a refusal to get yourself enough sleep at night, etc. It could really be anything at all about yourself which causes you problems. </p>
<p>Jung talked about how we don’t need to vanquish our shadow, we simply need to “come to terms” with it. We need to understand our tendencies so that we may counterbalance them or, better yet, turn them into strengths. (Maybe you learn to manage your fear of social situations, write a book about it, and help others do the same—and make some money out of it.)</p>
<p>Recognizing your shadow is about seriously looking at your own role in moments where you are feeling distress, particularly ones that are repeated, since the shadow itself will continually and repeatedly be acting. Then it’s about pinpointing your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that are always in contribution to those negative experiences. </p>
<p>It’s really just being open and honest with yourself about your imperfect nature, and then recognizing patterns you tend to follow that aren’t so good for you. (A lot of people have a hard time with that first part, as we are all well aware.)</p>
<p>Edit: Also, when you’re repeatedly having the same issue, that’s a dead giveaway that you’re shadow is at the center of the problem. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jung was extremely interested in alchemy, a major theme of which is &quot;uniting opposites&quot; - or, more poetically, the marriage of heaven and hell. The idea is that a thing divided is an incomplete thing. You cannot be a wholly integrated person without first acknowledging and understanding your negative aspects. That's probably an ELI15 and not ELI5....</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
