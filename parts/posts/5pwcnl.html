		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am just curious as to why it is so cheap to fly in Europe. It seems like a person who makes a middle class income can go country hopping every weekend with the costs associated.</p>
<p><strong>edit1:</strong> The distances are wrong (1500km vs 1200km). Now that I have double checked. 2500 was a typo, I meant to type 1500km. As for New York and Atlanta I wrote miles instead of KM, should be 1200km!</p>
<p><strong>edit2:</strong> Turns out you can fly for even cheaper form London to Italy, some people estimate its $15-$30!!!!!!!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is actually <em>really</em> neat! In addition to overhead costs in the US being generally higher, airlines in Europe (due to the way the EU handles borders) are generally cheaper.<br />
Airlines which are based in a country generally have to pay different fees to different countries for air-traffic-control services, so as a result the first instinct is to think that London to Italy would cost <em>more</em>. But, the EU treats airlines from all member countries as domestic.<br />
This helps <em>immensely</em> without travel costs because it expands the negotiating powers of budget airlines in member countries.<br />
But, since both flights you mentioned are treated as domestic that's not a factor in the answer.</p>
<hr />
<p>Given the lack of information on airlines and airports, I'm going to assume you're talking about RyanAir in the UK taking off out of Stansted and flying to Pisa. RyanAir has extremely low overhead costs relative to other airlines simply based on their purchasing and employment choices, however they use a secret weapon for budget flights: using smaller, more remote airports.<br />
Stansted is a small airport about a 40 minute train ride outside of London, so RyanAir is able to negotiate much more favorable prices in take off and landing fees simply by bringing business to the airport. And while Pisa is a larger airport, they're able to offer cheaper prices by keeping the runways in use during slow times of day.<br />
If you'd like more information on budget airlines, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=069y1MpOkQY" target="_blank">[this video]</a>.  </p>
<hr />
<p>So, why doesn't this work in the US? Increased costs following 9/11 have been cited, and this is true... But it's not the whole story. Budget airlines in the US have rarely been successful. <del>, and lately they're being executed incorrectly. Many of the current &quot;budget&quot; airlines in the US are subsidiaries of larger airlines, which means that their costs/profit margins are supposed to be high... But their big-ticket airline managers are executing the budgeting and negotiating incorrectly.</del> Additionally, there are simply fewer cheap airports in the US.<br />
In the end, US-based budget airlines just don't have the playing field to run well <del>and aren't executed properly.</del>  </p>
<hr />
<p>Update: apparently my information about airline-within-an-airline schemes was dated, so I've struck it out of the answer.<br />
Update2: People are asking about Brexit in relation to air travel. I don't really know much about how this will affect air travel between the UK and the EU, but air travel between other EU states and between EU states and international destinations shouldn't change much. From the US to EU states, there are many airports in Ireland that can be used instead of UK airports so those costs likely won't change by much after Brexit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The price you've quoted for the London to Italy flight comes with several strings attached - flying from smaller airports outside the city (airlines save on airport tax), weird takeoff and landing times (again, to save on taxes by utilizing undesirable times). </p>
<p>Also, the price quoted is pretty much $2-$3 for the actual ticket itself + taxes. The airline is not making any money on you (yet!). Real income comes with all the additions you need - check in at the airport (fee), print a boarding pass at the airport (fee), take a carry on with you (fee), check in a bag (fee), choosing your own seat (fee), drinks (fee), snacks (fee), etc. </p>
<p>Buying a ticket on a major airline to fly between to major cities comes with its perks. All 3 airports in NYC (JFK, LGA and EWR) and the airport in Atlanta (ATL) are all Delta hubs (3rd largest airline in the world). Hub to hub flying is always a little more expensive, not to mention direct flying. Hub to hub because anywhere from 40% to 99% of the flight could he connecting (I work for Delta, worked a flight a few days ago from Salt Lake city to Atlanta with 99% of the people connecting), mostly international; airlines like to keep these flights for people who are going onwards or are willing to pay extra. Direct because it's a luxury getting to your destination quicker, and luxuries often come with a surcharge. Now, if you were to go on the same route but were to do LGA to DCA to ATL, your ticket would be cheaper because you're not taking a valuable seat on a direct flight, and don't kind getting to your destination in 5 hours rather than 3.</p>
<p>And, flying on big name airlines also come with added benefits. On international flights, they almost always serve free meals. On long haul international flights with Delta, even booze is free. Also, flying with a major airline comes with their name, and what it stands for. Delta prides itself on being the #1 on time airline in the US, and also the airline with the fewest cancelations. If you're an occasional flyer, this won't matter to you that much. But if you're a business traveller, then an airline can use this title to capture your business travel needs because it's offering you something no other could. That gives the airlines the right to jack up prices even further. </p>
<p>tl;dr budget airlines can offer cheap tickets, but they come with many inconveniences. Major airlines charge more, but comes with more peace of mind. Flying hub to hub is expensive because of mostly connections. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean $70 for a budget airline like RyanAir? A fair comparison would be Frontier Airlines, who offers round-trip flights from LGA (NY) to ATL frequently at $60 roundtrip. I've similarly gone from Philadelphia to St. Augustine (880miles), Minneapolis (1,172miles), and Raeligh (471miles) for $30-$60 through Frontier.</p>
<p>ELI5: you're comparing a budget airline to major US carriers. There's often a discrepancy, but I've taken similarly expensive flights in the EU. Budget prices exist in the US, but people often complain about amenities being taken away despite seeking lower fares.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just came home from London with my fiancee last weekend. Travelling costs were(for each person):</p>
<p>40 minutes drive to Basel Airport from Freiburg via shuttle bus: 20 Euros</p>
<p>Flight to London Stansted, with priority boarding, no checked bags: 27 Euros</p>
<p>40 minutes drive from airport to King's X via bus: 12 pounds</p>
<p>Return bus to Stansted: 12 pounds</p>
<p>Flight back home: no idea, the 27 euros for the flight to London covered the flight back home as well.</p>
<p>Bus back home to Freiburg from Basel: 20 Euros</p>
<p>So the flight two ways was cheaper than transportation to the airports EACH. Weird world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I want to know is why it costs $900 to fly from Toronto to Vancouver, and only $300 to fly from Toronto to London, Heathrow on Air Canada. I understand costs are higher in Canada but it is the same airline, they use more fuel going to London, so where is the money going?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
