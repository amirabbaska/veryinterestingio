		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean last longer? That you can smell it for longer? I would suppose it doesn't last longer and any perception of that is created by the fact that most other places are covered with clothing or it is caused by proximity to our noses. It's easier to catch whiffs of our own wrists and neck than our stomachs and ankles. As far as other responders referring to &quot;pulse points&quot; I'd direct them to <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/greatist.com/live/perfume-wrong-places/amp" target="_blank">this article</a> in hopes of stopping the further spread of misinformation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been collecting colognes for the last 5 years or so and actually found it lasts quite a while if worn in your hair too. Mixes with your natural scent and oils in your hair. I only notice it “lasting” on my neck when my body temperature rises, but we usually stop smelling our own scent due to olfactory fatigue. Probably doesn’t answer your question as much as a
