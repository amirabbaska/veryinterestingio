		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crystal shape is defined by the packing of the individual atoms/molecules that make up the substance the crystal is made of. Ice is made up of the packing of water molecules, rock salt is technically called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halite" target="_blank">halite</a> and is the results of close packing of sodium and chloride ions.</p>
<p>In the packing structure of halite the sodium and chloride ions sit in a three dimensional grid. In this grid each chloride is surrounded by six sodiums and each sodium is surrounded by six chlorides. This is what is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_crystal_system#Rock-salt_structure" target="_blank">cubic crystal system</a> and is what determines the shape of the crystal when it grows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you really have two separate questions here:  why are salt crystals cubic, and why did my scenario result in fewer, macroscopically large crystals vs a flatter layer of many more finer crystals? </p>
<p>I'll answer the latter question and leave the first one to someone else.  Crystallization from solution entails a competition between the nucleation of new crystals and growth on existing crystals (along with other processes).  The rate of these processes depends on the supersaturation of the solution in different ways.  (Approximately speaking) high supersaturation favors nucleation and lower supersaturation favors growth.   Slow evaporation results in low supersaturation.  Thus, growth dominates and  there are fewer and larger crystals instead of the many small crystals you'd expect if there was more nucleation.</p>
<p>Slow evaporation is a common technique for scientists that are trying to grow large crystals, e.g. for crystallographic characterization. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As u/gmsteel has mentioned, the lattice structure determines how the individual ions pack together in the crystal. The reason why large, almost perfect cubes are formed has to do with the rates of ions depositing on the surface of the growing crystal.</p>
<p>Imagine the surface of the cube - for simplicity sake, there are at least three different environments: the faces, the edges and the vertices. Since the ions that deposit onto the side will have maximum attraction to the ions of the opposite charge already on the crystal surface, crystals tend to grow larger by deposition on the faces. Since each face grows at approximately the same rate, the crystal ends up being a macroscopic manifestation of its microscopic lattice structure (cubic). That's why minerals are often formed in distinct shapes (think quartz, fluorite, pyrite etc.) that are determined by their lattice structure.</p>
<p>The deposition at the faces is only selective if there is enough time for crystals to slowly form and that the environment remains undisturbed. You leaving for a vacation and allowing the bottle to slowly evaporate without any disturbance is the perfect set of conditions for crystal growth. In chemistry it is one of few ways to grow large single crystals (slow evaporation). The reason is that the ions, before being permanently attached to the growing crystal, tends to reversibly &quot;try&quot; different locations (faces, edges, vertices... faces!) until it settles on the perfect one (equilibrium). If the crystal-growing conditions are too extreme (e.g. supersaturated solution, vibrations, excessive heat to drive evaporation of solvent / cold to decrease solubility), then the ions will have no time to find the perfect positions and very tiny, sometimes non-uniform solids will form, and their structures will be far less ordered. </p>
