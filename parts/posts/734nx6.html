		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's lots of reasons and many of them have been mentioned here, but in English class, you should at some point discuss how in plays, movies, and books villains often have some sort of defect.  This serves several purposes.</p>
<p>1) It identifies them as bad.  Cursed by god, outcast of society, or simply unsavory.  People can't be a traditional hero if they limp, lose an eye, or have a handicap, they're no longer perfect at that point.</p>
<p>2) It places them below the hero - comparatively in underlying social structures.  We as society generally want healthy, beautiful people to succeed, and you can see this in all aspects of society.  We buy more from beautiful sales people, we promote young, healthy people more often and earlier than out of shape, older counterparts of equivalent skill, we let beautiful people cheat social structures like standing in line or deadlines on classwork etc. just enough to help them succeed a bit more than those who aren't as notably good looking.  The important part here is that you innately want the hero to win BECAUSE he is young, beautiful, and heroic while the villain is often bitter and betrayed by society, even if they can't help how they look, society already tells us who the good guy is just based on looks when it comes to classical works.</p>
<p>This is part of why things that shrug off the standards are fun.  How far can you push the envelope with your hero being fat, lazy, and unsavory before you innately turn the audience against them?  Modern Anime as a genre specifically plays with this a LOT, most of their heroes are HEAVILY flawed, and the aspect that sucks people in is watching these characters develop and overcome their flaws.  The best stories never completely erase the problem, but show us over and over how the hero comes to deal with this eternal struggle, making their heroism even better.</p>
<p>The same applies to villains.  How beautiful and good can you make them before it makes people feel bad when they lose?  Are we supposed to ultimately have SOME regret as the audience when the villain finally loses?  Was there SOME virtue in what they were trying to accomplish?  Villains that are attempting to overcome an underlying social injustice - often in the wrong way - generally look better and have more palatable personalities than those who are purely out to corrupt and destroy society as a whole.  Specifically so we DO like them at least a little bit, and while we ultimately still want them to lose, it's not a complete victory when they do.</p>
<p>These are things you should be looking for in any book/movie/show you watch.  It helps you to understand your culture better and enjoy these stories on a deeper level.  Watch for when people are following the tropes or shrugging them off, and what the writers can do with the character to make them interesting and unique in a world where EVERYTHING means SOMETHING, or, at least it should in good writing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Asymmetry often makes us uncomfortable. When designing movie characters, editors will purposefully make the villains slightly asymmetrical, just enough to make us uncomfortable. Similarly, you almost never see someone with two eyepatches, cause... At that point eyepatches are kinda pointless. So while it's not the entirety of why, our lack of comfort for ajar or non-symmetrical things is a part.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few posts have mentioned pirates, outlaws, or other people outside of acceptable society.  The exact opposite: people on top of the social hierarchy, villains who abuse their aristocratic power and privilege, can also be evoked with eye patches.  The European upper class engaged in dueling and other forms of ritualized combat.  Facial scars and injuries even became signifiers of prestige and high status, but also implied a more sinister official violence.  <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/av4bp4/frauleins-dig-them-0000573-v22n2" target="_blank">The practice of elite dueling and honorary scarification continues, underground, to this day</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because people don't lose an eye doing nice things like helping old ladies cross the street or handing out puppies to orphans. People lose an eye doing naughty things like using power tools without safety goggles or getting in bar fights.</p>
<p>It's also not nice to judge people based on how they look. Plenty of people with eye patches are decent folks. But plenty more are homicidal meth head bikers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
