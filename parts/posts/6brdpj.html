		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A reflex requires nerve circuitry with a sensory input path (afferent) and a motor output path (efferent). One of the input sensory paths for a cough reflex is in the external auditory meatus, or ear canal. <a href="http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/mobile/article.aspx?articleid=1084235&amp;issueno=1_suppl#ExtrapulmonaryModulationofCough" target="_blank">This is known as the Arnold ear-cough reflex as the sensory input comes from the nerve of Arnold, a branch of the Vagus nerve.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Embryology plays a major role here, most of the throat and ear occupy the same Embryonic structure complete with its own primordial blood supply and nerve (in this case the vagus). During development in the womb, the pieces get shuffled around a little bit but cannot create new nervous tissue (the neural crest cells have already migrated so unlike blood vessels which can be made throughout life to some extent the nerves are pretty fixed {this is also the reason that vascular anomalies are common in people but nervous ones are not} ). All this to say that sticking stuff in your ear will give your throat a scratchy feeling.
Here's a YouTube of the early development (long but it explains it well)
