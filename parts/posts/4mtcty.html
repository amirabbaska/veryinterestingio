		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a non-American and someone who hasn't studied economics, it is hard for me to understand the entirety of what John Oliver did. </p>
<p>It sounds like he did a really great job but my lack of understanding about the American economic and social security system is making it hard for me to appreciate it. </p>
<ul>
<li>Please explain in brief about the aspects of the American economy that this deals with and why is this a big issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow. This blew up. I just woke up and my inbox was flooded. Thank you all for the explanations. I'll read them all. </p>
<p>Edit 2: A lot of people asked this and now I'm curious too -</p>
<ul>
<li>Can't people buy their own debts by opening their own debt collection firms? Legally speaking, are they allowed to do it? I guess not, because someone would've done it already.    </li>
</ul>
<p>Edit 3: As /u/Roftastic put it: </p>
<ul>
<li>Where did the remaining 14 Million dollars go? Is that money lost forever or am I missing something here?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you /u/mydreamturnip for explaining this. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4mtcty/eli5_what_exactly_did_john_oliver_do_in_the/d3z1n7w" target="_blank">Link to the comment</a>. If someone can offer another explanation, you are more than welcome.</p>
<p>Yes, yes John Oliver did a very noble thing but I think this is a legit question.</p>
<p>Upvote the answer to the above question(s) so more people can see it.</p>
<p>Edit 4: Thank you /u/anonymustanonymust for the gold. I was curious to know about what John Oliver did and as soon as my question was answered here, I went to sleep. I woke up to all that karma and now Gold? Wow. Thank you.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever you take out a loan or get a service that you don't pay for in advance, you owe someone money. If you don't pay, they chase you down looking to get their money. For many of these people who are owed money, they want to spend their time performing services for people, not chasing down delinquent payers. So for a fraction of the total price of the debt, they sell the right to collect the money to some third party. That way they get some of their money back (more than they would without a bunch more effort chasing down the people who haven't been paying). </p>
<p>So now the third party who specializes in chasing these people down will try to find the people who haven't paid and get them to pay. What John Oliver did was buy the right to collect these debts, just like these third parties do, but then forgive the debts- tell the people who owe money that they don't have to pay him back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What John Oliver did was he started a company that purchases debt. Bad debt.</p>
<p>He then proceeded to buy $15,000,000 in bad medical debt. This debt is from people that had medical bills they could not or did not pay. Often debt like this is sold by companies (hospitals in this case) that originally incurred the debt when they know they have a very little chance of collecting it.</p>
<p>So John Oliver bought $15,000,000 in debt for $60,000 and then forgave the all of those debts. </p>
<p>While this all did actually happen, it is mostly a publicity stunt for his show. The reason that debt sells for so cheep is because the overwhelming majority of the debt would never have been paid anyway. So John did a good thing, but it appears far more impressive than it actually is. </p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Because people keep asking &quot;What is stopping me from buying my own debt and just forgiving it?&quot;</p>
<p>You cannot just buy your own debt. Companies that sell debt sell it in large chunks like what John Oliver bought. The person buying the debt does not even know whose debt they are getting until after the transaction, they only know the class of debt they are buying. Finally the class of debt John Oliver bought for a fraction of a penny on the dollar is the worst of the worst debt. Debts that collection companies have given up on collecting and they already have ruined the credit of those that owed the money. </p>
<p>In short there is no practical way to buy your own debt (although it is technically possible). </p>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: Because people keep inaccurately saying this. You cannot buy your own debt. Paying off your debt for a negotiated lower amount is <strong>not</strong> buying your debt. While practically they may seem like the same thing, they are not. My previous statement that you cannot just by your own debt stands correct. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To clear things up, he didn't actually spend $15 million.  Many companies in America make money by buying up debt for cheaper than the debt is actually worth and then they are entitled to collect the debt for themselves.  He actually only paid $60,000 for the right to collect $15 million in debt from people who owed money for medical bills, but he also had the right to forgive all of the debt which is what he did.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>According to sources, he purchased $15Mil with just $60k, a $14,940,000 difference and then just threw that difference away.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A simplified version of how debt collection works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Bob owes Acme Corporation $100, and it's due on June 1st. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several months go by. Acme sends Bob letters telling him his payment is overdue, please call them so they can work out a deal, etc. etc. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bob avoids them. He doesn't have $100. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually, Acme Corporation realizes they will never get that $100, so they <em>send it to collections</em>. When a debt is sent to collections, it's basically like Acme Corporation said, &quot;Well, Bob is never going to pay us back. We're tired of trying. BUT....we might as well get SOMETHING for it.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, Acme Corporation sells Bob's debt to a debt collector for $5.
It's like if you had a metal box that had $100 in it. You try everything you can to get the box open, but can't do it. So you find someone who is really good at opening metal boxes and say, &quot;Hey, if you give me $5, then I'll give you this box. If you can get the box open, there's $100 in there for you to keep.&quot;  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though the debt collector bought Bob's debt for $5, they can still make Bob pay the full $100. Thus, they make a $95 profit. </p>
</li>
<li>Now, all the debt collector has to do is use any means they can to make Bob pay. Since this is the only reason the debt collector exists, they can devote a ton of time and energy to making Bob pay -- calling him, sending him letters, etc. etc. If someone owes enough money, the debt collector can sue them in court and garnish their wages. People often end up declaring bankruptcy to escape their debt. </li>
</ol>
<p>In the meantime, Bob's credit score is destroyed. This means it will be almost impossible to get financing for a house or a new car or apply for a new credit card. Sometimes your credit score even affects whether you get hired for a job. It will take many years of work before Bob's can rebuild his credit score. And in the meantime, he's dealing with the debt collector calling him every day. </p>
<p>Now, imagine that instead of $100, it's actually $50,000 - or $100,000. And you don't owe it to a corporation, you owe it to a hospital because you or one of your family members were in a terrible car accident and had to be flown by helicopter to an urgent care center. Maybe your insurance didn't cover all of it. Or maybe you couldn't even afford insurance to begin with. </p>
<p>What John Oliver did was play the role of the debt collector. He spent $60 thousand to purchase $15 million in debt. BUT instead of trying to make all those people pay (the thing that debt collectors typically do), he basically said, &quot;Eh. Whatever. Forget about it.&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
