		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes - if there are surviving, female-line descendants of Denisovans or Neanderthals, and if the mitochondrial DNA of those populations was clearly distinct from H. sapiens sapiens.</p>
<p>There are only a handful of mitochondrial genes, amounting to about 16,500 base pairs. There are only 200 variations for Neanderthals, and 400 for Denisovans.</p>
<p>So we're not looking for much, and we haven't found it - there's no evidence of Neanderthal mitochondria in our cells. Interbreeding was rare, and mtDNA lines are too easily wiped out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's an explanation of why we don't see neanderthal mtDNA in today's humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The key takeaway was that the most statistically probable outcome, given the small number of Neanderthal and Denisovan ancestors, is that both of these mitochondrial lineages would be lost, simply by chance.  There same is true for Y chromosomes.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We haven't found any and it is pretty unlikely that it exists.</p>
<p>Because it requires an unbroken female line of descent, it doesn't mix, it is either yes or no. The further you go back generationally, the less likely it is for any particular line of mitochondrial DNA to persist, because there's too much of a chance of them ending up with all male offspring at a given generation.</p>
<p>The initial hybrid population was probably pretty small as well, which makes it even less likely.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is possible that only a certain line of hybrids were fertile or even viable; that is to say, if the denisovian/neanderthal was the father and the mother was homo sapiens sapiens, then there may simply not have been any hybrids with denisovian/neanderthal mitochondria in the first place (the same potentially applies to the Y-chromosome as well, in reverse).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
