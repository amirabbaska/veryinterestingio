		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't use even <em>most</em> of the oxygen in the air you inhale. There is more than enough to sustain a person who is already unconscious. This is especially true when you take a deep breath and immediately breath it out into them. Regardless, even a reduced amount of oxygen is better than the zero amount they're getting from the stale air in their lungs that aren't moving.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't absorb all of the oxygen that you breathe in so you're giving what you breathe out to the person who isn't breathing. But, most CPR classes are now teaching compression only technique, so most people don't learn how to breathe for someone any more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two elements here</p>
<p>Firstly the air you breathe in has about 20% oxygen and 16% when you breathe it out meaning that there is still a lot of oxygen in the air you breathe out and you can force that air quite deep into someone's lungs by doing mouth to mouth.</p>
<p>Secondly CO2 levels in air you breathe out will be fairly high, but your body system actually uses the level of CO2 in the system to regulate breathing. i.e. the more CO2 there is in your system the more often you breathe which might be quite useful in this case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You only use a little bit of the O2 you breathe in.  </p>
<p>Normal air is 350ppm CO2.  8% (80,000ppm) is dangerously high.  Human exhaust is 4%.  Sure, that's 100x more than normal air, but not a dangerous amount.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
