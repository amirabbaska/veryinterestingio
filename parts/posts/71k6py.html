		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it disrupts our homeostasis. Human skin has specific receptors in it which are designed to detect the presence of foreign agents &amp; unwanted dangers such as insects. Have you ever seen how a horse twitches it's skin to get rid of flies? Humans have the same process, except instead of involuntary twitching, it sends a signal to your brain to GET IT OFF</p>
<p>So, simply put, when you have a substance sticking to your skin, your brain interprets it as a negative stimuli that wants to harm you in some way. This stimuli will make your brain want to remove it, to return to homeostasis</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
