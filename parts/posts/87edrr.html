		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tea and coffee are not metabolized in the same way that the dry herbs or beans would be because only some of the substances in the herbs/beans are leeched out into the water. The water doesn't undergo a chemical change but rather dissolves chemicals from within the brewed substance.</p>
<p>The body doesn't really metabolize water, it metabolizes the substances carried within the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although other answers are correct in saying that coffee is part of the grains only I would explain different.</p>
<p>Your body doesn't metabolize them differently, almost no substances change from the original grain, and they are metabolized by the same mechanisms in the body. These mechanisms are known to be useful for almost all kinds of molecules. They are very unspecific.</p>
<p>However the coffee will be absorbed quicker than grains and that changes the amount of substances your body has to deal in a time. That can lead to different metabolic pathways. So in this case yes, they are metabolized differently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
