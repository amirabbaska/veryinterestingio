		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of wrong answers here. It’s because of your skin and the shape of your joints. Putting on a ring you are basically pulling your skin tight against your fingertip and pushing it up over the cleft of the joint.  It can’t go very far so it doesn’t form folds easily. Pulling off a ring your basically pulling on a lot more skin with no hard anchors nearby and it drops off over the cleft of your knuckle so it folds there and jams under the ring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you put a ring on, your joints are braced against all your other bones, giving you something solid to push the ring down against. When you go to take it off, joints have ligaments and such that allow them to stretch a bit, which makes it so that you’re basically pulling your finger off rather than the ring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it was because when your outing a ring on your skin is more taunt then when you take it off. When you take it off your skin kind of folds over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons I know of are; when something is tight to your skin, moisture is more likely to accumulate there. Sweat can make you a bit sticky, so a ring might stick down to the skin more easily. Because sweat is water-based, we will often resort to oil-based products such as grease or butter to loosen it up so the ring may slip off.</p>
<p>The second reason, and more likely to get a ring stuck, is that having the finger even slightly restricted will cause it to swell with blood because the veins are being squished by the ring so the blood has a harder time returning to the heart. The more the finger swells, the more the veins are compressed, and so the more blood gets &quot;stuck&quot; in the finger. This increases the size of the finger so the ring is effectively tighter. Many people will use compression techniques in order to force the blood back out of the finger so that it may shrink down enough for the ring to slip off. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGGwX2lY4rc" target="_blank">Here is an example of such compression.</a></p>
<p>edit: I should mention, the reason blood can be forced into the finger but not forced away from it is because the heart cannot suck blood into itself, it can only push blood out. It relies on the veins and arteries to retain clear passageways to allow the blood pressure to force blood to flow back toward the heart, by pushing the old blood out of the way with the new blood. This blood pressure is lost when the veins are squished by a ring so while the heart can pump blood into the finger by pushing it, it can not bring the blood back out of the finger quite as easily. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The skin on your largest knuckle is looser than the skin on the rest of your finger - and there's more of it - so it bunches up in front of the ring as you try to pull it off. You can see the same effect just tugging on the different knuckles in both directions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
