<p>Can you even get to a point where you're so good at &quot;hacking&quot; that you're able to easily access accounts or is it just Hollywood nonsense.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you see a building. It’s one of those company buildings that has automatic doors, but these automatic doors only open from the inside so people can walk out. You think this is interesting, and you want to know how it works. It could work a couple of ways, it could have a weight sensor, or it could have a motion sensor. You don’t see a floor pad, so it couldn’t be a weight sensor. You notice that there’s a gap in between the doors and you happen to have a can of compressed air that has a straw that will fit inside the gap. You figure “if it’s a motion sensor, it should sense the dust the compressed air moves” so you stick the straw through the gap and spray air. The door opens.</p>
<p>This is hacking. Typically you think of hacking as computer hacking, but hacking really is just getting things to do something they weren’t intended to do. Computer hacking is typically seeing a system, investigating how it works, and seeing if you can get it to do something it wasn’t intended to do</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody types that fast. It's mostly reading, studying, then programming attempted attacks. Sometimes it's finding tools and letting them find vulnerabilities. Sometimes it's just outwitting a person on the phone to get Information (social hack). Other times you may disassemble code to find clever security mechanisms and ways around them. Depends on your objectives. Nobody is typing a million keystrokes per second to break into a bank or the defense department or Hillary's email. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most realistic depiction of what hacking looks like that I have seen on tv is the show mr. robot, even then it’s a little far fetched. </p>
<p>Hacking is a lot like breaking into a building. It’s a matter of finding a weakness and getting in. </p>
<p>The most common form of hacking is essentially the same as stealing the keys. It’s easiest to go in through the front door with the password.</p>
<p>From there it gets more complicated and technical, but the basic premise is the same regardless. Find a bug or security loophole and use it to gain access or force the target to run some code that will give you access.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
