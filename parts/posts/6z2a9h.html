		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basic jist of it is size grows at a a rate of to the power of 2 and volume (and therefore mass) grows at a rate of to the power of 3, so weight quickly outpaces size. A six foot tall person, for example would weigh something like 180 lbs normally. A 9 foot talk person would easily be in the thousand lb range of properly proportioned. A 50% increase in height leads to a way more than 50% increase in weight and that's not sustainable because bone can only be so strong. At some point, the weight would be too much to carry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat counterintuitively, as an object gets bigger, its properties don't all get bigger at the same rate.  10 feet is twice as long as 5 feet, but a 10x10 square is four times as big as 5x5, and and 10x10x10 cube is eight times as big.</p>
<p>The weight of an object is determined by its volume, but strength is determined by area, the thickness of the objects cross section.  So if you take a bone or a steel beam, and double its size, it will become twice as long, four times as strong, but eight times as heavy.  Weight, in this case, increases twice as much as strength, so eventually you get to a point where the weight can no longer be supported.</p>
<p>And isn't just a matter of strength.  Blood vessels, digestive tracts, airways, they are all limited by the area of the cross section but must supply a volume.  All these systems start to break down as size increases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This topic is <strong>amazingly interesting</strong>. It has to do with scale, efficiency, and<strong> an extra dimension</strong></p>
<p>Another poster did a great job of answering your question directly, so I thought I'd expand on the subject. </p>
<p>Yes, the square cubed law shows how some features of the animal grow in 3 dimensions but did you know we can predict an animal's lifespan based on the specie's weight?</p>
<p>Lifespan will scale to WEIGHT^(1/4). That's the one-quarter power. Remember that (1/4) power for later. It's not just lifespan but you can use weight to predict:</p>
<ul>
<li>metabolism (how many calories the animal needs per day)</li>
<li>resting heat rate</li>
<li>brain size compared to intelligence</li>
<li>required oxygen</li>
<li>number of offspring over lifespan</li>
</ul>
<p>All for the average animal of that given size. </p>
<p>But it isn't only true of animals. It works for trees. It's true of similar features of organizations like ant colonies or publicly traded corporations. It even true of cities. The pace of life is faster in larger cities and you can predict by how much and the lifespan of a company based on size of organization. They are both exponential on average. </p>
<h2>So... <strong>why does this happen</strong>?</h2>
<p>What's common between mice, elephants, humans, trees, and even cities to some degree?</p>
<p>They all need resources delivered to every part of their structure.
As mass scales up, you have to deliver blood (oxygen and nutrients) to every single cell in the body. Once you have a <strong>cardiovascular system</strong>, you have a branching series of tubes that have to go to every single cell, the same way that every road has to be able to deliver a piece of mail to every single address. Each road (including driveways) has to meet or end in a house. This is basically a fractal - a repeating self-similar structure that looks the same at every scale (like the branches of a tree). </p>
<p>As animals scale up, this structure gets more efficient. There is a 25% savings that you get with scale (1/4 power). Highways can go faster than local roads and the more highways you can build the better you are at delivering things. </p>
<p>This 4 from the 1/4 power is better described as 3+1. 3 for the three spatial dimensions we scale in and 1 for the fractal nature of the structure.
Animals scale in 3-Dimensions and the fractal nature of our cardiovascular system scales in 4. We end up with a 1/4 extra bonus efficiency at scale. </p>
<h2>Extra dimensions</h2>
<p><strong>Wait what? 4 dimensions?</strong> Yeah <em>sort of</em>... This is gonna get deep. Fractals are <em>weird</em>. They sort behave as if they add an extra dimension, mathematically. </p>
<p>The best way I can help you to understand this is with coastlines and weird questions about 4D spheres. </p>
<p>What is the length of the coastline of Iceland? Which country in Europe has the largest coastline? These seem like questions with straightforward answers but for centuries, mapmakers got different answers and couldn't explain why. The issue is that coastlines are fractals and asking about there length is asking a 1D question (length) about something that behaves as though it has an extra dimension. </p>
<p>Imagine a sphere. Now let's ask a question that makes sense about a sphere what's the volume? What's the surface area? We can find formulas to answer these questions. </p>
<p>Now let's ask a question that doesn't seem like it makes sense about a sphere. What is the <strong>total area of the interior?</strong> this doesn't seem like it makes sense because there can't be an area of a three-dimensional object could there?</p>
<p>If we imagine the sphere as a infinite series of two dimensional circles in three-dimensional space, in other words, as slices of a sphere sitting on top of each other, then we can say what the area of each of these slices and add them together.</p>
<p>Since there's an infinite number of these circles the surface area is infinite. Sometimes when you ask a question that applies to an object of a higher number of Dimensions you end up with infinity as the answer. Area is a 2-D question and I asked about a 3D shape, so I got infinity. </p>
<p>What if I told you that there was a real two dimensional shape that can be no wider than a quarter but has an infinite perimeter? The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake" target="_blank">Koch snowflake</a> is a fractal that can be defined so that the perimeter is infinite, just as if we were asking a 1D question about a property of a 2D object. </p>
<p>This is very similar to the discovery of the coastline problem in map making. Depending on how small you let your smallest measurement be, the coastline gets longer. </p>
<p>The branching nature of our cardiovascular system is similar. It isn't infinite but it is almost like an extra dimension. Even though we're only a couple of metres tall, our cardiovascular system has a surface area larger than a tennis court. <strong>We're bigger on the inside. </strong></p>
<h2>Where <em>is</em> the Extra Dimension?</h2>
<p><strong>it is a what not a where </strong>
Some dimensions are <em>where</em> dimensions like left, right, up and down. Some are what dimensions like pressure, time (sort of) or volume. The thing being increased in a fractal is information over scale. In order to define a fractal, I need to cheat. The information for the fractal isn't stored in the shape, it is in the definition. I need to give you an algorithm. And the shape actually changes depending on the resolution that you choose to measure it. If you change the scale or resolution, you change the shape because the shape is defined <em>in terms</em> or its resolution or scale. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A really cool side to this is the cellular level. The way that a cell channels energy into a usable form is by pumping ions across a membrane. A membrane is the surface area of the cell and is proportional to x squared. It's also common to see many infoldings of the membrane (similar to cilia) to increase surface area. Despite these infoldings, the volume of a cell, which is proportional to X cubed, increases much faster than X squared. Basically the exact same concept as considering giant mammals, but on a tiny scale.</p>
<p>The reason cells like ours, which are much bigger than bacteria, can exist is because we have mitochondria, lots of tiny little membrane pockets that do the membrane pumping thing on their own. There's storing evidence to suggest that mitochondria are actually descended from a primitive bacteria themselves. If our cells need to get bigger, we can just increase the number of mitochondria in them (which is relatively simple; muscles and liver cells have high energy demands and therefore have many mitochondria in them).</p>
<p>Bacteria can't expand their membrane area any way other than just growing, but increasing their volume increases their energy demands even more. It's like if you were thirsty and you needed to run through a hot desert to get a small amount of water; you'll make yourself thirstier by running, it might not even be worth it to go get the water at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The strength of an animal is generally a function of area (the surface area of a muscle or bone), not volume. Weight is a function of volume. Since area increases exponentially slower than volume, hence the &quot;square-cube&quot; name, muscles and bones can't &quot;catch up&quot; to support the weight of giant organisms if the proportions would have to be the same: if you double the size/height while keeping the same shape you end up with four times the muscle power moving eight times the mass. </p>
<p>The bigger the increase the, worse the problem. Make something 3 times bigger and you have 9 times the muscle power moving <em>27 times</em> the weight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
