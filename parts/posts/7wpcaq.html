		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever you do something good, like finish a task or do something fun, your body releases chemicals in your brain that make you happy. Simply put, these chemicals are the reason we want to do things, and enjoy doing things.</p>
<p>These chemicals are powerful and make us feel good. If we flood our brains with these chemicals a lot in a short amount of time, it takes the brain time to adjust afterward to return to normal.</p>
<p>Video games, gambling, television, and social media are all specifically designed to be enjoyable and force your body to release these chemicals. For some people, the period after those chemicals wear off can be particularly uncomfortable, so they seek out that stimulus again to feel good again.</p>
<p>Over time, this cycle of instant gratification can lead to dependancy, where the person has trouble feeling happy or satisfied from other stimulus. They're brain is so used to soaking in these chemicals that when the chemicals leave their system, they don't feel normal like they should, they feel worse.</p>
<p>Things like studying aren't instantly gratifying, it happens over time and isn't really exciting, but we get pleasure at the end when our hard work pays off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every time I study I eat something sweet, or drink a caffeinated beverage. My body has come to associate studying with these simple pleasures, and now I get cravings to &quot;study&quot;.
Just be sure whatever your reward is, it is small, and you don't ever have it without studying at the same time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Feedback loops. It's easy to tell how well you are doing at a video game, and putting in tiny amounts of time make a real perceivable impact on your scores, encouraging you to spend more time.</p>
<p>Gamification us the idea that you can apply these feedback loops to other aspects of your life to improve them more dramatically. Or apply them to a work process to make it more efficient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One belief is that there’s an evolutionary efficacy to paying attention to “easy” things. Thousands of years ago, what’s a better trait, being able to focus a ton of attention on staring at a page or at noticing surroundings and minute by minute interaction. You had to “quick think” in order to survive. Sedentary lifestyle and industry and leisure time allowed us to focus on “longer term” attention. But because were so hard wired to notice danger were predisposed to easier things like tv and games. This is just a theory, btw. Also, there are scientific terms I should be using here but they escape me </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Games and TV are designed to be rewarding. For some games, they hire psychologists to ensure the game is addictive, which is a different and easier thing than to make it continuously interesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
