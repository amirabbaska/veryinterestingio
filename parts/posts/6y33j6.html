		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those are called sunspots. They are areas of the sun's surface that are cooler than the rest of it. They're still very hot, just not hot enough for the light they're emitting to be enough to see through eclipse glasses. Basically, there are strong magnetic fields in those locations that are inhibiting the normal surface convection of those areas, thus keeping them somewhat cooler than the rest of the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I received the <a href="http://spaceweather.com/" target="_blank">http://spaceweather.com/</a> alert for them just last night!</p>
<p>If you've taken on a more than passing interest in the sun as it sounds like you have, you might consider signing up for their alerts - they'll let you know about Coronal Mass Ejections as they happen so you can have some lead time to get to a dark area to see the aurora!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;If you have your eclipse glasses, go look.&quot;  </p>
<p>This made me go 'whoah dude' more than it probably should have.  I mean, it's obvious that we all share the sun, but I've never seen it spelled out so clearly like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the sunspot groups has grown tremendously in just the last day or so, here's a cool GIF of it:</p>
<p><a href="http://spaceweather.com/images2017/04sep17/sunspots_anim.gif?PHPSESSID=q66lf7ihj64s5nvk96jco0g392" target="_blank">http://spaceweather.com/images2017/04sep17/sunspots_anim.gif?PHPSESSID=q66lf7ihj64s5nvk96jco0g392</a></p>
<p>The larger spots within the groups are larger than the planet Earth.  The growing spot group, known as AR2673, is active, and being monitored for flares or other disturbances.  It is facing Earth directly, and if it blows, could spray a blast at us.  Go here, might have to scroll down a bit, great pics:</p>
