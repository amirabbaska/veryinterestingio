		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In 2007, new laws were introduced about how companies could advertise which products to children.</p>
<p>It meant that you could no longer, for example, try to persuade a kid to eat your unhealthy food.</p>
<p>I suspect putting toys in cereal would fall foul of that, and that's why cereal adverts are now aimed at parents, telling them their kids will be well-behaved, high achievers if they eat Coco Pops.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the costs and theoretical danger. Kellogg received a lot of backlash in 2004 when they had to recall a ton of boxes because a <a href="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjY3WDkwMg==/z/LZoAAOSwqxdTrDX1/$_35.JPG" target="_blank">Spiderman watch</a> used a <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/kellogg-s-to-drop-mercury-battery-toys-after-spider-man-promotion-1.490898" target="_blank">mercury battery</a>.</p>
<p>In 2008 Kellogg did have a <a href="https://s1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/HpZLR4Fl1_TWsWMStyllng--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/blogs/games-us-unplugged/batman_300x196.jpg" target="_blank">Batman toy</a> in their cereal but for the most part these days since things are going digital a lot of companies just do 'codes' and 'coupons' for their incentives just to be safe. </p>
<p>If they do include a toy it's going to be a hunk of plastic that doesn't have joints or whatnot to come apart easily. Look at companies like Kinder who have drastically changed their toys in the Kinder Egg. I remember as a kid having to built something out of 10 pieces but now it's a one piece or 2 piece toy.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They haven't stopped entirely.  As of the last time I bought it, General Mills had cereal with Mega Bloks cars sponsored by Hello Kitty and Power Rangers.  <a href="http://www.asparkleofgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GeneralMills.jpg" target="_blank">linky</a>
I'm not convinced that the reduction in practice has anything to do laws or lawsuits.  This just seems like a simple decision to save money.  If their market research said it was more profitable to sell without toys, then so be it.  In the case of Mega Bloks with Hello Kitty and Power Rangers, the external companies likely just paid enough to make it worthwhile.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I miss cereal box prizes. We didn't have a lot of money as kids, we usually got the malt-o-meal bagged stuff. Once in awhile though, we'd get &quot;good&quot; cereal and get a prize. When I was an adult, and started buying my own cereal, I looked for a box with a cool toy but they don't have them anymore. </p>
<p>It's one of those things I really looked forward to seeing my kids do. Those bastards, ruining it for everyone. Same with cracker jack toys. They're shitty stickers now. I'm from KC, I opened a box of cracker jacks the morning after the last World Series game. It was a fucking San Franciso Giants sticker. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
