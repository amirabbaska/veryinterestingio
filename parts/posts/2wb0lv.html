		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ignoring practical issues like being able to brace the wounds together for the weeks it'd take to heal, you would have to go beyond just matching blood type--the two people would need matching HLA haplotypes or else each person's immune system would try to reject the other person's tissues. (There may be ways around this, for example if each person were put on immunosuppressants.) Perhaps it could happen with identical twins, whose HLAs would be perfect matches.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a matter of fact, it is possible. It's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabiosis" target="_blank">Parabiosis</a>. But as some others here have explained, it would not work so easily in humans.</p>
<p>almost every cell in the human body has a series of proteins known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen" target="_blank">Human Leukocyte Antigens</a>, or &quot;HLA&quot; for short. These HLA proteins act like identification and inspection sites for the human body: Cells which lack them are targeted by natural killer cells (a type of white blood cell). HLA also function as a snapshot of what is inside the cell. You can imagine HLA like a hotdog bun, and inside the hotdog bun, the HLA presents a random protein segment from inside the cell. If that protein segment is something the immune system sees regularly, it will ignore it. If it is something odd or foreign, the immune system will attack it through a  T-cell response. And if the HLA itself is a different setup, this will result in an attack as well. So in the example of non-identical humans, the T-cells of one human will attack the other.</p>
<p>In rats and mice, however, scientists use historically inbred mouse lines that are nearly (if not completely) genetically identical, like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C57BL/6" target="_blank">C57/Black-6</a> mouse. When we make a gene knockout mouse on this background, the only difference is the gene we are studying.</p>
<p><strong>Parabiosis was a useful tool</strong> in discovering how the adipokine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin" target="_blank">Leptin</a> regulates satiety. In an intriguing experiment, scientists took two types of genetically altered mice with similar phenotype, and parabiosed them to see what happened. The Ob- mouse lacked ability to make Leptin, while the Db- mouse made leptin but lacked receptor for it. Both mice overate and became really, really fat. But when parabiosed, the Ob mouse lost weight, and the Db mouse remained fat. Interestingly, a wildtype mouse parabiosed to an Ob- mouse made the Ob-mouse lose weight, and a Db-mouse parabiosed to WT caused the WT mouse to lose weight and die. <a href="http://www.diabesity.eu/images/parabiosismice.png" target="_blank">This (SFW) image</a> summarizes the findings, but through this mechanism, we discovered that Leptin (produced by fat cells) can inhibit food seeking behavior if the mechanism is preserved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer for humans exactly, but these studies have been done in mice and do work. It's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabiosis" target="_blank">parabiosis</a>, see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24145664" target="_blank">parabiosis protocol</a>. </p>
<p>In essence, two mice can be surgically grafted together with a shared circulatory system. Blood cells and even circulating stem cells derived from each animal can be found (functioning) in both. Because both animals retain their functional immune system, they share their circulating antigens and develop <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_tolerance" target="_blank">immune tolerance</a> to the other's antigens as though they themselves were expressing the new. So, in mice, HLA mismatches do not lead to rejections or graft-versus-host disease. </p>
<p>Parabiosis has been used in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v16/n10/full/nm1010-1097.html" target="_blank">diabetes research</a> with mutant animals, demonstrating that a specific mutant (<a href="http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v16/n10/full/nm1010-1097.html" target="_blank">Lepr^db/db</a>) grafted to a normal wild-type lean mouse or even an obese <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/allele/key/568" target="_blank">Lep^ob/ob</a> will cause the non-db mouse to starve to death due to circulating satiety factors. This was the discovery of leptin.</p>
<p>More recently, in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v20/n6/full/nm.3569.html" target="_blank">aging studies</a>, young mice grafted old rejuvenated the old mice! The old mice had noted improvement in the brain (learning, memory, circulation, neuron density) as well as muscle, liver and heart function.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Immune systems would become aggressive to the foreign entity and attack cells growing the wound together. We see this problem with transplants all the time even if they're a direct tissue match and blood type. It is really Really REALLY hard to get immune systems to play nice with foreign objects because it is so good at identifying what is and isn't an original part of the body. The problem is mainly the difference in DNA between the people attempting to do this but we don't fully understand the immune system and how it differentiates hostile and safe entities so who knows, maybe in some weird world of advanced medical science this could be possible?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
