		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a delicate point about time translations in general relativity, which corresponds to a delicate point in the definition of energy. </p>
<p>As you might already have guessed, continuous transformation to a physical system correspond to a certain associated quantity (called a &quot;charge&quot;) that &quot;generates&quot; the transformation. If a transformation is a symmetry, then the corresponding &quot;charge&quot; is conserved, which is Noether's theorem.</p>
<p>Now, energy is <strong>defined</strong> as being the &quot;charge&quot; to time translation. But what are time translations, exactly?</p>
<p>Our current understanding of fundamental physics takes the form of a pair of interacting, but very distinct entities: the stage (spacetime) and the actors (&quot;matter&quot;). It's not a trivial fact that you can always separate spacetime from the things that move on it, and for example theories of quantum gravity such as string theory tend to blur this line. But as physics stands right now, they're two different things, and both of them are dynamical objects and evolve in time according to specific laws, the famous equations of motion (eom). So &quot;matter&quot; (in which I include everything that isn't gravity) has its system of eom, while the shape of spacetime (the <em>metric</em>) evolves according to <em>its</em> own eom, which are the Einstein field equations.</p>
<p>Note that these two eom are <em>coupled</em>. The eom of matter depends on the shape of spacetime, which affects the motion of particles for example, while the eom of spacetime depends on the matter content, which can create curvature.</p>
<p>Ok, now, back on track: you want to translate something in time; i.e. move all events so that they happen, idk, one second later. It seems completely natural that you should do this by translating <em>both</em> matter and spacetime. They are two physical, dynamical interacting subsystems, they are your physics. They should both be subject to the transformation. Is this always a symmetry? Yes. Both the eom of matter and the Einstein field equations do not depend in any way on what time it actually is, and nothing will actually change. So... let's call the associated charge <strong>the</strong> energy and it has to be conserved, and we're done, right?</p>
<p>That doesn't work. Here's why: if you move both spacetime and matter forward, say, 1 year, this is obviously entirely equivalent to keeping everything where (when?) it is, but assigning a time of 1 year less to all events. Imagine if we were to rewrite all books and all information so that dates are shifted back one year, 2017 -&gt; 2016 and so on. Would <em>anything</em> physically change? Not at all. Is this <em>really</em> a nontrivial transformation?</p>
<p>It's not. It's just a change of coordinates, because time t is just a coordinate on spacetime. And coordinates have no real meaning. That's a fundamental point of general relativity, actually. Since our transformation is dumb, the corresponding &quot;charge&quot; is also dumb: it's always zero*. This is why you sometimes hear of the <em>total</em> energy in the Universe being zero, and I'll clarify in a minute in which sense this is &quot;total&quot;. The point is this definition is almost completely pointless because what good is a physical quantity that is always zero no matter what happens to the system you care about, and what good is it to know that it is conserved (well, duh)?</p>
<p>That's why you actually define time translations in a slightly different way. You only translate matter, not spacetime. If you do it this way, then if the metric of spacetime does change in time, the same matter will find itself in a different shape of spacetime, and so this will not be a symmetry <em>unless</em> the specific shape of spacetime itself is time-translation invariant. In other words, you are acting only on the matter and its own eom, while the metric is more in the role of &quot;background&quot;; since the eom for matter does depend on the metric, it's not, with this philosophy, invariant under time translations. Note how delicate, in the interpretation of the sentence &quot;the laws of physics are/aren't invariant under time translations&quot; is what you actually call the laws of physics and what you call background. The charge associated to these transformation is energy (let's call it physical energy), and is the energy you're more familiar with. And it is not conserved if the metric of spacetime is not time-translation invariant, like in cosmological expansion.</p>
<p>But the &quot;stupid&quot; energy is useful because it gives us an interpretation of the &quot;lost&quot; or &quot;gained&quot; energy in expansion. The physical energy just defined does not include gravitational potential energy. In fact gravitational potential energy is associated to time-translating the metric. Thus the &quot;stupid&quot; energy being conserved just means that (physical energy of matter) + (gravitational potential energy) is conserved. It's not a particularly useful idea in terms of calculations, but it's the approximate physical interpretation you can give of this. So when CMB photons get redshifted by cosmological expansion, you can definitely answer the question &quot;where does the energy go&quot; with &quot;energy is not conserved, because the metric is not time-translation invariant, period&quot;, but you can actually equally well say &quot;it becomes gravitational potential energy of the photons. The other masses in the Universe are getting farther from the photon and so its gravitational potential increases.&quot;</p>
<p>Ok. With that out of the way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and you can generate infinite energy,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>yes, you can. It's easy: put a spring with two endpoints a cosmologically-sized distance away. The spring will be stretched by dark energy and you will be able to extract work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>would it also invalidate the law that entropy always increases</p>
</blockquote>
<p>no, but that's really subtle. Gravitational phenomena are able to reduce entropy in a small subsystem but at the expense of creating a much larger amount of entropy in a larger subsystem. (I've talked about this in detail <a href="http://rantonels.github.io/gravity-entropy-and-life/" target="_blank">here</a>). Living beings (including humans) are also able to do the same thing.</p>
<p>The point is that to do this, you need to shed matter that should carry away the large entropy. The second law can <strong>never</strong> be violated (the possibility to create energy out of nothing does not actually help with that). If you need to continuously shed matter to decrease entropy, you're gonna have to get smaller and smaller, and at a certain point you will run out of matter. So there is simply no way to escape the heat death: at some point in the future, any existing structure, computational mechanism, or order of any sort will be dismantled.</p>
<p>* more precisely, it can also be a constant independent on the actual state of the Universe. But still equally pointless, and the rest of the reasoning is the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
