		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is unlikely that life can survive on the surfaces of these moons, even if it might exist in the liquid oceans of Europa. Thus, for this to work, there would have to be a mechanism for the life to get from Europa to a sufficiently similar life-sustaining environment in Ganymede or Callisto.</p>
<p>Ganymede is much less active, so there probably isn't a route, even if it might have such an environment. Even if it does, it is likely to be somewhat different to that of Europa, which would probably be a dealbreaker for an invading microbe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This kind of resembles the panspermia theory but at a smaller scale. There have been experiments showing that some microbial life (extremophiles) can survive in space, though they stay inactive until brought back to a pressurized environment. So far the weak link in this theory is atmospheric entry: microorganisms would be burned by the heat of the shockwave if the are on the surface of a meteor. This weak link is irrelevant for the Jovian moons as they have no atmosphere, so it would be more plausible.</p>
<p>There is another environmental hazard, though. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3t6giv/how_does_jupiter_bombard_europa_with_radiation/cx3mqp3/" target="_blank">Jupiter has a very strong radiation belt around it</a> as charged particles spin in its magnetic field. Life in the hypothetical subsurface ocean would be shielded pretty well. However, your scenario involves chunks of ice orbiting Jupiter for a while, falling on the surface of another moon and staying there until convection in ice can take it down to the depths. I'd like to have some numbers but it sounds like this can only happen over geological timescales.</p>
<p>It is true that some extremophiles are much better than humans at surviving ionizing radiation, notably deinococus radiodurans, but this doesn't mean they can take an arbitrarily high dose. With a sufficiently prolonged exposure, any living thing will eventually turn into a kind of &quot;organic soup&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem of their liquid water being shielded under ice has been raised as an obstacle to life spreading from one moon to another, which makes me wonder if anyone knows whether any of them were either liquid on the surface.  Much like how early Earth was covered in seas of molten rock from bombardment, were the icy moons covered in oceans, with atmospheres that have long since dissipated?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would depend on whether the life was like ours or not. If life on other planets is similar to ours it would suggest a common ancestor. This suggests life is spread easily, and that life would be likely to be found on all bodies in the solar system that could support it.</p>
<p>If life evolved independently in the Europan oceans then that makes the question simpler. It suggests to create life from scratch is not so difficult given suitable conditions. The appropriate question then becomes 'what are those conditions and are they on other moons'. Also this would imply the Europan ocean is isolated. Other moons must independently evolve life.</p>
<p>Additionally, something not mentioned often is the immense pressure sub surface oceans are under. Because of this the water chemistry is physically different to water on Earth so whilst there might be life, it might be specific to those pressures and not be able to 'spread' easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That would make sense to me but I hope we find life that developed independently rather than just being passed around from planet to planet. It seems like that would make it more likely that life is common in the universe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
