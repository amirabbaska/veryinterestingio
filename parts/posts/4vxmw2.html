<p>What about a cat or bear that wanders off to hunt and comes back to -1 kitten/cub - would they know and go searching for it? How do they identify that a kitten/cub is missing?</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you everyone for all the helpful answers so far. I should clarify that I'm talking about multiple broods, say of 5+ where it's less obvious from a cursory glance when a duckling/cub is missing (which can work for, say, 2-4).</p>
<p>For those of you just entering the thread now, there are some very good scientific answers, but also a lot of really funny and touching anecdotes, so enjoy.</p></div></div>
