<p>What about a cat or bear that wanders off to hunt and comes back to -1 kitten/cub - would they know and go searching for it? How do they identify that a kitten/cub is missing?</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you everyone for all the helpful answers so far. I should clarify that I'm talking about multiple broods, say of 5+ where it's less obvious from a cursory glance when a duckling/cub is missing (which can work for, say, 2-4).</p>
<p>For those of you just entering the thread now, there are some very good scientific answers, but also a lot of really funny and touching anecdotes, so enjoy.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been studies showing that even newborn baby chickens have rudimentary counting skills.</p>
<p>The way they proved this was fairly interesting. They took baby chickens, hatched them surrounded by scrunched up balls of paper so that the chickens identified with them and then had the baby chicken watch as they placed each ball of paper into one of two concealed containers. The baby chickens would reliably be able to choose the container with the most balls in, demonstrating some manner of counting ability.</p>
<p>(Not a true source, but some reporting the same thing <a href="http://www.livescience.com/49633-chicks-count-like-humans.html" target="_blank">http://www.livescience.com/49633-chicks-count-like-humans.html</a>)</p>
<p>It seems likely that counting is a sufficiently simple activity that birds can handle it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inherent in the question are a couple of large and somewhat related biases. One is that as a human, you're inclined to look at a group ducklings and observe, &quot;there's a quantity of X ducklings,&quot; rather than observing X unique individuals. Likewise, in keeping track of their children, human parents are less likely to look out at the playground and say, &quot;I only see three of four&quot;, than they are to ask, &quot;Do you see Jenny?&quot; It's a reasonably common trait among social animals to recognize one's own young, and more generally to recognize individuals.</p>
<p>The mother duck recognizes her own offspring as individuals and as hers. This is why when two broods run into each other and get momentarily mixed up, they generally depart in their correct family groups, rather than mom simply leaving with any six ducklings.</p>
<p>So, while mother duck may have some ability to observe greater than and less than, this isn't what she likely observes when missing one of her young. However her brain encodes it, she realizes that she's missing her small female with the dark markings.</p>
<p>Moreover, the young are alerting her that there's a problem. They make noises when they're distressed, such as being trapped in a storm drain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever looked at a couple of coins and said 'yep, that's four coins' without individually counting them? That's called subsitizing. Many animals have been studied and found to be able to subsitize to some degree. Humans have trouble subsitizing beyond four or five objects, with each added object to a group taking a distinctly longer time to suss out. </p>
<p>Studies looking for counting in animals have to be careful that their subjects aren't merely subsitizing their way through the experiment!</p>
<p>Counting is a different and sort of more involved, difficult process. A study looked into a story of Chinese fishermen who would give comurants every eighth fish they caught as payment. The study found the birds could count quite high, to around seven. I don't have any study on hand, but crows have some small ability to count too.</p>
<p>tl;dr animals can count or subsitize or both, and can keep track of the number of their young depending on the specific species.</p>
<p>Edit: It's called Subitizing. Dont reddit while sleepy folks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coots aren't exactly ducks, but their ecology is essentially that of ducks, and they can count! <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/04/030403073214.htm" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/04/030403073214.htm</a></p>
<p>Essentially the story is that female coots lay their eggs in their own nest, but also the nests of their neighbors.  Since they want to raise their own chicks and not bother having to care for anyone else's chicks, they have evolved the ability to  count the number of eggs in their nest.  If a coot knows that she's only laid five eggs and she comes home to a nest with six eggs, she'll carefully and critically examine each egg to figure out which one was laid by her neighbor, and then she'll bury the parasite's egg so deep in her nest that it won't hatch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's entirely possible no counting is going on, but individual recognition is. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_cell" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_cell</a></p>
<p>Animals absolutely recognize individuals. To a mother duck, each duckling would sound, smell, and appear individual. The absence and presence of individuals is something animals recognize- she's probably not thinking &quot;I have four ducklings and one is missing&quot;, she's probably thinking &quot;fluffiest duckling, loudest duckling, quietest duckling, all here; where's duckling with the weird feather?&quot; Without once thinking in terms of numbers. All together the family unit might also have a place of its own in her little brain, and an unresolvable absence might feel like an injury to that unit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
