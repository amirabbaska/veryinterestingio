		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can, but it might be underwhelming. You're probably already familiar with it, in fact.</p>
<p>First off, you need to wrap your mind around what it means to illustrate something in a lower dimension: it's a bit counterintuitive, but what you're really doing is understanding that the shapes you see represent something other than the shapes they are. Look at <a href="http://delinear.info/images/th3n04h/cube-clipart-cube.gif" target="_blank">this cube</a>, for example. See it? Well, yeah... except you don't. You can't -- not really, anyway, because it's <em>not</em> a cube. It's some trapezoids and a square and two triangles. You just understand that the angle of those shapes is a funky representation of what is, if you built it in 3D, a perfect square.</p>
<p>So now let's move up to the fourth dimension, and the tesseract: a four-dimensional cube. If a square is a shape where every angle has <strong>two</strong> lines coming off it at ninety degrees, and a cube is a shape where every angle has <strong>three</strong> lines coming off it at ninety degrees, then a tesseract is a shape where every angle has <strong>four</strong> lines coming off it at ninety degrees. We know what a tesseract <em>is</em>, then... but what would it look like? What would a shape that had those properties <em>be</em>?</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Schlegel_wireframe_8-cell.png" target="_blank">Here</a> is a tesseract, represented in 2D. You could imagine building that in 3D as a wireframe, ball-and-stick model, right? That's your simulation -- but the weird part is, all of the 'gaps' between the wires (we call them 'cells') is distorted as a result of showing it in a lesser dimension. The six outer sides that look like truncated pyramids in your wireframe -- as well as the small inner cube and the big outer cube -- are actually all identically-sized perfect cubes in a real tesseract (in the same way the trapezoids in the cube drawing are actually identically-sized perfect squares). Additionally, all of the lines coming off each corner would be at right angles in a 'true' tesseract, and all of those lines would be the same length. Every single one of them, and all of the lines would be the same length. Every single one of them.</p>
<p>It's trippy stuff, but mathematically it works out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A tesseract is essentially a 4D cube. It would look like a cube with another cube farther away, connected by the corners. Farther away in a direction perpendicular to 3D space. That is not easy to think about.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has some images of tesseracts: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
