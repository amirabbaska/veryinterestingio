		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but my understanding is that the two problems are inherently related. Effects that can produce a matter-anti-matter assymetry are usually classified into either Baryo- or Leptogenesis mechanisms. These are effects that can produce either a large overabundance of protons or electrons and a mechanism will usually produce only one or the other. More complicated analyses could considered a few in combination, but viable mechanisms are still so unconstrained that they are usually analyzed separately. With a completely charged universe you could then proceed to a neutral universe via the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiral_anomaly" target="_blank">chiral anomaly</a>, which is fairly well accepted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
