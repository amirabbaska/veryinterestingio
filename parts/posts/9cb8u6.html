		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ethnic Russians are native to the western part of Russia. The part that is generally considered to be geographically in Europe. Over the centuries Russia has conquered and settled in the parts to the north, east and south of that.</p>
<p>Various different native groups inhabited those areas. Some light skinned, some darker skinned. Some of these native groups have their own &quot;republics&quot; within Russia, although in many of those they are outnumbered by ethnic Russians who have settled there over the last few centuries.</p>
<p>Bear in mind some of these &quot;native&quot; groups have migrated from elsewhere over a thousand or so years ago. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Russian Slavs, Finns, Germans (and many other people with European heritage) are white for the most part. There are many different nationalities within Russia. Chinese, Mongols, Koreans, Kazakhs, Armenians, Japanese, Georgians, Ossetins, Turks, Tatars, Circassians &amp; Azerbaijani and many others are among them. Source: traveled Russia &amp; served in Russian military (got to know many people from around the country, like A LOT).</p>
<p>Or it could just be that people you mention lead a life that involves being outside a lot. Hence the tan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Russians came from the west (modern Ukraine). Mongols came from the east. After many years Russians pushed back the Mongols and took the modern Russian territory. The modern “white” Russian people are European and the Asian looking people are descendants of mongols. </p>
<p>Actually Russia has a huge diversity of ethnicities coming from all over the continent. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The modern Russian ethnicity was built through a very long process of migration, conquests, assimilation, and so on. What is usually thought of as &quot;ethnically Russian&quot; developed in Eastern Europe, between the lowest parts of Volga (near the Caspian Sea) and the Baltic, almost reaching modern day Finland. </p>
<p>At the time, there was no difference, ethnically or otherwise, between what we now know as Russians and Ukrainians, Belorussians, Poles, and so on. It was, more or less, a simple eastern Slav ethnicity, with the same culture and language. The difference came when you went too far south-west, where you'd get to the Yugoslavs - the southern Slavs. Even so, the language was so close that people from Novgorod could understand a lot of what someone from Belgrade would be saying.</p>
<p>The eastern ethnicity later split, partially because of religion (Western and Eastern Christian churches), causing the appearance of western Slavs, those we know as Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, and so on. </p>
<p>Now, as to the skin color.</p>
<p>The Slav ethnicity is a bit of a mystery. We know for certain that it emerged in the 5th century, and the only prior mentions of it are vague and hard to judge properly. However, they are Europeans, and were driven east by Germanic and Celtic tribes, eventually settling in the areas they inhabit now - Czechia, Slovakia, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and parts of eastern Russia. That's where the fair skin comes from - Europe. </p>
<p><em>(The rest is more about ethnicity and culture than skin color)</em> However, eastern Slavs, and Russians most of all, have been exposed to many different cultures and ethnicities over the course of history. There was a regular migration from south-east to north-west (Caspian to Baltic, as I described earlier), which already exposed them to cultures of Scandinavians, Balts, Indo-Aryans, Caucasians, and so on. The migration went back and forth, and that is the cause of appearance of modern day variants of eastern Slavic ethnicities. The migration didn't truly stop, even with the emergence of states and princedoms. Even Tolstoy, in the 19th century, noticed that the Russian peasants migrate back and forth once a generation. </p>
<p>Then there was the influence of the Tatar-Mongol conquerors. The princes of Rus' became vassals of the Horde, and as such the culture and the language were significantly changed. Mongols weren't savages - they were the ones that brought the ideas of commerce and power into Rus', and it is still reflected in the language. </p>
<p>The European influence is also hard to underestimate - there were times when all of the Russian elite spoke Polish (which was already quite different from Russian, and carried with it western sciences and philosophy), and then all the court spoke French. Peter the Great brought in words and ideas from Netherlands and England. As such, the Russian language and culture was shaped by influences from both the east and the west. </p>
<p>Another thing worth noting, is that there are two different words for &quot;Russian&quot; within the actual Russian language. One, &quot;roosskiy&quot;, refers to the ethnicity. The other, &quot;rossiyskiy&quot;, refers to state. Russian Empire for example, isn't something that is ethnically Russian, it is a Russian state. As such, Russia has a less nationality centered view. As an empire, it had to treat the conquered territories equally to its own, else it would suffer the fate of the British Empire. As communists, ethnicity and nationality went out the window, at least on paper, and egalitarian view was promoted. And as of now, all that still has an influence. Russia is a very diverse country, with republics like Tatarstan, a whole different ethnicity, being part of the Federation. </p>

<p>Most of the historical and cultural facts are taken from V. O. Kluchevsky's lectures, the rest is my own experience as a Russian and a history enthusiast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
