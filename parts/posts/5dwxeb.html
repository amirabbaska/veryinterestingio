		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who receive the death penalty are entitled to an extensive appeal process which can be very expensive. People who are imprisoned for life are not given the same privilege. This is because killing someone is an irreversible act and we don't want to make mistakes (Unfortunately we still do). The appeal process is very expensive as it takes years, sometimes decades and lawyers are not cheap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't always cheaper. It's cheaper in the USA because of the strong sense of American justice and the fundamental privilege of &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; under common law.</p>
<p>In a country that didn't care how often it killed innocent civilians, the death penalty could be applied very quickly and end up far cheaper. However, USA has an extensive appeal process that usually correlates with the severity of the punishment; the more severe the punishment, the more likely they are to get more appeals. This is to prevent innocent people from being wrongly punished even if it means some guilty people walking free. This is seen as the better alternative in most developed countries.</p>
<p>Anyway. Once someone is sentenced to the death penalty, it is usually decades before they're released. Those decades are spent in the highest security facilities (most expensive) and they will go through the court system numerous times before it's over (even more money).<br />
Medium security for life is <em>far</em> cheaper than 35 years of death row and 6 court appearances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the extended appeals process, death row inmates are usually housed in a separate cell block with higher security, isolated cells, meals in cells, limited free time, etc - which makes the overall expense of housing them higher than for a typical inmate in general population.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we allow virtually unlimited appeals. The government pays for their lawyers, and pays for the court time each time they appeal. Now allowing appeals is important because it is how we find out when we have wrongly convicted someone of a crime, but if you allow it to go on for years or decades the bill racks up quickly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, there's some folks on the pro- death penalty side who claim that this figure is deceptive, as it doesn't take into account the full cost of their medical care as they get old. But to your point, the basic premise is that in the U.S., a prison guard makes a median salary of $38,970, and an attorney makes $113,530.
Personally, I'd make the argument that cost is the LAST reason you should be considering when you're deciding whether to execute people for commission of a crime, and that the cost argument is the kind of argument you make when you've already made up your mind, and are just fishing around for stuff to bolster your position. For the record, I'm personally anti-execution. It's a position which acknowledges the fallibility of people and institutions. You can certainly argue that letting a murderer live is unjust when their victims don't get to live, and that's a pretty cogent argument, but for my part, I'd rather hedge our bets against due process cock-ups, and keep a few more $40k/yr prison guards in business.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
