		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normally, if you hit a tuning fork or clinck a wine glass etc, the thing vibrates for a short time (which causes vibrations in air), and then stops vibrating. The reason it stops vibrating is because, as you note, some of the vibrational energy is transferred to the air. But additionally, a large portion of that vibrational energy is transferred into heat. So if you hit a tuning fork or a wine glass in vacuum, it will vibrate a bit longer than it would have in air, but it will still eventually stop vibrating, and that vibrational energy will end up as heat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, sound is traveling vibrations anywhere. For instance, it's still sound when you hear things under water, and that's not vibrations traveling through air. If it's in space, it vibrates for a <strong>very long time.</strong> Here's why:</p>
<p>Say you hit a tuning fork made of aluminum (because I remember the internal damping of Al) in space. And let's say it was the same temperature as the space around it (a little under 3K, on average). By striking the tuning fork, you've imparted energy to it. This is, for now, in the form of coherent vibrations. </p>
<p>However, the vibrations aren't perfectly conducted, and the molecules push and pull on one another, spreading the energy. Extremely slowly, it starts to even out and become random vibrations, which we refer to commonly as thermal energy or the temperature of the object. </p>
<p>As soon as it starts to heat up, it breaks equilibrium from the space around it, so the radiation of energy (black body radiation) becomes one-sided while the tuning fork tries to balance out by spreading its energy to the space around it through photon emissions. Black body radiation is the same reason that IR cameras work and a hot iron glows. It's transferring energy as radiation instead of (or in addition to) through kinetic transfer like conduction or convection.</p>
<p>Here's the thing. That little vibration in the air dumps energy pretty quickly. The fork sounds for a few seconds, then goes quiet. The damping ratio is on the order of 0.01 to 0.1, usually. The damping ratio of the <em>internal</em> friction of the metal is more like 10^-5. So, if you hit a tuning fork (or a lonely metal beam or anything crystalline or anything hyperelastic) without air or external friction (like being bolted to something else) to slow it down, it will vibrate for <em>weeks</em>. Slowly, very slowly, the vibrations will degrade into random vibrations (thermal energy) and be dissipated through very faint thermal radiation until the tuning fork and space are one again the same temperature and all is quiet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For explosions, there will still be sound if you point a microphone at it. It won't be the sound vibrating that causes it though. Instead the microphone will pick up the expanding bubble of particles created by the explosion. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8MljsHpYRk" target="_blank">Related Video</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both answers mention what happens with a tuning fork so I'll mention what happens with a speaker. </p>
<p>A speaker works by moving a membrane back and forth with frequency of sound that it is reproducing. It compresses the air which propagates the sound wave. </p>
<p>In vacuum there is no air, so there is no resistance from it. The membrane would continue to move in a vacuum, there would just be less current (and therefore power) needed to move it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Overheating is a real danger in outer space. Even though the temperatures are very low, there just isn't a lot of particles to transfer this heat to. Anything that creates sound in an atmosphere will just vibrate but will not emit sound. You could probably hear it by putting your hand on the device; the sound could reach your ear via the bones mainly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
