		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok so your body has no way of detecting “wet” per se. There are no specific wet receptors in the skin. </p>
<p>The way you detect wetness is predominantly the sensation of cold, which is often associated with wetness, particularly in the normal environment in which we evolved. Wet things are generally colder. And even if they are not colder your fingers get wet and as the water evaporates off your fingers and rapidly cools your skin. </p>
<p>There might be other smaller component of maybe your skin being more slippery when wet etc but this doesn’t play a huge part. You’d have to run your skin together to appreciate any tiny differences in friction so it’s not a big component.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sensory receptors in our skin can detect heat and pressure. When you touch something wet, your receptors tell your brain you are experiencing a pressure and a loss of heat, which your brain interprets as ‘wet’!</p>
<p>Fun anecdote showing the short comings of this:
A dry-suit is worn by divers and boaters in cold and wet weather to keep warm and most importantly dry. The dry suit covers your whole body, leaving only your head and hands exposed. Neoprene collar and cuffs seal you in so you can submerge without getting wet. However, the first time you get in the water after putting on a dry suit, you feel wet! The water pushes the suit against your skin, and is cold, so the two senses get interpreted as being wet! Only after you move around a little do you realize that you are still dry inside the dry suit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thermal conductivity. It’s the same reason your feet feel cold when you walk on the bathroom tile first thing in the morning, but warm when you step on the carpet. The carpet and tile are actually the same temperature- what your brain is detecting is the heat flux between you feet and the floor.</p>
<p>Since room temperature is colder than the human body, room temperature things draw heat away from the body. Things with high thermal conductivity, like water, metal, or ceramic tile, feel cold. Things with low thermal conductivity like carpet, plastic, or foam, feel neutral. </p>
<p>Same goes for hot things. You are much more likely to experience pain from a hot metal thing than a hot plastic thing, even if they’re at the same temp (think about the seat belt buckle in your car on a hot summer day. Would you rather grab plastic or metal?)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
