<p>Couldn't find much info, maybe when they release the dam it carries more sediment because in the pictures I found the river is not so brown.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mixing of two rivers with different salinity gradients. Happened in south America too. Also happens down the coast where the Indian and Atlantic mix. BBC has a David Attenborough special called Africa and the first or third episode is called &quot;Cape town&quot;and covers the topic.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My PhD is on water optics (important for calibrating and validating satellite imagery) </p>
<p>This looks like high suspended particle load (TSM) with perhaps a little dissolved coloured organic matter (CDOM).</p>
<p>While some phytoplankton, principally diatoms, but also some prymnesiophytes, have yellow/brown pigments, their blooms don't look like this. </p>
<p>You can't see differences in salinity (unless you can see in the microwave spectrum), but you can see the effect of differences in temperature and salinity as in the extreme example above. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very common phenomenon in rivers with varied sources. I've seen pictures of the west/east Nile river similar to that, as well as the Columbia/snake river and Missouri/Mississippi rivers. It boils down to a difference in the salinity and silt deposits in the river waters. You'll also see a similar occurrence when river water meets the ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one has really addressed what is causing the sharp boundary here, so I’ll comment.</p>
<p>The muddy water on the right is fresh, and has a high sediment (clay) content. The little clay particles all have the same charge, so they repel each other, and the water stays cloudy for weeks or indefinitely.</p>
<p>The water on the left has much higher salinity, and salts have their own charges.</p>
<p>At the boundary the waters are mixing quite quickly and some of the salts are attaching to the clay particles. After that the clay particles don’t repel each other, and they drop to the sea floor (creating mud-banks).</p>
<p>Source: have PhD and degree in related topics (remote sensing, soil science)</p>
<p>EDIT: accidentally swapped left and right; corrected now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
