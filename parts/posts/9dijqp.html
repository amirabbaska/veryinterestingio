		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine yourself floating in space with an deflated balloon. Inside the balloon is a quarter. Now if you inflate the balloon, you'd expect it to expand evenly. Also, as the balloon expands, the quarter floats in the middle somewhere with its flat sides facing some direction.</p>
<p>What astronomers are observing is that the universe expanded like the balloon was inflated, except the universe's expansion doesn't seem to be even like we would expect. What's even more strange is that the differences appear to be above/below our solar system's orbiting plane (the flat sides of the quarter.)</p>
<p>So there are two very strange things afoot here. 1) the balloon (the universe) doesn't appear to have expanded quite like we would expect it to. 2) the differences in expansion seem to line up with the orbital plane of our solar system, which is otherwise totally arbitrary (like the orientation of the quarter in the balloon.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically there is an underlying assumption that our universe should look essentially the same from any location, and that there's nothing special about where we are in it. </p>
<p>The Axis of Evil is an anomaly in the background radiation of the observable universe, which appears to line up oddly with our position.</p>
<p>If that were true, it would seem to suggest at least the possibility that the earlier statement is flawed, and raise quite a few questions about <em>why</em> our position is 'special.' However, there's definitely not strong agreement that this is actually the case, it has been suggested it could be coincidence, noise in how the data is processed, less significant than believed, or simply an error, among other ideas. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fixed Link: <a href="http://www.space.com/37334-earth-ordinary-cosmological-axis-evil.html" target="_blank">http://www.space.com/37334-earth-ordinary-cosmological-axis-evil.html</a></p>
<p>The Universe is thought to be mostly uniform, and ordinary, due to our Cosmological understanding of the Big Bang. Since everything began roughly the same exact time with the same materials. It makes since that statistically the universe will be similar from one end to another.</p>
<p>However, after taking several data points, and looking closely at the data, the variations between each point shows it's not uniform. There's oddities like temperature and even orientation. If a singular big bang occured, it wouldn't provide random results throughout our known universe.</p>
<p>Trying to explain statistically why things are random is a challenge. However, a greater one might be why a pole or section perfectly aligns with another, while most are random. This strange alignment is an Axis of Evil for cosmology to explain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
