I am asking for the very most basic explanation of what the hell a computer is and how it works. How do a bunch of separate components made of metal and plastic come together to create something we can use to make images, sound, text, and a whole new dimension of information to explore? How is this information fed to a machine made of metal and plastic, and how does the metal and plastic know how to interpret that information, even though it has no sentient will of its own? Am I the only one that is confused by what seems to be some form of inorganic magic humans have created? I feel like a lone caveman in the modern area,  scratching my head in amazement at all of the technology around us.  I've read a dozen explanations of the history of programming, and I still don't understand it. It seems like magic to me.</p></div></div>
