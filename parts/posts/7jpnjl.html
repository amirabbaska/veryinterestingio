		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The easy answer is no. If you mean combustion (or burning) of the bread, then there would be less calories because once combustion occurs (even partial) the byproducts are either indigestible or barely so. </p>
<p>If you mean dark toast, the kind you might get at 6 on the toaster, it has the same calories. The Maillard reaction is what drives browning and it is a complex process where proteins denature and bind to other proteins as well as carbohydrates and so forth created an amalgam of mixed molecules. Essentially this is what leads to that caramel/nuttiness you get when things are browned. However, this conformational change and denaturation does not decrease the calories because the overall building blocks are the same and still digestible.</p>
<p>However, if let’s say a byproduct of a Maillard reaction is an indigestible molecule that was previously digestible, you could argue that it is now lower in caloric value because it is no longer bioavailable energy. </p>
<p>Side note, a lot of people are talking about measuring calories by using a bomb calorimeter aka burning the item. This is no longer the method used for finding caloric value of food. Instead they find the net average of Atwater bioavailable nutrients and then use standardized values (e.g. 4 Kcal/g for Carbohydrates) to calculate the assumed caloric value. Again, this is obviously dependent on bioavailable sources of energy, not overall stored energy.</p>
<p>A perfect example of how a bomb calorimeter is not a feasible option, is Lettuce. Excluding the water (which is 95% of the material) lettuce is primarily fiber. Insoluble fiber in this case or in other words fiber we cannot breakdown (Cellulose). This material has no caloric value to us because it is not bioavailable (aside from small amounts created by gut fermentation thanks to helpful bacteria). So a piece of lettuce has a net caloric value of basically 0 in the Atwater system. In a bomb calorimeter however, it might have a much higher value because inside each of those cellulose walled cells is stored sugars, proteins, and so forth. Additionally, cellulose is essentially a starch made up of Beta-Glucose, however Beta-glucose is in a different conformation than Alpha-Glucose in starches we digest which means it is incompatible with our enzymes. However, combustion wise, cellulose and amylose (Alpha-glucose polysaccharide aka starch to most people) are equivalent in “Calories” in the context of a bomb calorimeter.  </p>
<p>Again, this is not the case in bioavailability. The only animals that can actually get the full caloric potential from plant material are foregut fermenters and hindgut fermenters, aka Cows and Horses. This is why they need multiple stomachs or a large cecum, in order to host helpful microorganisms to breakdown cellulose. Even Termites are not able to digest cellulose, but usually carry symbiotic organisms that can. </p>

<p>Addl. Note: /u/chuggsipas pointed out the fact that to be totally accurate about this discussion we have to really highlight that a Calorie at its base definition is the amount of energy required in order to raise one gram of water, by one degree Celsius. It’s important to distinguish this because while I do mention that a bomb calorimeter is not used for nutritional labeling values, it is the correct way to calculate calories in its true context. Another thing chugg brought up, and I absolutely agree with, is the fact that nutritional calories are a terrible measure of how our body uses energy. We do not just ingest and combust whatever is bioavailable, there are a multitude of processes that are dedicated to metabolism, storage, availability, etc that are not taken into account by flat caloric values. In fact evidence builds every year that quality of foods and caloric sources are more important than the overall calorie value. However, on some very basic level you can get a vague idea of your energy intake with the Atwater calorie system. </p>
<p>Edit: Added some clarification in regards to glucose in Cellulose.</p>
<p>Edit2: Fucked up and did L/D-Glucose instead of Alpha/Beta. Corrected that :X </p>
<p>Edit 3: Just wanted to say thank you to anyone who challenged or questioned anything I wrote. I definitely needed to add some information and make changes here and there. I appreciate it, especially since that’s what healthy discussion is about, and no one can be 100% correct, 100% of the time without some input from others! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heating up food enough to cause a chemical change (toasting or burning) reduces the total caloric content. However, the heat also tends to make those calories more accessible by breaking down the sugars so your body is more likely to absorb more of them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, so much misinformation on this. A calorie is a unit of energy. You can measure it by taking a piece of food and putting it into a bomb calorimeter, incinerating it, and measuring how much energy is released. So if you burned a piece of toast, you've already already burnt it and released its energy. Therefore your number of calories in the toast is less than the original amount of calories in the unburnt toast.  </p>
<p>Any answer that talks about digestion is completely incorrect, which is why calories are such a controversial measure for food energy. It doesn't take into account digestibility.  To make calorie counting work, you should also be measuring the amounts of material you excrete and incinerating it to see how much unused calories have just gone through your system.  Even then you're missing the fact that some calories in food are more difficult for your body to process and consume more energy to digest.</p>
<p>So by burning the toast, you have reduced its calories by definition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends.</p>
<p>Burnt toast would become unpalatable before there was significant oxidation that would reduce the caloric content.</p>
<p>If you burnt it thoroughly, it would significantly reduce the calories you get because those calories would be destroyed.</p>
<p>Of course, you'd probably get less calories from burnt toast because you wouldn't eat as much of it because it tastes terrible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
