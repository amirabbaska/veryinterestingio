		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A typical non-FHA/USDA loan usually requires 20% downpayment because the lender doesn't want to be too exposed in the event of a foreclosure.  The government loans tend to be more forgiving in regards to credit.</p>
<p>The two houses we've bought over the years have been FHA because we didn't have 800+ credit scores and 20% down.  FHA loans generally require only 3-5% down and you can sometimes get a downpayment assistance program that will help you with that 3%.  We bought our two houses with about $500 out of pocket per house.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
