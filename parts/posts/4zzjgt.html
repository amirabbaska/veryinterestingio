		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/X-cessiveDreamer is correct, what you are referring to is a common behaviour in flies, which is they form leks.  </p>
<p>A lek is a gathering of a bunch of male flies which come together using a landmark in order to find mates.  If you think about how small insects are in comparison to the landscape, it can be very difficult for insects of the same species to find each other in order to mate, which this behaviour helps to solve.  </p>
<p>As many people have pointed out, sometimes these leks will follow you around.  this is because people are pretty tall, and flies can sometimes start using you as a landmark on which to gather around.  Flies that specifically look for high spots as geographic features are said to be &quot;hilltopping&quot;.</p>
<p>Source: am currently in a master's of entomology</p>
<p>Edit: For people asking about specifics of lekking behaviour.  That depends greatly on the species, and can be altered by colours, relative height, amount of light, etc.  I don't feel comfortable giving any precise recommendations or opinions</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not 100% sure what you mean exactly but you might be referring to a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lek_mating" target="_blank">lek</a>. It's a mating behaviour which varies somewhat between different species. But basically a bunch of males get together close to a prominent feature, such as a branch or the light fitting in your room. When one encounters another they have a bit of a fight and the loser moves down and the winner moves up where he is more likely to encounter a mate.</p>
<p>I do do ecology for a job but I'm no entomologist, I am relying on some hazy 20 year old knowledge from university for this, so please correct me if I'm wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insects don't really have brains the same way your or I do and they don't learn, <del>per say</del> per se, thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BaaruRaimu" target="_blank">/u/BaaruRaimu</a>. They have ganglia that just cause them to have reactions based on stimuli which are very fast, that's why if you swat at a fly it flys away really quickly but seconds later it will return. It doesn't learn that you're a danger to it. <strong>SEE MY EDIT THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY CORRECT</strong> </p>
<p>Now onto this, basically if there's some sort of positive stimuli for the fly (like a scent that is released by a female fly for mating) it will attract all flies in the same way towards that area and they don't really think about what could be there they are just attracted to the area. </p>
<p>I might be misinformed on specifics for this since I'm not a fly expert, so if someone spots something I'm wrong about reply to me. </p>
<p>EDIT: So after several replies it seems like I am in fact, very incorrect about the fact that flies do not learn, and that even with ganglia they are able to. Did some research on it myself and yes it appears that flies do have some basic learning abilities, so the first part of my answer is not actually correct. I apologies, I was told this in my first year psychology class, since we examined some differences in gray vs white matter and how gray matter has high learning potential, while white matter is more involved in fast responses (myelin sheath). I was then used the analogy I gave where if you swat a fly it keeps coming back since it does not learn. Thanks for all those that corrected me, will leave my answer up for reference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

*Not a scientist but I did help a legit scientist with his business model for an organic product he invented, that farmers could spray so males and females of a specific pest could not find each other to mate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
