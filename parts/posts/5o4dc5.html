		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As /u/RobusEtCeleritas said, they are going too fast for orbit. The relevant question then is how much would get through the atmosphere without being scattered. The opposite situation is something that actually occurs: high energy protons from space reaching Earth. While it is hard to find the exact information I'm looking for on this <a href="http://pdg.lbl.gov/2011/reviews/rpp2011-rev-cosmic-rays.pdf" target="_blank">the particle data group</a> seems to indicate that most protons with TeV energies would be scattered long before they got through the atmosphere. <a href="http://www.space.com/images/i/000/034/337/original/cosmic-rays-nasa.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;downsize=*:600" target="_blank">Artists's impression</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Particle physics aside, a &quot;cannon pointed toward space&quot; can't put <em>anything</em> into Earth orbit, no matter how powerful it is. Depending on the launch velocity, one of two things will happen: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The projectile will fly away and never come back.</p>
</li>
<li>It will impact the Earth somewhere else.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only way to achieve an orbit is to apply some thrust <em>after</em> you reach the desired orbit height. No injection burn, splat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. It would almost surely interact with atmospheric particles and be broken up into constituent parts very quickly (within a km or so at sea level densities). </p>
<p>Imagine the LHC experiment, but with lots of opposing targets. Even half of the LHC energy (eg one accelerated particle hitting a particle at rest) is enough to cause the fired particle to breakup and cause a chain reaction of decay and broken up particles.</p>
<p>I'm on my phone and can't get a nice link, but look at how particle detectors like Pierre Auger Observatory or Gamma-ray observatories like VERITAS work. You're basically doing this in reverse sending the particle shower into space instead. Gravity plays no role (at least for the showers I've dealt with).</p>
