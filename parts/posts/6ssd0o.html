		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, most perfumes are alcohol based.  Alcohol is very volatile, and the majority of it evaporates quickly after leaving the bottle.  That's why if you ever talk to someone selling perfume (sometimes you can't help it), they tell you to let the scent mellow for a little bit before you really know what it will smell like.</p>
<p>The compound that gives things like onions and garlic their potency is released when you cut into them, and is intended as an irritant.  This was to ward off things that would otherwise eat the onion in the original habitats.  Side note, these compounds have the ability to destroy the cells of dogs and cats, so should never be fed to them in any form.  </p>
<p>The compounds released by cutting onions convert their amino acid sulfoxides to sulfenic acid.  This what makes you cry, but also what sticks to your hands, and is very difficult to remove with normal washing.  Most guides say stainless steel will help to remove the odor, and I've found it usually works for me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an explanation but advice that might be useful if you are on this thread: You can get rid of most of the smell of onion and garlic from your hands if you wash your hands without rubbing them, just let the water run on your hands for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Is doesn't get 100% of the smell but it's better than the usual method.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

They make stainless steel bars for the purpose but you can just run the inside of your sink as well. I don't recall why it works but I'm quite sure it's not bullshit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
