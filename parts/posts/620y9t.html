		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So as many of you have probably heard, the first attempted &quot;head transplant&quot; is scheduled to occur later this year. I haven't been able to find scientific articles on the subject but it seems they plan to fully connect the nerves/veins/etc, and the spine. However to my knowledge we still haven't figured out how to repair a typical spinal injury, so how can we, even if just in theory, expect to fuse two different spines to any extent?</p>
<p>Edit: so this blue up quite a bit. For the record, I am well aware we can't fix do a body transplant yet, I simply wanted to know how we could even attempt it when we hadn't overcome a major hurdle like that though.</p>
<p>I am well aware the odds of success are super low, that's now what I'm asking about. </p>
<p>I do believe a body transplant is something we could one day achieve, just not yet. Eventually someone has to try, and that's what this is to me. This year's failure could led to next year's success</p></div></div>

<p>In real terms, we have no way of knowing if the spinal nerves will re-fuse and if signals will flow again. Present medical knowledge is that once there is a catastrophic cord injury and severance, then it is pretty much over from a neurological point of view. </p>
<p>The issue here is that the brain stem deals with and controls all autonomous functions of the body (heart beat, breathing, etc) - which presumably will be above the incision point. It is unknown whether the brain stem will be able to send signals down the new spinal nerves, thus there is a very real risk that the &quot;head&quot; will not be able to breathe or function without life support. Combined with that, it is unknown whether the donor body's other functions (digestion, excretion etc) can be maintained by the donor brain, especially if the spinal fusion fails. </p>
<p>It appears that the head donor is terminally ill and has agreed to take part in a &quot;last ditch&quot; attempt at furthering of his life. He already has a terminal neurological condition which affects his body, therefore the logic is that if his head and brain &quot;survive&quot; the operation but there is no cord fusion giving movement or any quality of life, he hasn't &quot;lost&quot; anything as his brain is still in a crippled body and will likely die in due course. </p>
<p>From a medical science point of view, it will be fascinating to see what happens and he should be thanked for his courage and generously in effectively donating his body for the advancement of medical science and understanding. However, I fear that the outcome will not be successful, and for that, I wish him a safe and peaceful trip. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The surgeon claims that this will all be possible because he plans on using a super-sharp knife to cut the spinal cord cleanly. </p>
<p>That's all well and good...but, axonal injury is still axonal injury. Wallerian degeneration (in which the nerve cell dies all the way back to the nerve body) will still occur. Nerves can regenerate after Wallerian degeneration, but they do so at a very slow rate. </p>
<p>I can't imagine a way this would work out such that the patient wouldn't have to be on life support for at least 6 months, likely longer, <em>in the best case scenario</em>...notwithstanding the secondary infections he'd likely get which might kill him before anything good happens. </p>
<p>Of course, the whole goal of this is to prove us naysayers wrong, and I, for one, would be amazingly excited to be proved wrong. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spinal cord injury researcher here. You are absolutely correct, we have no idea how to repair a typical SCI... however, in this case the nerves of both patients are likely fully intact, making it a much easier job than coaxing cells to regrow following an injury.</p>
<p>That being said, I agree with u/AHoddy that this is extremely unlikely to work. This is more of an experiment to see what will happen as well as a &quot;last-ditch&quot; attempt to save a terminally ill patient. </p>
<p>Also, thank you for calling the procedure by its proper name: a body transplant. It irks me to no end when people call it a head transplant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
