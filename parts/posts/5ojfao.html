		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thermoceptors of the skin are not only stimulated by temperature but also some chemicals. Menthol cools, capsaicin warms, etc. These receptors (TRPV1 or -2)  are activated by the stimulus, and when they're activated they send signals to your thalamus and cortex - which perceives that particular signal as &quot; cold/hot&quot;.
So if you stimulated them by say light touch, your brain would still interpret that as cold. Fortunately that's not the case typically. So, each receptor responds to a certain modality of sensation, and when that happens your brain has a particular association with it. </p>
<p>As someone else mentioned, some areas of the body are more densely packed with receptors. Biologically it makes sense that important/vulnerable areas are more sensitive. So you realize danger quickly when appropriate, and don't freeze or burn off your laser-snake.</p>
<p>Interestingly, you can force some receptors to respond to a stimulus that it doesn't normally recognize. For example, exerting a great deal of pressure onto the light sensing photoreceptors in the eye will turn them &quot;on&quot; and your brain perceives light. Hence why you see lights if someone punches you in the face.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think these are actually incorrect - this area of the body is a mucous membrane. From almighty wiki: &quot;...they are able to absorb a number of substances and toxins but are vulnerable regarding pain&quot;. Thus the menthol can actually make it inside the body vs. normal skin tissue that it cannot enter as easily. Rub some inside your nostril, under your tongue, in your eye etc... </p>
<p>Same reason hot peppers wont 'burn' your hands, but they will burn when they hit your mouth, or vapours go in your eye, or you choke your chicken with a handful of habaneros.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
