		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do not know how our experience or information is encoded and decoded in the brain. As in precisely how the strength/association between neuron pairs changes or the neuron network structure of the brain changes.</p>
<p>What we do know is that short-term and long-term memory are probably two very separate processes. In fact, it is from observation and experiments that researchers propose the existence of a separate form of memory called short-term memory. This wikipedia entry highlights some of the major ones. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-term_memory" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-term_memory</a>.</p>
<p>Short-term memory mainly describes the ability we have to retain various pieces of information and manipulate/transform them. Essentially this is what we mean by &quot;thought&quot;. Long term memory on the other hands describes the changes in our brain that allows us to recall things (actually it's closer to piecing back information rather than recalling).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I think you have a bit of a misunderstanding of what short term and long term memory are, and what brain structures are involved in both. Your hippocampus is NOT involved in short term memory, only long term memory. The primary brain structure involved in short term memory (which is better called &quot;working memory&quot;) is your frontal lobe. The term working memory is preferred because your frontal lobe does more than just short term memory. If you were to make a judgement call of how sure you were of a memory, that in itself is like a different type of memory called meta-memory</p>
<p>Any memory that you don't have to constantly repeat to yourself is already encoded in your hippocampus and considered long term. So any fact you can tell me right now is long term memory. This can be something as deeply encoded as &quot;what is your name?&quot;, something you will never forget, to &quot;what was the last song you listened to?&quot; something that you may have already forgotten, and even if you haven't, probably will very soon. How long a memory lasts has nothing to do with whether it is short term or long term. Short term memories must constantly be repeated to yourself--they cannot exit your brain. For example, memorising the squence &quot;29483482942&quot; is an exercise of short term memory. So Dory in Finding Nemo actually has long-term memory loss, not short term memory loss. /u/sonomodata described it really well as &quot;thought&quot;, which I think for the most part is true.</p>
<p>So memory from the frontal lobes are &quot;moved&quot; to the hippocampus as soon as a long term memory is developed. How? That's a tough question to answer. The simplest explanation is through a process called Long-Term potentiation, or LTP. LTP is really complicated, but the short version is that glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. The type of receptor that most often binds to glutamate is called an AMPA receptor. AMPA receptors open sodium channels. Glutamate can also bind to a type of receptor called an NMDA receptor. NMDA receptors allow calcium into the cell, but cannot function unless enough AMPA receptors are activated. Once the NMDA receptor is activated, the calcium influx actually causes the synthesis of additional AMPA receptors, strengthening the neuronal connection.</p>
<p>It is through this process that short term memory in the frontal lobe are consolidated to long term memory in the hippocampus.</p>
<p>When people talk about sleep, what they're talking about is a process of systems consolidation, where the hippocampus becomes less and less involved with a memory the longer it as been since the memory was learned. Instead, the hippocampus seems to &quot;move&quot; the memory to other association areas of the brain, a really fascinating process that happens during sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm just going to chime in here and stop any ideas before they get out of hand. We literally do not know.</p>
<p>My degrees are in neurobiology, physiology, and behavior, from pretty decent schools. Granted, that was 10 years ago, but I've kept up on research.</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing while in school is that we couldn't answer that exact question.</p>
<p>Then I went and got a TBI at the temporal-parietal junction, with secondary damage to the hippocampus. I can literally remember everything that I learned in school, and almost every other memory, but I can't get short term memories into long term memory anymore.</p>
<p>I have been in contact with all my old professors. But at the end of the day, we just don't know the answer. Don't get fooled by anyone here giving an answer, if they know the answer, then please, tell me and every other doctor on the planet that is studying this. But first and foremost, tell ME, because it is affecting me personally, and I happen to have gone to school to study it </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't really know how memory works. I mean really. The long term memory is still almost entirely a mystery. So take everything i say with the understanding that i might well be wrong.</p>
<p>Long term memory is stored in distributed networks. Hippocampus is somehow a crucial part of the encoding based simply on the fact that it does not happen without a working hippocampus. However it doesn't seem to affect recall at all. What it actually does we don't know. Asetylecholine seems to be the central neurotransmitter for memory formation.</p>
<p>Long term memory is divided roughly to episodic memory and semantic memory. The separation can be inferred from the fact that you can lose one without losing the other. The episodic memory holds stuff about the events in your life. Like your last birthday or what you ate for breakfast. The semantic memory holds stuff like what is a birthday or a breakfast. </p>
<p>We actually remember only bits of what we think we do in terms of episodic memory. We remember some details and connect them to some more general model or schema in our head. So a memory of a particular day might be two or three actual details filled with what an average day might have been. This is why it is very easy to make false memories trough suggestion. Add something that fits the general schema and it fits nicely in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know the precise mechanism because we don't know how memory works in that much detail.  But we do know that it seems to happen in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.  Various experiments have found that interruptions in NREM sleep can negatively impact memory tasks.  And also that playing recordings of things learned during the day during NREM sleep can cause those things to be remembered better than memories with no associated recording being played.  </p>
<p>Speculativly, it might be that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_spindle" target="_blank">Sleep Spindles</a> are related to the memory transfer mechanism but we really don't know how exactly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
