		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The old-school way was to actually burn it and see how much heat it produced: a calorie is an actual measure of energy.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the food would be blended up and analyzed for the amounts of fat, protein, carbohydrate and alcohol (the stuff you can get energy/calories from), and knowing the amount of calories in each of those by weight, they just calculate how many calories it should have.  The advantage here is that they can differentiate between calories your body will use, and calories it won't (like that in fiber: it'll burn, but our bodies don't digest it).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are also tools available that measure calories. That's not necessarily how &quot;they&quot; determine how many calories are in a packaged or menu item, but it's one way they can get a value on how many calories some foods have.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's easily estimated by measuring the carbohydrate, protein, and fat contents. Each gram of carbohydrates and protein contains approximately 4 Calories (kilocalories). Each gram of fat contains approximately 9 Calories. You can check the math since the nutrition facts should also include the contents of each of these.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Woah I have the real question here. If they determine calories by setting food on fire and measuring the heat it produces, can you apply that to anything you could set on fire? Like could you find out the calories of a chair?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the comments about methods:<br />
A calorie and a Calorie (food) are not the same. 1 calorie is the amount of energy it takes to raise 1 gram of water by 1 degree celsius at 1 atmosphere of pressure (isn't metric great??). 1 Calorie (big C) is the measurement used in food, and is actually 1000 calories, or 1 kilocalorie, or 1 kcal.</p>
<p>Not directly relevant to your question, but still useful to know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
