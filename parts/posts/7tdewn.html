		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main limiting factor was expected to be accumulation of dust on the solar panels. They had a good idea of the rate at which dust was likely to accumulate and made the panels large enough that they would still provide enough power to complete the 90-day mission even as the dust accumulated.</p>
<p>What they had not accurately predicted was how frequently the wind in the thin atmosphere of Mars would be strong enough to blow the dust off. It turns out that these &quot;cleaning events&quot; are frequent enough that the dust never got to a level where the rovers couldn't operate. The amount of power varies with the seasons and with dust levels and the amount of driving and science they can do varies accordingly, but it's always been enough to keep the systems going.</p>
<p>The rest of the systems lasted longer in part because most things built tough enough to last the harsh conditions of launch and landing are not going to fall apart in a couple of months or after driving a few hundred metres. I doubt anybody expected them to go for as long as they have, but they knew if they had power they could go for a lot longer than 90 days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So - just incase anyone doubts the orig 90 day claim.....</p>
<p><a href="https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/bitstream/handle/2014/11979/02-0732.pdf" target="_blank">Here is the technical report that describes it</a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/BZfT2" target="_blank">This</a> is the pertinent chart - that shows the life expectation for Spirit was 92 sols, Opportunity 100 sols.  Both would only JUST make the 90 sol level 1 requirement.</p>
<p>Many things have contributed to the long life of the rover - here are a few...</p>
<p>We don't use direct to Earth communications very often, but the mission was designed to do so because UHF relay communications hadn't been proved at Mars when they landed - and using UHF over DTE saves huge ammounts of power.</p>
<p>Using some creative ops planning - the rovers can survive on less power than expected.</p>
<p>While Mars taketh-away in the terms of dust deposition on the solar panels - it also giveth with wind events cleaning them again.</p>
<p>Finding north-facing slopes to survive the winter wasn't something anyone conceived of before launch.</p>
<p>The rover's thermal insulation and batteries both perform better than expected.</p>
<p>In short - there comes a point at which a spacecraft is basically good enough to last a very long time on Mars - pending some external intervention such as too much dust without cleaning events or random failure.   That 90 day requirement meant testing for 270 daily cycles.  That 270 figure might basically make things 'tough enough'</p>
<p>That said - Opportunity is showing it's age.  The flash memory is unreliable and so we operate in a RAM only mode each day (any data products that don't make it down to earth before we go to sleep, are lost). The Mini-TES and Mossbauer spectrometers are both no longer working.  Both front steering actuators are not used.</p>
<p>And here's another point - if people still doubt they were not expected to last.   The MER project gave a spare deep space transponder to the MRO project.  That meant that MRO is on the exact same X-Band frequency as Spirit was.   Once MRO got to Mars two years after Spirit did - it was an operational nightmare.  You couldn't uplink to one while the other was visible to Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there! Astronomer here. This is a really great question, and some of the top comments have hit the nail on the head when it comes to the technological side of Opportunity's over-delivery.</p>
<p>However, I do think some of the top comments have glossed over a certain fact: NASA loves to under-promise and over-deliver. Opportunity is not a lone case: Cassini, Kepler, and many other space missions have operated far beyond their mission &quot;expectations.&quot; The reality is that if NASA promises an 8 year mission and we get an 8 year mission, nobody is that impressed---NASA just did their job. If they look at the optimistic predictions and promise a 12 year mission, then the spacecraft could underperform and suddenly the public is in for a world of unforgivable disappointment. But, if NASA expects 8 years and promises 4, then we're suddenly infinitely impressed with the effectiveness of NASA engineering. In the latter case, it's pretty easy for NASA to make their case for continued funding.</p>
<p>Very conservative estimates serve NASA's agenda best, and I think that's perfectly fair.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 90 days figure was the minimal time that the rovers had to survive according to design specifications. That means that the engineers who designed it had to have a 99% probability (whatever the spec was) that it would last at least 90 days. Now of course those kind of flagship missions are built to very high standards, and with a bit of luck (dust devil cleaning the solar panels for example) they can far outlast their initial design spec.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As u/mollymoo already pointed out the accumulation of dust is a major factor. But to add to that, projects such as these are heavily over engineered. The requirements for the parts on a Mars rover are incredibly high and everything is tested heavily. On a rover this expensive you don't want to leave anything to chance. </p>
<p>Also, the 90 days was the bare minimum. In the case that a lot went wrong it would probably at least function this long. All parts are almost certainly engineered for a lot longer than 90 days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
