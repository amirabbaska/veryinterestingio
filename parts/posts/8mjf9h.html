		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, very few jurisdictions have people swear on bibles anymore.  Those that do offer alternates to non-Christians.  Some religions, like the Jehovah's Witnesses, who do not allow swearing, are allowed to affirm instead.</p>
<p>Note there is no legal significance to swearing on the bible or any religious book, it is purely symbolic.  All the swearing process means is that you are promising to tell the truth and acknowledging that you can be charged with perjury if you do not.  Any religious trappings are legally irrelevant to that purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't have to swear on a Bible, or swear at all. You can simply affirm that you will tell the truth. As you noted non-religious or non-Christian people may have an issue with swearing on the Bible. Likewise some Christian denominations do not believe in swearing or oath-taking and aslo affirm/attest rather than swear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good answers here; it's worth adding that &quot;some people don't want to swear on a Bible&quot; is not a new problem, and the US constitution has avoided it from the very start.  In the American colonial era, the Quakers were a common religious group that thought swearing an oath was forbidden.  So the constitution requires the president and congress to &quot;swear <strong>or affirm</strong>&quot; that they will obey the Constitution.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently was called as a witness in a grand jury proceeding and while I wasb's terribly surprised that no Bible was offered, I was a little taken aback that the oath the foreman read didnt even contain &quot;so help me God.&quot; As an atheist who isn't hung up on such things but still feels it's important not to particpate in civil religion, I had given some thought to how I should respond and in the end it didnt matter.</p>
<p>I was a little amused that I was asked to &quot;swear or affirm&quot; but didn't really have a choice (I didn't have to repeat the oath, just say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;I do&quot;) so only God knows if I was swearing or affirming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
