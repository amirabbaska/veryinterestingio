I'm the <a href="http://www.ted.com/about/our-organization/who-we-are" target="_blank">science curator</a> for TED Talks, a <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/author/david-biello/" target="_blank">contributing editor</a> at Scientific American, and just wrote a book called &quot;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unnatural-World-Remake-Civilization-Earths/dp/1476743908" target="_blank">The Unnatural World</a>&quot; about this idea that people's impacts have become so pervasive and permanent that we deserve our own epoch in the geologic time scale. Some people call it the Anthropocene, though that's not my favorite name for this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/unnaturalworld/" target="_blank">new people's epoch</a>, which will include everything from the potential <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/42/fakes/the-case-for-bringing-back-the-passenger-pigeon" target="_blank">de-extinction of animals like the passenger pigeon</a> or woolly mammoth to big interventions to try to clean up the pollution from our long-term pyromania when it comes to fossil fuels. I live near a Superfund site (no, <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/one-hurricane-is-enough-to-ruin-your-year/" target="_blank">really</a>) and I've been lucky enough to visit five out of seven continents to report on people, the environment, and energy. </p>
<p>I'll be joining starting at 2 PM EST (18 UT). AMA.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://twitter.com/dbiello/status/808733612573159424" target="_blank">Proof!</a></p>
<p>EDIT 3:30 PM EST: Thank you all for the great questions. I feel bad about leaving some of them unanswered but I have to get back to my day job. I'll try to come back and answer some more later tonight or in days to come. Regardless, thank you so much for this. I had a lot of fun. And remember: there's still hope for this unnatural (but oh so beautiful) world of ours! - dbiello</p></div></div>
