		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One theory is a concept called Koinophillia. It asserts that organisms seek to minimize the number of &quot;unusual&quot; features in their mates and are thus attracted to features that seem common or standard. The thinking is that this would increase the likelihood that the offspring will survive into adulthood and cary on their genetic traits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer: I am NOT AN EXPERT, but this was what I was told when I was part of a small study to find the “prettiest” face.</p>
<p>Humans apparently subconsciously look for genetic diversity and this is represented in a preference for “commonized” features found in a large portion of the given sample size. In the particular study I was part of, I was asked to find the “prettiest” face given 6 faces. </p>
<p>5 of the faces were real humans, and 1 was a computer image of average of the 5 faces. Given 15 trials, I selected the computer image 12 times, not knowing it was a digital recreation. I was told afterwards that most of the participants (n=68) had similar results. </p>
<p>(inb4 how did I not know one was not real— I was told by researchers that all of them were human faces, and in the heat of the moment I didn’t question that)</p>
<p>Again, I’m just providing my own bit of hearsay knowledge I picked up when I participated in a study. </p>
<p>EDIT: by “average” I mean a biological averaging of facial features (thus, genes), NOT just a 5/10 in looks or smth</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A symmetrical face implies solid genetics. Good skin is an indicator of good health. Some features, such as large eyes, smooth skin, or vibrant hair, indicate youth, and youth indicates reproductive health (more so in women, whose reproductive health declines much faster with age than men's - this is why men are more prone to picking younger partners), as well as survivability in a theoretical crisis (e.g.: tiger attacks the cave).</p>
<p>And in general, attractive features are considered attractive because our brains read them as &quot;normal,&quot; whereas features we consider unattractive are read as &quot;abnormal.&quot; Normalcy is an indicator of balanced genes from a diverse set of sources; as sexually reproducing animals, humans want their genes to be as thoroughly mixed as possible to ensure the species' health and resilience. </p>
<p>Some people are attracted to unusual features because those features exists in their family, so they grew up looking at them and consider them more normal than others do, but mostly what you think of as &quot;pretty&quot; is just close to average.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good genetics (fewer abnormalities) are expressed through a high degree of facial symmetry, which is the primary indicator of beauty. The other is the correlation of the face to the population mean. The most beautiful faces are those which are perfectly symmetrical AND express the average of your particular population/heritage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You unconsciously pick up a lot of cues about the health of an individual from their face. </p>
<p>Think of all of the different things we maintain through hygiene. Washing our face, clearing blackheads, cutting our hair, washing our hair, putting product in our hair, if you’re a girl, you put on makeup. All of this done to communicate that you’re a healthy individual, both mentally and physically.</p>
<p>We’re highly attuned to reading people’s faces.</p>
<p>How often have you seen someone and thought to yourself “Wow that person looks exhausted.” Or you see someone with a sallow complexion and unconsciously question why they look sick. Or you see someone with rings under their eyes and think “are they not getting enough sleep or are they eating improperly?” Or when you see a person with dirty, poorly maintained hair and think “I wonder if they’re ok. They look like they’re struggling.” Or you see someone with acne and think “Wow they probably aren’t taking good care of their skin/aren’t eating right/aren’t drinking enough water/haven’t read about one of the 9 billion bullshit acne cures.”</p>
<p>Those are all the superficial things. When we look at faces, we’re also looking for emotional cues. We’re searching the person’s face for indicators of their emotional health. I’m sure everyone’s had an experience where they’re at a bar and finally build up the courage to approach that pretty girl, only to get a weird feeling from her in the first few sentences.</p>
<p>After you leave, you try and figure out what went wrong, but for some reason, instead of words coming into your head, you just get a picture of her face and how her eyes are opened just a little too wide and how her expressions are all a little too animated. </p>
<p>If you’re asking more about like why we find some faces attractive and other faces less attractive, it’s also got a lot to do with bone structure. A symmetrical face with “good” bone structure probably unconsciously communicates that the person’s bone structure in the rest of their body is likely symmetrical (which is pretty important when it comes to avoiding chronic injury, because asymmetrical structures lead to compensation patterns which themselves lead to injury) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
