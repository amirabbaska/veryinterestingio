		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that nobody really knows for sure. The longer answer is that tickling likely evolved as a behavior that teaches humans (and other animals) to instinctively protect vulnerable areas of their bodies.</p>
<p>People tend to be ticklish in vulnerable areas of the body -- the neck, the underarm, the belly, etc, (the exceptions being hands and feet, which just happen to have a large number of nerve endings). Thus when children play (think &quot;tickle fights&quot;), they learn to protect those areas, which could come in handy during an actual fight.</p>
<p>Laughter is an involuntary reaction, and It's possible that during tickle fights, it functions as a way of calling for help. It's also possible that it's just a biological &quot;accident&quot; that tickling triggers this reaction. But nobody really knows for sure.</p>
<p>Edit: Some people have suggested that laughing is a signal that basically says &quot;everything is fine, we're not really fighting&quot;. I honestly don't know, but it sounds like a reasonable suggestion. Especially since smiling is a rather aggressive act among primates (it is baring your teeth, after all.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tickling triggers the fight or flight response, the reason it works is a fear that someone is attacking you. However, when it has no effect the whole situation basically becomes a huge anti-climax which is hilarious.</p>
<p>Try this next time, if you are tickling your kids or nieces and nephews - first try it cold, without saying anything just do the tickling motion on a perfectly calm kid - it doesn't work as well but if you start by saying something like &quot;I'm gonna get you&quot; or something like that it will cause bursts of laughter. You need to build up the situation: &quot;the tickle monster is coming&quot; and then take long drawn out steps towards them, move your hands slowly in an arc like claws, it all builds the tension and increases the hilarity. </p>
<p>This is the same reason anger is funny, usually, hearing someone yell in anger would cause you to be afraid, but since you are safe their anger is ineffectual and the situation becomes funny. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ticklishness is an involuntary protective response to sensitive areas that when agitated would cause pain. Typical responses to pain are either crying or laughing. Thus, when you get someone REALLY good, and don't stop, they inevitably start crying...or pee. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
