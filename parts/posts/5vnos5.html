After the heavy rainstorms, I've been walking to a park near my house when the sun sets, and the croaking of what sounds like hundreds and hundreds of frogs can be heard all throughout the park. There are no bodies of water in the park, so how can the frogs just appear where there wasn't any water before?</p></div></div>

<p>This does happen in arid climates like the Southwest more than you might think. There are special native frogs and toads (like the New Mexico Spadefoot) that will sit underground for a long time, sometimes years*, until a heavy rain hits the area. They can stay underground for so long because they coat themselves in mucus and enter a torpor (very deep sleep) state. Once that perfect rain hits, they'll come up to mate and spawn. This whole process is very quick (on the order of a week or so!). They need to mate, spawn, and the tadpoles need to grow up quickly enough to be independent of standing water. After the mating-fest, the adults will dig back down several feet and wait again.</p>
<p>EDIT: Decades might be a bit of an embellishment here...more likely just a few years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While there are possible explanations such as meteorological events like waterspouts that could cause it to &quot;rain frogs&quot;, the more likely answer is these frogs are actually toads.</p>
<p>Toads typically don't live near bodies of water, however they still prefer darker/wet climates to prevent their skin from drying out, so post rainfall is the perfect opportunity for them to come out and eat/mate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
