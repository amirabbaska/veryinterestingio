		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A fish basically just lets water flow <em>past</em> its gills, which are feather-like structures that contain ton of very thin filaments that are filled with tiny blood vessels.</p>
<p>Fish don't break apart the water to get oxygen; ocean water has oxygen dissolved in it (just like you can dissolve CO2 in a fizzy drink). As the water flows past the gills, the oxygen naturally floats into the blood vessels that have a very low oxygen concentration, filling that part of the blood back up with oxygen. The oxygenated blood then flows back into the fish's body.</p>
<p>The exact same thing happens in reverse with ammonia, CO2, and other wastes, which float out of the vessels where they have a higher concentration into the ocean, where it has a lower concentration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In fish gills there are a set of Gill arches, each Gill arch has protrusions called Gill filaments and each Gill filament has Gill plates. This provides a large surface area for exchange of substances. As water flows over the gills oxygen diffuses into the blood and carbon dioxide diffuses out. As well as this waste materials like ammonia (fish don't have urea, they instead have waste ammonia) move out of the blood into the water. Cartiligionous fish (like sharks) have a parallel flow system where water and flood flow in the same direction so diffusion is 50% efficient as diffusion can only occur across some of the gill plate as equilibrium is reached between blood and water. Bony fish have a counter current flow system where blood and water flow in opposite directions so diffusion takes place across the whole gill plate and this is around 80% efficient. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Cellular Respiration</strong></p>
<p>Most organisms you know undergo what's called &quot;cellular respiration.&quot; Cellular respiration is the process of taking in glucose and (breathing in) oxygen in order to produce carbon dioxide, water, and ATP (a type of energy unit for cells). Humans do it, animals do it, and (contrary to popular belief) plants do it too. Cellular respiration is the exact opposite of photosynthesis, which takes ATP, water, and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and glucose (plants actually do both).</p>
<p>So just like us, fish breathe in oxygen (and require glucose), to create energy, water, and carbon dioxide (which they exhale). Gills are very much like lungs, in that they take oxygen to the blood stream. Water has oxygen dissolved in it, so the gills can absorb it just fine.</p>
<p><strong>Then why don't gills work on land?</strong></p>
<p>The shape of the gills are a big clue here. Ever notice how gills look fibrous, or like someone has made repeated slices/cuts in them? This increases the surface area, which allows more water to touch them, which means more area in which oxygen can be absorbed. On land, the gills collapse, lowering the surface area. Nowhere near as much oxygen can be absorbed in this situation, and the fish literally suffocates. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
