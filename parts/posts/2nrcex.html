This is the case even when resting, so your body has to constantly release this heat to keep your internal temperature at 37 C.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your <em>skin</em> is not 37 degrees, it's cooler than that. See <a href="http://www.healthyheating.com/Definitions/Definition_Images/facts_1.gif" target="_blank">this chart</a>. </p>
<p>If the ambient temperature is higher than your skin temperature, heat will be transferred into your body. That's why 37 degrees feels stifling -- your skin is a bit cooler than that normally, and therefore you're taking in more heat than your body wants.  </p>
<p>Your body then adjusts your skin temperature to be higher than ambient (if possible), which allows you to transfer heat out once again. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is not a static system; it is constantly producing waste heat which it needs to shed. If the ambient temperature is at the body's optimal internal temperature, then it is difficult to maintain that temperature (and indeed it would be impossible if we did not sweat). You need a lower ambient temperature in order to efficiently and quickly shed waste heat without excess sweating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For one (this is just a nitpick), <em>skin</em> temperature is lower than body temperature, so if your surroundings were body temperature, it would actually be warming your skin.</p>
<p>The main reason is that air is a poor conductor of heat. It holds your body heat in like a blanket. So you'd need air to be significantly cooler than your body in order to have equilibrium. </p>
<p>Your perception of hot or cold is actually a perception of heat energy entering or leaving your skin, rather than a measurement of temperature. This explains why 25c air feels warm, 25c water feels cool, and 25c metal feels cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
