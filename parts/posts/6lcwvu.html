		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The statement that the photon is the mediating particle of the electromagnetic force means that the electromagnetic field which causes that force can be decomposed into objects called photons.</p>
<p>This is not something easy to see in quantum mechanics--one needs to use quantum field theory to treat photons mathematically. This is because the wavefunction is a function of the positions of a predefined set of objects being treated in a problem. In such a context, the reaction between two objects can only involve those objects themselves--because there is no way to directly compare the wavefunction of  two systems with a different number of particles.</p>
<p>The mediation of the electromagnetic force by photons requires creating and destroying photons--an electron emits a photon and another electron absorbs it. Quantum field theory is a framework that allows that allows particles to be created and destroyed, and so describes the mediation process. This works because as a field theory, QFT describes the state of a set of fields defined over space-time, rather than as a function of a discrete number of points.</p>
<p>However, the notion of mediation is a bit, shall we say, loose. The coulomb force is an effect that arises because of &quot;virtual photons&quot;-- as someone else said, these are not real particles because their properties are dependent on how the calculation is done (for those seeking deeper, read about electromagnetic gauge) and by their nature are not experimentally observable--so they are a way of a mathematical book-keeping. Pinning down in a very precise way what mediation means requires some non physical philosophy of QFT. But what's definitely true is this: There is an electromagnetic field that causes the force between electrons. Because there is a field, there is a particle associated with that field. If there were no electromagnetic force, there would be no photons--and vise versa; the two are inextricable.</p>
<p>The term &quot;mediates&quot; is used because the calculations involve photons that communicate the necessary information between elections.</p>
<p>Feynman wrote a really great and accessible book called QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter, that gives the reader a surprisingly accurate qualitative description of what is going on in quantum electrodynamics without introducing the (extensive) math required to actually carry out calculations in QFT. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in quantum field theory- be them a hobbyist, a dedicated student of physics, or even a researcher who might like to think about how to communicate core concepts to laymen of QFT.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What happens is that you expand the S-matrix in powers of the coupling constant. The S-matrix elements are matrix elements of the time-ordered exponential of the interaction Lagrangian, which for QED contains terms like Ψ^(T)A^(μ)γ<em><em>μ</em></em>Ψ, where Ψ represents a fermion field and A represents the photon field.</p>
<p>The various terms in this power series look like a bunch of intermediate particles being created and destroyed, linking the same initial and final states. These intermediate particles are called &quot;virtual particles&quot;, and they only <em>seem</em> to exist because of how you've chosen to do your calculation. They do not literally exist.</p>
<p>If you look at Feynman diagrams like the ones shown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Møller_scattering" target="_blank">here</a>, these represent the lowest-order terms in that series expansion for the case of electron-electron scattering. You can see that there is a virtual photon in both of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The way photons appear in computations is only as a name for terms in a perturbation series for scattering processes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are interested in an answer in terms of quantum mechanics:
To describe particle interactions we use Quantum Field Theory. It is a theory which brings together field theory and quantum mechanics. One uses something called second quantization to also quantize the fields(f.i. the wave function of the photon) in stead of only quantizing the usual observables like x, p, etc.. It is a many particle system in which we can create and destroy particles, as has been mentioned already.</p>
<p>Now usually in QFT's (within the Standard Model) we are only interested in asymptotic states. That is; we want to conduct an experiment with some particles going in and some particles coming out. This can be efficiently calculated perturbutively using something called the S matrix. The fundamental interpretational issue here is that this is defined in terms of the asymptotic states only. Basically we're putting the interaction in a black box, and calculate then what could possibly come out. This method works really well for usual particle physics since these perturbative methods can be applied.</p>
<p>Returning to your question about what happens quantum mechanically: This is not well understood. The whole framework had been built around asymptotic states. If you know what a Hilbert space is (which you probably should if you know quantum mechanics); we only have a well-defined Hilbert space for the asymptotic states. The Hilbert space within the actual interaction is not well known, so describing what's actually going on is way harder. The Feynmann diagrams in that sense are only a tool which works because we can perturbatively calculate this interaction within the Hilbert space of asymptotic states.</p>
<p>This is also the struggle of Canonical Quantum Gravity. Since gravity cannot be perturbatively analyzed we cannot use these diagrams, so we need to find out exactly what happens during this interaction: we need to find a Hilbert space for the full Hamiltonian. This is way more difficult then just using perturbation theory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
