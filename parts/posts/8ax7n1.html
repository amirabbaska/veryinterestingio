		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you say &quot;secure&quot; do you mean safe from internal tampering? like someone adding a back-door without people knowing? or people selling this information to other companies / people?  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This is sometimes solved with a code review process, someone needs to review this code and sign off that it is okay to be added. In more sensitive parts, the same code will be reviewed by multiple people, usually not from the same team.<br />
This increases the chances of finding anything bad (malicious or not).<br />
If all of them are in on it, then sure, they can probably place it in but usually many different people will work on the same code, so you will need a lot of people to be a part of it.  </p>
</li>
<li>Regarding exposing the code, this is obviously difficult to prevent. Depending on what the code does, many companies use other methods to try and learn if their code was leaked (Checking competitors new &quot;features&quot;, scanning certain websites that may show such code and so on).  </li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that many people wouldn't want to risk their job or risk going to prison that easily, and in many cases it is easy to learn who was involved in a leak or a malicious addition to your code.</p>
<p>That being said, it still happens a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stealing a company's source code wouldn't really be that big of a deal in most cases.</p>
<p>Even with the code, nobody can turn around and legally sell the software without it being immediately obvious they're doing it.  Even if you try to, you don't have the advertising, marketing, support staff &amp; industry reputation it takes to make something of it.  If the code is for an online service of some sort (eg - Google), it's worthless without the millions/billions of dollars of infrastructure it takes to run the code &amp; make use of it.</p>
<p>If somebody just wants to steal a program, it's easier to just pirate a copy &amp; not deal with the complications of building it themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Secure from what? This word means many different things according to the threat model, that is, the kind of attacks or accidents you want to protect against:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accidental deletion/corruption: backups, no need for more explanation.</li>
<li>Accidental or harmful leaks: big companies split the resources so employees don't have access to everything. For instance when the windows 2000 source code was leaked, it wasn't complete. Small companies do little or nothing, and trust their employees.</li>
<li>Inclusion of malicious code: code review, when they do it (not often enough!)</li>
<li>Leak by hacking: try to protect it like any other asset from the company. Source code is hard to protect, because all developers must have access to part of it. Development and testing infrastructure is notoriously insecure (deployed with default passwords or none at all, debugging mode, etc.)</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people here are saying code reviews and preventing all developers from having access to all the code.</p>
<p>I've worked for several large software development companies and not a single one of them did this due to the cost.  All developers had access to all code and there was very little code review due to tight timelines to release new features.</p>
<p>The only people who didn't have complete access were consultants and once they'd worked for us for a few weeks they were also given full access.</p>
<p>All the developers had access to all the data in the database, too.  The companies felt it was too time consuming and expensive to restrict access, even to sensitive data.</p>
<p>What we did do was log who accessed and checked code into the repository.  We didn't log who accessed which data in the database.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few people have touched on this, but here’s my experience.  The places I have worked don’t have any protection in place to keep code secure from developers.  One final company I worked for had a “no flash drives” policy, but there was no way for them to detect a flash drive, and I could have just copied everything to a cloud drive without anyone noticing.   </p>
<p>In most cases, I had access to the entire projects codebase and I some cases, all the code to other projects I didn’t need.  I think the risk of a developer leaking code is lower than the hassle of people not being able to access something when they need it.  I’ve always worked at places where “dozens” of people were working on a project, so I admittedly don’t have experience at larger companies.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
