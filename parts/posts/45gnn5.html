		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Lemons are a hybrid created by humans</strong></p>
<p>Lemons are not a good example, but an actual example would be spicy peppers. Mammals generally do not like spicy fruits, but birds can't taste spice, and they also don't digest the pepper seeds. Birds are the target for pepper plants. They'll eat the fruit with no problem, fly away, and shit out the seeds with a nice fertilizer.</p>
<p>Edit: <strong>Basically extreme flavors are to make sure animals that digest your seed won't eat the fruit.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lemon is not a naturally occurring fruit, it's actually bred from a sour orange and a citron, the sour orange itself being bred from a pomelo and mandarin. So it's not the product of evolution, but selective breeding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they've been bred that way. There are also lemon varieties which are sweet.</p>
<p>Also, don't confuse human tastes with animals - particularly birds. They'll eat the most amazingly horrid (to us humans) things</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>mredding's answer notwithstanding, its important to remember not all animals are created equally. Chili peppers, for example, can be painfully spicy because we (in general mammals) are sensitive to the active ingredient, capsaicin. Birds however, do not share this sensitivity. This means mammals can have a difficult time eating the peppers, but allows birds to eat them and spread the seeds</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The comments on selective breeding are correct, but don't forget you are approaching this from a biased angle - you as a human find the lemon sour. Other animals have different preferences and there will be adaptations to that. Flowers emit UV light for bees, but we don't see it. Cats do not taste sweet and prefer salt.</p>
<p>Your whole life perspective and view of the world is skewed towards being human.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
