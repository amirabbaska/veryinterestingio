		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked for my local paper, which is owned and part of New Zealand's largest media company, for five years as an editorial assistant. Basically I was a group secretary to the editorial team.</p>
<p>The job involved doing grunt work like typing up letters to the editor, sports results, paying the editorial teams bills, research, and putting content online from the print edition. This was from around 2008 to 2013 or so.</p>
<p>At this time we didn't have business plan for our web site, which was part of a larger news site ran by the parent company, it was just something we had to do. We weren't selling advertising on it yet (the parent company was, but we couldn't sell it locally) so we just put it online for free and it was expected of us by the public.</p>
<p>Now it's worth noting, that in the print edition of our paper, journalists, who had spell checkers at their finger tips, were expected to submit their stories with no grammatical or spelling errors. The chief reporter would then check it, send it back if he spotted any errors, or send it on to sub editors. Sub-editors would then check it, correct any errors they spotted and then set it on the page. At this stage it been checked three times, so there should be no errors, but there still were.</p>
<p>After the parent company's website started to generate revenue we were pushed to start gearing our content for online. Everyone in the newsroom had a large meeting in the news room to discuss how we would be moving forward. The main thing that we had to worry about was generating, and making available, as much content as quickly as possible. Get it up and errors can fixed later if it's worth fixing them we were told. One of the journalists asked if this basically meant journalistic integrity would be diminished in this quantity versus quality approach and was told yes.</p>
<p>Some people are catching flak and downvotes for saying it's because it's not as important as it once was, this is the answer. We were a proud paper that celebrated its history and tomes of the past were scattered around the buildings, including old staff lists. Back in the early 1900s half of the list of 100 or so people was made up of proof readers. One proof reader for every other member on staff. By 2000 only three people checked a story before it to print and no one was hired specially to do this job. When I left, a journalist could write a story, and put it online with only their eyes ever seeing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do freelance writing on the side for some pretty big papers, and my experience has been a combination of a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Production/copy editors' roles are increasingly being combined. The same editor that approves your pitch also has to schedule it, and give it a quick proofread (on top of the other 50 articles they're deali with). </p>
</li>
<li>A shocking number of copy editors are just bad at their jobs. They confuse that/which, or common expressions, or mix up their affects/effects. I had one copy editor correct 'sea change' to 'sea of change', although I caught it before it went to print. </li>
</ol>
<p>tl;dr: Fewer dedicated copy editors, more jack-of-all-trade editors, and a healthy mix of those with a lax grip on the finer points ofmthe language. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a copy editor, my view on this is: people don't believe they need to get their copy edited by a professional. Most people running websites will pay for writers, but comparatively few seem to see the need to pay for a copy editor. </p>
<p>Further, some just don't bother with editing at all, and others say they want to keep it &quot;in house&quot; (i.e. done for free by staff members or mates, which means they will pick up varying degrees of errors but the copy won't be professionally edited). The latter works fine for some sites — and up to a point in their growth — but less well for others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
