		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's how the &quot;Fiduciary Standard&quot; is billed but that's not what it does.</p>
<p>Just to differentiate - the Obama &quot;Fiduciary Standard&quot; has nothing to do with what is known as the &quot;Fiduciary Rule&quot; - which the Fiduciary Standard is frequently confused for.  If your money is in an IRA account (or any managed account), whoever is managing it has a fiduciary duty to you to act only in your best interest.  This duty precedes the &quot;Fiduciary Standard&quot; in question and again has nothing to do with it.  In fact the &quot;Fiduciary Standard&quot; hasn't even come into force yet.</p>
<p>The &quot;Fiduciary Standard&quot; only affects IRA accounts.</p>
<p>IRAs are a &quot;self&quot; managed retirement account.  In essence they are little more than a normal investment account that gets preferential tax treatment in exchange for having some restrictions placed on how you can take the money out.  Now I put &quot;self&quot; in quotations because most people just use a stock broker or other financial adviser to actually invest their money rather than picking their investments themselves.  As a self managed investment portfolio, IRA brokers use a commission model where they make a commission on every investment that the IRA makes.  </p>
<p>But these commissions aren't the same across different investment types.  The example cited by the Obama administration is that commissions on bonds are usually much lower than commissions on stocks.</p>
<p>What the Fiduciary Standard does is to prevent IRA brokers from investing money into a security solely on the basis of the commission paid.  That sounds great in principle, but in reality it creates a presumption that if an IRA broker invests money into anything other than the lowest commission security that they have done so in violation of the rule.  An IRA broker can rebut that presumption, but nobody wants to take on the risk for doing so.</p>
<p>The workaround that most companies have come up with for this is client disclosure and approval - every time your IRA broker wants to make an investment, they will have to send you something detailing the investment they want to make along with an explanation of the lowest commission alternative and then get your approval.  This creates a tremendous amount of extra work for your IRA broker, and so most of the big IRA investment companies are switching small to mid sized clients onto generic, unmanaged flat fee based accounts.</p>
<p>Since the rule was designed to help small to medium sized IRA clients obtain access to higher quality financial advice, moving those clients onto unmanaged accounts is counterproductive at best.</p>
<p>The rule doesn't really impact large managed accounts where most brokers are going to be giving their clients a call every couple of weeks anyways, and it doesn't impact unmanaged accounts at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lot of good debate in this thread, but I will add:</p>
<p>Right wing politics likes to portray every single issue as something every single voter should take total responsibility for. Sounds great! Right? </p>
<p>It's.. not.</p>
<p>Are you a heart surgeon?</p>
<p>Are you an accountant?</p>
<p>Are you a veterinarian?</p>
<p>Are you an auto mechanic?</p>
<p>Are you chef?</p>
<p>Odds are you can't answer yes to all of these. </p>
<p>What you can do, is express your <em>intentions</em> and let <em>their expertise</em> -- that you are paying for -- guide your actions. That's why we take our cars to mechanics and we go to the doctor. They spend years learning something so that we don't have to. Now, what happens if your mechanic says you need to do X beacuse it costs 10,000 whereas Y would cost 1,000 and give you the same or better result. You'd be pretty pissed off. The mechanic has now acted <em>against</em> your best interests because it is <em>in their best interest</em> to do so.</p>
<p>Why the regulation? Because you as a consumer may not be equipped to know the difference.</p>
<p>Capitalism works great when the solution is what works best for everyone. However, often times it is better for the capitalist to work against their customer, and do so by lying, tricking, or concealing data to do so. Or, in the case of financial planners, by doing things obscure and hard to track so that they do better for themselves at the expense of their client.</p>
<p>Regulations help this quandary, by providing guidance and legal remedy if you pay someone to do something and they work against you for their own benefit. </p>
<p>Right wingers want to make you responsible, because you should know better or something. But how can anyone know everything about every job?</p>
<p>You can't. It's not possible. A well regulated economy protects the consumer and allows honest business to thrive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This particular rule it is not actively bad for customers. However, the theory is that too many rules will lead investment companies to be timid and inflexible, and <em>that</em> could ultimately be bad for customers.</p>
<p>Frankly the argument is paper-thin. The <em>real</em> concern is that it will lead to excess lawsuits, and to the elimination of some crummy investment products that are hugely profitable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/13/your-money/rule-to-make-brokers-act-in-clients-interest-still-pending-after-4-years.html" target="_blank">one issue</a> with the rule;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More specifically, the Wall Street firms and brokers say they are concerned the new regulations will prohibit them from charging commissions, even though Ms. Borzi has said commissions will be permitted.</p>
<p>“We think they won’t adequately allow for commission-based accounts and therefore investors will be hurt,” said Ira Hammerman, general counsel for Sifma. “It’s like, ‘Just trust me. We will work it out.' ”</p>
<p>Fiduciaries under Erisa, as it’s written now, cannot be paid in ways that would pose a conflict of interest. But the way brokers and insurance agents are compensated often contains potential conflicts: a broker might receive a higher commission for recommending one investment over another. And arrangements known as revenue sharing, where mutual fund companies share a portion of their revenue with the brokerage firm selling the fund, also provide opportunities for conflicts. Fund companies that pay more, experts said, might get a spot on the firm’s list of recommended funds.</p>
