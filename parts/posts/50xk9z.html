		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, it's because western music fell in love with major keys <strong>after</strong> the notes got named.</p>
<p>When they started using letters, they started with 'A' to describe the lowest available note. This is the key bit here, because they didn't design the musical alphabet to match up to any particular scale.  They just said 'huh...we'll call the lowest note I can play an A'.</p>
<p>When they invented the piano keyboard they used the white keys for the natural notes &amp; black keys for the accidentals. </p>
<p>Then Western music developed a particular love for Major keys, and 'C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C' happened to be the simplest one (read: the only way to construct a major scale using all natural notes).</p>
<p>And so here we are.</p>
<p>EDIT: A couple other things some folks are asking:   </p>
<p><strong>Lowest note of what??</strong><br />
Basically there was a 2-octave system in common use at the time.  They weren't trying to solve all music for all time, just write down what was in common usage.   </p>
<p><strong>How did they decide what was natural &amp; what was accidental??</strong><br />
This is another of those timing things.  The 12 note system is younger than you think - western music didn't really start agreeing there were 12 notes in an octave til the 16th century.  So we had 7 letters, then we had to decide how we were going to cram 5 more notes in there somewhere...</p>
<p>Edit 2: Thanks for the gold kind stranger!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IN THE BEGINNING... </p>
<p>... which, for Western/European music,  means ancient Greece...</p>
<p>they recognized seven different musical notes (which repeated in different octaves, of course). They didn't yet call them by letters (which would have been in the Greek alphabet anyway), but those notes corresponded to the ones we call A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.</p>
<p>What's important to realize is that those notes are not evenly spaced. That means that you can play the same seven notes in the same order and get seven different scales just by changing which note you start on.  The Greeks called these seven different scales &quot;modes&quot;, and a given musical composition would be built around one of them. Each mode has different associations, much like the difference between major and minor keys in modern music.</p>
<p>The seven modes and their names are as follows:</p>
<p>A,B,C,D,E,F,G:  Aeolian<br />
B,C,D,E,F,G,A:  Locrian<br />
C,D,E,F,G,A,B:  Ionian<br />
D,E,F,G,A,B,C:  Dorian<br />
E,F,G,A,B,C,D:  Phrygian<br />
F,G,A,B,C,D,E:  Lydian<br />
G,A,B,C,D,E,F:  Mixolydian   </p>
<p>So really, you could start anywhere naming the notes A through G without changing anything fundamental; you would just wind up with a different sequence through the same seven modes.  The way the notes happened to get named in our later history means that playing them in alphabetical order gets you Aeolian mode, which is the same as a modern natural minor key.</p>
<p>In modern Western music we think of the natural major key as the default, which corresponds to the Ionian mode. But that wasn't always the case; the process of Ionian dominance took about a thousand years after the notes got their letter names.</p>
<p>The reason we now have more notes than just those 7 is that it occurred to someone to try to play some mode starting on one of the <em>other</em> modes' start note.  For instance, if you start on B but play the Aeolian intervals, that means that the second note - in the C slot - has to be a higher frequency than C, though still lower than D.  Thus was invented &quot;C sharp&quot;, written C# (or, well, C♯ in proper Unicode).  Then D and E could stay as they were (&quot;natural&quot;), but the F also had to be sharpened, and then followed by natural G and A. </p>
<p>Now, if you try to play that same Ionian mode starting on F, you have a normal A in the third slot, but then the fourth note still needs to be lower than B.  Can't call it A♯, because you already have an A, so it gets a name based on B instead - B flat, written B♭.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, you're in charge of naming musical notes, several hundred years ago. The first note you name is, well, obviously, &quot;A&quot;. You then name the next six notes in the scale that starts with your A, so that the scale goes A, B, C, D, E, F, G and then back to A.</p>
<p>But the key of A doesn't go like that: it goes A, B, C♯, D, E, F♯, G♯.</p>
<p>Ah, but that's the key of A <em>major</em>. These days, we think of the major scale is being the sort of &quot;default&quot; scale; but back a few hundred years, it was the <em>natural minor</em> scale that was considered the &quot;default&quot;. And the natural A minor scale has no sharps or flats.</p>
<p>In other words, if you sit down at a piano and play A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, you've just played the scale of A minor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Why are the keys in that order?</strong></p>
<p>The piano and the precursors to it come from <del>Europe</del> Italy. <del>Europe</del> Italy used DO or Ut(C) RE(D) MI(E) FA(F) SOL(G) LA(A) SI(B) as the names of the musical notes and are taught in that order. </p>
<p>There's no &quot;order&quot; per se, the reason the mayor scales are played and taught starting with DO is completely subjective.</p>
<p><strong>Why can't it be changed?</strong></p>
<p>Take into account that you are looking into a very, very small case of music theory. </p>
<p>First the piano, although an extremely important instrument, is just that, an instrument; a tool. Its layout doesn't bother a seasoned musician more than a keyboard layout bothers a programmer.
There are hundreds of other instruments that this change wouldn't benefit in the least. (in case you were thinking of changing the name of each note) </p>
<p>Second CDEFGAB is used by the US, UK and selected other countries, the rest of the world (<del>Southern</del> Most of Europe, Latin America and Asia) uses DO RE MI FA SOL LA SI. (in case you were thinking of changing the order of the keys). </p>
<p>Edit: I don't know why I went all the way to microtonal music, your question was very specific. Maybe I mixed another answer with what you were asking. Sorry. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This goes back pretty far to chanting, when it was believed that there were 8 modes (ways to go up the scale with the same sharps/flats starting on different notes). Along came a new theorist and he proposed 12 modes, creating Aeolian and Ionian, or minor and major. </p>
<p>(Note: Now there's 6 modes, turns out people didn't give a damn about plagal and authentic modes. For shame.) </p>
<p>Without sharps or flats, A to A is the Aeolian mode, or <del>major</del> minor scale (thanks /u/fr4ternity). C to C is the corresponding Ionian, or major scale. Glarean, or the magic new theorist from before, noted audaciously that the Ionian was the primary mode used. </p>
<p>On early instruments the distinction of where the C and A would be isn't particularly relevant but on keyed instruments it began to make sense to make the center pitch the most popular mode of the flat and sharpless scale. </p>
<p>In all, it's a giant game of telephone dating back to the good 'ol days of Gregorian chants. Something is bound to get wonky. (It's oddly obvious when listening to old chants that our two most popular modes weren't conceived yet. Kinda cool.) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
