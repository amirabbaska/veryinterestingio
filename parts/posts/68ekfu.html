<hr />
<p>edit:</p>
<p>Thanks for the great replies everyone. I can summarize what everyone said as follows:</p>
<p>1- Data are sent as packets of bits, each having the sender and receiver address included. These packets are a predetermined length of digital signals or predetermined format. That's how different packets not mix with each other.</p>
<p>2- Packets take turns going through the same channel, not being transmitted at the same time. It is just so fast that we perceive it to do so.</p>
<p>3- Fiber optic cables have numerous fibers in them, each single fiber can have different communications channels with each being a different frequency of light (thousands).</p>
<p>4- This means that an optic fiber is a very very large highway containing thousands of lanes (wave lengths), in each lane data of different people can travel sequentially as very fast cars (discreet packets of data). One optic fiber cable contains many of these super massive highways. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whether it's fibre optic or copper doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>Whenever you visit a web page, for instance, the data you send and receive is cut up into little pieces (packets). Each packet, much like a letter, has a destination address. These packets are sent from your computer to the nearest router. The router inspects the address and figures out where to send the packet to. The next router along the path does the same thing, and the next one, until the packet reaches its destination.</p>
<p>Along that route, the packet will sometimes travel across a copper wire, a fibre optic cable, or maybe even some kind of wireless link. The point here is that it doesn't batter how the packet is sent. What matters is that the internet is reliable enough that most of these packets arrive at their destination in a timely manner.</p>
<p>For the most part, these packets are sent and moved one after another. Just like on a highway, there are many packets in a row all going roughly the same direction. Some might take a turn and get off that highway to go elsewhere. Some highways have mutiple lanes, meaning that several packets (or cars) can be roughly in the same place at the same time. This is accomplished, for instance, by transmitting different &quot;lanes&quot; in different colours. This too is pretty much technology independent. You can send multiple signals along a copper wire, or a fibre optic cable or through the ether.</p>
<p>If you think that's magical, then try to think about cable TV: you have many channels on cable TV, but only one cable. It's the same thing as &quot;everybody's internet&quot; going through one fibre optic cable. This is called <em>multiplexing</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because all the data is not sent at truly the same time. They are sent in chunks (packets) one after the other. Each packet has a header which contains the length, destination address, source address and so on.</p>
<p>So the router knows “the next 50 bytes should go to the address 123.123.123.13” and sends it there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Current technology allows about two terabytes/second transmission speed. Couple this with multi-frequency piggy-backing, and you can have over 40 different freqs on the same fiber, all carrying a two-terabyte package.</p>
