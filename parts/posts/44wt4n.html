		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, Ooh, I know this one. Besides their respective names of jerk, snap, crackle, and pop the most important one in terms of engineering is jerk. This is a deciding factor in human comfort. While acceleration manifests itself as a feeling of increased or decreased weight, the rough shaking you might feel on a road covered in pot holes or on a wooden roller coaster is jerk. Thus measuring and managing jerk is important in the design of suspension systems for vehicles or more generally, any time humans are to ride on, in, or near the device being designed. This even comes into play when designing engine mounts and shifting patterns in passenger vehicles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was taking an introduction to physics, I read a really interesting take on the derivatives of velocity demonstrated by a rider on a rocket sled. Here's something similar I found online: &quot;Constant acceleration (m/s^2) occurs when riding a rocket sled by lighting a single solid rocket motor. If you light a series of the same rockets, one after another each second, whilst they’re all burning, you'll experience jerk (m/s^3) as you’d feel a steady increase in g or acceleration. If you light the rockets quicker each time (instead of at a steady one second interval), you’ll get a rate of change in jerk called jounce or snap (m/s^4), feeling your head pushed back harder each time and with more force than the previous rocket. If you then repeated the jounce experiment but with a bigger rocket each time, lighting each one quicker than the previous, you’ll experience crackle (m/s^5). Now if those progressively bigger rockets use solid rocket fuel that gets steadily more powerful as they burn (an accelerating burn rate), running the crackle experiment again, you’ll experience pop (m/s^6). If you run the pop experiment again but use solid rocket fuel that accelerates in power (has a jerk burn rate), you’ll start to experience forces that don't really have defined names; in this case, (m/s^7). Using rocket fuel with snap burn rate, where the fuel is burning with a rate of change in acceleration of the burn front, and using progressively more volatile fuel as it burns through, you’ll experience another unnamed force, (m/s^8). You can see this is a chain reaction thought experiment, the more rates of change you add to rockets, solid fuel, and fuel pellets etc, you can define more orders of acceleration.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
