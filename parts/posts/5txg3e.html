		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the comments here are close to the money but don't touch it just right.</p>
<p>Alcohol is a toxin to the body. The main area where it is detoxified is in the liver. The detoxification of alcohol produces a few side products that start to accumulate in the liver cells. The most important one is a molecule called NADH, which is used by liver cells for energy production as well as glucose production. An imbalance in this molecule is created because of the alcohol, so the cells get confused and think there's enough energy, so they stop the cellular power plant, but this also stop prevents the liver from producing glucose naturally.</p>
<p>Your brain requires glucose directly from the blood in order to function properly, so once it starts running low on fuel, it begins to malfunction. This malfunctioning is what shows up as drunkenness. As more and more parts of the brain run out of supplies, you start to become more and more drunk. The outer most parts of the brain get affected the most very early on, and the inner parts of the brain are affected later, because brain blood flow works from inside to out.</p>
<p>The hippocampus is a part of the brain that's located very deep inside the brain. Because it's a very old and basic part of every brain, it gets a lot of blood to stay in tip top shape. When you drink enough alcohol to reduce fuel to this area, your brain cells stop firing properly, and they lose the ability to register new information.</p>
<p>It's kind of like writing with disappearing ink. It's there for 10 minutes while you do it, because there are other parts of your brain that allow you to think and act immediately, but it can't be saved to paper.</p>
<p>This process isn't absolute though. In between, people can eat food, or the alcohol starts to get metabolized and a little more blood glucose comes in. This lets the brain save memory in parts, and allows for atleast partial recollection of the events the next day. It's sort of like keeping a brief snapshot, which your friends help fill in the gap with.</p>
<p>Also, alcohol can directly slow down functioning in the brain by mimicking little molecules that switch off or prevent neurons from firing.</p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>The only thing that's known about memories right now is that they are formed in part by brain cells firing off in particular patterns. These patterns are what make memories. Firing off neurons needs fuel in the form of glucose.</p>
<p>The brain needs fuel to work and save memories. Alcohol tells your body's main fuel factory in the liver that there's enough energy, so your brain runs out of fuel overtime. The part of your brain that makes memories runs out of fuel only when the blood sugars are too low, and that's what makes you blackout.</p>
<p>Plus alcohol also directly prevents neurons from firing off by mimicking molecules that act like brakes.</p>
<p>So it's a bit of a combination of both fuel stoppage, and hitting the brakes too hard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol messes with a part of your brain called the Hippocampus that, among other things, manages transferring short-term memories into long-term ones. The result is that some or all of the short term memories from the time you are intoxicated don't get transferred, and once your body has removed all the alcohol and you're sober again, you can't remember some or all of what happened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consumption of alcohol impairs a person's ability to form long-term memories. It's like writing an essay but forgetting to save it somewhere when you're done. You know what is going on in the moment but as soon as you're done all of that information is gone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

That doesn't help. What are the mechanisms, why does it happens? We already know it happens.</p>
<p>Edit:u/RedditorDoc hits closer to what I had been hoping for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
