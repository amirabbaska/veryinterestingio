I know I am not the only one who does this and I know that it happens A LOT. Like realistically, how many people are actually answering that YouTube survey honestly? Wouldn't this cause the data to be quite inaccurate and unreliable? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I am a mod at /r/surveyresearch and a full time survey researcher. </p>
<p>There is inherent noise in all data we collect. However, generally when people answer surveys they mostly tell the truth, this is backed up with empirical research where we have administrative data on the people surveyed and we compare what the participant says and what the records say. Most of the time their responses align with the responses of the &quot;truth&quot;. Error is mostly associated with trouble with recall or understanding the question rather than purposeful inattention.</p>
<p>We also call this phenomenon of answering randomly or answering with malicious intent, &quot;Satisficing.&quot; It is an area of intense research from academics in the field of survey research. We can't catch it all, but we can setup various tricks to catch and remove answers that are intentionally wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li>Randomization: If you randomize your question order and response order, a person who would pick randomly or pick the first response for each question would just appear as noise in the data, rather than a particular bias.</li>
<li>Logic checks: We can ask the same questions twice in different ways or we can ask a chain of questions that logically go together (i.e.,Are you a frequent smoker? Yes, How often do you smoke? Never). This would flag data for removal.</li>
<li>Meta/Paradata- If you complete a 20 minute survey in 5 minutes, we can kick your data out. If you straight line your answers, we can kick your data out. etc.</li>
<li>Attentional Checks: &quot;How often do you smoke?(Select the 3rd answer to continue)&quot;. &quot;Do you use [Brand that does not exist]?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>We run the risk of deleting real honest responses, so these checks do not always occur. But it is available if there is concern with data quality. That being said, recent research shows that data cleaning really doesn't change the results that much for most questions. On average, it evens out as long as you have a large enough sample size.</p>
<p>I would strongly encourage to answer surveys and answer them honestly. You have the ability to represent your interests and sway the opinion of companies and even governments by the answers you provide. Data collection isn't cheap, decision makers put a lot of value in these surveys and they will design products and even political positions around the data they get from these surveys.</p>
<p>For a nationally representative US survey, your single response roughly represents ~606,177 adults. Your response has the power to represent, statistically speaking, an INFINITE amount of people. It is an incredible opportunity, don't waste it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT- listen to the guy up there at the top for reals.</p>
<p>If you're filling in online surveys odds are you're getting assigned an advertiser ID associated with you via various combinations of IP and MAC address, account details, cookies etc. If you fill in enough surveys to significantly affect things you'll start getting surveys with subtly bogus answers in them now and again and if you select the bogus answers regularly your entire answer history will get written off as done by a bot, clicker or randomly by a user not paying attention. Examples include asking you about a shop or service that doesn't exist.</p>
<p>This is something a whole bunch of Google Opinion Rewards users have ran into. They fill in answers at random for a few months and then they hit the &quot;which fleeble did you gronk regenty? A) flarb B) gonk C) deeble D) none of the above&quot; question and answer flarb. No more survey questions for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In larger surveys, and in any type of validated questionnaire, such as psych testing measures, etc. there are validation questions: questions that are similar to other questions. If you don't answer them consistently, then the form can get tossed because the response isn't valid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I never really contribute to these threads but I have a story about Google rewards that might be relevant. I was using it for pokemon go, but if you're not familiar with Google rewards it will ask you questions about places youve visited recently and will give you google wallet funds for your answers. Now pokemon go takes you to a lot of different places so I was getting a lot of surveys and just giving the answers they wanted to hear. One day a new survey pops up for me and asks me if I ever went to some funny sounding water park before. I say yes, and they ask me what my favorite attraction there was. I choose some random name of some random water slide, which leads the survey to tell me the locations I just submitted were fake and made up just to test the integrity of my answers. I have never had a new survey since.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All legitimate survey results allow for a certain amount of accuracy.  That's why &quot;survey size&quot; is vital in legitimizing the accuracy of a survey.  Too small of a group, or too large in rare instances, will skew the results due to people not answering honestly or not understanding the question.  Where the survey is taken is also a factor.  Those who commission or actually take these surveys know this, and either determine a percent of accuracy, or use it to sway the survey in their desired direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
