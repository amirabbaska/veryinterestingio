		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Large Hollywood movie production studios have contracts with many large record labels for access to their original master recordings of music, and for more popular songs, the record labels can also sometimes provide the individual unmixed track recordings of those songs. </p>
<p>Basically, the movie studios can get separate high quality recordings of the drums, vocals, horn section, guitar, piano, etc, and completely remix the song to fit the context of the movie/trailer. </p>
<p>As far as making the tracks sound “clear”, this is either just done by having high quality recordings, or the audio engineers have added some sort of compression, equalizer, or other form of effects processing to the tracks to give them and crisper, more modern sound. </p>
<p>EDIT: These multitrack master recordings and the individual tracks are referred to as “stems.” I was not aware of this term at the time of writing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Audio sweetening is a big field.  </p>
<p>As some others mentioned, studios try to get the best original sources they can find. When media has degraded they'll multiple different sources, each the highest quality they can find.  These will be integrated together.</p>
<p>There are many noise reduction techniques out there. Many begin by transforming the clips from temporal data (the waveforms you are probably used to) into frequency data (often visualized <a href="https://cdn.lynda.com/video/137180-140-635180851189681333_338x600_thumb.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a>). When working in frequency space the data is more like a speckled image rather than waveform data.</p>
<p>Constant frequencies, such as a 60 Hz electrical hum, can be removed; as frequency data that can mean erasing or cutting down (perhaps to 10% of their old value) at the 60 Hz line. Many noises are easily visualized as long lines or dark areas when viewing audio as frequencies, and they can be digitally removed or have their intensity reduced.  Frequencies outside the regular voice range can be removed; the sound engineer can start by dropping everything below about 300 Hz and above about 3500 Hz, then fine tune the range based on what they hear.</p>
<p>The traditional high-pass and low-pass filters used in analog equipment do the same type of work, only less precisely. Mixer boards, both digital and analog, do them on a coarse scale. They cut both the high-frequency sounds and the low-frequency sounds, and can be used to boost or drop different frequency bands as needed.  The big mixer boards with tons of sliders that are shown at concerts do this, allowing the sound engineer to modify different frequencies of noise during the live event.</p>
<p>Reverberations and echos can be easily added, and with some software can be scanned for and removed or reduced. </p>
<p>Multiple recordings can be mixed together.  If the quality of old tracks is not good enough new recording can be mixed in.  If part of a word is unclear in the original recording, a voice actor can sing the lines in a similar voice, and the sound engineer can align the sound sample, adjust the pitch and volume, and blend the two together.  It may be Sinatra you hear, but there may be a mix of singers that have been skillfully blended in.  Similarly for orchestral parts, new violin recordings, cello recordings, or flute solos may be recorded and mixed in.  </p>
<p>There is far more -- it is an entire industry with signal processing math, specialized software, in addition to artists and engineers involved -- but that should give an idea of how it works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two other major possible ways to make it clear. First studios will go through and clean up old recordings or use remasters to make it sound clear. Second, although used less frequently, sometimes they will rerecord a song with an voice actor that can impersonate a persons voice and a Hollywood orchestra for the instrumental part.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When possible we get high quality remastered tracks of each instrument, called &quot;stems&quot;.  These stems allow us to basically remix the track as needed, pulling out parts we dont want and boosting ones we do to modernize and &quot;trailerize&quot; the music cue.</p>
<p>Also, most of the songs you hear are not simply the song.  Usually we have a music library company add some additional elements to it, like more drums, or a rise, or a string element, etc.  </p>
<p>On top of that, you have all the sound effects you typically hear in trailers, (the Hits, the Rises, the BWAAMS, etc) that can sound like part of the song when cut rhythmically.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably a combination of the following....</p>
<p>1) access to a high quality source, possibly the original master recording on tape.  The audio quality of a tune someone put up on YouTube, your parents cassette collection, a worn out record or even a CD might not be anywhere near what it was when the track was originally recorded.  </p>
<p>2) Compression.  Trailers and commercials are notoriously over compressed.  This means the loud sound in a piece are squashed down a bit and the quieter sounds are boosted giving the whole thing more power and punch but making it a lot more fatiguing to listen to for longer.   It’s kind of like how they say a sweeter drink might taste better at first but but by the end you might prefer one less sweet.  This is why people complain that many commercials are much louder than the TV or Radio program they are listening to.  Compression allows the whole thing to be made louder without blowing out the speakers or our ears during the loudest parts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
