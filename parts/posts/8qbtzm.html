		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How is a memory formed, stored and recalled? </p>
<p>The way I simply picture it as, is an electrical signal created during an experience, and that gets stored in the brain. So it’s like a computer’s virtual ram... information exists as long as there is electricity in the system (being alive) and gets deleted when you power off (death).
Is there no “hard writing” of memories on the brain (like on hard spin drives)? </p>
<p>Following that... why are only part of a memory usually recalled? </p>
<p>Thank you </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's understood that there are two major kinds of memories in the brain: long-term and short-term, though these have many sub-types. It seems long and short term memories work quite differently from each other.</p>
<p>The forming of long-term memories involves the physical structure of neurons actually changing. Circuits of neurons (neural networks) are created, altered and strengthened through repetition. So it's very much like hard-wiring, as opposed to constantly active electrical activity like in computer RAM. It's like widening roads that see heavier traffic and building shortcuts where they are needed, making it possible to see this change from a satellite even when the traffic isn't there anymore.</p>
<p>When you do something mentally (a physical action or a mental one such as reciting a poem), it requires specific neural paths (and probably multiple paths, one triggering the other) to be activated and used. When you do it again, these paths are reinforced, strengthened and made more efficient, so the task becomes easier and faster. These changes eventually become quite stable and permanent, thus long-term.</p>
<p>Short-term memory works differently. It's more like working memory, in the sense that it's only available while you're actively using it and decays on its own within a minute, or as soon as more information overwrites it. Short-term memory can become long-term through conscious effort and attention. It's possible that all short-term memory becomes long-term automatically, and from there it can be strengthened further or forgotten.</p>
<p>Short-term memory is kept in &quot;neural loops&quot; in various parts of the brain. For example, they can be kept in visual form which you can &quot;see&quot; in your &quot;mind's eye&quot;, or in phonological form, by repeating information which you can &quot;hear&quot; as your &quot;inner voice&quot;. These memories don't form permanent neural paths, so they require constant active repetition to stay there. In that sense, they require electrical activity or they are instantly forgotten, which you could compare to computer RAM.</p>
<p>Recalling memories involves retracing the neural paths that have been formed by long-term memory. These paths are very complex and they often overlap each other in many ways, so one memory can trigger another, or the beginning of a path can trigger the full path. Once a neural path is retraced, the result of this is restored to short-term memory for access. Doing this strengthens the neural path by making it more efficient so the next recall will be faster, but in the process, some details can be lost. It's like walking a path multiple times, eventually the corners get cut in the name of efficiency.</p>
<p>To recall a memory, there needs to be a trigger or cue. Most memories are accessed through direct retrieval, which means that a question or cue will trigger the appropriate neural path. This is different to how a computer would search a database by going through every item in a list until it found the right one. A more efficient way to retrace a path is &quot;recognition&quot; (as opposed to recall) which acts on a shorter path and is more specific. For example, you recognize a face you know instantly and with 100% certainty, without having to go through a bunch of memories about that person to come to a conclusion. Facial recognition will bypass many brain areas to achieve a faster response with a confident binary outcome (it's either John or it isn't — there is no inbetween).</p>
<p>As for deleting memories (forgetting), ceasing of electrical activity won't delete your long-term memories. Cell death, however, will, which is why people who go without oxygen for too long will start losing some memories. Though a brain will always produce some electrical activity unless it's dead, that doesn't mean that the electrical activity is what maintains the memories. It's the neural paths that maintain them. Older memories may have more neural paths, so they can be redundant (you may have multiple independent memories of your childhood but only fewer memories of your recent job). Short term memories are wiped after a minute anyway, so at that point they're definitely gone.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, the short answer is nobody knows. This is a hot research topic right now, as technical advances in the last decade have made it possible to investigate what types of cells are involved and what they're doing as well as the timing involved.</p>
<p>An oversimplification of the long answer:</p>
<p>Adding on to what higgs8 says: Memory formation and learning seem to involve the formation of spines along dendrites (generally the output end of the neuron although it's more complicated than that). These spines are new connections that didn't exist before. They are &quot;pruned&quot; overnight (this is thought to be one of the functions of sleep) and the ones that remain form the basis of new networks. Information is stored in the networks and in the pattern of activation that they produce.</p>
<p>Networks must be maintained by regular use. If a spine is not activated with sufficient frequency, it gets pruned during the regular overnight scrubbing. This is why you forget things.</p>
<p>You can recall part of a memory because the network is often distributed through different parts of the brain, especially those associated with particular senses. It doesn't all get pruned at once, and it doesn't necessarily all get activated at once.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_hypothermic_circulatory_arrest" target="_blank">process</a> that is done during some brain or heart surgeries where body temperature is lowered to a point where blood flow in the body can be stopped for up to 40 minutes without any significant brain damage. An EKG is used to determine that there is zero brain activity, which is when the doctors know it is safe to stop blood flow to the brain. Then the surgery is done, blood flow is resumed, body temperature is raised, brain activity resumes, and the patient wakes up and carries on with their life. I'm not sure if the patients remember everything up to the point that they were put under for the operation, but the majority of our memories must not be reliant on constant electrical signals for this procedure to work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a question that is way too hard to answer. Your memories are not located in a specific area of the brain, although specific areas of the brain are crucial to memory. For example, you've probably heard that your hippocampus is required for memory, which is true. Individual with damaged hippocampi can no longer form new memories, permanently living in the present. But memory is not stored in the hippocampus. It's distributed throughout the brain, and it looks like your hippocampus is just a tool to &quot;point&quot; your neurons in the right direction.</p>
<p>This is to say, answering where a memory is located is extremely difficult. When neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield did surgery on epileptic patients, he stimulated parts of their brain. This succeeded in eliciting specific memories in sensations. For example, one famous example was where stimulation resulted in a patient smelling &quot;burnt toast&quot;. However, to say that each specific memory is located in a specific area of the brain is clearly ridiculous</p>
<p>As far as we know, our memories are formed by the specific connections of neurons throughout the brain. Through a process called LTP, pathways that fire frequently become stronger and more likely to fire in the future. This process is the key to all memories, although we don't know much about it besides that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since no one has alluded to this yet I will mention that science (and most materialism philosophy) has fully been unable to answer what the conscious experience is, including recalling memories. We see correlation when certian areas of the brain light up or are destroyed, but that does not imply causation. This is a hot topic in philosophy right now, called the 'hard problem of consciousness.'</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
