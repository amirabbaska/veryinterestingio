		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer - You pinched a nerve.</p>
<p>The sudden sensation of heat is usually a nerve response.  So, if you move your neck a certain way and suddenly feel a rush of heat, you probably pinched a nerve.  That doesn't necessarily mean that you &quot;have a pinched nerve&quot; in the sense most people mean (though it's totally possible.  How long the symptoms last are a big indicator.)  Degeneration of the discs or vertebrae or a direct injury can cause long term nerve impingement and damage.  What I think you are describing is a short term pinch, like hitting your &quot;funny bone&quot; - which is actually your ulnar nerve.   Anyway, if your neck is unusually tight, you are more susceptible to fiery, hot &quot;kinks&quot;.  Alternating hot/cold therapy, stretching and being aware of how you sleep can make a huge difference.</p>
<p>Edit to add - every nerve that leaves your spine is surrounded by fascia, connective tissue and muscle.  Those muscles that you can feel with your fingers along either side of your spine are really groups of much smaller muscles.  If some of them are tight and you unknowingly move in a direction that puts stress on them, it hurts.  If you pull those tight muscles too far, they could &quot;tear&quot; (sprains and strains are various degrees of tears).  Your body works quickly to protect it against injury and will seize up neighboring muscles to offer stability.  This all happens quickly - and most of you probably experience it in your low back as well.  The two least stable areas of the spine are in the cervical and lumbar regions.  When this happens, there are lots of nerves that can be caught in the cross fire and when they do, they will make you feel heat, sharp stabs, pins and needles, wetness or even electric shocks.  But basically, the muscles and connective tissue that sandwich a nerve have seized up and the nerve in between them got pinched.  Now that I finally typed that sentence out, I'm gonna copy/paste it to the top of my comment.</p>
<p>Edit to reply to the sleeping part - First, never sleep on your belly.  This kills the neck. Side sleeping is hard on your neck, shoulders and hips, too though.  It is really hard to train yourself to sleep on your back, but it is the best way to sleep for your body.  You need to have a low profile pillow for your neck, but your mid back and shoulders feel much more comfortable if they are slightly raised.  Think wedge or a reclined position.  Then your low back needs support, too.  But you do that by supporting your knees!  Sounds off, but it's true.  Placing a pillow under your knees will change the angle where the femur inserts into the pelvis and therefore the pressure applied to the SI Joint - that's where your sacrum meets up with the top of your hip bones, which is the area most people point to as &quot;low back pain&quot;.  Anyway, I get that it sounds daunting and impossible, but it isn't.  I'm a massage therapist and I give this same advice to lots of people.  Some of them are no-fuss types who just throw away the pillows and force themselves to sleep on their backs.  Done. (Rare, but they are out there).  Some are more creative and they buy memory foam wedges to give them some lift under their mid back and shoulders, then stack a very thin pillow under their head/neck and put a body pillow under their knees.  Others (like me) decide to throw a fuck ton of money at it and buy one of those beds that raises and lowers like a hospital bed.  I went to school for massage therapy almost 10 years ago and while I was there, we learned a lot about postures and dysfunctional movement patterns that contribute to chronic pain.  Before then, I had chronic shoulder and neck pain as an exclusive side sleeper. When I started addressing the way I sleep and either received regular massage or self-treated, I pretty much solved my pain issues.  I still wake up on my side from time to time, but then I just roll back onto my back and go back to sleep.  It takes years! But it's worth it.</p>
<p>And, can I add that regular massage therapy is a great way to help manage pain!?!? It's not just a luxury for wealthy vacationers.  95% of my clients are regulars who come in to keep their pain at bay.  I have truck drivers, carpenters, athletes, mail carriers, hair dressers, office workers*. It just so happens that massage therapy also feels good, so there's a bonus to using it as a tool for optimal health.  Give it a try.</p>
<p>*office workers - jutting your chin slightly forward to see the computer screen tightens up the suboccypital muscles at the base of the skull and can cause headaches.  Also - the mouse hand - I often see chronic shoulder pain that seems like it is underneath the shoulder blade where you just never can quite reach it.  Then pain/numbness will sometimes spread to the chest and/or down the arm and into the thumb and first couple of fingers. That's referral pain from the scalenes!  Google &quot;trigger point referral pain scalenes&quot; and see if that pain pattern doesn't look familiar.  Switching your mouse to the other side for a few weeks and getting a good massage can fix that.  </p>
<p>I'll stop now, but man, I could talk about bodywork all day LOL</p>
<p>Ok, I have some time before I need to go to work, so I'll give you all a quick lesson on muscle tension. When I get a client who wants to try to self manage their muscle tension at home, they always ask &quot;what are muscle knots, what causes them and how I get rid of them and/or stop them from coming back?&quot; So here's how I try to explain it - First, imagine that you have long hair that's tied up in a tight ponytail.  You get caught in the rain and after you run into the house you take your hair down to find that the outer layer is soaking wet but the inner layer is bone dry.  The water can't really seep through where the hair was tightly bound by the rubber band.  Your muscles are the same way.  They are made up of lots of long muscle fibers very much like that ponytail.  Now, here's the part that sounds crazy.  When your muscles contract, those fibers attach to each other and kind of &quot;choke up&quot; to get a better grip.  The contraction is automatic and the act of releasing that grip requires energy.  &quot;What!?!?  It takes strength and energy to lift something, so the contraction should require energy and the release is when you relax and let go.  Right?&quot;  Nope.  Sorry, but it's the opposite.  For a good example of this, think about rigor mortis.  After a body dies and the muscle fibers stop receiving the oxygen and nutrients they need, they go into a permanent state of contraction. That's because they stopped receiving the energy they require to &quot;let go&quot;.  So, contraction is automatic and the release requires energy.  Got it.  That energy comes in via fluid, right? So, in order for a cell to receive the nutrients it needs, do its job and then create waste that also needs to be taken away, it needs to have fluid coming in and going out.  We call this cellular respiration.  In order to work properly, your muscles need a constant flow of fluid into the deepest fibers.  If they are over used, the deepest fibers might not get the nutrients they need to release.  This is what &quot;muscles knots&quot; are.  So now, understanding what causes these &quot;knots&quot;, it's easier to come up with ways to treat them.  The first and fastest solution is to use brute force and manually separate the fibers to let the fluid in - as if you're trying to help get the center of that ponytail soaking wet while standing in the shower.  But brute force can be very painful and, depending on the location, not really safe to do without proper training. For this you can hire a qualified massage therapist.  Other, gentler ways include heat and ice.  Heat will open up the capillaries and encourage a rush of blood into the area locally.  Think of this as a soak in the tub instead of standing under the shower.  Most people are familiar with how relieving heat can feel.  The trouble is, though, that most people stop there.  They open up all the things and get good blood flow into the area and then just leave it there.  They forget how important it is to &quot;exhale&quot;.  Complete cellular respiration requires an inhale and an exhale.  Drawing all that fluid in and then leaving it there can contribute to inflammation and result in more pain.  Following up with cold therapy will push the fluid out.  So my recommendation is to always start with hot and end with cold.  Ice is no longer just for a sprained ankle! (Make an ice pack with a tube sock and rice.  It has the same therapeutic value as ice with a less jarring, icey feeling) Repeat this cycle with some light stretching and I promise you'll notice a significant difference.  And, speaking of pushing fluid in and out, it makes sense to hear that this whole process works much better if you're well hydrated, right?  This is why hydration matters for muscle pain.  If your rivers are dry, they can't bring in nutrients and remove waste, right?  So help your body out by making sure it's well hydrated and can do it's jobs properly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Many are talking about a 'pinched nerve', but a pinched nerve will cause a lot of pain down into your arm with numbness and tingling and often take months to get better (if there's swelling on the nerve). It's only a nerve as far as nerves are what send the pain signals for you to feel them.</p>
<p>A sharp pain in your neck is non-specific - it's probably a combination of things. There are a dozen joints in your neck that can give you pain if moved 'wrong', there are dozens of muscles that can 'pinch', and there are other structures like ligaments and discs that can create pain.</p>
<p>The burning can be the result of the pain nerves responding to one of these structures, or it can be another group of nerves called 'sympathetic' nerves that give us feeling in our skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some weird responses in here. I've felt a fair bit of nerve pain including the pain/sensation you're speaking of. My guess is when you move your head rapidly, a nerve gets hung up on something near it, stretches out, then releases quickly like a rubber band and snaps back into place. This shocks and vibrates the nerve and your brain interprets it as pain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
