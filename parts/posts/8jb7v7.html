		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As many people have already brought up, but here in more detail of the history</p>
<p>The Sumerians watched the Sun, Moon, and the five visible planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn), primarily for omens. They did not try to understand the motions physically. They did, however, notice the circular track of the Sun's annual path across the sky and knew that it took about 360 days to complete one year's circuit. Consequently, they divided the circular path into 360 degrees to track each day's passage of the Sun's whole journey. This probably happened about 2400 BC.</p>
<p>That's how we got a 360 degree circle. Around 1500 BC, Egyptians divided the day into 24 hours, though the hours varied with the seasons originally. Greek astronomers made the hours equal. About 300 to 100 BC, the Babylonians subdivided the hour into base-60 fractions: 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. The base 60 of their number system lives on in our time and angle divisions.</p>
<p>An 100-degree circle makes sense for base 10 people like ourselves. But the base-60 Babylonians came up with 360 degrees and we cling to their ways-4,400 years later.</p>
<p>A 100degree circle is actually used to a large extent in my profession (land surveyor) where a circle has 400 as its base, called Gon instead of degrees.</p>
<p>When I was in the military we used a  circlebase of 6300 for proper targeting with artillery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We consider 100 to be a round number because we are used to using a base-10 counting system.  In ancient Sumeria, they used a sexagismal, base 60 counting system.
So for them, 6 * 60 was a perfectly rounded number. </p>
<p>The reason the circle has 360° is because it was defined by ancient peoples that used a different number system to us.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yep, most of the comments here are correct, it's because the number 360 is so darn-tootin' divisible without a remainder, which wasn't invented until 'recently'.</p>
<p>Want to split it in half?  each part is then an even 180</p>
<p>Want to split it in 3 ?  Each part is then an even 120</p>
<p>4?  each part is then 90</p>
<p>5?  Hey, we can actually do that!  each part is 72</p>
<p>6?  No problemo!  Each part is 60</p>
<p>7?  no, screw you and your 7</p>
<p>8?  That's easy!  each part is 45</p>
<p>9? No problemo!  Each part is 40</p>
<p>10?  Can you remove a 0?  Yes we can!  Each part is 36</p>
<p>11? No.  No 7 and no 11, no matter what some supermarkets tell you.</p>
<p>12? Does the pope poop like the rest of us?  Each part is 30.</p>
<p>I'll leave the rest of the numbers (up to 360) as an exercise to the reader.  It's fun to see how to numbers undulate and where the mid-point falls (i.e. the closest integer ratio value of the square root).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because 360 is a nice number that can be divided evenly by many numbers - 2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12...</p>
<p>It's also theorized that 360 was chosen because it is close to the number of days in a year. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
