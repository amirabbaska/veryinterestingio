		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how you define efficient: greatest volume per square unit of packaging? Weaire-Phelan. Least amount of unutilized space? Least amount of wasted space in a shipping container or truck? Different answers altogether.</p>
<p>Rectangular prisms work really well for most purposes which is why milk cartons and cardboard boxes are common. Weare-Phelan does not work well for packing in shipping containers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If by &quot;efficient&quot; you mean packing spheres into a volume (as opposed to the efficient hexagonal tiling of circles on a plane), there are actually two solutions: the face centered cubic (fcc) lattice and the hexagonal close packed (hcp) lattices, which both achieve a packing density of Pi/(3*Sqrt[2]) or about 74%.   This was recently proved by TC Hales in 1998.  </p>
<p>An example of the face centered cubic lattice is the stacking of oranges or cannonballs into a pyramidal stack.  The fcc and hcp lattices differ by a shift between layers of the lattice, with fcc being a shift of ABCABCABC (the same shift between layers) and hcp alternating between shifts ABABAB.  </p>
<p>Not coincidentaly, many metals or other elements also arrange their atoms in the fcc and hcp lattices.   For example aluminum, copper and nickel are fcc, and titanium and magnesium are hcp.  There are other alternatives.  In practice there are many considerations to how atoms pack into crystal lattices, but many elements are fcc and hcp.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
