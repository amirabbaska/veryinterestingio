		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Voyager 1 is <a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/" target="_blank">currently</a> about 19.5 billion Km away from Earth.  Converted to light years, thats 0.00206607877 ly. Multiply by 365.242199 light days in a light year to get 0.75461915326 light days.  Which means it could take a picture of Earth as it was about 18 hours ago.  For us to view that image it would take the same time to transmit back to us so if we viewed a picture it would be 36 hours old.  Since its before noon here, the date of the Earth in the pic would be the 7th. But the picture  was taken on the 8th, and received on the 9th.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Voyager I actually HAS taken one of Earth after it left Saturn. This picture is often called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot" target="_blank">Pale Blue Dot</a>, and the Earth is less than a pixel in apparent size at this point. It can't take another picture of Earth, but already in this image the scale of the Solar System is dwarfing our ability to comprehend it.</p>
<p>The light reaching it is whatever was happening <del>6</del> 18 hours ago. Just not much of the light reflecting off of Earth hits Voyager I since it's so far away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To expand on that. What is the most it could theoretically see? Basically, I'm curious if there is a formula (or something less formal) that takes in as variables the distance from an object, and the size of the lens; and outputs a resolution. </p>
<p>For as far out as the Voyager 1 is, I'd assume it would need a lens a mile wide just to make out basic weather patterns.</p>
<p>As a bonus, I'm curious how much our processing ability factors into this. Are the rays of light simply just that spread out at that point? That when the &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot; picture was taken, was it the case that no amount of tech (short of a larger device capturing the light) could have could have gotten a better picture? Or was there a possibility of a much greater resolution being obtained if the light captors were more sensitive, and the processing was more intelligent?</p>
<p>Edit: Why did I get down-voted? I was just asking a question. :(</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
