		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has a lot to do with how fluid is distributed in your body. When you are awake, and most importantly upright, excess fluid tends to accumulate on your lower half, just because of gravity. When you are asleep and laying flat, the fluid is evenly distributed throughout your body. So when you first wake up, your face is &quot;puffier&quot; looking than usual. Add to that messy hair, and lack of makeup for some people, and you're going to think you look bad in the mornings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main reason why you look uglier in the mornings is due to a build up to lymph in your face. The lymphatic system doesn't actively transport lymph, it primarily uses the surrounding muscles that are moving to push itself around. Since when you sleep you move very little, the lymph that gravity pulls to your face while your sleeping doesn't leave, your face is left looking puffy. This, along with other factors like bed head and general groggyness makes you look ugly, compared to your usual self. By the time you get up out of bed, brush your teeth, and comb your hair, you've moved around enough that the lymph in your face gets redistributed and you look perfectly normal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
