		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Excluding specialty and high-end companies, there aren't really dozens of independent car brands. Most of them are owned by a few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry#Top_vehicle_manufacturing_groups_by_volume" target="_blank">large conglomerates</a>. Volkswagen, GM, and FCA all own 10 or more brands. </p>
<p>And there are a lot of other partial ownerships. FCA owns 90% of Ferrari. Nissan owns 34% of Mitsubishi and Renault owns 43% of Nissan. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Only a few industries are limited to a small number of major players. Typically this happens because of <em>network effects</em> where you're better off having the same brand as other people -- for example computer operating systems, where you want lots of apps to work on your computer. Sometimes it happens from <em>economies of scale</em> -- it's easier for one company to run 20 supermarkets in the same city than for 20 companies to each run 1.</p>
<p>Most industries that have a large number of consumers also have a large number of companies as suppliers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are plenty of markets with wide competition. Cell phones, for example. People talk about Android vs iPhone vs Windows vs Blackberry, but both Android and Windows (especially Android) have multiple manufacturers competing with each other.</p>
<p>Motorola, LG, Samsung, Lumia, ZTE, and more.</p>
<p>Computers work the same way, with &quot;PC&quot; encompassing dozens of manufacturers from Dell to HP to Alienware</p>
<p>In fact, I can think of more industries that have a lot of competition than ones with only a little.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I drove a truck for a very short time. But I noticed. Many many loads were finished bulky items. You haul a lot of pipe. Then there were dense loads, sheets of metal used to make pipe. Not as many loads.  </p>
<p>A car is a bulky item, lots of air inside. You have to be careful with it when shipping. You cannot pack it tight like you do sheet metal. All Japanese cars used to come from Japan, a long ocean trip. Now many of them are made in the USA. </p>
<p>A car is many components made a lot of places. Once assembled it is more difficult to ship than the components. There is a lot of advantage to having multiple assembly points around the world. Other things can be built in one place and shipped easily.</p>
<p>There used to be a method for deciding where to put a factory. The weight of all the components would be determined. On a flat map a pin would be placed at the source of each component. A comparable weight of washers would be tied together and strung from the pin. A string from that weight would be tied from the point of origin of the resource. All the strings would be tied together. The center of the strings would be where the factory should be located for the least cost of shipping. </p>
<p>In other words a steel plant would be located between the source of coal, the source of the iron ore, and the destination of the steel. Exactly where depends on the weight or amount of each component.</p>
<p>Now steel is made with electricity and steel plants are near waterways with barges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would say that's relative, the automotive industry for a while was just a handful of players and while international trading has made it seem like there is a lot of choice, if you look back on the history of the industry, lots of other companies have folded or been absorbed into the companies you know today. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
