		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As we all know, sound is a series of pressure wave travelling in air: sound waves are caused by oscillations of pressure in the air.  The loudness of a sound possible on earth is limited by the size of this oscillation of air pressure.  This presents a natural limit to how loud a (sustained) sound can get - the pressure of the air cannot drop below a vacuum.  So the loudest (sustained) sound possible is therefore a pressure wave oscillating between vacuum and +2 atmospheres.  And this is equal to 194 decibels.  No sound on earth (at sea level) can exceed 194 decibels because of this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound pressure level (dB SPL) is a measure of how much the air pressure is changing</p>
<p>194 dB is the result of a sound wave that takes the air pressure from the normal 101 kPa and brings it down to 0 and up to 202 kPa. Since you can't get below 0 pressure, any more energy just creates a taller peak resulting in an asymmetric wave and we call those shock waves instead of sound waves</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The loudness of a sound is nothing more than the difference between maximum and minimum air pressure of the sound wave. The bigger the difference, the louder the sound.</p>
<p>At sea level, air pressure is 1 atm. The lowest pressure possible in a sound wave is a complete vaccuum: 0 atm. Because sound waves are symmetrical, the oscillation the other way is the same size and therefore 2 atm. Put these numbers into a fancy mathematical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure#Sound_pressure_level" target="_blank">formula</a> and we can see that this translates to 194dB.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound is rapid and repeated change in air pressure.  A wave more dense air followed by less dense air vibrates your eardrum or microphone, and we perceive this as sound.  The greater the difference in density, the louder the sound.</p>
<p>At 194 dB, the dense air is at twice normal pressure, and the less dense air is essentially a vacuum.  You can't get less dense than a vacuum, so that serves as a maximum limit in sound intensity.</p>
<p>Note that you can get louder sounds than 194 dB if the sound travels through a denser medium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
