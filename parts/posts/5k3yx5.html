		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of reasons for this, ranging from the type of instruments used, all the way to the pattern of the chords in the song itself. I'm really sorry for how long this post is. There is a chunk of musical theory I can talk to you about. I am not an expert on this so if anyone else wants to chime in they're free to. I am leaving a lot out.</p>
<p>So, let's talk about cadences. </p>
<p>----- CADENCES AND SHIT -----</p>
<p>An important way songs/musical passages resolve themselves is through cadences. </p>
<p>A cadence is a sequence of notes or chords in a song that make up a closing phrase of a piece of music. </p>
<p>Have you ever sung a hymn in church? Do you remember when you knew the song was over when everyone sang 'A-men' and it sounded a little different to the rest of the song? Or when you listen to a piece of classical music and there's that &quot;DUNNN.....<em>DUUUUUNNNNNN!!!</em>&quot; at the end? The reason for this is because the song itself uses a two (or more) chord message to tell everyone 'hey, i'm done now'. It's not just to do with the lyrics. </p>
<p>There are four main types of cadences which are commonly used. To begin with, you have to know the key of the song, in order to determine the chords. This song, from what I can hear, is in C major and then changes key up into D major. </p>
<p>A 'scale' is a series of notes used to make up the key of a song. It's like a set pattern of notes that the song follows. Nearly all songs have a key and a scale - can be major (happy) or minor (sad) if they don't, it usually sounds really weird and you can tell straight away. It doesn't necessarily sound bad though.</p>
<p>C major only uses the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B and then back up to C.  This can either mean it only uses those notes, or it will (generally) only use chords <em>beginning</em> with those notes (I.e. D minor, F major, G major. No F# major, Bb minor, what have you. Just the white notes if you go and look at a piano.) </p>
<p>The 'downward' melody you hear throughout the song you've linked goes C, to B, to A, to G - so it travels backwards through the scale. It begins on C, and ends with G. This then repeats over and over gradually adding more instruments. </p>
<p>So, let's say we number each of those notes to let us know what interval, or place they hold in the scale:   </p>
<p>C major = I, D minor= II, E minor = III, F  major = IV, G major = V, A minor = VI, B diminished= VII.  </p>
<p>There is no 'VIII' because you would just be going back to the same note as I - so it only goes up to VII. </p>
<p>If you go and look at a piece of sheet music and see these roman numerals - this is why. It's a shorthand way of telling you how the song's chords are progressing.</p>
<p>(As a side note, these numbers can be transferred to all types of scales as each one has 7 different notes used, 8 if you count the duplicate of the starting note of the scale. You can transfer these numerals onto any scale - so if you decide the key is in D major, like the key change In the song you linked : </p>
<p>D = I, E = II, F# = III, G = IV, A = V, B = VI, C#=VII. And so on and so forth with any scale you like.)</p>
<p>Nearly all pop songs use a certain formula in their music. A <em>huge</em> one involves chords I, IV and V. These are the big bosses of chords. Go and look up some guitar tabs and see how many use C, F and G. (VI is often used too - this is known as the 'relative minor' chord in a major scale, so for C it will be A minor, D will be B minor, and so on and so forth.)</p>
<p>Moving back to types of cadences/resolutions in music:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The 'perfect' cadence</strong> is <em>chord V to chord I</em>. This is <em>the</em> cadence. So in this case it would be G to C. The song ends by going back to the 'root' note - the one which tells you the key of the song. So, C for C major. It ties everything together in a neat little bow and ends how it begins, hence why it's called 'perfect'. </p>
<p>The key change in this song goes up into D major - but at the end it resolves itself by going from chord V (A major)    to Chord I (D major). You can tell by listening to the notes of the guitar right at the end. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The 'imperfect' cadence</strong> is when the song moves from <em>chord I to chord V</em>. C to G. It sounds like the song intends to go on, but is stopped short somehow. Interestingly this seems to be what is happening in this song's chord progression right up until the end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The plagal cadence</strong> is the one I mentioned up top about singing hymns in church. This one goes from <em>Chord IV to chord I</em>. So if we go back and look at our chart, it goes from F major to C major. Again resolves on the 'root', tying everything up, but has a different feel to it and sounds a bit holy. It's also known as the 'amen' cadence. </p>
</li>
<li><strong>The 'interrupted' cadence is</strong> the 'hi, I just came to pop round unexpectedly and ruin your day' of cadences. This is where you think the song is going to end on a perfect cadence, but fuck that shit, it throws in a minor chord instead and throws off the mood.</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT: I've only brushed the surface of cadences. There are hundreds of potential progressions, all used for different effects. Ranging from jazz to Bach chorales, there are tons and tons which work in different ways to excite the listener, or are used for narrative purposes.   </p>
<hr />
<p>Aside from the musical theory part of it though - like I said, it can be to do with how loud the music is, and the instrumentation. This song uses a lot of 'sweet', sentimental instruments like an acoustic guitar, a glockenspiel, a piano. It deliberately builds up and up until it suddenly dies away, eventually resolving itself at the end and coming to a close - much like the aforementioned 'hero's journey'.</p>
<p>We're naturally predisposed to want to resolve things that are left open, so it's understandable that a song such as this will drag it out and build upon it until finally you reach that conclusion ... Or if the composer has a different intention, they'll throw you off with an interrupted cadence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is all about tension and the resolution of that tension. The more tension you create, the more gratifying it is to your ears when you resolve the tension.</p>
<p>Let's use clothing as an example... you may have a green shirt that goes really well with your blue pants. Green and blue are two completely different colors, yet somehow they really work together. On the other hand, if you have an orange shirt, and orange pants, but the shade of orange is slightly different, it can be really hard on your eyes. -and you wish with all your heart those pants were just a bit darker. You can create that same tension in music.</p>
<p>A very strong tension/resolution in music is moving from the fifth note of the scale to the first note of the scale. - let's call it &quot;five/one&quot; at 1:53, he takes it a step further which catches your ear. He plays  the &quot;five&quot;, then instead of going back to the &quot;one&quot; like he is supposed to, he plays one step higher (let's say &quot;sharp five&quot;). Mind blown. You have no idea where he's going now. It could be anywhere. All the rules are broken now. But wait! Then he goes straight to the &quot;one&quot;. Oh thank you lord, we made it home. Don't scare me like that!</p>
<p>At 2:06, he saying &quot;so you are all comfortable with that &quot;five/one&quot;? You rely on it to show you where Home is? Well how about this? I'm changing your home. &quot;One&quot; is now in a completely new place. Don't like it? Tough.  But wait. This new &quot;one&quot; has its own &quot;five&quot; too. In fact, I might even like this &quot;five/one&quot; better than the old one. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few others have done an outstanding job answering the question directly. Thanks to OP for providing a sound clip.</p>
<p>I want to elaborate with a homemade example about how the choice of chords (and the arrangement supporting them) specifically impacts the emotions and experience of the listener. The arrangement I made is more in the style of a TV score, but the principles are evident in all genres of music.</p>
<p>Here's the 4 1/2-minute audio file: <a href="http://www.darkrhetoric.com/MajorMinorStudy.mp3" target="_blank">http://www.darkrhetoric.com/MajorMinorStudy.mp3</a></p>
<p>Feel free to pause at the end of each &quot;section&quot; to read the comments below. See if they align with what you felt when listening. Also, I'm neither a professional musician (proof: strings aren't written in divisi) nor a music teacher (proof: inaccurate, subjective nomenclature); this is all just a fascinating hobby to me. Enjoy! ^_^</p>
<h1>0:00 to 0:25 - Grounding</h1>
<p>[0:00] Key of C
[0:05] Intro to Major Progression
[0:14] Intro to Minor Progression</p>
<p>The key we're in and the progressions we'll hear are introduced. F G C and F G Am.</p>
<h1>0:26 to 0:54 - Major, Premature Ending</h1>
<p>[0:46] Resolves to C Major</p>
<p>This sequence simply and quickly resolves to C Major. It sounds trite, premature, and ultimately necessary because the resolution wasn't &quot;earned.&quot; The arrangement ends abruptly, adding to the cheap and gratuitous feel.</p>
<h1>0:55 to 1:38 - Minor, No End In Sight</h1>
<p>[1:15] Resolves to A Minor
[1:29] Holds on F Major
[1:34] Resolves to C Major</p>
<p>This sequence resolves to A Minor but then continues, because continuation just feels right. In the context of the arrangement, resolving to A Minor sounds incomplete.</p>
<h1>1:41 to 2:25 - Minor w/Arrangment Support</h1>
<p>[2:00] Resolves to A Minor
[2:20] Resolves to C Major</p>
<p>Resolving to A Minor is viable, but it must be supported by the arrangement (unlike the example above where attempting to &quot;end&quot; on A Minor just kept the piece flowing). With arrangement support, ending on A Minor sounds bittersweet. Peaceful, but there is still pain. You could picture the hero having prevailed, but at great cost, with permanent damage and losses that will never be forgotten.</p>
<h1>2:26 to 3:04 - Major w/Arrangement Support</h1>
<p>[2:46] Resolves to C Major</p>
<p>This &quot;dropout&quot; style can be used to end on C Major, too. The effect is similar to the above, but unlike a painful loss, dropping out beneath C Major evokes feelings of transcendence: A voluntary parting with things past and a wistful look toward the past framing the hero's vision of the future.</p>
<h1>3:05 to 3:16 - Re-Grounding</h1>
<p>[3:05] Intro to Original Major Pattern (redundant)</p>
<p>Here we have that trite original progression, once again, quickly resolving to C Major. This helps frame the final sequence.</p>
<h1>3:17 to 4:03 - Major, Heavily-Affirmed</h1>
<p>[3:36] Resolves to Major</p>
<p>Ending on C Major can be done with other kinds of arrangement support (i.e. something other the &quot;dropout&quot; style we heard earlier). A quick resolution to C can be cloying and saccharinely-sweet if done prematurely, hesitantly, or in a way the audience is unprepared for. In this sequence, we go for broke: Doubling down on the sweetness. Pounding that C Major happiness into the listeners' heads.</p>
<p>Have you ever had a cup of coffee with just a bit too much sugar? This is not that. This is an extravagant mug of hot cocoa with whipped cream, ice cream, chocolate syrup, overflowing the sides of the cup and onto the saucer, topped with cinnamon, berries, and mint leaves. Easily too sweet (and too much), but at least you know what you're in for.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Choice of chords and arrangements of strings, pads, and other subdued materials can be particularly potent when supporting spoken word: Not just in movies but on-stage, too (contemporary Christian praise/worship comes to mind).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think a part of it is essentially a Pavlovian response, on top of what others have already said.</p>
<p>If you think about it, in every movie or TV show the same part of the song comes on at the same time in the story. We're trained to associate that part of the song, which typically has those chords and notes, with the resolution of the story. I imagine if a different set of chords and/or notes were used we would likely get that feeling from them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a slow song that's bright, major, and sentimental sounding. It starts with sparse instrumentation, builds, adds more instruments, modulates, reaches a climax, then thins back out to more sparse instruments. Do these things in a song, and voila! Sappy emotional release ensues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
