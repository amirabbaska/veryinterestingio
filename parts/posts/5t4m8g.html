		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you have very low blood sugar, your pancreas releases a hormone called glucagon into the blood stream, which triggers the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose to raise blood sugar levels. A side effect of glucagon is nausea, and we're not really sure why. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two main reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>your blood sugar has dropped enough to cause a mild case of hypoglycemia, which can be associated with nausea, shakiness, lightheadedness</p>
</li>
<li>an excess of stomach acids is irritating the lining of your stomach and causing inflammation. This happens in people who have issues with their stomach emptying properly especially. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is a huge relief. My doctor also recommended a high protein diet especially first thing in the morning to get longer lasting stability. Mine is caused by the way my celiac's affects my hormones and endocrine system. Took a while to figure it out, but finally found a doc that focuses on auto immune diseases and how they interact with the endocrine system. Helped me so much to try to manage it, but it is still a constant battle to stabilize since hormones are so variable throughout the month. My hypoglycemia is much worse during ovulation and my period. Realized this after my doc made me track symptoms on a period tracker app. Connected the dots after that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
