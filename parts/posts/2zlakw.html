<blockquote>
<p>Federal rules protect you if you are &quot;bumped&quot; on most flights within the United States and on outbound international flights. Passengers who are involuntarily bumped are protected under Federal Aviation Administration guidelines. If you volunteer to be bumped, your agreement with the airline that is not regulated and will depend on negotiating at the gate.
<strong>The airline must give you a written statement describing your rights, as well as the airline's boarding priority rules and criteria. If the airline is not able to get you to your final destination within one hour of your original arrival time, the airline must pay you an amount equal to 200% of your one-way fare, with a maximum of $650.</strong> To receive this payment, you must have a confirmed reservation. You must also meet the airline's deadlines for ticketing and check-in. An airline may offer you a free ticket on a future flight in place of a check, but you have the right to insist on a check.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, you can sell things even if you don't have them.</p>
<p>You can order out of stock/back order items from stores, for instance. The only requirement is that they actually fulfill the order as described in a reasonably time frame.</p>
<p>When it comes to airlines, while the practice isn't ideal, but its not an issue generally speaking. There are always some amount of cancellations/no shows, and they don't want to fly under capacity. The issue arises when less people cancel than usual, and a situation like yours happens.</p>
<p>As long as the airline provides you a flight, in the class you paid for, from the departure/destination your want, they're in the clear (even if the timing is off). </p>
<p>Often, they'll give a free upgrade, discount, or other incentive to customers who were forced off their flight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>Somewhere between 5% and 10% of airline passengers won't make their scheduled flight, due to cancellations, missed connections, change of schedule, or just plain no shows.</p>
<p>The airlines could just keep those seat empty, and charge everyone more, or they could assume a certain amount of people won't be on the flight, and sell a few more tickets.</p>
<p>The airlines are actually pretty good at this...they do it on just about every flight, very few passengers are bumped, and flight costs are lowered for everyone.  You only notice it the few times it doesn't work, usually when a flight gets cancelled and there is a glut of people who need to be rebooked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
