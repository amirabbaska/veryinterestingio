		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine folding a piece of piece of paper in half, then opening it up.  The crease down the middle remains, and the paper no longer lies flat.  Imagine creasing the paper once every inch across, now it will curl up a bit.  When you drag a ribbon across a pair of scissors, you are creating one continuous crease.  This makes it curl up! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Forcing the ribbon to bend around the sharp corner of the scissor edge permanently stretches the outer side of the ribbon so it ends up being longer than the inner side. This makes the ribbon form a curl. A sharper edge and slower movement both make the curl tighter.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This happens with everything, not just a ribbon. When you run a blade across one side of the ribbon, a bending stress is applied to the surface of the ribbon. This stress causes the top half of the ribbon to pull together creating a bending moment, and therefore curls. And, when you run the blade across the other side stress is put on that side and they cancel out. But if the ribbon is thick enough it will have the internal strength to counteract the stress.</p>
<p>Again, this happens to everything and in manufacturing it is something that may need to be taken into account. If you are running a thin part through a sand blaster (to rough it up for another step, or remove unwanted material), the part will have a bend to it. The bend can either be remove with a bending step, or the part can be flipped over and sand blasted again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
