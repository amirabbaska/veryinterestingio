		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For Consideration:</p>
<p>I work in a small, single-owner breakfast and lunch place.  It's not 100% from-scratch (we don't bake the bread or make condiments, etc), but the important stuff is done in house (soup, meat, etc).  </p>
<p>When the cooks do the prep for a given day, they prep enough of everything according to proportion.  The lists are made -assuming- that every burger will get X number of tomato slices, Y slices of cheese, and so on.  So, although the guest skipped those slices of tomato, the restaurant already prepped them.  Many things don't keep very long once prepped/sliced, so whether you eat them or not, they're &quot;spent.&quot;  </p>
<p>Just spitballin' here.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A restaurant's job is to make money for the company that runs it. There is no incentive for the company to charge less money when you remove an item. Most people are still willing to pay the full price instead of leaving, so that is what the company will charge. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've worked in restaurants for about a decade. In my experience, kitchen staff won't make an item with extra ingredients unless the proper charge is on the ticket. In general, if you ask for something to be withheld, you'll just get extra of everything else. But since I'm just wait staff and not a manager or owner, I can't really change the price of your meal. The only exceptions I've seen be made are for when people want a half portion or something made very plain for a child. I would normally have to get it OK'ed by management and then they would adjust the price accordingly. </p>
<p>I find this incredibly annoying as both an employee and as a customer but there's not much I can do about it unless I open a place of my own. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, any alteration to how the menu is presented should cost the customer more, and never cost the customer less.  </p>
<p>The cost of assembling a menu item for the customer is already figured out.  The decor of the plate, the flavor combinations etc. have been planned out ahead of time, and you're asking to change that layout.  If you are altering the menu, you're creating a &quot;speed bump&quot; in the kitchen for the people who are preparing it.  </p>
<p>They will make it to your liking, however this will probably slow down the service for other customers.  If everyone changed the menu to their specific tastes, it would likely double the time it takes to prepare each meal, and it may alter the presentation and flavor profile that the chef had intended... and they risk making other patrons mad for slow service.  So naturally they're not going to encourage the practice by offering a discount for doing so.</p>
<p>If you're allergic or you generally don't like one aspect of a menu item, it doesn't hurt to ask for an alteration.  But don't expect them to say yes (so have an alternate item picked out), and don't expect to pay less... because you're wrecking the flow and order of the kitchen.  And you don't want to piss off the people who are making your food behind closed doors, nor make the waitress the target of an upset kitchen staff.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you buy a car, you're buying a whole car.  You can't just say &quot;well.. what would that cost me without tail lights and a back seat?&quot; They can't answer that because nobody's bothered to figure out what the car is worth without that.  Now, if you want to get it with <em>extra</em> features, they can tell you what it will cost to add them.</p>
<p>It's the same way at a restaurant.  A dish is the combination of all the ingredients, not a list of ingredients that you can pick and choose from.  If you want something extra, you can get it priced as an add-on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
