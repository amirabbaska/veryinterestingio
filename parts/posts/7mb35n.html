EDIT:  Looks like I was partially wrong.  Quoting /u/psfilmsbob &quot;Every carrier has roaming deals with other carriers who use the same signal, meaning your AT+T phone will work on T-Mobile towers, vice-versa. Same with every major carrier.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After being stranded in the middle of the Big Bend backcountry, I can attest that calling 911, even on “emergency calls only” doesn’t always work.</p>
<p>Word to the wise, for any outdoorsy people on this thread: buy a satellite phone</p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>Story below in the comments but just thought I’d put it here as well </p>
<p>Its just good to have. We honestly couldn’t’ve prevented our situation. Friends foot was bleeding intensely and as a result we were not keeping pace with our water consumption. It was desert weather mid spring and no rivers, so we had to carry all our water the entire trip and it would’ve taken days for my friend to get back, so we would’ve run out.</p>
<p>Ended up giving almost all our water to one guy so he can go all the way back himself to his car and go off-road to either come get us or get help. It was weird how valuable water sorta became, made me change my perspectives on life in a few ways. In a sense I knew that we could eat cactus to stay alive, and we knew the way back to the road, but just being put in that situation where things are kinda uncertain was strange. I remember giving that guy almost all our water and thinking that there was no way for me to know what is about to happen until it just sorta happened.</p>
<p>Interesting experience 10/10 for life lessons 2/10 would do again</p>
<p>The guy came back with his car, we got back within 20 ish hours</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My time to shine. I've written software for this -- if I say anything more, I might be identified easily by the people who know this. </p>
<p>Edit: Important and useful distinction: At least one carrier needs to have coverage in the location you are trying to make an emergency call from. If none of them do, your cellphone won't be able to connect an emergency call. It's not magic, just engineering :)</p>
<p>Edit: Since this got upvoted like crazy, disclaimer time. Do not use anything I've said here to make decisions on how you want to act in an emergency. Assume anything I've said below can be completely wrong. Having said that, I've been as truthful as I can be and as my memory serves me.</p>
<p>The physical components for connecting to cell phone towers of various carriers and various tech (2G, 3G, etc) are mostly the same. The difference comes in which cell towers you tune to. A cell phone connects to a tower by &quot;tuning&quot; into what are called bands or channels. For something simple as GSM, it is literally frequency bands. For newer tech like CDMA and LTE, it's a bit more complicated because the tower signal jumps frequency bands and is mathematically encoded (stuff that even I don't understand well). </p>
<p>When you buy phones from different carriers, they are set to ignore bands or channels that the carrier doesn't use. It serves several purposes - 1) to make sure you can't take to phone to another carrier 2) to make sure your phone doesn't waste time and battery tuning to cell towers that won't accept them (if you have an AT&amp;T service, the T-Mobile tower will reject you even if you can talk to it) 3) Less testing of the phone necessary, etc. There's software that picks the best tower out of all the towers your phone can hear/talk to
(you might be able hear/talk to multiple towers from your carrier, you want to pick the closest one or the one that supports the fastest data, etc).</p>
<p>When you make an emergency call, the software that's responsible for picking to tower tells the tuning software &quot;THIS IS A FUCKIN EMERGENCY CALL. FULL SPEED AHEAD! CONNECT TO WHATEVER YOU CAN FIND&quot;. The tuning software also keeps track of the last few bands/channels in which it saw any signal. It'll try them first so that you can connect the call quickly. If it can't find any, it'll do a full sweep of all the bands the physical hardware can possibly tune to. </p>
<p>Once it finds a tower, the software for making calls says &quot;HEY MAN, I KNOW WE MIGHT NOT BE COOL WITH EACH OTHER, BUT THIS IS A FUCKIN EMERGENCY CALL MAN! CAN YOU PLEASE CONNECT THIS?&quot;.</p>
<p>The tower goes &quot;OH FUCK! SHIT! I'll connect you&quot;. If the tower is at full capacity, it'll kick out someone who's not in an emergency call and then connect the incoming emergency call.</p>
<p>In fact, you don't even need a SIM card (in some countries) or ever have had service in a cell phone to make an emergency call. That's why when there's no SIM card, the phone will still tune to a tower with good signal and show &quot;Emergency call mode&quot;. This is to make sure we don't waste time when you actually need to make an emergency call. This is why if you are in an area with no cell service from any carrier, your phone drains the battery soon - because it keeps searching each band asking &quot;Can any tower hear me?&quot;. So you should put it in airplane mode. And if you are in airplane mode and make an emergency call, it'll automatically get out of airplane mode. Again to save you time.  </p>
<p>In case your call disconnects, you phone will connect back to the same tower again. This is so that the carrier can try to locate you using the tower signals. If you had connected to another tower, the emergency people might have to connect to the different carrier and start locating you all over again. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: don't try the next part in a real emergency unless you really don't have any other options. I'm not sure all phones do, but a significant portion of them will. </p>
<p>Each country has a different emergency call number. It's 911 in the US, it's 112 (I think) in Europe, something else in Japan. What if someone goes to a different country and get into an emergency? They won't remember what that country's emergency number is -- so the software in your phone will see you are dialing 911 in Europe and go &quot;this person just wants to make an emergency call. I'll just connect to 112 instead&quot;.</p>
<p>There's a ton of cool stuff that goes on in your phone and the carrier to make sure we do absolutely anything possible to connect an emergency call. </p>
<p>Hope this was an interesting read. </p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Wow, this blew up way more than I expected. My most up voted comment by a wide margin. Really happy that so many of you enjoyed it as much as I did writing some of this software. It makes me emotional when I think about this work. And obligatory thanks for the Reddit gold. </p>
<p>Edit: Also, so many people assuming that this means it's feasible to hack or asking if it's feasible to hack. No, it's super trivial to avoid hacking this to make free calls. The tower just needs to check the number you are calling is an actual emergency number. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if the emergency calls have special routing behavior to make sure it goes to your nearest call center. So it's even more easy to prevent free phone calls. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
