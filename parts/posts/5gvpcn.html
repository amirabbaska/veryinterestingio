		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tokamaks rely on current in the plasma to produce a poloidal field. Since the toroidal coils can't keep increasing the field strength forever, could tokamaks benefit from being run in a multiphase configuration? Could the decay of one toroidal field drive the production of another?</p>
<p>Are other heating methods sufficient to maintain a toroidal current, or are tokamaks a fundamentally transient configuration?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You really don't want to operate a pulsed fusion reactor. First, keep in mind that a reactor will be subject to large thermal and mechanical stresses. Cycling these stress on and off, as would happen in a pulsed reactor, will lead the rapid fatigue of the structural elements.  Also the start up phase of a tokamak is very inefficient. You lose a lot of energy breaking you ionize the gas forming a plasma.</p>
<p>For these reasons non-solenoidal current drive is an active area of research. The good news is that there are several promising forms of current drive that could allow us to operate a tokamak steady state. For example there are techniques like electron cyclotron current drive which uses radio frequency waves to drive current. A plasma will also naturally drive a current as you heat it up. Advanced reactor scenarios us these natural bootstrap currents to efficiently sustain the current.</p>
<p>Finally, a comment on vocabulary. The toroidal fields coils generate the toroidal magnetic field. The central solenoid inductively drives a toroidal plasma current which produces a poloidal magnetic field. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
