		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are covering a lot of ground here but missing your question.</p>
<p>Basically babies are born with a resivawr(sp, autocorrect you have failed me, you have failed yourself, and most of all you have failed the people of Reddit)  of nutrients (such as iron) that are not present in mom's breast milk.</p>
<p>They are in fact born with enough iron and various other nutrients to survive off it for many months - but for best health you'll want to supplement after the first couple.</p>
<p>So the answer is that babies can't survive off it forever either and eventually need to eat food with the missing nutrients. Adults can do roughly the same thing - you can survive (but not thrive) off potatoes and cow's milk and absolutely nothing else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nutritional values of the different species' milk change. Dogs have different nutritional needs than cats which have different nutritional needs from cows which have different nutritional needs from humans. </p>
<p>Adult dogs can, for instance, live off (Well designed) kibbles alone. That is a variety of 'formula'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This post made me imagine women being subsidized by society for their whole lives to keep the human population supplied with breast milk. This would be incredibly inefficient. Women require more calories to make milk than women who are not lactating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most mammals stop producing the enzyme that allows them to digest milk after they grow to a certain age. This varies by species and for humans happens around 4-5 years old. It is actually a mutation in a minority of humans that allows us to digest milk at all past this age, lactose intolerance is the natural state. </p>
<p>But milk does not have enough of the nutrients that you need to survive, it just has those needed for quick early growth with the rest already in the infant from before birth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
