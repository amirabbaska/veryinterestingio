		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am an EMT and it is a combination of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training time. An EMT is 6 months of training. A Medic is usually another 2 years after that. So in a little over the time it takes most to get an associates degree you can be a paramedic.</li>
<li>Supply and Demand. While your medic isn't as prevalent as say an EMT and those aren't as in supply as people who can work an entry level job without training the pay does go up as you become more sought after. This is partly to do with how fast Medics and EMTs can be trained. There are just oodles of EMTs and still many Medics and only a limited number of jobs.</li>
<li>Community Resources. Big cities have more resources and can pay Paramedics more than smaller cities. Every firefighter, police officer, and EMT/Medic wants to make big money in the big city. However, for the majority of Medics in the US that work for smaller towns they simply have to cut costs where they can and this usually comes in the community service part of things. It isn't just medical, fire, and law either. Schools are seeing their budgets tighten all the time. This is just the case across the board.</li>
<li>Medicaid/Medicare and the Uninsured: The law says that ambulances have to treat and transport you regardless of your ability to pay and that's the way it should be. But it also puts a strain on ambulance districts in two ways and this causes or doesn't help the bullet point above. The first way is that when Medicaid and Medicare pay they don't pay full price. Surprise, the government wants to keep its costs down and will only pay a certain amount. Sure, ok. At least we get paid from those programs. But the worse thing is people without insurance because we sometimes don't see a dime from people and have to send them to collections - which is terrible to ruin someone's credit over medical bills. But at the same time it would be equally terrible to see an ambulance district not be able to afford good equipment, hire competent staff and reward that staff appropriately, or, curse the thought, close down for good, because they didn't have an income. Most community ambulance districts aren't out to make a ton of money but that extra money is nice to afford better and safer equipment and afford training for the employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>And it really is a shame too because EMTs, Police, and firefighters usually have to pay for their own training (at least some if not all) and are really great pivot points of the communities they serve. I decided to get into EMS because it was a good job to have through college and I was helping people. It gave me purpose and made me feel good (and a little bit of money was nice too) but I ultimately did not feel it was a lifelong job I could do and make a real living at because of the low wages and near nonexistent benefits in that line of work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paramedic here, checking in late to the party, but I can offer some perspective. </p>
<p>There are too many EMS services in the U.S. Those who do the best pay/benefits wise are those who work for large, urban or county-wide EMS systems that are funded (at least partially) by the tax base of the area that they serve. I am fortunate enough to work for a municipal system that is funded via the tax base and billing for our services. With OT, I make over $100k. Since we are a municipal system, we are ran as a public safety bureau and not like a for-profit business. Why that is important is that the finances are viewed differently than the for-profit services. My Chief's salary doesn't change based upon how much profit he can squeeze out of the budget. We are viewed by our government as a necessary public safety service instead of a money making venture. Our government knows how valuable of a service we provide to our city and understands that in order to attract good people, they need to offer a good pay/benefits package. It's the cost of providing a service, not the cost of doing business. On top of that we are unionized, which is a big help. With every contract negotiation the union is working to improve the pay and benefits that we receive. </p>
<p>The for-profit, small town EMS systems that rely on subscriptions and billing to survive just cannot afford to offer good pay and benefits. They don't have the call volume to generate the billing revenue to bring in a ton of money, and they have to keep costs in line to remain profitable. As a result, they cannot afford to pay their employees a whole lot. That being said, many medics and EMTs will take these jobs because even though the pay isn't great, the workload is typically pretty easy, compared to what the city medics are dealing with day to day. So even if the pay is only $15/hr, a lot of guys won't mind working a slow 24hr shift once a week and then work their other jobs. </p>
<p>Others have touched on the other issues. The relative ease of education I think is a factor, however I don't necessarily think it's as big as some other people believe it is. I don't think the answer to poor pay is requiring a bachelor's degree. The million little EMS services that are barely financially afloat cannot afford to pay much more than they currently do, regardless of if their employees have a degree or not. They simply don't have the financial resources to do so. The flip side to that is that if paramedic became a bachelor's degree, you'd end up with paramedics who would have more student debt with only a marginal increase in pay. The increased student, coupled with the still low pay, would result in even less pay to live off of due to more money being spent on student debt. </p>
<p>TL;DR - There are too many small EMS services with poor revenue coming in that are barely surviving financially. What we need are more large, municipal, unionized, tax-funded services that are operated as public safety bureaus and NOT like for-profit businesses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>former paramedic for 10 years</p>
<p>A. Private ambulance service. Most community ambulances transportation occurs via private ambulance service that is dominated by American Medical Response. Profits drive that company and it's better to have high turnover, less experienced paramedics at lower pay scales over ones with more experience and will demand higher wages. Also the community ambulance 911 systems contract out emergency responses to a single company so that ambulance service is really the only game in town for a paramedic to work for.</p>
<p>B. Lack of a nationwide or state level association/trade union. Firefighters, police and nursing have had strong associations to help protect wages and politically push for more protections. Most paramedics/EMTs don't have a strong association and either get a small local union representation (like SEIU) who are not specifically set up to handle the needs of first responders or none at all. </p>
<p>C. Most people coming out of paramedic schools are young and the wage scale is set accordingly. It's a demanding job. The hours suck, the physical demands are high and the stress is unbelievably high. I was an EMT at 20 and a paramedic at 21. After 10 years I was in the top 20 on the seniority list out of 350 paramedics. The last 5 years I worked was hell I can't imagine working into my late 30s.</p>
<p>D. Most career advancement paths involved moving into the fire service. Moving into a clinical setting is often blocked by a lot of factors including the nurses who don't want to give up duties to yet another healthcare profession. I never wanted to be a firefighter.... I hate heights and the smell of burning buildings. </p>
<p>Most of my colleagues who stayed in the field got jobs with different fire services. I chose to get out of it completely although stayed in healthcare for about 20 years in medical devices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a sports fan here in America. I have conversations like this quite frequently with people who say shit like &quot;it's so unfair that pro football players make more than brain surgeons&quot;.  It's all about supply and demand of the labor force. Somebody like LeBron James has a much more marketable skill than a brain surgeon,  even though it could be argued that the brain surgeon as a more important job. However, the brain surgeon does not have a more <em>valuable</em> job from an economic sense.  A brain surgeon is not going to sell out a stadium multiple times a year with fans willing to watch him  perform surgery. And this is what you understand: the labor force in a capitalist  economy is paid what they're worth economically, not morally. EMT's  are common, low skilled employees that are easily replaceable. Yes, they are important, but they are nothing special.  If you want a good counterexample though, there is a big shortage of nurses here in America, and therefore the salaries of nurses has gone up because hospitals have to compete with each other to attract nurses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're not paid what you're worth. You're paid the minimum necessary to get someone with your qualifications to do the job.</p>
<p>So long as they can get EMT's for the current salaries, the salaries won't go up. Same thing with firemen. If no one was willing to go into a burning building for less than $150,000/year, that's what we'd be paying firemen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
