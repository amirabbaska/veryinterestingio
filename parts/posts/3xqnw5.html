		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see this quite frequently in my line of work. I am a nurse working on a Gero psychiatric unit.</p>
<p>We frequently see people with chronic mental illness eventually develop dementia, usually earlier than the general population. Their mental illness does persist into the dementia process. It is modulated somewhat by the dementia however. People with bipolar disorder still experience manic episodes, however the behavior becomes more disorganized earlier in the manic phase, and seems to have a higher propensity towards developing psychotic features. The schizophrenia is largely the same, with hallucinations being more prevalent with dementia, as well as a bizarre delusions, which aren't unusual with dementia, being more significant and prevalent with a co occurring schizophrenia diagnosis.</p>
<p>Personality disorders tend to persist as well, though as stated above also change someone by the dementia. People with narcissistic traits tend to remain narcissistic and develop somewhat antisocial tendencies in their dementia. Borderline traits tend to remain noticeable in dementia as well. OCD traits tend to persist as well, though as the person's dementia progresses and their cognition declines their ability to maintain routines and rituals also deteriorates. This generally results in increased anxiety and agitation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the dementia process does deteriorate everyone down to a similar presentation. That being non functional and eventually resulting in death. You see a narrowing and blurring of the previously well-defined psychiatric behaviors as the dementia progresses towards end stage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My grandmother was a tried and true alcoholic. Family money and reputation kept her afloat and &quot;functional&quot; but by all accounts it was tragic and violent. My father's earliest memory is shaking her awake at a red light after she passed out behind the wheel driving carpool.</p>
<p>When she first moved to a care facility, it was on the condition she be given a daily ration of vodka. But time went on and her memories were slowly erased in reverse. Grandkids went first. Then her sons. Then her husband, her parents, and her beloved sister. And then one day, whatever memories haunted her went too. In the last two years she neither wanted nor needed a drink, even in her most lucid moments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're going to get a lot of answers to this depending on someone's background. Alzheimer's itself is a complicated disease. There are many causes (which may or may not be independent); protein chunks (amyloid-beta plaques) in the brain, loss of cholinergic and/or dopaminergic neurons, and MANY MORE theorized. While all of these have different microscopic effects on the brain, the macroscopic effect is the same: Alzheimers. </p>
<p>Each microscopic change would affect an already existing mental disorder differently. For example, loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain could cause anxiety. Plaques could cause a loss in neuronal connections, inhibiting serotonin uptake and causing depression (SSRIs are a popular antidepressant and mean selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor).</p>
<p>TLDR; Yes, probably. Alzheimer's would probably exacerbate them or induce them (if there was a predisposition).</p>
<p>Your conscience is a series of chemical reactions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My grandfather passed in July and had Alzheimer's, and now it appears my nan does as well. My grandfather focused on the most negative moments of his life towards the end, including the last discussion he had with his wife before she passed. </p>
<p>My nan who has always been a bit &quot;paranoid&quot; has had those negative aspects of her personality amplified. Most of the memories she seems to cling to are also the negative ones, and she's become very untrusting of people outside her family. </p>
<p>Watching both relatives being repeatedly hurt by a statement someone made to them 40 years earlier on a whim, has definitely made me aware of how I'm treating people. The thought that some comment of mine might be the one memory that someone is left with, haunts me. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After a severe food poisoning experience in hospital in her mid 20's courtesy of some dodgy fish from one of the best restaurants in London, Mum has never been one for fish.  I still don't know how to cook fish.</p>
<p>Fast forward 40 odd years and she's 4.5 years into Alzheimers.  These days she absolutely LOVES fish and will always go for it - regardless of the type of fish - if we take her out for a meal.  She can't remember her name, sometimes can't remember Dad's (they've been married 41 years) but she know has a thing for fish.</p>
<p>She's also gotten over her fear of moths too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
