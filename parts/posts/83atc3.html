		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's built up over hundreds of thousands of years. Because only a few centimeters of snow are deposited each year and become extremely hard during winter we can dig down into the ice with boring machines and extract ice core samples, which you can see physically have different layers in them depending on factors like the climate, atmospheric composition, CO2 levels, etc that were around when the snow was deposited. In fact, the trapped CO2 in the ice cores is one of the ways we study Earth's climate history and they can take us back many thousands of years with a great deal of accuracy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even though it is a desert the precipitation is not 0. At the pole the snowfall on average is between 1-3&quot;. However, at the pole the temperature never gets above freezing. The snow just builds up thousands and thousands of year. Along the cost the weather does pass freezing during the summer (not by that much), but also has more snowfall</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A desert does not mean no precipitation at all. Usually it's defined as  somewhere that gets less than ten inches in a year. Antarctica is cold enough that while  it doesn't get a lot of water, nearly all of what falls, stays and builds up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually saw a thing about this today. The main reason is the temperature, even in the summer the temperature on that continent stays a few degrees below freezing so nothing melts away. Even if it only snows an inch a year or so, that snow stays where it is. If 1 inch a year that's 12 feet every 144 years, which in geology is really short period.</p>
<p>This is also the reason why Antarctica is so good for research, all the layers are still there dating back millions of years, and because the snow falls through the air it captures some of it and the scientists are able to determine the composition of the air in said time period. It also is one of the factors in our climate change research, they can clearly see that carbon monoxide is depositing way faster than it ever was.</p>
