		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>black holes must be significantly heavier than the Planck mass M_P, which is about 22 Î¼g. Anything quite heavier can form a (extremely short-lived unless it is really heavy) black hole, while anything quite lighter cannot. So yes, poppy seed is good, <em>E. coli</em> bacterium doesn't work.</p>
<p>Imagine you have an object lighter than M_P and you're trying to compress it to inside its Schwarzschild radius, which is smaller than the Planck length l_P. In fact, ignoring some pesky numerical factors, you have the formula</p>
<p>M / M_P ~ R / l_P</p>
<p>where R is the Schwarzschild radius of the mass M, the radius in which you'd have to compress M to make it a black hole. Since at the length scale of l_P smooth classical spacetime stops existing to give way to a quantum foam, for R to be smaller than l_P sounds already fishy. </p>
<p>But you try anyway. What you find is that well before your compressing mass even reaches the Planck length, in compressing it you have already given it a lot of energy, which increases its mass (through E = Mc^(2)). In the end, it turns out you have made it into a black hole with M &gt;&gt; M_P and R &gt;&gt; l_P. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but it would blow up immediately.</p>
<p>Black holes emit Hawking radiation. The smaller the hole, the stronger the radiation, which makes the hole even smaller, which makes the radiation even stronger... repeat until KABOOM.</p>
<p>A poppy seed is pretty much at the size (I mean mass) where it goes kaboom in an instant. The energy equivalent of the mass of a poppy seed is a small tactical nuke. Do not try this at home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's worth mentioning that both matter and energy warp spacetime, so enough of either can warp it severely enough for all trajectories to end at the singularity.</p>
<p>If enough photons are gathered together in a small enough volume their combined energy will create a black hole. This is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugelblitz_(astrophysics\)" target="_blank">Kugelblitz</a>.     </p>
<p>Photons (the force carriers for light) do not have mass. So no mass is required for a black hole to exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
