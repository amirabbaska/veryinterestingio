		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two main options, one is much more practical than the other.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use the characteristics of the other planet to define the units of time, just as we do on Earth.  This includes the orbit around its star, any sort of satellite (lunar) orbit, rotation around its axis, etc.  Just like on Earth how there are solar and lunar calendars still in use to this day.</p>
</li>
<li>Normalize everything to Earth days and Earth Years.  This is highly impractical for living on <em>another planet</em> but can be useful during transit in between planets.  Our astronomical values are already highly Earth-centric, such as the distance unit of AU's (avg. distance between Earth and the Sun), Earth days and Earth years.  However, these are intended for easier relative understanding, not so much practical use of potential future space travelers.</li>
</ol>
<p>I would like to point out two additional things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ever notice why there are 12 months, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes and seconds in an hour and minute respectively, 360 degrees total in a circle?  It is because these numbers are <em>anti-primes</em> meaning that they have multiple divisible factors and are <em>versatile</em> for the sake of the ordering and division of units.  It is completely arbitrary how many numbers we assign to these values, as you can divide up a specific amount of time into any units that you want, although it is more intuitive to use ones that have multiple divisors.</p>
</li>
<li>Ever wonder how Earth time zones were first made and why?  Prior to the invention of the locomotive, horse-travel was simply too slow and inconsistent to warrant there being different time zones.  You would base your arrival time as, well, the time it is at your destination.  This was still the case in the early days of locomotive travel (3:10 to Yuma, anyone?!) where the name of the specific train ride had the destination time printed on it as its unique identifier.  It wasn't until a little later when people realized that it was a huge pain in the butt to have to keep two separate times for long-distance travel (both the departure and arrival times *at their specific physical locations) and their actual time of travel.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Setting aside relativistic effects, a second is a defined standard unit. Therefore it is unlikely that seconds, minutes, or hours would change much, or the smaller units (milliseconds, etc.). </p>
<p>Calendar units, however, like days, weeks, and months are going to be highly subject to change based on the characteristics of whichever planet as well as cultural / social / economic needs of whoever is living there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question is kind of unclear, do you mean (1) how would we define past time (i.e. make a geologic time scale for another planet) or (2) how we would count time (i.e. deal with the fact that the length of a year and day may be very different from that of Earth)? For both, we can use Mars as an example. </p>
<p>For the first, establishing geologic time is based on pretty much the same principles on Earth, namely breaking time into chunks based on major changes in some aspect of the planet. <a href="http://palaeos.com/precambrian/martian_timescale.html" target="_blank">This</a> is a nice write up of some of the basic principles of establishing a geologic time scale (in a very simple and general sense) and provides two examples of proposed Martian geologic timescales based on either crater density or chemical weathering.</p>
<p>For the second, various schemes have been suggested for keeping track of the differences between Martian and Earth time (a practical concern especially for dealing with things like rovers on Mars). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> entry for this provides a decent amount of detail. In essence, most of the efforts are to establish something like how we deal with time on Earth, but modified to account for the local changes in length of day etc. For example, for each lander mission, a new 'time zone' has been established basically centered on the area of the lander. I'm not aware of any strict proposal of how to establish date and time systems for any generic planet based on the details of its day and year length, maybe another panelist will chime in on that point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Planets are all very different.</p>
<p>Most planets have more than one moon. Or some not at all.</p>
<p>I mean, some planets have a day that's like, a year long. </p>
<p>Venus turns the wrong way. </p>
<p>A lot of planets don't even have a north or south pole. </p>
<p>There wouldn't be a standard protocol, I guess. I mean... UCT is super chill on Earth. But I guess you'd have to go out into space and find a pulsar, or some other arbitrator in our little solar system that is not connected with us at all - and has its own order. Then you could build a UCT system for a new planet. Pulsars or universal pulses of energy are usually pretty honest in rhythm and cadence. So, idk, I guess we could start from there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
