		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any chance you have untreated ADHD? Many of us experience what's called a &quot;theta wave intrusion&quot; if we get really bored, it's almost like passing out vs sleep. It is annoying honestly. Adderall or mental stimulation prevents it from happening, but without that... If I'm just riding along in a car and not engaged in meaningful conversation or doing something, I will fall asleep in like 5 minutes. </p>
<p>I usually drive and I do not have an issue falling asleep behind the wheel because I can hyperfocus on driving. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two terms I can think of that can relate to driving drowziness. The first term although not directly causing sleep is called <em>Highway Hypnosis</em>. This is where a driver can go for a long period of time driving, not remembering any or all of the trip. Also called sleeping with your eyes opened, has been related to a lot of drivers dosing off to actually falling asleep, or causing accidents, although there has been incidents where drivers have made safe decisions in this state of mind. This phenomenon is most common along highways, the view staying the same, your brain doesn't have to register much information, you stay at a steady cruise, and fail to store the short term memory of driving, although you may be thinking of other things. The second term, <em>Carcolepsy</em>. There's a few factors to sleep, and a large one is comfort. Physically and mentally. If you're a regular driver, and you have the chance to be a passenger you have a sense of relief, a comforting sense, you don't have to worry so you tend to doze off. Although I've only mentioned a few, there are alot more factors that play into this. Mental exhaustion, depression, maybe a certain medicine you use. On a personal note, I can rarely ever doze off in a car due to a bad accident I was in a few years ago, I was awake at the time but no matter who it is I have to be awake and alert, I speak for myself when I say, you can't trust any driver on the road. One blink of an eye and your whole life is gone, so OP you may get a bunch of knowledge from reddit, but I recommend just explaining to a doctor at your next checkup. Better safe then sorry because there may be some other underlying issue. If you have any more questions just ask, I have nothing to do on this long car ride from Florida to Maryland, besides stay awake ;). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People with sleep apnea tend to fall asleep when passive in monotonous environment.
Do you feel tired long after waking up?
Do you have frequent nightly toilet trips?
Do you snore?
Ask your doctor. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have the same problem but more so when I'm the passenger. My fiance makes fun of me for it as does my boss after we had to drive together to go to a training course and I slept most of the way leaving him to talk with our other coworker alone. Up until my boss established a 30 min no talking time with him that is.
If I'm driving longer distances the best way I've found to stay awake is actually to eat sunflower seeds. No other snacks seem to work the same. Books on tape help pass the time though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
