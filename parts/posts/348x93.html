		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is an article that talks about this question.  </p>
<p><a href="http://nautil.us/issue/22/slow/jupiter-is-a-garden-of-storms" target="_blank">http://nautil.us/issue/22/slow/jupiter-is-a-garden-of-storms</a></p>
<p><strong>What has kept it going?</strong></p>
<p>The average velocities going around the spot are about a couple of hundred miles an hour. And the jet streams are also on the order of a couple of hundred miles per hour. But the estimates of the vertical velocities are really, really small. They’re in the order of inches per hour, not hundreds of miles per hour, and because of that, they’ve largely been considered unimportant. But the vertical winds happen over a large area and they happen continually, and therefore we think they can be very important. We think that what’s trying to destroy the Great Red Spot is the heat that is being transferred into the cool top and out of the warm bottom, that is trying to restore radiative equilibrium. But we think what makes the Great Red Spot stay alive despite this radiative heat transfer is this small vertical velocity.</p>
<p>There’s a rule of thumb that as winds descend, they become warm, but as they rise, they become cold. Thermal radiation with photons inside the Great Red Spot tries to equilibrate the temperature of its lid and floor with the surrounding atmosphere. This would tend to make the cold, dense lid hotter and it would eventually disappear, destroying the Great Red Spot.</p>
<p>But as the heavy lid starts to dissipate, pressure balance is lost. The loss of balance then allows the high pressure at the center of the Great Red Spot to push gases vertically outward through the weakened lid. As the wind rises up, it cools off, due to our rule of thumb, and resupplies cold air to the lid, re-establishing it as a cool, heavy lid. A similar process happens to the floor of the Great Red Spot and in turn re-establishes the warm floor at the bottom that thermal radiation is trying to destroy.</p>
<p>Plus, the upward moving gas that passes through the dissipating lid goes outside of the Great Red Spot, eventually stops rising, and is pushed outward horizontally over an area that is very big compared to the area of the Great Red Spot. It then stops moving outward and descends. That descending gas pushes the atoms and molecules of the atmosphere that surrounds the Great Red Spot downward, greatly lowering their potential energy. Finally the gas completes its journey by returning home to the center of the Great Red Spot. On its final return trip home, that gas harvests the potential energy that was liberated from the atmosphere that surrounds the Red Spot.</p>
<p>The harvest of that energy is what balances the loss of the Great Red Spot’s energy from thermal radiation. In a computer simulation, you can actually measure the direction and magnitude of all the energies that go in and out of the Great Red Spot, and the whole energy budget balances very nicely. You’ve got this great drain of potential energy in the atmosphere in the area surrounding the Great Red Spot due to this circulation of gas, but it’s OK because the sun re-establishes radiative equilibrium in that surrounding area and re-supplies its energy. So, ultimately, the source of energy that prevents the Great Red Spot from being destroyed is the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shear stress in the atmosphere from the rapid rotation of the planet.  It's like a giant version of the eddies you see in the water when you are rowing a boat.</p>
<p>Each of the bands on Jupiter is a strip of atmosphere moving really fast, <a href="http://www.psi.edu/epo/visualizations/jupiter.html" target="_blank">about 28,000mph at the cloud tops</a>.  At different latitudes these <a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/jupiter/atmosphere.html" target="_blank">bands of atmosphere move at different speeds in different directions</a> and the shear stresses at the boundaries are enormous.  Most of the time it's (very) roughly laminar flow, but there are enough imperfections (those giant billowing white structures you see in some of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter#Zones.2C_belts_and_jets" target="_blank">zones and bands</a>) in the flow that periodically an eddy forms.  If it gets large enough the moving bands of atmosphere will perpetuate it, keeping it rolling like a marble between your hands.  That's essentially what the Great Red Spot is.</p>
<p>The Earth has similar atmospheric banding called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_cell" target="_blank">Hadley Cells</a> but we have only 3 north and 3 south of the equator with relatively mild winds.  The airflow in the Hadley Cells is, in part, what determines which regions of the earth will be wet or dry.  Venus, by comparison to either Jupiter or the Earth, has only one of these atmospheric bands on either side of the equator as Venus has a low rotation speed, thick atmosphere, and relatively low wind speeds.</p>
<p>On Jupiter, most of the force for the banding and the storms comes of the extremely rapid rotation (9.9 hours for a full rotation compared with 24 hours on the Earth) of the planet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Hubble observations indicate that the GRS is getting smaller by 580 miles per year along its major axis and its shape is changing from an oval to a circle. At the current rate, the storm is expected to become circular in four years. The vortex could completely disappear or grow larger, since the fate of such storms (even storms on Earth) is difficult to model and predict precisely due to their complexity. (Looked that up on Hubble's website) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might be familiar with a certain perpetual whirlpool here on earth in the north pacific. You probably remember it from history where navigators used it to go back and forth to America. It's powered by the sun and will likely continue doing what its doing well after you're gone. I suspect the storm on Jupiter is like that, a solar powered swirl, and works like the one on earth, where one area is heated and expands and another is cooler so you end up with current. As others have said, if Jupiter has a solid surface, its under an ocean of liquids and so a storm can spin unimpeded.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
