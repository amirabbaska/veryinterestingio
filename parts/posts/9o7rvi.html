Is this realistic if there are no humans or other animals going in an out shedding skin cells, etc?<br />
Or when the room is closed up would the dust in the air settle and then no further accumulation occur?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many sources, as /u/matrixkid29 pointed out. The proportion is going to vary a lot according to the environment. Where we live (West Africa), there is a fine dust that hangs in the air much of the year from the sand of the Sahara. We have to sweep our house every day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>- Mold spores</p>
<p>- Insects (dead/decomposing insects, insect feces)</p>
<p>- Skin cell shedding (including hair)</p>
<p>- airborne dust sticking to your clothes and being brought in</p>
<p>- dirt coming in the house from your shoes (this is apparently the biggest one)</p>
<p>- papers (mail, papers you bring into the house) apparently, they leave flecks or something. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Outside, the air keeps being mixed up. Winds blow against and around things, creating turbulence that picks up dust and keeps dust from falling out of the air. Sooner or later, this dust-laden air will get inside the house, through gaps around doors and windows. </p>
<p>Once inside the house, there isn't much wind - gentle drafts, if anything. The air is moving too slowly to create turbulence, and so the dust slowly falls through the air onto surfaces.</p>
<p>In addition, there are sources of dust inside buildings. People are constantly shedding skin and hair, and mold and fungi that grow inside houses grow and release spores that add to the dust. This too settles out onto surfaces relatively quickly in the still air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
