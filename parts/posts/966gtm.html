		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long streams and sheets simply are not stable and would break up into droplets, due to surface tension. Spheres are the least energy form for free floating water and that's what it goes to. </p>
<p>Droplets form in the atmosphere when rising air cools to the dew point and starts forming droplets or ice crystals which start forming clouds. When droplets grow heavy enough, they fall and we get rain.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the tear drop shapes used for taps and weather symbols and stuff is pretty much only seen when a drop hangs off something and drops off. Once falling the drop starts to pull toward spherical again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is surface tension. On earth, a sphere of water will break into pieces after it exceeds the molecular surface tension holding it together.  In space you can make a big fat blob of water stick together. Less gravity up there.  Less forces trying to break surface tension.</p>

<p>Oh, try this.  Soap breaks surface tension.  Water will not bead well with a surfactant (like soap) added.  Fill a cup of water.  Add some pepper.  Yes the spice you cook with. Watch the pepper float all over the surface of the water.  Now coat your finger with a little soap.  Insert your finger into the water and watch how the pepper &quot;runs away from your finger.&quot;  The soap breaks the surface tension.  If you want to know about soap and bubble formation see below.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other said, stability due to surface tension. Spherical shapes are by far more stable and harder to tear apart while falling. Raindrops actually often take on a sort of hamburger bun type shape, with a roundish top and a flatter bottom. This is due to drag. The drag also generates a localized region, albeit very small, of high pressure on the bottom and low pressure at the top of the drop. This acts to &quot;funnel&quot; air around the drop and curl in towards the top, which can act to tear the drop apart into smaller drops. The drops overall become less stable as they become larger and are thus more prone to being broken apart, not to mention altered rates of depositional/coalescent growth, but I digress.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: Stability and surface tension.</p>

<p>Raindrops form around a nucleation point. </p>
<p>Think about a dust particle, or some small particle floating in the atmosphere. When it cools down enough it attaches like dew on a leaf. Once one water droplet (almost microscopic) has grabbed on then more water will accumulate around the initial nucleation point. </p>
<p>Hail is formed in a similar fashion, but gets cycled around in a cumulonimbus cloud (those tall clouds that cause thunderstorms) long enough to gain much more water. </p>
<p>Hopefully this helped

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you would like a mathematically-proven answer:</p>
<p>For a given volume, the smallest surface area is a sphere, so drops are spherical. If you “float” water droplets with acoustic vibrations, you will see this holds true.</p>
<p>Water has a property called surface tension (for ease of my phone’s keyboard, I will abbreviate this as “¥”; usually it is lowercase gamma). Hydrogen bonding between water molecules allows you to overfill a glass with water and observe the small “bubble” of water that sits above the rim of the glass. The pressure exerted by be water molecules equals the pressure of the atmosphere. This breaks after too much water is exposed to the atmosphere and the tension breaks.</p>
<p>When water is in free fall from clouds, it will break into its most stable size, spheres. The famous teardrop shape is observed due to gravitational pull. </p>
<p>Still, this is formed when the force inside the droplet equals the force outside plus the force from surface tension:
Fin= Fout+F¥
<em>We will come back to this equation later</em></p>
<p>The infinitesimal change in surface area (dG) can be determined through the following:
dG= 8<em>pi</em>r*dr
Where r is the radius and dr is the instantaneous change in radius of the sphere.</p>
<p>Helmholtz Free Energy (A) is used to determine the work for the system:
A= U-TS (potential-temperature*entropy)
Taking derivative:
dA=dU-TdS-SdT</p>
<p>It is also known that
dU=dq+¥dG-PdV
Where, dq is the change in heat, ¥ is surface tension, dG is the infinitesimal change in surface area, P is the pressure, and dV is the change in volume.
Substituting this for dU in the equation from the previous paragraph, we get:
dA=TdS+¥dG-PdV-TdS-SdT
Assuming constant volume and temperature of water, the equation can be combine and simplified:
dA=¥dG</p>
<p><em>Going back to the equation marked 3 paragraphs earlier</em> (Fin= Fout+F¥)
Fin= Pin<em>(4</em>pi<em>r^2)
Fout=Pout</em>(4<em>pi</em>r^2)
F¥=¥<em>dG
Where “in” is inside the sphere and “out” is outside. (4</em>pi<em>r^2) is simply the surface area of a sphere.
This could be rewritten together as:
Pin</em>(4<em>pi</em>r^2)= Pout<em>(4</em>pi<em>r^2)+ ¥</em>dG</p>
<p>Simplifying this expression, we get:
Pin-Pout= (2¥)/r</p>
<p>Using this expression, you can determine the size of the most stable sphere size of a water droplet. A study from Earth Science back in 1999 found a raindrop to have a radius of 0.125cm, or 1.25mm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
