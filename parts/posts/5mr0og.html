		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For mental health, yes. The document linked below covers the correlation between mental health and level of education. It seems that more highly educated people have more social support as well. See the &quot;social resources&quot; section, or better yet just Ctrl+F and search for mental health.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a direct answer, but a hypothesis:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/may/08/work-pressure-fuels-academic-mental-illness-guardian-study-health" target="_blank">Overworked and isolated - work pressure fuels mental illness in academia</a> from <em>The Guardian</em>, 2014.</p>
<p>The generalisation would be that education creates opportunities for people to get into stressful job situations, like in the comment from /u/Qui_est-ce_qui about lawyers.  In this case, it's not the education that's the proximate cause, but it's a catalyst and correlate.</p>
<p>Of course, you could also find lots of anxiety and depression and so on among people who aren't well-educated -- in particular they may be prone to another kind of deadly stress if they have trouble finding a job.</p>
<p>An interesting research question would be whether the mental illnesses of the educated and un-educated are different, not just whether they're more prevalent in one group than another.  I don't know the answer to that question off hand.</p>
<p>Another thing that comes to mind is the role of <em>inequality</em> per se in driving mental health problems, along the lines of:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most studies involve the relationship between socioeconomic status and common mental health issues. If you look at the statistics for adults who report poor mental health, it is fairly even across the board. The study below involves race which is almost always how things are broken down. </p>
<p><a href="http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/poor-mental-health-by-re/?currentTimeframe=0" target="_blank">http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/poor-mental-health-by-re/?currentTimeframe=0</a></p>
<p>Whether or not this can be broken down into groups who are more educated or not is debatable as I believe the statistics are not generated with only education in mind. Access to education is almost always linked to income and race. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
