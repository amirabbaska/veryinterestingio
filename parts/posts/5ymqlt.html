		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming that we took careful care to set the rate such that overall government revenues would not change.  In addition we'd have to look at deductions and credits, but let's say we eliminated them as well.  Let's assume that all of those problems are addressed and you find a perfect percentage to charge everyone and keep all government revenues exactly the same. </p>
<p>What you are asking about here is called a &quot;flat tax&quot;.  This is where everyone pays literally the exact same percentage of their income in taxes.  While this seems very fair, once you take a close look it's VERY not fair. </p>
<p>The reason it's considered unfair is because poor people tend to spend much higher percentages of their income on a class of expenses known as necessities of life. We're talking things like food, water, clothing and shelter.  Things that are required to keep you alive. </p>
<p>Let's take a poor (but not too poor) person.  They make $700 per month and pay $500 per month in housing, the rest on food.  The housing that they can get for $500 is the cheapest available in their city. OK, but mostly shit and includes roommates.  They eat very little and fairly badly on $50 per week. </p>
<p>If you charge this person a 10% tax rate, they need to pay $50 per month in taxes.  Thie reduces their food budget by 25%, so now they don't get to eat for the last week of every month. </p>
<p>Now lets look at a rich person.  They earn $10,000 per month and spend $5,000 per month on housing.  They eat well, spending $150 per week and have plenty of money leftover for savings and other luxuries. </p>
<p>A 10% tax on this rich person will not impact their food budget.  It will mean they put less into savings, or spend less on luxury items, perhaps they might select a cheaper home.  But they will not go hungry.</p>
<p>Basically what I'm getting at here is that poor people spend a much higher percentage of their income on the necessities of life than wealthy people do.</p>
<p>Even in cases where a rich and poor person both spend the same percentage of their income on something like housing (a rare case, but one that can exist), it's still unfair because the rich person is able to spend less on a less nice home whereas the poor person is already in the cheapest home available. </p>
<p>This is where the concepts of discretionary spending come into play.   A wealthy person has not only more money to spend but more ability to decide where to spend the money that they have.  Poor people are restricted because they are already scraping the bottom of the barrel to get anything, so there's not really any room to move downwards. </p>
<p>So a flat tax actually is considered regressive (poor people pay more) because we should be looking at discretionary income, not total income.   That's the intent of our tax system, to take into account the fact that poorer people don't have as much room to move and save as richer people do.  </p>
<p>So we say if you make less than X amount you don't need to pay anything as you don't have any discretionary income.  As you move up the income chain, more and more of your income is discretionary.  therefore we charge you a higher and higher percentage of income.</p>
<p>If you make $1,000,000 per month, you likely have a VERY expensive house and some nice cars, but you don't NEED those things to live.  At that level, 99% of your income is discretionary. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>What rate everyone was taxed at</li>
<li>If we mean total taxes or just income taxes</li>
<li>What the money was spent on.</li>
</ul>
<p>For two extreme scenarios, we can imagine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the income tax rate to 15%, and cut social programs to make the budget work. This would essentially be a huge tax break for the rich paid for by taking services away from the poor.</li>
<li>Abolish all taxes except for a 50% tax on income and gains, refund everything not needed equally to everyone. This would essentially be a &quot;universal basic income&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some people who would advocate for one or the other of these, and they would argue that their preferred option would be both an economic stimulus and &quot;the right thing to do&quot;, and they'd say the other one would be a disaster.</p>
<p>It's not so important whether everyone pays the same rate or not, as what we believe the point of taxes are. Some think they should be the bare minimum because they're essentially a necessary evil, others think that they're a small price to pay for what they achieve.</p>
<p>I think the reason there's so little agreement is that people don't agree on the value of government. Some people think that roads and currency and NASA and the army and courts are a great value. Other people think that nearly all government is a waste of money at best and might actually be the biggest problem most people face at worst. If we can't even come close to agreeing on something like that, I don't think we'll be able to agree on what tax rate everyone should pay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, &quot;flat tax&quot; is beneficial to the wealthy, and harmful to the impoverished. </p>
<p>If the rate is on the higher end, towards what high income individuals currently pay, that massively increases the tax burden on low income individuals, reducing even further their ability to afford the basics of life. </p>
<p>If the rate is set on the lower end, towards what low income individuals currently pay, that is a huge tax break for the rich, and massively reduces the income of the government, resulting in cuts to government services, which are more likely to be needed by the less well off. </p>
<p>The specifics of what would happen depend entirely on the tax rate in question, but generally speaking it would devastate the economy, the people, and/or the government one way or another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't really live in America for less than $2,000/mo by the time you cover rent, utilities, medical, food, internet, phone, and transportation.  I'm sure someone will reply with &quot;yes you can&quot; but it's really tough to get much lower than that.  </p>
<p>Therefore, each individual needs to come up with $24,000/year to barely meet costs.  Anything above that allows you to spend a bit more, or simply add to savings.  </p>
<p>Assuming you're working a full time job, a low-end worker will only get about 2000hrs in a year after you account for unpaid vacation and sick time.  That means to just cover costs they need to be making $12/hr after taxes.  </p>
<p>If we tax everyone at the same rate, minimum wage workers are forced to choose between food, rent, and taxes each month just to get by.  Those making more than $24,000/year can cut some of their luxuries to get make ends meet.  </p>
<p>Personally, I'd like to see income tax be X% of all income over Minimum Wage X 2000.  Basically giving everyone a large deduction that scales well to all pay scales.  Nobody should choose between food and Government.  This would also give almost everyone a profit incentive to raise the minimum wage periodically, but also a profit incentive to keep raises reasonable. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
