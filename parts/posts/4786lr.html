		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an old saying that seems to hold true throughout history, and actually has been semi-proven when compared to the economic climate at the time, that shows wealthy families lose their wealth within three generations.  Obviously not ALL of them do, but a very large percentage (around 80%, from what I've seen).  Anyways, it's just curious to me why/how that happens.</p>
