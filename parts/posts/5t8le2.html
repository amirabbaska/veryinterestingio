		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Matter <em>can</em> actually be created spontaneously in our universe, but only if it is immediately destroyed. In all empty space, particle-antiparticle pairs are constantly forming, existing for a fraction of a fraction of a second (ridiculously small time scales), and then annihilating. Normally this is not an issue and doesn't violate conservation laws, as the particle pair is immediately destroyed, before it can interact with anything, and so the total energy of the system is still 0. We call such particles &quot;virtual particles&quot; because they don't (or shouldn't) exist. </p>
<p>Interestingly, these pairs are the reason for Hawking radiation - if a pair is produced on the edge of the event horizon if a black hole, then it is possible for one to fall into the black hole while the other escapes. This causes a problem - energy has been produced from nothing, and that just won't do. To rectify this, the universe determines that if the particle which escaped is made of positive energy, then to keep the energy of the system at 0, the particle which fell into the black hole must have had negative energy. Thus, the black hole loses mass, which escapes in the form of the newly created positive energy particle.</p>
<p>In some ways, it's possible to view the universe in a similar manner. Our universe could be made of <em>loaned energy</em>, which will one day disappear or be destroyed and hence return the overall system to 0 energy. This is a very basic view of some very complex ideas and it's very speculative, but I hope it helped you to understand one of the possibilities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No idea... and it's a big open question. Answers are all some version of kicking the can... </p>
<p>*Cyclic (It's always been!)</p>
<p>*Cyclic Ecpyrotic (It's always been, because of higher dimensions interacting!)</p>
<p>*Eternal inflation (Ceases to be a meaningful question, &quot;it's always been!&quot;)</p>
<p>*The universe is a simulation (God did it!)</p>
<p>The thing is though, conservation of energy isn't a law that applies to whole universes, it's part of a set of constants that is a feature of the universe we live in. Conservation of energy doesn't mean much, if anything, when you're talking about the entire system, from the outside. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Our math can only get us to 1 planck time after the big bang, at which point all mass/energy that would ever exist had already come in to existence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientific laws are observations on how we see the universe work around us, not prohibitions on behavior.</p>
<p>So if we do a lot of tests, and tons of observations, and we never see energy being made or destroyed, we eventually say, &quot;well that's a law.&quot;</p>
<p>The caveat here is, we really don't know what happened to 'start' the universe. It's not something we can test or observe, and it doesn't appear to be a repeatable process still occurring today. So we can't say the same laws applied to that process, nor can we come up with a definitive alternative, nor can we say that there weren't circumstances unique to that event that the law as-it-is-now doesn't take into account.</p>
<p>For instance, the law could be, more accurately, &quot;Energy cannot be created or destroyed except when a universe is jump starting&quot; and we just don't know it. It would still be consistent with our observations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's first of a caveat that energy conservation probably does not apply on a cosmological scale. </p>
<p>But aside from that, there's a simple classical physics notion that might help. That idea is that there is no absolute scale for energy in classical physics. Let's take the example of a roller coaster, where you probably remember that the total energy of the system is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy: E = KE + PE. As the roller coaster descends from the top of the hill, the potential energy PE decreases, and the kinetic energy KE increases, but the total stays the same the whole trip. Customarily, one says the PE is zero at the bottom of the hill and positive at the top of the hill. But the kicker is that you could also say that the PE is zero at the top of the hill and negative at the bottom of the hill, and the physics of the situation is exactly the same. The only difference between these two choices is a shift in the overall value of the total energy E. This tells you that the physics doesn't depend on the total value of E, only the <em>changes</em> in PE and KE that happen while stuff goes on.</p>
<p>In a very rough sense, you could say the same thing about the big bang. You could suppose that prior to expansion there was a state that was all potential energy, and then there was a change in that state that converted it into other forms of available energy, which created the universe. Well, how much was the original PE to begin with? It doesn't <em>matter</em> because the only thing that counts is the exchange of that PE to other forms of energy.</p>
<p>This is so ELI5 that people might complain about its accuracy, but hopefully this gives some idea why it may not matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
