		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Infants don't &quot;know&quot; things in the <em>same</em> sense that adults do, but they certainly are driven to try new age-appropriate things, and are happy when they succeed at them, in each successive stage.</p>
<p>Episodic memory doesn't tend to appear until roughly (and controversially) around age 3, yet it is an important foundation of what we mean when we say adults &quot;know&quot; things as opposed to simply being able to perform skills unconsciously.</p>
<p>At a certain age young children develop a &quot;theory of mind&quot;, where they become able to be self-reflective, and shortly to model the minds of others (like realizing that other people out of sight don't know the same thing that the child just saw).</p>
<p>After that point they are getting closer to what you mean by &quot;know&quot; in the adult sense, but obviously various kinds of development continue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally–Anne_test" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally–Anne_test</a></p>
<p>The Sally-Anne test is designed to see if a child has developed a theory of mind. Theory of mind is the ability to attribute mental states—beliefs, intents, desires, pretending, knowledge, etc.—to oneself, and to others, and to understand that others have beliefs, desires, intentions, and perspectives that are different from one's own. Children ages 4-5 passed the test around 85% of the time. It is around that age that children start to develop this theory of mind and begin to understand knowledge and perspective. So that means that babies do not have this theory of mind and therefore they do not understand knowledge or when and how they are gaining it. </p>
<p>Tldr. No, babies dont have a theory of mind so therefore they don't realize they are developing skills or learning.</p>
