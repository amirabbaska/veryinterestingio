		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's the sodium that is nutritionally more relevant.  Both because people need a certain amount of sodium intake, and because with certain medical conditions too much sodium becomes dangerous.  As far as I know of, it is extremely uncommon to have a diet deficient in chloride (or too much), so there's no reason to list it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the above, for certain foods, such as infant formula we are required to state the chloride content too.</p>
<p>Sodium is calculated from all sources and not just Sodium chloride. We even calculate the sodium content of sodium citrate, sodium ascorbate or even the absolutely miniscule amount of sodium provided from sodium selenite (a selenium source).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is because of two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>That most anions come with cations (in the form of salts) in food (the most common being table salt, or sodium chloride)</p>
<p>and that</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>That generally cations are a more critical  body necessity rather than anions (ex: chlorine is used to activate mucus, but sodium is used to generate artificial electronegativity gradients in nerve cells and is a primary element in regulating blood pressure).</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally a human can live with some anion defficieny for a little while (possible at the very least a few days), but without critical cations such as sodium your nervous system literally shuts down (brain-dead), you have little to no blood pressure (heart failure), and if you somehow survive all of this, then you can't move or think. You'd be declared medically dead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I won't argue the validity of the answers above but as an analytical chemist who performs some of these tests, the reason i would say salt is listed as sodium content is because if you are analyzing food either by atomic absorbance (AA) or inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy  (icp-oes) when you digest a sample you can lose chlorine from heating and also sodium has a much easier to measure emission and absorbance spectra where as chlorine is difficult to measure as it can react with the glass and steel and doesn't have a very pretty spectra</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It also makes it that much more difficult for a consumer to understand how much salt they're eating.
Which, coincidentally works out conveniently for food manufacturers and their lobbyists. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
