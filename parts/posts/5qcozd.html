Theoretically everyone is there to do something impactful to the industry, and the more senior folks have good business sense and can figure out what's most important to work on.

<p>They buy companies with near finished products, and maintain what they have (sort of)...  </p>
<p>My point is that it sounds great on paper but does not seem to be very productive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reality is that their structure is only flat on an org chart. There are 8-10 leaders who basically drive the company in the direction they believe is best, and those people are the leadership (for better and for worse, because it's a <em>very</em> cliquish company).</p>
<p>There is a lot of lip service to the idea that 'anyone can get their idea built' but the reality is that you have to build consensus first and then get resources to get your project done, and that means you're taking resources away from one of the culture captains to do it. This is a big no-no and is why some employees feel marginalized and leave.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I would argue that valve isn't a game company anymore, and hasn't been since ~HL2. They are a platform company, and despite their success (or because of it, when you're swimming in money there isn't a lot of impetus to change) their platform does a TERRIBLE job at developer experience. It's literally 5+ years behind the mobile platforms for usability. </p>
<p>As of today: you can't use digital marketing techniques to grow your game because they provide you no analytics so you don't know what is working, you can't use modern payment flows because steam wallet (which is a fucking shit-show... how many clicks to get to the center of the checkout experience??!?) you can't do paid user acquisition on steam because they want to control who grows and who doesn't. They don't detect fraud well, so when it happens you end up eating the cost because valve processes the transactions, you give the digital goodies away, and then a week later they say 'whoops! we're taking that money back because it was fraud' only you've already given away the stuff. </p>
<p>But you still <em>have</em> to be on steam, because it's where all the eyeballs are.</p>
<p>Source: Done a lot of business with them, have friends who work there, have others who used to work there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a big fan of Valve's structure and there's a few reasons why (I think) they can do what they do. Here's a bunch of factors to think about, in no order in particular: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If they make a bad move the company has a lot of treasure to sustain itself. The huge profit margin coming from Steam that would keep the company afloat for years even if they released nothing at all or a string of failures. That allows them to think (very) long term. In the beggining Gabe Newel's personal fortune filled that role. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Newell's goal was to build a company that constantly delivered innovation. For reasons I have yet to hear explained he ended up figuring out that that a completely flat, bossless structure was the way to do it. Considering they have built a series of acclaimed games, one of the first online marketplaces, and that they are, by most reports, behind most of the tech in the current VR renaissance, I would say he has suceeded.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Valve is also very, very careful about who they hire, and they are very swift in dealing with people who do not deliver value within their corporate structure. You can learn more about this from their corporate handbook. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the corporate handbook: You are supposed to listen carefully to your colleagues and Gabe Newell in particular. So it's boss-less until it's not, really. </p>
</li>
<li>From what I've heard (personal reports and Glassdoor) there's some question about how good of a corporate culture having no bosses actually creates. Some people describe the culture at Valve as close to a high school. Also the Oculus move - there's a comment at hacker news recently (would have to find it) about how the VR team basically moved itself into Oculus with all the tech and they were quickly acquihired by Facebook, turning themselves into millionaires. In a bossless structure, the decision was made, I suppose, by the team itself. A very curious turn of events that many people at Valve are bitter about (again, according to the commenter). </li>
</ol>
<p>Definitly read the handbook and Abrash's blog about Valve if you're interested, The history of how Gabe Newell arrived at that structure is interesting and while I respect his decision I'm not sure if any other company could work the way Valve works. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in such an organization, and I answered a similar question two weeks ago. I'll copy it here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It depends on company policies and the people you're working with. I work in a ~400-employee software development/digital design studio with a Valve-like flat structure, and it works really well. The most important difference between us and Valve is that we primarily do consulting for other companies instead of working on our own projects. You can hop teams, but it happens very rarely, because people don't actually want to move from a project to a project on a weekly basis; most people like stability. When you hop teams, you typically change places with someone else in an another team. We have an internal piece of software for tracking in which project everyone is, and who to contact in matters related to a project.</p>
<p>There aren't that many cases where you need someone to actually &quot;take the lead&quot;. Teams make technical decisions by discussing about them, and the business people handle the business stuff. While the hierarchy is truly flat, some structure will always emerge naturally. You trust and follow an another person because they're more knowledgeable than you in a certain area, not because they can get you fired.</p>
<p>Flat hierarchy is not for everyone, but you can definitely make it work with the right people and the right principles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some additions:</p>
<p>Being flat doesn't mean there's no leadership. Social structures tend to form naturally; the most experienced/knowledgeable developer in the team with the best connections becomes a de facto team leader (without any <em>actual</em> power over others). All important decisions are made by teams, which are not just limited to development/design teams. The business people are their own team; they make decisions about customers, contracts etc. The &quot;leadership&quot; team handles large (= expensive) strategic decisions, like should we open an office in this country or should we acquire this startup. Same applies to marketing, recruiting, HR, internal development and so on.</p>
<p>The decision process varies from team to team, but from my experience it's not anything formal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dev 1: Hey, should we use this technology for this thing?</p>
<p>Dev 2: I used it in a previous project, didn't work at all, crashed all the time and was expensive to maintain.</p>
<p>Dev 1: What did you use instead?</p>
<p>Dev 2: We used this thing.</p>
<p>Dev 1: Ok, I think we should experiment with it.</p>
<p>Dev 3: I can try it out in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Dev 2: I can help you with it if you need anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discussions like this can happen as often as necessary; they're usually just 1-5 minute discussions in the team room or a dozen messages on a Slack channel.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions, I'm happy to answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
