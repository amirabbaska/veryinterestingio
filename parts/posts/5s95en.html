Does this really happen? And what is the effect if we do this to everything in our life since we are born? If everything around us works at double the speed, do our brains eventually work better as well? Do we become smarter?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, your brain works best when it isn't always bombarded with stressors. If you are taking in a lot of constant new information you don't really digest it always, and the very incentive to acquire &quot;new&quot; information and constant stimulation is surrounded by stressors. What is the motivation to live &quot;fast-paced&quot; to begin with?
Which is why there are so many psychological defects in our modern rat-race age... the human brain evolved in an environment where life was very hard but not necessarily &quot;fast-paced&quot;. Many hunter-gatherer tribes don't wake up early and the majority of them take naps throughout the day, now these people may be &quot;pre-logical&quot; but they are walking encyclopedias who know everything there is to know about surviving in their world without reading about it. Furthermore, the human brain has actually shrunk as well. A constant barrage of internal and external stimulation will flood your brain with dopamine and other neurotransmitters but it will also increase your cortisol levels... by racing through life to acquire some invisible goal one realizes that we forget to actually enjoy that life.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope.</p>
<p>What is actually happening there is fundamentally similar to the &quot;after-image&quot; effect.  Your sensory systems are extremely sensitive to <em>change</em>, rather than the actual level of something.  So when you stare fixedly at a blue shape, when you look away, everything will look less blue (and thus more yellow) on that part of your eye for a little while.</p>
<p>There is another illusion in which you stare at a gif in which everything is in constant motion, like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LtUHXpb.gif" target="_blank">this</a>.  (WARNING, probably not something you want to look at it you have photosensitive epilepsy.)</p>
<p>After you stare at the dot in the middle for a while, and then look elsewhere, you will perceive motion where there isn't any, <em>in the opposite direction</em> of the motion you saw in the gif.  </p>
<p>The effect you describe is somewhat similar.  You perceived something moving faster than normal, and afterwards, everything seems slower than normal.  It hasn't actually affected your brain's 'speed of processing', just your brain's <em>perception of how fast things are happening.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain adapts to whatever you do on a normal basis. They have shown extensive dendrite growth in the parts of the brain that coordinate with parts you use the most. For example, if you play piano a lot, you can probably learn to do other fine motor skills with your faster more rapidly. It's just like everything else in your body. You adapt to be better at what you typically do. So, if you life a lot of weights, you get stronger, and you muscles get bigger. If a section of your skin experiences a lot of minor trauma, it'll thicken to protect you. The same goes for your brain. </p>
<p>Just think, if we were to bring someone from the 1800's into modern civilization, the rate that we do everything would blow them away. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I think it's just the contrast of watching something so fast and then going back to normal. Like if you read a book with really big font then look at your phone, the letters on your phone look so small. Really if you get used to anything and then go back to the norm it will just make the norm look different by comparison.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
