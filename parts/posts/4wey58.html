		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am gonna use the movie interstellar to explain my question. Specifically the water planet scene. If you dont know this movie, they want to land on a planet, which orbits around a black hole. Due to the gravity of the black hole, the time on this planet is severly dialated and supposedly every 1 hour on this planet means 7 years &quot;earth time&quot;. So they land on the planet, but leave one crew member behind and when they come back he aged 23 years. So far so good, all this should be theoretically possible to my knowledge (if not correct me).</p>
<p>Now to my question: If they guy left on the spaceship had a telescope or something and then observes the people on the planet, what would he see? Would he see them move in ultra slow motion? If not, he couldnt see them move normally, because he can observe them for 23 years, while they only &quot;do actions&quot; that take 3 hours. But seeing them moving in slow motion would also make no sense to me, because the light he sees would then have to move slower then the speed of light?</p>
<p>Is there any conclusive answer to this?</p></div></div>
