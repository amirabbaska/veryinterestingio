		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to try my best to explain this, but it can get complicated. To understand how this works, you would need to understand how a key cylinder is made and how the key interacts with the cylinder. We'll use a 6-pin cylinder as an example.</p>
<p>Starting with the key, as you know there are several grooves along the side of the key. This designates the keyway. Each keyway is usually specific to a manufacturer like Schlage or BEST. When you look at the cylinder on a lock, where you stick your key in, it isn't a straight line, it's a series of jagged shapes that correspond to a keyway. Typically keyways are designated by a letter, for example &quot;C keyway&quot;. This is done so that a key with the C keyway grooves will not work in a cylinder with an A keyway.</p>
<p>The notches on a key correspond to the pins inside the cylinder. There are 6 pins in their own chambers within the cylinder. In each of these chambers there is also a spring so that when you take the key out of the lock, the pins will return to their original position. When the key is inserted into the lock, the grooves push the pins into alignment allowing you to turn the key and unlock the padlock. </p>
<p>The pins in each chamber vary in size and are placed in a sequence called the bitting format (I'll touch on this later). The various pin sizes are given a number 0-9, zero being no pin and nine being the largest pin. These pins are placed in a sequence to create a combination. Keys are cut to these different combinations so that one key doesn't operate every lock. </p>
<p>Now, remember that bitting format? The bitting format is a sequence that allows us to come up with 4096 possible combinations. How did I come up with that number? Using the 0-9 size pins I mentioned earlier, you would put a different sized pin in each chamber. For Example:</p>
<p>965857
965859
965851
965853</p>
<p>Each of the 4 combinations above have to be operated by a different key (assuming there is no cross keying or master keying, but that's another time). When coming up with these combinations, it's important to note that no 2 numbers in the sequence can be the same when they are next to one another, which is why I left out 965855. Since this is the case, there are only 4 possibilities per sequence group. Since there are 4 possibilities per group and 6 pins, 4^6 is 4096 possible combinations.</p>
<p>Out of those 4096 there also arises the issue of ghost keys, which are keys that are so close to another combination that it's possible for them to accidentally unlock another cylinder. This is why your friend's key will sometimes work in your lock. Typically there is keying software that eliminates these groups before the bitting list is finalized, but when things like padlocks are mass produced, they reuse the same bitting format because of the limited number of combinations. </p>
<p>So to bring this all back around, because of the different pin combinations in a cylinder, there are around 4096 possible combinations (minus ghost keys) that can be used when mass producing padlocks. They are all operated by a different key that is specific to the padlock's keyway. </p>
<p>I realize this is too much information and there were some points I didn't touch on...but it's fun to explain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lock has a set of pins of various sizes that when lined up correctly allow the lock to turn. Depending on the lock, there's usually about 4-6 pins. For a 5 pin lock, let's say there are 15* different pin sizes that can be put in any permutation. The number of permutations P(15,5) gives 360,360 unique locks. </p>
<p>During manufacturing they just rotate through different pin sizes either at random or according to a process which ensures that no two identical locks end up in the same lot.</p>
<p>* 15 comes from looking up the number of sizes in a Schlage pin replacement kit. Some pin replacement kits have up to 28 sizes which would result in 11,793,600 unique pin sets for a 5 pin lock, or 271,252,800 for a 6 pin lock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a limit to the number of possible keys for any given lock series.</p>
<p>Any given lock has a number of spring loaded pins that can have a small number of positions, the cut of the key moves the pins up and down to align break points with the edge of the lock cylinder so that the lock can turn.</p>
<p>A cheap lock might have 4 pins and each pin has 5 possible heights that it can be cut to.  Such a lock would have 5^4 possible combinations, which would be about 500 different keys.</p>
<p>a more well made lock might have six pins capable of 10 positions, and that would give you 10^6 possible combinations, or 1,000,000 different keys (that said, a lot of combinations near all high or all low would tend to be avoided- you wouldn't want to be able to open the lock with what was essentially a key blank)</p>
<p>high security locks may have additional features like angled teeth that rotate the pins to a necessary position, which adds another dimension for potential unique keys, as well as making picking the lock much more difficult.</p>
<p>--edit--</p>
<p>that should be 4^5 on the cheap lock, for 1024 combination, and thanks to the kind soul who pointed out my mistake to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people don't realize that not ALL locks and keys are unique. Even autos have keys which duplicate those of other similar brands. It's just it's so rare that a key to one car will start another, it's not often seen. But it does occur. Same is true for house keys. If people REALLY knew how easy it was to pick a lock, they'd think twice about buying cheap locks....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
