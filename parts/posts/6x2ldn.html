		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As you get more tired you're body tries harder and harder to send you to sleep. You will then reach an 'optimal' state of tiredness where you will probably be able to sleep within 30 mins.
However, if you stay awake past this point your body thinks there is something wrong for you to still be awake, e.g. You're in danger.
As a consequence and survival mechanism it gets rid of the drowsiness by releasing adrenaline to increase alertness as well as other mechanisms to make you alert.
This state of temporary alertness can't be maintained for long and you still need to sleep eventually so you become tired again.
The cycle can repeat but not for too long, maybe around a day or 2 at most.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
