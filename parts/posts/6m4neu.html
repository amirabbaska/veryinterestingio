		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Note: I don't have a Snapchat, So I'll be speaking from a Reddit perspective. Disclaimer: There are so many other niches and elements of the system that I didn't touch on, simply because I didn't know about it, didn't think about it, didn't have time to mention it, or any other number of reasons. This post is just a surface scratch of why the upvote and downvote system works. Human psychology is an incredibly deep and vague subject of which I don't have nearly the credentials to really claim to know what's true and what's not.        </p>
<p>Part of it is purely because it indicates social acceptance. If someone likes your post, they upvote it. And social acceptance, if functioning correctly, should make you subconsciously feel a little good. It's built into human nature, otherwise we wouldn't be social animals. Another part of it is because it makes the system tangible and measurable, which commonly makes things more appealing to humans, as opposed to vague or entirely indeterminate measurement systems. Imagine if you wrote some blog post on some blog site: would you want it to have an indicator that simply says &quot;This post is doing well!&quot; with an image of a small fire next to it (and nothing at all if it does poorly), or a counter of how many views it's had? It's generally more fun to see it go from some number like 1,100 when you go to sleep, and wake up to 2,310. Even better if it suddenly made it big somehow and jumped from 1.5k to 300k overnight. Being quantifiable simply makes things feel more controllable, or at least observable.        </p>
<p>As to motivation to upvote someone else's content: A common reason is to show appreciation because it was better than the average post or comment. Maybe it made you giggle, or they provided some extremely in-depth answer, or they're a novelty account that does its job well. In any case, showing appreciation is like an honest &quot;Thank you&quot;, and makes both parties feel good on the inside. Another common reason is to help sort out what's good and bad content. If it's ad-spam; downvote and report. If it's some fan art of something you like, or a funny post, or an interesting video, you upvote it to help others see it, and also to help a post that you like get the attention that you think it deserves.<br />
As for comments, it's the same way. When sorted by &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;best&quot;, AskReddit threads almost always sort themselves out into really good comments at the top, and mediocre comments at the bottom, save for the exception when an answer is late to the party and ends up sitting at 1 karma. That sense of helping a fellow human out also triggers that feelgood sensation, because again, if being positively social benefits the species, then it's a good system for the brain to reward.           </p>
<p>^^1 I forgot to talk about the case in which downvotes affect the user experience. Basically, it's the &quot;negative feedback&quot; response. So, like it seems, you downvote content that you don't like, be it because it doesn't contribute, because it might be factually wrong, because you don't think someone should see it, or because you disagree with it. In some of these cases--where you downvote because of the appropriate reasons--it ties back around to the feeling of contributing to society, which makes you feel like a necessary cog in the social machine. After all, you did your part in making that out-of-place NSFL shock link or extremely aggressive and rude comment more invisible from the eyes of the rest of the community. You've cleaned out part of the trash.  </p>
<p>In the other cases--in which you downvote because you disagree--it provides a <em>different</em> rewarding feeling, albeit more self-aligned. It might make you feel superior. It might make you feel like you're &quot;more right&quot; for having more karma on your post. In a very heated Reddit debate, there might be one side which is consistently negative in karma, whereas the other side is consistently positive in karma (usually due to the audience which is viewing it). The side which is positive feels like they have a group behind them, whereas the other party is a solo individual who doesn't stand a chance, and might be completely wrong. In turn, you once again feel like you've aligned with society, and get rewarded for it.       </p>
<hr />
<p>TL;DR it feels good to upvote content, and receive upvotes in turn. This TLDR doesn't help much. You should read the full comment.    </p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: two comments have explicitly told me about their upvotes. It feels good. Let me express an honest thank you in return. This makes me even happier. (In case another example is needed, refer to this edit.)          </p>
<p>Edit 2: an insightful comment from /u/MNGrrl has prompted me to add another section to my comment---though not necessarily directly related to their comment, but rather a tangent of it which I failed to mention. It's notated with a ^^1 superscript.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To understand this, we must look no further than the famous psychologists Pavlov and Skinner. The names might ring a bell ^^^^heh for the famous experiments sharing their names, &quot;Pavlov's Dog&quot;, and &quot;Skinner's Box&quot;.</p>
<p>In the experiment of &quot;Pavlov's dog&quot;, Pavlov would ring a bell, feed his dog, and his dog would drool (an instinct associated with eating food). Pavlov kept doing this, until eventually all Pavlov had to do was ring the bell and the dog would start drooling regardless of food.</p>
<p>With this experiment, Pavlov was able to make the dog associate the sound of a bell with his reactions towards food (drooling, for starters); Essentially, Pavlov showed that <em>reactions</em> can be conditioned.</p>
<p>Then came Skinner. In Skinner's box experiment, he put a pigeon in a box, and in the box there was a button. Whenever the button was pressed, food would be dispensed to the pigeon. Eventually, as the pigeon realized this, it would obsessively press the button in an attempt to get more treats. -There was also a second part to Skinner's findings: If food was given <em>every</em> time the button was pressed, eventually the bird would get bored of the button and quit pressing it. But if instead food was given <em>at random</em> for button presses, the bird was drastically more likely to keep pressing the button, even after the bird was full it would still want to press the button.</p>
<p>With this experiment, Skinner was able to make the pigeon associate the press of a button with the experience of receiving food, and by giving food at random Skinner was able to get the pigeon to want to press the button substantially more. Essentially, Skinner showed that <em>actions</em> can be conditioned.</p>
<hr />
<p>Essentially, Reddit is a big skinner box. You have come to associate upvotes, and by proxy the act of giving comments people will like, with the feeling of social acceptance and gratification. Your brain desires this social acceptance and gratification, and believes it can gain that by typing certain words into this box on your screen. Yes, peck at your upvotes, pigeon, peck away.</p>
<hr />
<p>FUN FACT: Professor Skinner actually was commissioned by the US government during WW2 to use the very same Skinner Box concept to create <em>Pigeon Guided Bombs!</em> Pigeons were put inside of a bomb, with a screen inside that displayed what the bomb saw. The pigeons were conditioned to associate Japanese naval ships with food, and would peck the naval ships on the screen to dispense food, and this pecking of the screen actually controlled the steering of the missile. Apparently the tests of Project Orcon proved surprisingly successful, however the pigeon-bombs were never actually used in combat.</p>
<p>(If you haven't noticed, Skinner had a weird obsession with pigeons)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a few mentions of gamification here but I’m going to advocate a different perspective.  Particularly, I think gamification (i.e. the reward) isn’t accurate because people don’t do things for the rewards- they don’t expect to get upvoted.  Well sometimes we do, but we usually don’t and we shouldn’t.  I’ll expand on that point more, below.  The question then becomes why do we keep posting?</p>
<p>The answer is intrinsic motivation which is fostered by three ingredients: autonomy, competence, and relatedness.</p>
<p>Self-determination theory (SDT) is a psychological theory of motivation that explains human behavior in terms of these three ingredients.  In fact, when a lot of people talk about “gamifying” things, we are really referring to ensuring that the user is gaining a sense of autonomy (personal control and freedom), competence (via upvotes: their post is funny, their post is accurate, their post is relevant, etc and this affirms their view of themselves as competent) and it allows them to connect with others (obviously this is social media, after all).<br />
The behaviorist perspective prevailed throughout early psychology, which said that people do things “in order to get a reward” or because they expect a reward.  As I’ve noted, it’s foolish to expect to get upvoted.  Indeed, SDT research shows that when people do things for a separable outcome (e.g. reward, money, upvotes), they lose interest, do not enjoy the task, perform poorly, etcetera.  This is extrinsic motivation. If people do things because they enjoy the task (because it satisfies the 3 basic needs) they continue to do it.  They can even get a reward later, but as long as the reward is not the reason they do it, intrinsic motivation will increase and participation will remain steady.
There's TONS and TONS of research on SDT.  Read it.  It's cool.  It's the closest we get to a real theory in psychology instead of just a pet theory.</p>
<p>TLDR; Thus, we keep posting because we enjoy it, not for the reward of upvotes.  The upvotes foster our sense of competence and relatedness (and probably autonomy), which helps us enjoy it more. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Validation in a community. Here it's Reddit community and larger, since a lot of it leaks out into the world. Look at IAMA's and news articles that have actually quoted Reddit users.</p>
<p>In my opinion everyone cares. Even you, OP, care. If this thread had zero, absolute zero comments, and zero votes. You'd be bum. Heck you created this to validate your answer. I am sure you had some idea of what the answer is already, you just need validation that it's probably right. You might even want to see that the majority agree with your answer.</p>
<p>If this thread received 100,000 up votes, you'd be darn happy. But will it make you richer in real life? Would it make you a better person? Probably not, but a smile because you made a thread that receive so many up votes, right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think there's a difference between Reddit and Snapchat. Reddit awards you for posting good content which motivates people to be creative and post new content while Snapchat just increases your score by one every time you send or receive a snap. High Snap scores are just a result of people who are more social or who use the app for a long time and don't really have any meaning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
