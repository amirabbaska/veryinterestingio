I know that we have an internal clock...but is it synchronized to something external like the sun, or is it something internal like a quartz crystal in a watch?
How will this effect our ageing process in space...especially with the whole idea of traveling at the speed of light and coming back to find that everyone else has aged so much and you haven't. If the clock is internal, how does it matter how fast the body is moving.</p></div></div>
