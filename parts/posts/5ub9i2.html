		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically you assume oxygen has higher solubility in water as temperature increases but, unlike solids like salt or sugar, gases are much less soluble at higher temperatures. De-gassing water to prevent corrosion or make very clear ice is done by repeatedly boiling and cooling water. So yeah : higher temperatures = less oxygen in water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume your question asks about why the oxygen concentration decreases with depth in the ocean.  If not, please clarify.</p>
<p>Atmospheric oxygen equilibrates with the ocean at the seawater/atmosphere interface.  Whatever temperature and pressure are for a given water mass is when it is at the surface defines its starting oxygen concentration.  If the water then cools and becomes more dense it sinks.  It does not increase in oxygen concentration since there is no source of additional oxygen.</p>
<p>Oxygen is consumed by biological processes, i.e respiration.  As organic matter is metabolized it consumes oxygen.  Organic matter falls through the water column and as it is consumed it must use oxygen whether the consumer is a microorganism or other heterotroph.</p>
<p>Therefore, as you get deeper, the &quot;older&quot; water, that is water that has been away from the surface longer, decreases in oxygen concentration.  In fact, when there is abundant surface productivity raining down organic matter it can drive the oxygen concentration all the way to zero, creating so-called &quot;dead zones&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bco-dmo.org/parameter/527499" target="_blank">Apparent Oxygen Utilization</a> is a handy tool to measure productivity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In freshwater or marine systems Apparent Oxygen Utilization (AOU) is the difference between the measured dissolved oxygen concentration and its equilibrium saturation concentration in water with the same physical and chemical properties. Such differences typically occur when biological activity acts to change the ambient concentration of oxygen. For example, primary production liberates oxygen and increases its concentration, while respiration consumes it and decreases its concentration.</p>
<p>Consequently, the AOU of a water sample represents the sum of the biological activity that the sample has experienced since it was last in equilibrium with the atmosphere. In shallow water systems (e.g. lakes), the full water column is generally in close contact with the atmosphere, so oxygen concentrations are typically close to saturation: AOU values are low. In deep water systems (e.g. oceans), water can be out of contact with the atmosphere for extremely long periods of time (years, decades, centuries) and large AOU values are possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>edit: OK!  so, I went to r/science <em>after</em> reading r/askscience questions.  I now assume your question relates to this post: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5u9cr3/new_study_has_detected_a_decline_in_the_amount_of/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5u9cr3/new_study_has_detected_a_decline_in_the_amount_of/</a>  </p>
<p>In any case, the answer is well provided there: as the ocean warms the water can dissolve less oxygen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ocean models predict a decline in the dissolved oxygen inventory of the global ocean of one to seven per cent by the year 2100, caused by a combination of a warming-induced decline in oxygen solubility and reduced ventilation of the deep ocean.</p>
