		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can vouch for the answer described <a href="http://www.sciencefocus.com/qa/are-there-rainbows-other-planets" target="_blank">here</a>. Since I see no reason to reinvent the wheel, allow me to copy that answer here with a couple of annotations and links:</p>
<hr />
<p>The ingredients required to make a rainbow are sunlight and raindrops. Currently, there is no other planet known to have liquid water on its surface or in sufficient quantities in the atmosphere to make rain. However, other liquid droplets could refract sunlight and spread it out into its component colors, just as water droplets do on Earth.</p>
<p>On Saturn’s moon Titan, for example, the atmosphere is rich in liquid methane droplets that almost certainly form rain. Titan’s atmosphere is extremely hazy, meaning that direct sunlight is probably uncommon, but there is still a chance that methane rainbows could form. If they do exist, they would look very similar to terrestrial rainbows, but would be somewhat broader due to the different refractive index of methane compared to water.</p>
<p>Another similar phenomenon, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glory_\(optical_phenomenon\)" target="_blank">called a &quot;glory,&quot;</a>, occurs on Venus (pictured <a href="http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/03/12/venus_glory.jpg.CROP.original-original.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>) and is caused by droplets of sulphuric acid that are present in the planet’s atmosphere.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On another planet it would depend on what the droplets in the air are made of and the type of sun its orbiting. Another liquid would have a different refractive index so the the angle of the rainbow (how big it looks in the sky) would be different. The type of sun would affect the spectra (the band's of colors) in the rainbow. A red sun would make the red part of the rainbow brighter, although all of the spectrum would still probably be there</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The intensity of the colors would not necessarily be the same, if the atmosphere of this planet had a different opacity graph than ours (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg</a>).  The intensity of each color in the rainbow could also change based on the color of the star / sun's light.</p>
<p>You would not observe any new colors that are not present in earth rainbows due to not being able to see outside the visible spectrum, not because those colors would not be present in the new rainbow or would be too faint (though they may indeed be faint).  Infrared and ultraviolet light is present in rainbows on earth, too, you just can't see it.</p>
<p>The order of the colors would not change.  It would not reverse order, outside of a double rainbow.  I think it's possible that the secondary, reversed rainbow could actually be the more prominent one, if the droplets are positioned and shaped correctly, but I'm not really prepared to defend that position.  It would be unlikely to be the common case I think.</p>
<p>The angle and size of the rainbow could be different, as stated in /u/drawliphant's comment.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All rainbows would have the same colours in the same order. It has to do with <a href="http://www.ces.fau.edu/ces/nasa/images/Energy/VisibleLightSpectrum.jpg" target="_blank">frequencies of visible light on the <strong>electromagnetic spectrum</strong></a> which is the same for all light anywhere in the Universe.</p>
<p>A rainbow is caused by liquid droplets (in our case, water) 'refracting' light. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eejRR.gif" target="_blank">A prism</a> acts very similar to a liquid droplet. White light from the Sun hits the droplet and the white light is 'split' into all the different colours that make up white light. </p>
<p>Now, interestingly, white light is just a bit of every colour hitting your eye at the same time. Black is just the opposite - none of each colour is hitting your eye.</p>
<p>But back to the prism - the prism has a certain 'refractive index' which basically determines how drastically this white light will be split up. So, on earth you'd have water droplets with a certain refractive index (about 1.3) which splits it up, but on another theoretical planet with a different kind of rain, such as liquid nitrogen, it would have a different refractive index (about 1.2) which is a bit less than water. A lot more factors come into play here, such as what kind of air the droplets are surrounded by, since the air itself has its own refractive index. </p>
<p>So let's assume we've got both liquid water (1.3) and liquid nitrogen (1.2) falling in a vacuum (1.0). Since liquid nitrogen has a smaller refractive index, we would see the light get split up less drastically than for the water rain. This would actually result in a narrower rainbow, and the ends of the rainbow (the pots of gold!) would be closer together. But the colours would be the same.</p>
<p>I still like the idea of differently coloured rainbows! There's no limits to our imagination.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
