		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have lived here and asked that same question to other scientists and learned more about it myself in my studies.</p>
<p>There are several reefs in the Gulf of Mexico (<a href="http://classroom.sanibelseaschool.org/coral-reefs-in-the-gulf-of-mexico" target="_blank">http://classroom.sanibelseaschool.org/coral-reefs-in-the-gulf-of-mexico</a>).  Just none along the north side and all the way down till you start getting into South east mexico.
The flower gardens are reefs.  They are on top of salt domes that brought the depth to a shallow enough level that coral could thrive while being far enough off the coast that the sediment load has settled and light is able to penetrate well.</p>
<p>MOST Coral is very dependent on light and water quality.  Most near shore waters in the Gulf of Mexico are very murky due to the Mississippi River sediment load.  General water circulation in the gulf is counter clockwise so the sediment load is taken to the west along the shore.  By the time you reach south Padre Island the water starts getting clearer on a more consistent basis.
You can actually find numerous pictures of the boundary of water density because of it.  By the time that happens away from the coastline the water is too deep for coral to form and thrive.  </p>
<p>edit: added a link and some clarity, modified per u/biochemthisd (added most).  also thanks for Gold kind stranger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do grow in the Gulf of Mexico.  They seem to 'not exist' mainly because of the north end of the Gulf.  Coral Reefs need warm water to survive.  The water temp in the keys for example might drop to the very high 60's/low 70's in the middle of winter.  Off Pensacola it will drop to the mid 50's</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a &quot;coral reef&quot; in the middle of the Gulf itâ€™s not a true coral reef but its full of life that feeds off the nutrients from the Mississippi River delta. The Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary is about 100miles south of Galveston Texas an holds many species form the Caribbean Region. <a href="http://flowergarden.noaa.gov/about/naturalsetting.html" target="_blank">http://flowergarden.noaa.gov/about/naturalsetting.html</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most common reason in the region is water depth which controls sunlight penetration and mineral content brought in by ocean currents but also water temperature/pH/salinity, human activity to name a few factors. Coral is extremely sensitive and is only able to thrive in perfectly habitable conditions. </p>
<p>Many causes of coral degradation is attributed to the natural cyclicality of the environment which can increase sediment content, alter salinity, change tide exposure to name a few. </p>
<p>Of course human activity can contribute to its lack of growth or existence/degradation as well. Overfishing, toxins brought in by runoff (both can be attributed to human activity and naturally occurring toxins), human disruption to name a few. One cause of coral bleaching most people are unaware of is caused by sunscreen. When swimming, snorkelling, scuba diving in any ocean or body of water it is best to use biodegradable sunscreen as this does not contain oils that will stick to corals and inhibit growth. Just an easy tip to help do your part. </p>
<p>I also didn't mention climate change (until now) as a human based cause because that can be and has been debated in plenty of other threads. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so, The Florida Keys?
I've lived there for 25 years. One side on the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico on the other with the last key being in the Florida Straits. The Keys themselves are a chain of reef that has built up over millions of years and rising above the water able to sustain life (which is the defining difference between an island and a key). There is coral reef on both sides of the chain.
Are the Keys not considered in the GOM for some reason?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
