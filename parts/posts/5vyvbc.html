<p>To further provide anonymity you promise, verbally or implied by attendance, that nothing said while at a meeting will leave the meeting.  The point of not giving last/family names is that even if someone did want to share, all they have is &quot;Some dude named therap321 said...&quot;</p>
<p>The point of introducing yourself is to make the group feel inclusive.  While you are there &quot;anonymously&quot;, knowing each other's names and situation gives a sense of belonging.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea is that your attendance at the meeting is anonymous, that is, those at the meeting will keep the information of other attendees anonymous. This way, attendees can be free to talk about information without worry that anything they say, including their attendance, will not be known by anyone outside the meeting.</p>
<p>This way, a powerful Senator can feel safe to attend an AA meeting, without his attendance being leaked to the public. If his attendance was known, it would hurt his career and social life, discouraging future attendance and preventing him from effectively treating  his alcoholism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The &quot;Anonymous&quot; part of AA doesn't necessarily refer to being anonymous within the meeting, it's about being anonymous outside.</p>
<p>Out and around you don't acknowledge people you see in meetings, unless you're already friends. In fact, there are code words to scope out if you're talking to someone that's in AA. Do you know Bill?</p>
<p><strong>It's about a secret understanding. For many people, they could lose their jobs, they could lose family, etc if people knew about their alcoholism. AA is about being a safe place that no one <em>else</em> will know about.</strong>      </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the answers below are correct, but I thought I would expand on it. At our meetings, the chair always begins with a few words about anonymity. It's usually the following:
anonymity
serves two different yet equally vital functions:
• At the personal level, anonymity provides protection
for all members from identification as
alcoholics, a safeguard often of special importance
to newcomers.
• At the public level of press, radio, TV, films
and other media technologies such as the
Internet, anonymity stresses the equality in the
Fellowship of all members by putting the brake
on those who might otherwise exploit their A.A.
affiliation to achieve recognition, power, or personal
gain. </p>
<p>It should be clear from all this that my first name is not actually Frank. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The anonymity refers to there being no &quot;face&quot; of AA aside from the founders Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob who are now dead as well as the protection you have from having your attendance at meetings revealed to the outside world. You'll hear people use their first and last names in meetings sometimes to acknowledge that they do not feel the need to hide their identity from their recovering alcoholic peers. The general code of behavior by honor system is that what is said in a meeting stays in that meeting, and AA does not share its members names with any outside organization.  Although these rules are still adhered to, the &quot;anonymous&quot; idea was much more important in the 1930s when alcoholism was heavily stigmatized and considered an issue of poor willpower or bad character. Hope that helps, feel free to ask any questions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
