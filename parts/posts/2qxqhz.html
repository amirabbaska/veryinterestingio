		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, the <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Earth+orbital+period" target="_blank">Earth's year/orbital period</a> is about 365.25 days, and the time between the ball dropping last year and this year was only 365 days. So the Earth will be 0.25 days (~6 hours) behind in its orbit. Or <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%28Earth+orbital+period+-+365+day%29+%2F+Earth+orbital+period%29+*+2+pi+*+Earth+semimajor+axis&amp;a=ListOrTimes_Times&amp;a=*DPClash.AstronomicalP.day-_*SolarDay-" target="_blank">410,000 miles</a> (660,000 km) short of where it was last year.</p>
<p>Hence why every 4 years we have to add an extra day (February 29) to the year to give the Earth time to catch back up.</p>
<p>Edit: This answer assumes you're asking the sensible question about how far the Earth is from its position last year in a frame with the Sun always at the origin. In other frames you have to account for motion around the galaxy, etc, and the answer changes a lot, but isn't particularly insightful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it depends on your frame of reference!</p>
<p>If you are in a heliocentric reference frame, we're about six hours along in our orbit compared to last year.</p>
<p>However I think it's more interesting to consider it from the frame of reference of the universe itself, and there is a good way to visualise it! Hold out your hand and imagine you are holding a golf ball, a golf ball that is visible yet made of neutrinos so it passes through matter unhindered!</p>
<p>Then, click your fingers and imagine that ball then becomes fixed in space and doesn't move at all. You would see that ball travel over 250,000 metres (250km) away from you in one SECOND after clicking your fingers and you will never, ever, <strong>ever</strong> be at that point in space again, not ever.</p>
<p>So, heliocentrically we aren't <em>that</em> far away, but from the reference frame of the galaxy or the universe? We're billions of miles away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What it comes down to is that there is really no such thing as a &quot;true&quot; stationary frame of reference. You could really use anything, the sun, the galactic center, or even some random asteroid or body. In fact, you could even use the Earth. Now, you would have to treat it as an accelerated frame of reference, however this would allow you to say that it's in pretty much the same place. Happy New Year!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
