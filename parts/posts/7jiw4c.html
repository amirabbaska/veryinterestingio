<p>Supernovae can take well over a week to reach maximum luminosity, and they stay rather bright for months after the peak. This just goes to show how much energy is involved in these event.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Assuming IK Pegasi goes supernova, which is the closest to us at 150 light years away (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_supernova_candidates" target="_blank">source</a>), how much of our night sky would be occupied by it?  Slightly bigger than normal?  Size of the moon?  A quarter of the sky?  Curious. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Long story short, it depends. It takes 1 to 3 weeks for the supernova to reach peak brightness and then it will start fading, but the visibility window around peak brightness will depend on how bright it gets. </p>
<p>As for how likely it is for you to see one with your own eyes, well unless you've seen the one in 1987 you might be waiting a while. Statistically we should get about 2 supernovae be century in our milky way, but most won't be visible. If Betelgeuse goes off then we'll be able to see it with our own eyes. It could happen any day between now... And the next 10000 to 1 million years depending on who you talk to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To sort of expand on this, surely supernova remnants such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_Nebula" target="_blank">the Crab Nebula, which is the leftovers of the supernova spotted by Chinese astronomers in the 11th century</a>, last much longer? Theyâ€™re basically a shell of ejected gas from the supernova and could technically be considered part of the supernova? How long do they last for; thousands of years? Millions?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
