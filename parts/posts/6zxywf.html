		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Nothing man made has left our milky way galaxy. Few man made things have left our solar system. We figured out the shape due to a couple of different pieces of evidence. One being that we live in a 3 spacial dimension universe. And so, when gravity sucks in gasses to collect matter, they flatten out and then spiral. Minutephysics has a good video on this. Our solar system is another example of this and is why almost all galaxies and solar systems are so flat. Another piece of more observable proof is statistically it should be. Looking at other galaxies and noticing that a vast majority are spiral makes sense for ours to be as well. And finally, you can see it. With the naked eye. When it's dark enough out, you can look up and see a smooth line of our galaxy with rounded ends (because youre viewing a disk from the side). And additionally with that you can kinda make out the spiral.</p>
<p>I'm a physics student. But because im just a student I don't know every piece of evidence. There is more than likely more that i don't know about, but this is what I know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Radio studies provide perhaps the best evidence that we live in a spiral galaxy.&quot;<br />
The spiral structure &quot;is based on data collected by many teams of astronomers during the past few decades, including radio and infrared maps of stars, gas, and dust.&quot;<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are actually a lot of different shaped galaxies. A large number of which are elliptical galaxies which are hardly flat disks or spirals, but are much more three dimensional. There are disc galaxies that are flat like spirals, but with hardly any star formation. There are also irregular galaxies with hardly any shape at all!</p>
<p>What evidence do we have that we live in a spiral galaxy? That has to do with star age and it's position in our galaxy. Something shared by all spiral galaxies is called the halo. The halo is located around the center of the galaxy and part of the halo consists of a large amount of star clusters (huge number of stars tightly bound together by gravity). These star clusters orbit, not in the plane of the galaxy, rather in a bulge or sphere around the center. What's neat about star clusters is that most of the stars were formed at the same time, and are ancient.  They are some of the first starts to form in a galaxy and are still sticking around for the ride. When astronomers looked into the center of our galaxy(into the brightest part of the Milky Way) they found tons these star clusters, all orbiting the center of the galaxy, some outside of the galactic plane. But when we look the other way we see mostly stars outside of our galaxy or young stars. That is because in spiral galaxies stars are constantly being formed in the spiral arms. </p>
<p>So to recap, we know we are in a spiral galaxy because the observable structures all match with what we know about spiral galaxies from observing other galaxies. Every spiral has a halo with old stars and arms with young stars and that's exactly what we observe in our own galaxy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
