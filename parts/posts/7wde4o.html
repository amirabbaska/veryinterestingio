		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually know quite a bit about this. My best friend writes the code for the optics that go into machines lime this and a
ATM's. </p>
<p>Basically what happens is the US bills have water marks and other identifying features on them for safety. When you use a specific light they light up brightly. A photosensor is able to identify the image and thus the bill it is. A 1 has no mark. A 5 I think has Lincoln on it, a 10 is Hamilton and so on. So the computer matches it up with a portrait like a game of guess who and then identifies the bill that way. </p>
<p>This is only one way. Some higher tech machines have more sophisticated means. Some include identifying the specific ink that's on the bill, identifying micro print and so on.  It'll depend on the level of security required by the customer as to which programs get put where. For instance vending machines the risk of loss is relatively small. So a less advanced identifying algorithm is used. An ATM involves a high level of risk so an advanced algorithm would be used. So on and so forth. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The programming depends on the manufacturer, but most validators use a combination of optical scanning and magnetic signature. An LED shines light on the bill and a light sensor reads the reflection.</p>
<p>Mars VN series validators were the first ones (that I'm aware of) that used a purely optical scan. (And a frequency coupled power supply, which was cool.)</p>
<p>I spent 8 years repairing bill validators and coin changers for a living.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has evolved over time. If anyone remembers the Jolly Roger cookbook from the 80s/90s you used to be able to tear off s little square part of bills on the bottom right (about an inch from the side). This would allow the machine to recognize the bill but kick it back at the last second due to the tear.  You would get the item plus your bill back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
