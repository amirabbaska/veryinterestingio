		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Well for two reasons. First, to keep bugs away. The little hairs annoy the bugs and help to keep the plant bug free. Kind of like those spikes they put on the window air-conditioning units to keep birds from nesting/hanging out there. Nobody wants bird poop in their air conditioner!</p>
<p>Second reason is to help the fruit retain moisture. The hairs do this in two ways. They collect the dew in the morning so that helps keep the fruit moist. And, they act like a barrier, keeping the moist air close to the fruit. Think of the hairs like a little shirt for the kiwi. Your shirt keeps warm air close to your body and the hairs keep the moist air close to the fruit. Cool huh?&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To keep small bugs away -- it's hard for them to walk on the skin and get close to the fruit to bite into it -- and also the hairs add surface area to control moisture in the fruit. <a href="https://anemptyencyclopedia.wordpress.com/2015/09/11/why-so-hairy/" target="_blank">Kiwi-specific info here</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With peaches specifically, they are hairy because their human farmers preferred that.  Peaches have been a domestic fruit for over 6,000 years (per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach#History" target="_blank">Wikipedia's Peach article</a>) and have a recessive gene that causes loss of the hair (sold as nectarines).  </p>
<p>If farmers didn't prefer the hair (it helps protect the fruit from bruising) they would have selected the hairless cultivars a long time ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hair in plants can be used for defense but also to prevent water loss. The hair created a &quot;boundary layer&quot; that keeps the air slightly more stationary so when the water tries to evaporate, the air immediately around the plant is already fairly saturated with water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In humid environments where pests such a bugs can be an issue for fruit, some have developed this &quot;hair&quot; to keep the bodies of insects off the surface of the fruit, as it is irritating to them, and it will also make it difficult to lay eggs, because they cannot penetrate the hair to reach the skin of the fruit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
