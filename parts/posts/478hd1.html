		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I find that I can get two cups of tea out of a tea bag (which I'm sure infuriates tea purists). I like to avoid caffeine near bead time, so I was wondering whether a second steeping of a tea bag would produce a mostly decaffeinated tea. So what do you think? Does most of the caffeine dissolve on the first steep?  </p>
<hr />
<p>What I've learned today:</p>
<ul>
<li>The answer to my question is mostly yes.</li>
<li>That apparently I'm not doing tea wrong after all. </li>
<li>a lot about tea, like A LOT about tea</li>
<li>If you want to get scientists out in force, ask a question regarding their caffeine supply.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks all for the answers!</p></div></div>
