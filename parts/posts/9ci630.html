I'm wondering why this is true, why it's easier to go in the opposite direction of the Sun's gravity?</p>
<p>Obs: that's my first question on this subreddit! Thank you all so much for your time!</p>
<p>Edit: I think I've understood it, and I'm definitely going to finally play Kerbal Space Program. Thank you all!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any spacecraft launched from Earth is moving along with the Earth in it's direction of motion at considerable speed, 67,000 mph (107,000 kph). In order to reach the outer solar system, a spacecraft only needs to add a little bit to this speed, even less if you want to use gravity assists from the outer planets. To get close to the sun however, a spacecraft has to cancel out almost <em>all</em> of the speed it has from moving with the Earth, meaning it has to cancel out almost all of that 67,000mph velocity around the sun so the sun's gravity can pull it in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In space everything comes down to changes in velocity.</p>
<p>On earth we might be making distinctions between speeding up and breaking to slow down, but in space there isn't really an difference between those concepts other than direction.</p>
<p>The second thing is obits.</p>
<p>You can't just point your spaceship in some direction and accelerate in that direction and expect to actually go there. Orbital mechanics are weird that way and usually end up going in a completely different direction that the one you are aiming at.</p>
<p>To simplify it: to get outward you have to speed up  and to get inward you have to slow down.</p>
<p>This is true for spaceships wanting to go from earth to earth orbit and back but also for spaceships wanting to go from earth's position in the solar system either outward or inward.</p>
<p>With earth we have the atmosphere that helps slow things down when coming home (at the cost of heating things up), with the sun we don't have anything like that.</p>
<p>If we want to go to the sun without any tricks we have to get rid of all the velocity we have thanks to the earth orbiting the sun once a year. (it is a lot)</p>
<p>If we want to go to Pluto we have to add speed instead.</p>
<p>Since we aren't stupid we do some tricks that help us such as using the gravity of other planets to help us along (slingshot maneuver).</p>
<p>With the sun we have the problem of lots of velocity to get rid of and not really much to help us a long the way. (The big heavy planets are all out in the other direction).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you were in a moving train and you want to hit somebody with a water balloon. If you throw the water balloon straight at them it will miss because you and the balloon are moving. To fix that, you have to throw the balloon so that the total velocity is directly at your target. This is a simple example that doesn't include acceleration. </p>
<p>Your intuition is correct in some regards, it could easier to go towards the sun, because of the force of gravity. The problem though is actually getting to the sun. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It depends on how far you need to go towards the SUN of course, but lets assume you want to crash into it, then you need to cancel the orbital speed of the earth around the SUN(without any gravity assists), which is avarage 29,78 km/second. </p>
<p>If you want to reach Pluto you need (Again: no gravity assists) to gain velocity first to raise your orbit and then when you are at the orbit of Pluto, you need to add enough speed to circalize your orbit (catch Pluto basically), total speed to be added (Both manouvres)  about 11km/second.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of those funnel things they have you drop a coin in and imagine a little powered coin size-car.  It's going to be easier to move around and can be done more precisely near the top of the funnel.  Near the bottom, it takes a lot of energy to get it back up and a little mistake means it burns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
