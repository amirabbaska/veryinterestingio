		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people seem to be saying &quot;so they can target ads&quot; or &quot;so they get lots of information about you&quot;, but that's not really the case. Let me explain a bit about how this works.</p>
<p>When you click &quot;log in with Facebook&quot;, the website sends you to a website controlled by Facebook (not them) that asks you to log in if you aren't already logged in, and then asks you to authorize their application to access certain information. If you click OK, then it sends a token to that website allowing them to access only the information that they requested access to.</p>
<p>That Facebook page will tell you what they are requesting access to. The list of things they can ask for is on <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions/" target="_blank">this page</a>, but most of these websites just ask for the basics- public_profile and maybe email, so they'll get your name, profile picture, and your email, but they won't have access to your likes or your friends list or anything like that. If they do want access to that other stuff, the page will tell you. You should always read this page to make sure that random websites aren't requesting permission to spam all your friends and like pages on your behalf. </p>
<p>The advantage of this to Facebook is that you have more stuff tied to your Facebook account so you become more tied to the Facebook ecosystem. They also know what app/website you're using, but they don't know enough about what you're using the app for to target any additional ads to you.</p>
<p>For the website, there are two main benefits.</p>
<p>First of all, the sign-up flow is way easier- it's literally just two clicks if you're already signed in to Facebook. If they need a bunch of information from you, they'd otherwise need a much longer sign-up process, and a lot of people tend to give up if the sign-up process is too long. </p>
<p>Second, they get to take advantage of all of Facebook's security. Facebook has something like 17,000 employees. They have whole teams just dedicated to keeping your information safe. Joe's Forum does not have whole teams dedicated to keeping your information safe, so it's much more likely that Joe gets hacked than Facebook. That means Joe doesn't have to worry about stopping hackers from creating tons of fake accounts, and if his website does get hacked, the hackers won't get access to all of his user's personal information (since all of that is stored in Facebook).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The site needs you to make an account.</p>
<p>But it's a hassle to make an account.  If you log in with facebook the site gets an account to refer to you by, and you don't have to put much effort into it.  It also makes it easy for you to tell people about their thing if they can convince you it's good, so you're more likely to do that.</p>
<p>Facebook has also made it really easy to use it as an &quot;everything&quot; login to keep people engaged in facebook.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here is commenting on why <strong>Facebook</strong> wants there to be login buttons without talking much about why <strong>developers</strong> choose to use them. </p>
<p>For us, it's all about simplicity and &quot;friction&quot;. Simplicity means that's it's stupid easy to get an API key from FB then copy and paste some code instead of creating the form, storing the information, and making sure it stays secure. </p>
<p>I mention the concept of &quot;friction&quot; because there are tons of website out there competing for your attention. A user is more likely to try out a service if they can click a single button and go instead of taking the time to fill out a sign-up form.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you click &quot;login to Facebook,&quot; look at the permissions you're granting the app. A lot of them are going to want your friends list and your email address. These are very useful pieces of information when collected on a large scale, and very profitable.</p>
<p>If they get you to create an account without using Facebook, you're still handing them you're email address, which is still useful. </p>
<p>It all boils down to this simple fact: if a service is free, then you are not the customer, you are the product. Any time you use a free product, try to think of what information you're giving them and how you are being marketed as a product. </p>
<p>Edit: Also, there's a difference between something like Spotify allowing you to login through Facebook and that stupid quiz to find out what Disney princess you are that your friend shared asking you to login through Facebook. One of them is a service that you're likely to use a lot, and they are outsourcing the authentication infrastructure to Facebook, the other is just trying to collect information to sell. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
