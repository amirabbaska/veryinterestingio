		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd say that thinking is the process of arranging the information you already know using it in a way that is useful. When you learn data is like you are adding random pieces to a puzzle. When you learn how to think, you spend time looking at those random pieces and connecting them together where they belong. Afterwards, the final image is what you use in your life.</p>
<p>Using the scam example other commenter used: knowing what money, Zimbabwe and scams are are the random pieces. Connecting all the concepts together, and reasoning why it doesn't sound like a good idea is learning the process to think. Using the knowledge that this is a scam to avoid other similar scams is using the revealed &quot;image&quot; for a real life issue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thinking is the way we organise our thoughts. This helps us understand things, or it can also be a distraction when you daydream, worry about something, etc.</p>
<p>We have to learn to think because it is a learned skill. Not knowing how to think is like trying to cut wood with a blunt saw. You'll get something done, but it may not be complete, and you sure as hell are going to spend way more time than is needed. It's going to be faster and more effective if you have the right tools. Thinking is a tool. Learning to think is sharpening that tool. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, what is thinking? It is firstly a way to identify things, including ourselves. It is how we know what <em>we</em> are as selves, and a proof for ourselves that we are distinct from other things. Thinking is an emergence that occurs in intelligent beings (not only humans).</p>
<p>Thinking <em>is</em> consciousness. It is the hallmark of being a person. Without thinking, what is there? Automatic response to a stimulant. Limited learning through cause and effect, or innate behavior. One could argue that our brains are pretty similar, and that thoughts are actually constructed in a predictable manner based on our environment. Noam Chomsky believed this. </p>
<p>But even if that is true, our thoughts are pretty unique. It defines us as unique individuals. Very rarely do two people actually share the <em>exact</em> same experience, and thus share the <em>exact</em> same thought patterns. There will always be some sort of deviance if there is even the smallest difference.</p>
<p>There are also different types of  thinking. We learn to think more <em>critically</em> because it helps us as individuals. It helps us solve problems much faster than we would with trial and error. It helps us avoid the consequences that would force us to learn things the &quot;hard way&quot;. For example, if you know that fire burns wood, it is beneficial to be make a small connection that fire might also burn your skin. Being able to improve our thought process is incredibly beneficial to us.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a difficult to do as an ELI5 because it's not something that can be easily proven. There are a lot of theories from different psychologists and neuroscientists about what thought is. It also depends on how you define the word thought, which people might have different opinions on. So to summarize what &quot;thought&quot; is in a sentence or two makes a lot of assumptions about these things. </p>
<p>So let's just take a look at one theory from Charles Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University who specializes in developmental psychology with a focus on social, emotional and cognitive development. I'm paraphrasing his work extensively, but my understanding leads to this summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thinking is using language to correlate multiple words (or symbols) to create meaning.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, he believes words are <em>necessary</em> for thought. It's more than just a running dialogue in our head; having words is a necessary part of our ability to perceive and understand our world in a complex way. This isn't some crackpot theory. It's been studied with a reasonable amount of scientific rigor. Fernyhough goes over some of that in his books, but for a great summary of some of his ideas and their evidence, there is a great Radiolab episode about <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/91725-words/" target="_blank">Words</a> which goes into it. His segment starts around 10 and a half minutes into the segment. </p>
<p>Let's take a creature like a rat (discussed in the segment). They able to perceive the color blue. They are able to perceive directions, like left and right. But they are incapable of putting these two concepts together. Meaning, they can't understand &quot;left of blue.&quot; The theory is that language is the thing that unlocks the ability to put together these concepts. And the theory is somewhat reinforced by the fact that children before they have language act very much like the rat. They can perceive blue; they can perceive left/right. But they can't understand &quot;left of blue.&quot; But once they start unlocking words, they start being able to connect words together. Eventually, they are able to create more and more complex thoughts. </p>
<p>I could summarize the contents more, but I would just be ripping off their work. So I recommend giving it a listen. I honestly think the segment is well done enough for a 7 year old to understand some of. Radiolab does a great job of taking complex ideas and making them simpler to understand. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
