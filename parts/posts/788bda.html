		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Way back when, television was an analog signal. More accurately, it was a <em>series</em> of analog signals that your 100%-analog color television could use to produce a picture. You have three signals for color (your TV only looked at one if it was black-and-white) and a &quot;timing&quot; signal that indicated when it should start drawing a new line. The &quot;vertical hold&quot; was a sometimes-manual synchronization to that signal.</p>
<p>&quot;Scrambling&quot; was really just that. Some of the signals were inverted, some of them were switched. But, fundamentally, you couldn't <em>add</em> in junk or actually do significant <em>math</em> to obscure the signal, because televisions simply didn't have the ability to un-do that and produce a working picture for your paying consumer. Likewise, before relatively powerful integrated electronics became available, it wasn't economically feasible to give a customer a powerful computerized set-top box just to watch some television.</p>
<p>So your &quot;encryption&quot; was a scheme with only a few variables. Throw off the synchronization here, swap a color field here, and it would make the picture &quot;off&quot; enough to be unwatchable. But, likewise, once someone figured out your mechanism, they just had to create a relatively simply &quot;decoder&quot; to bring that signal back.</p>
<p>TLDR: Analog encryption wasn't terribly complicated, but it was analog, so it required <em>hardware</em> as opposed to something digital, which might be more complex, but also could be done with a wider variety of hardware. Nowadays, everything is digital (because computing power, even for high-definition video, is so cheap) so analog encryption/decryption isn't a thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I built a couple of those for friends and family.  The vertical sync signal was missing, so this box would create its own.  You then had to fine-tune it manually to get a stable picture on your TV.</p>
<p>Later, with the DirecTV systems, people hacked the plug-in cards that came with the box.  The programming hardware was technically illegal in the US, but was about $80USD from a Canadian company.  A friend was part of a &quot;dark web&quot; hacker group, and every time DirecTV changed the codes, they would be hacked within hours.  Reprogram your card and you had everything.  One thing you had to remember was that your box couldn't be connected to the telephone line, else DirecTV could &quot;call&quot; your box to see what it was doing.  That's how they did remote fixes and upgrades back then.  DirecTV finally came out with a new box and card system that couldn't be reprogrammed with the previous gear, so that was the end of that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the digital age, things work somewhat differently. </p>
<p>The encryption itself usually isn't broken but some other part of the hardware might have a flaw that lets you access the key data, be it a season interface, an firmware dump or just insecure key distribution. Once you get ahold of a valid key, you can rather easily emulate most common cryptography systems (in the end it's just some protocol plus AES) either in hardware or nowadays more commonly in software. Nagravision2 had such a major flaw that any key change would lock out pirate decryption for a few hours tops. Most paytv networks will weigh the suspected amount of pirate decryption against the tremendous costs of implementing a newer encryption system (usually that requires at least a smartcard change, tough luck if they went cardless and now have to exchange all the boxes). As long as the illegal decryption process is complex enough to deterr the average teenager, requires expensive hardware or at least some sort of fancy setup, they'll let people get away with it. </p>
<p>More recently, cardsharing has been the typical way to go. Essentially, there's one valid and paid subscription in a cardreader connected to some sort of server (cable boxes, RasPis, full blown x86 servers, even internet routers like ddWRT boxes have been successfully used) and they handle the requests from the clients that connect via internet. Depending on the card in question, a dozen individual viewers is fairly easy to handle, using two or three cards can even result in as many viewers as your internet connection can handle (and that's a lot since only a few kbytes are sent and received every couple seconds). </p>
<p>Recently though, providers have been switching to systems that pair the card with a particular box or have gone cardless alltogether - really annoying for people who simply want to use better hardware than the usually crappy provider boxes and do nothing illegal otherwise. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
