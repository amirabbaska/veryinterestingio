		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They very earliest humans may not have known, but they instinctively wanted to have sex anyway. It would have been pretty easy to figure out after that because only the people having sex had babies. The effects also aren't that delayed. A pregnant woman will miss her period, which would be pretty noticeable, especially after the second month. It's also possible that humans would have figured it out from watching animals for hunting and observing their mating cycles (or from domestication of animals, but that came later).</p>
<p>However, the exact mechanism remained unknown for some time and there were all sorts of misunderstandings about reproduction in the ancient world. For example, the ancient Greeks thought all inherited traits came from the father and a lot of medieval Europeans believed that a woman had to orgasm to get pregnant, etc., but they all knew that sex lead to babies.</p>
<p>Edit: I should say, there is no way to know for certain because we don't have records from that time. We can speculate based on some of the artifacts that exist and what humans would have been able to observe, but will never get beyond that without a time machine. As a result, I don't mean my answer to apply universally to all groups of humans. It's meant to explain how many groups could have figured it out from a number of ways. That's not to say every group did because, once again, we cannot know. It's pretty well accepted that people had made the connection for the most part at least 12,000 years ago, but it could have been far earlier.</p>
<p>Edit 2: One problem with this question is what it means to &quot;know&quot; something. Some people today don't know that sex leads to pregnancy, but I wouldn't say modern people don't know that. It's very likely that there were quite a few people throughout time that thought sex didn't lead to pregnancy. It's also likely that some early humans suspected what was going on, but couldn't confirm it or weren't believed by others. And of course some groups of people figured it out before others. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to provide a counterpoint to a lot of the posts saying &quot;humans would <em>simply</em> observe it&quot; or &quot;women would just remember they had sex three months prior&quot;. The &quot;pattern&quot; for pregnancy is an extremely difficult one to recognize and most humans would not casually observe this and it was most likely one or a few isolated discoveries then spread as knowledge. Most of the posters calling this 'simple observation' are not looking at this objectively due to their current knowledge and overestimating human pattern recognition over extended time. Let's look at what it would actually take to make this connection and why it's so hard:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First of all you have at most n=1 chance every 9 months to recognize let alone confirm this pattern in yourself. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, the cause (sex) happens many times more than the result in a semi-random pattern, so if anything the obvious &quot;pattern&quot; is sex = no result. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, the time gap of a few months makes it incredibly hard to make the connection, even harder if we're talking about pre-calendar civilization. Without looking or thinking of the date do you have any idea what you did 3 months ago? You're overestimating our ability to recognize patterns over time (without deliberate experimentation). For example, until the recent public education about Celiac's disease there have been thousands/millions of <em>modern</em> humans that live for years with this disease, a disease with severe symptoms that appear <em>within a day</em> of eating wheat, and could have been cured merely by recognizing a simple pattern. </p>
</li>
<li>Fourth, we have to acknowledge competing explanations. Supernatural explanations and other theories could further cloud pattern recognition. A simple illustration of this effect is millions believed masturbation caused sterility into the last century despite being easy to recognize this pattern is not true at all. Ubiquity of pregnancy lore in ancient civilizations would likely derail the pattern recognition process before it began for many. </li>
</ul>
<p>A few made this connection but my point is most humans miss obvious patterns with more than a couple hours' delay like this example. And when you multiply the time scale by 90x days <em>plus</em> obfuscate the pattern with a high pregnancy failure rate with sex (lots of sex with zero result) <em>plus</em> make this pattern only testable about once a year you have a near impossible pattern for any human to casually recognize. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many probably didn't. I remember as an undergrad reading about a tribe of people that had an abnormal amount of albinism. It was especially peculiar because the tribe in question regarded albinism very negatively. You were a second-class citizen. So some anthropologists went to figure out how and why they had such a high rate.</p>
<p>Well it turned out that when the men went off hunting, sometimes for days at a time, they left the albino men at home because they weren't really men. You can guess what happened from there. So the anthropologists asked them how babies were made. They were made, according to the tribe, when a woman goes down to the river fetch water. An ancestor spirit inhabits her belly and a child is born. The anthropologists, being bad anthropologists, told them how babies were really made. The tribespeople laughed at them, saying in effect &quot;We have sex all the time! There would be thousands of babies if what you're saying is true! No, it's ancestor ghosts.&quot; </p>
<p>And thus many more albino children were born to that tribe.</p>
<p>Edit: Since this thread is locked I can't respond to people. I honestly don't remember the source except that it was in one of my anthropology classes. This was ~2002. It's just something that stuck with me. People seem to have marshaled evidence that the story is anecdotal (to the field of anthropology) and so I'm inclined to believe them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a decent correlation though (only people and animals that had sex ever got pregnant). </p>
<p>Most did figure it out, but not all. On a few Polynesian islands where some of the staple foods have a very mild contraceptive property, the link was never realized (this led them to be among the most sex-positive societies ever). I think they believed in reincarnation so they thought pregnancy occurred when a spirit of someone crawled into the woman and a body started developing. </p>
<p>On the other hand, there were some cultures that believed that once a woman was pregnant, every man who had sex with her contributed material to the baby and were therefore partially responsible for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
