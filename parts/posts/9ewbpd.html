		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I'm aware, we still don't <em>quite</em> know.</p>
<p>Compared to humans, we've known for some time that insects are generally more resistant to ionizing radiation, and multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain this radioresistance.</p>
<p>For a long time it was thought that because actively dividing cells are those most sensitive to radiation, insects would succumb less as, unlike humans with our leagues of constantly dividing cells, insects undergo discontinuous periods of growth (only with every moult). But this whole organism approach to radioresistance was tricky to interpret, as the physiology between us and, say, invertebrates is very different.</p>
<p>At a cellular level however, experiments on cells controlling for proliferative rate have revealed that insect cells are <em>de facto</em> more radioresistant than human cells, leading us to believe division rate actually might only have a little to do with it. When you blast human and insect cells with ionising radiation, the DNA within the insect cells itself undergoes much less damage, and what damage is present is more effectively repaired. Likewise, those same insect cells experience lower oxidative stress as a consequence of radiation exposure (radiation triggers the production of rather harmful reactive oxygen species that, amongst other things, trigger cells to commit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis" target="_blank">apoptotic</a> suicide). </p>
<p>So yup, it appears the suite of repair enzymes insects utilise are simply better at dealing with DNA damage, explaining why insects have greater radioresistance. As for the evolutionary reason why they're more efficient, we're still not quite sure.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the reason might just be the number of cells. For example, one of the reason why you can freeze sperm cells and not live animals is that if 1% of sperm cells die from cryogenization, you still have 99% live ones ; meanwhile, if 1% of your cells die from it, you are dead.</p>
<p>By the same token, a radiation that would transform ten of your cells into tumors would mutate only 1 cell from an animal with 10 times less cells, and very small animal would most likely not be affected at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing would be to consider where (depth) maximum energy deposition (Dmax) occurs.  The depth of tissue where the Dmax occurs is energy dependent, but starts around 0.5 cm and goes up to about 4 cm.  If you're talking about a mouse and a high energy beam applied tangentially, there isn't enough tissue to absorb most of the energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I think of the amazing differences between large and small animals, one phenomenon keeps coming up: surface area to volume ratio.  For small animals, their volume (and hence weight and mass of cells) is MUCH smaller compared to their surface area.  And not just total surface, but also their frontal area projected onto a two-dimensional plane.</p>
<p>The dose of ionizing radiation is proportional to the flux of radiation through a given frontal area.  Large animals have much, much more mass of flesh behind each square centimeter of frontal area in which the radiation can stop and impart its energy.  Small animals have much LESS mass of flesh behind each unit of frontal area.  Is it possible that ionizing radiation is more likely therefore to pass right through a small animal?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>And here I thought it was because our larger bodies have more surface area than a mere bug for radiation to affect, and it's the total accumulation of radiation in question (not so much intensity or ability to resist.)    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
