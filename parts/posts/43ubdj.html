The BBC (among others), says &quot;The oil giant said its profits had fallen by 51% to $5.9bn (Â£4.1bn)&quot; while CNN Money (among others) says &quot;The company posted an annual loss of $5.2 billion.&quot;</p>
<p>How are they reporting both a profit and a loss? Are these some accounting terms that mean something different than what a normal person would think?</p></div></div>
