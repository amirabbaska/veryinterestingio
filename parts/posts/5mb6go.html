I have found hundreds of meta-analyses on everything depression related, but does anyone have actual studies in which patients are given SSRIs and the improvement is measured? I have only found one of these using fluoxetine, despite scouring many databases and references of so many analyses and articles. Thanks for any help!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are sections in the FDA labels for each one that will describe the results of clinical efficacy studies.  </p>
<p>Here is part of the section from the lexapro FDA label:</p>
<p>&quot;The efficacy of LEXAPRO as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in three, 8-week, placebo controlled studies conducted in outpatients between 18 and 65 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for major
depressive disorder. The primary outcome in all three studies was change from baseline to endpoint in the
Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).
A fixed-dose study compared 10 mg/day LEXAPRO and 20 mg/day LEXAPRO to placebo and 40 mg/day
citalopram. The 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day LEXAPRO treatment groups showed significantly greater mean
improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS. The 10 mg and 20 mg LEXAPRO groups were similar on
this outcome measure.
In a second fixed-dose study of 10 mg/day LEXAPRO and placebo, the 10 mg/day LEXAPRO treatment group
showed significantly greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All antidepressants have to be rigorously studied in double blind trials against both other antidepressants and placebos, before they can be approved for clinical use in most countries.  </p>
<p>However there are a lot of criticisms about those research studies:  sometimes the same drug will do well in one trial and poorly in another, and in the past only the good trials were made public.  When independent researchers demanded the data from the unpublished trials, it showed the effectiveness of the drugs was overstated due to this selective publication.  Now all drug trial data is expected to be made public, even if the drug performs poorly. Also the drugs can have side-effects, and the placebos often don't, so patients can sometimes tell which they are receiving, and just knowing they are not getting a placebo might cause them to feel a little better. That might make the drug seem  more effective than it is. Also the drugs are usually studied in trials of 6 or 8 weeks, and other treatments like cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) might have benefits that are more obvious months later. </p>
<p>To find specific studies, try going to pubmed.com which searches the US National Library of Medicine, and typing in the generic name of an SSRI, eg. paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, etc, and key words or terms like &quot;efficacy&quot;, &quot;clinical trial&quot;, &quot;double blind&quot; and &quot;major depressive disorder&quot;. Putting the terms in quotes helps narrow the search.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A single study doesn't prove anything (ever). A meta analysis is exactly what you want, especially with drugs that show rather small effect compared to placebo like SSRIs (albeit big difference compared to no treatment!). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're looking at meta-analyses of the SSRI data you could just skim through the paper and look up the original research, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>You might find some of Catherine Harmer's work useful, though. A few of her earlier studies look at the effects of SSRIs on cognition in healthy volunteers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What's wrong with the meta-analyses? They should also have all the primary studies in the reference list. Or are the summarized results not helpful?</p>
<p>A systematic review would be better if you want more details (although still summarized). Try Cochrane.org</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
