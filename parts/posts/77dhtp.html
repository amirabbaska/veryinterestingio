		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing to understand is the difference between specular reflection and diffuse reflection.  In perfect specular reflection, all incident light essentially reflects everywhere off the surface such that the angle of reflection is the angle of incidence. Like the left image here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/refln/u13l1d3.gif" target="_blank">http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/refln/u13l1d3.gif</a></p>
<p>This basically means that the surface is &quot;smooth&quot; in terms of reflection.  On the other hand, in diffuse reflection, the surface is rough and thus each incident ray is seeing a slightly different surface and thus reflects off at random angles depending on where it lands on the surface.</p>
<p>Thus, a mirror is an example of mostly specular reflection when illuminated where a white t-shirt is an example of diffuse reflection (due to the cottons strands making for a very uneven surface)</p>
<p>Now, as you've said, an object that is truly black, what is called &quot;a perfect black-body&quot;, should absorb ALL light in the visible spectrum and thus one should receive no light from it and it should have no reflection under illumination.</p>
<p>However, in reality there is no such thing as a perfect black-body and thus all materials will reflect at least SOME light off at least their surface, if not the bulk.   In a similar vein, no material is 100% transparent and it will always reflect and absorb at least some light.</p>
<p>But what is happening with a piano is actually a bit more,  because the look is ENGINEERED by having TWO surfaces,  The first layer is a fairly-but-not-totally transparent top layer that has a flat surface.  That means that most of the light gets through it, but a good chunk doesn't and reflects off the front and because of the smoothness of the surface it reflects specularly.  The light that makes it through the quasi-transparent layer then meets the black paint, and is mostly absorbed (though some reflects here too).  </p>
<p>Thus, in a nutshell (and I'm totally making up these numbers), you've created a case where you start with 100% light, then a top layer reflects 20% of it specularly and transmits 80% and then the black layer underneath eats the 80%.</p>
<p>There's an interesting aside here I'll maybe draw attention to, which is that having multiple layers with different properties is actually the reason for a lot of the &quot;flavour&quot; and variety of sights we see (rather than just having a single layer).  And in general, much of what we see CANNOT be modeled by assigning  reflection/albedo properties to a single layer alone. This compounding effect of multiple layers of different properties actually plays a big role in computer graphics, where it is called &quot;Subsurface scattering&quot;.  I'll drop the wiki to that topic here:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsurface_scattering" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsurface_scattering</a></p>
<p>But it's probably not worth going fully into here, but this is the reason why old CGI moves like Toy Story looked so plasticy (Pixar, of course, brilliantly turned a bug into a feature in that movie).  Because it's not possible to create the kind of visual surfaces we see in real life by treating them as only a single layer with some properties, you have to compound the effect of multiple layers.  </p>
<p>There's a lot of aspects to this in the surface of something like a piano (or marble).  It's a multi-layer effect.  And it's also worth noting that although it's often possible to &quot;cheat&quot; these effects using only one or two layers, this kind of sub-surface complexity can happen within a single material, and it need not be the case that you literally have multiple spatially separated layers, but rather you have reflections from different depths of the surface of just a single material behaving slightly differently.  So even in a single material you may not be able to model its reflection by treating it as a single surface. (the converse is also the case, it may sometimes be possible to take a real life surface appearance that is physically caused by multiple layers and &quot;fake&quot; it with a single layer with specially chosen properties).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When light hits an object, several things may happen.</p>
<p>The light may be absorbed. An object that absorbs all light would be perfectly black.  </p>
<p>The light may be transmitted through the object. An object that transmits all light would be transparent and invisible.</p>
<p>The light may also be reflected. One way of reflection is when the light bounces off the object in the same angle as where it came from. The scientific term for this is specular reflection. An object that reflects all light like this would be a perfect mirror.</p>
<p>Light can also be reflected so that it bounces away in all directions.  The scientific term for this is diffuse reflection. An object that reflects all like this would be perfectly white.</p>
<p>Other effects like refraction can also happen, but these are not relevant to the question.</p>
<p>All objects do a combination of these effects when they are exposed to light. How an object looks like depends on how much it does each.</p>
<p>The wax on top of piano transmits most of the light through, but it also does a notable bit of specular reflection. This means that if there is a bright source of light hitting the piano from the opposite direction, you will see a &quot;mirror image&quot; of that thing on the piano. Lesser sources of light will not be seen, as like said before, most of the light goes transmits through the wax, and hits the actual surface of the piano which is black and absorbs almost all of the light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having refinished a few pianos, I can tell you that they are never totally black. It would be so much simpler if they were. Some brands use a blend that has a slight blue/purple highlight while others have a gray highlight. These finishes may appear similar, but if you do a touch up of one on the other, it stands out like a sore thumb. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not highly reflective and it's not completely black. If it were truly completely black it would not be reflective at all.</p>
<p>The coating on the piano has a thin layer on top that is somewhat reflective, mirror-like, but it only reflects back a small fraction, perhaps a few percent points. That is enough to create the illusion of &quot;high reflectivity&quot;. If it were truly highly reflective it would look like the mirror in your bathroom, which reflects over 50% and sometimes significantly more than that.</p>
<p>Below that thin reflective layer there's a deeply absorbing layer of dark pigment which accounts for the black hue. All light that passes through the top layer hits the bottom layer and gets absorbed. That layer perhaps absorbs 90% of incoming light, or close to it. Some of it gets scattered back. But it's not perfect black; if it were, it would look like a hole in space, featureless.</p>
<p>Source: I make telescope mirrors, which are some of the most highly reflective surfaces made by mankind. I am also an amateur woodworker who has spent some time with furniture coating processes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
