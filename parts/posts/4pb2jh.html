At the start of the tunnel, you're above ground, but by the time you get to the bottom of the tunnel, you're underground and well below the water table.  I don't see where the water can go when it rains to keep it from flooding.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They pump it out. First, the highway is designed to divert rain and runoff as much as it can until it hits the down slope just before the tunnel entrance. Basically the only water that is getting into the tunnel is on that small section of road. </p>
<p>There are grates right at the entrance, seen here in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@30.6887348,-88.0401779,3a,75y,68.21h,70.56t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1suvkPPe5AE_kwTi2Rpk2O1w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656" target="_blank">Street View</a> which lead to pumps which pump the water back up.</p>
<p>Here's another <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@30.6890021,-88.0392217,3a,75y,88.41h,55.26t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s_oX5xlX0sKVPhr9OAfTzmQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656" target="_blank">small grate</a> further down the tunnel on the right side.</p>
<p>Paragraph 9 of this Department of Transportation fact sheet also explains it.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are pumps. I promise you the engineers who designed it included a pump out system to get liquids out of that tunnel. This includes spills from wrecks.</p>
<p>The Boston buried freeway system downtown spends forty million dollars a year pumping water out of it.</p>
<p>I am sure your tunnel has a drainage system and redundant pumps to keep the road dry.</p>
<p>It includes immediate drainage into some kind of sump. The sump pump will start when the liquid level gets high enough. I doubt that any tunnel under a bay will stay dry enough to not require pumping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
