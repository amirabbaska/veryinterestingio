		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spinning at that speed would surely create a large amount of centrifugal force, how much? How much gravity does an average neutron star have? Would the centrifugal force, which would surely be massive, just pale in comparison to the gravity? the scale of these things just boggles my mind</p>
