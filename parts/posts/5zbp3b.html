From 3D-printed organs to organ regeneration - from point of care to &quot;lab on a chip&quot; diagnostics, synthetic biology and new gene-based therapies - our life, and quality of life are being changed by technology. Ask me questions about what new technologies are being employed or on the horizon for prevention and better diagnosis, stem cell research and understanding how new developments in brain monitoring algorithms will allow physicians to make rapid life-saving clinical decisions in the operating room.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Dr. Kraft, </p>
<p>Since we've mapped the genome, there has been discussion for universal mapping and eventually it's implications for health insurance i.e. Patient has P53 mutation and is more prone to a multitude of malignancies and is therefore a more risky subject for insuring. My question is 2 parted. </p>
<p>1) do you feel each person will have their genome mapped as a standard of care soon?
2) do you believe this will have implications for health insurance? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
