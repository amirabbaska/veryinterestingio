		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From <em>Leviathan</em> by Thomas Hobbes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The imaginations of them that sleep are those we call ‘dreams.’ And these also, as also all other imaginations, have been before, either totally or by parcels, in the sense. And, because in sense, the brain and nerves, which are the necessary organs of sense, are so benumbed in sleep as not easily to be moved by the action of external objects, there can happen in sleep no imagination, and therefore no dream, but what proceeds from the agitation of the inward parts of man’s body; which inward parts, for the connection they have with the brain and other organs, when they be distempered, do keep the same in motion; whereby the imaginations there formerly made, appear as if a man were waking; <strong>saving that the organs of sense being now benumbed, so as there is no new object which can master and obscure them with a more vigorous impression, a dream must needs be more clear in this silence of sense than our waking thoughts.</strong> And hence it cometh to pass that it is a hard matter, and by many thought impossible, to distinguish exactly between sense and dreaming. For my part, when I consider that in dreams I do not often nor constantly think of the same persons, places, objects, and actions, that I do waking, nor remember so long a train of coherent thoughts, dreaming, as at other times, and because waking I often observe the absurdity of dreams, but never dream of the absurdities of my waking thoughts, I am well satisfied, that, &gt;being awake, I know I dream not, though when I dream I think myself awake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Real Eli-5</strong>: When there is an overwhelmingly bright light in your field of vision, this makes other lights appear dimmer. E.g. the sun preventing vision of the stars. Likewise, during the day, your sense impressions of the world (vision, hearing, touch etc.) are quite vigorous and incredibly constant, &quot;dimming&quot; the vividness of thought. At night, when the more bodily senses are sleeping, and the only thing you are doing is dreaming, your dreams appear much more vivid, just as the stars appear much brighter.</p>
<p>Another way of pointing this out is that there is an inverse relationship between the vividness of a &quot;day-dream&quot; and how much attention you're currently investing in the environment around you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every comment here should have a &quot;hypothetically&quot; placed in front of it. The reality is that we simply don't know enough about dreams. Why do they exist? What function do they actually serve? What are we remembering when we wake up? What does a dream actually look like? None of this has been scientifically verified because you can't read someone's dreams, and the technology and neuroscience to study this just isn't there yet. Any other answer you've gotten that puts forth their opinion as fact is just being misleading. It's a very interesting question, but unfortunately we don't have an answer yet. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just finished up The User Illusion and while the author didn't talk very much about dreams this was my takeaway from it: </p>
<p>Your consciousness while dreaming is very different than when you are awake. In dreams, you lose any distinction between yourself and your surroundings, whereas when awake, you seperate yourself from the world and act according to how you could be perceived by others. Dreams don't have that limitation and allow you to simply be (as part of and within the world). In dreams, your mind has no veto power over your body (no ego) and your instincts are the only form of free will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gonna drop a dream related question here too if it's ok:  </p>
<p>What would cause someone to never achieve their goal in dreams? Is it normal for everyone?  </p>
<p>As in. If I dream I'm climbing a mountain I never reach the top. If I dream of exploring, I get lost. If I'm close to getting a girl or anything else desirable I never succeed. All my life I've had very vivid dreams and a few occurences of lucid dreaming. I dream a lot and tend to remember many of them. One thing that always struck me as depressing is that in dreams I never make the jump, never reach the goal, in some dreams I die, and in many dreams my teeth get broken. Note that I'm mostly excluding nightmares here. Even in benevolent dreams, I never get what I want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dreaming is characterised by a unique brain activity pattern where dream hallucinations are derived by a diffuse activation in the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>One important note is that some parts of the frontallobe from which our self awereness originates  from is inhibited during sleep which is why dreams can be so bizarre and vivid without us reacting to it before we wake up and become concious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
