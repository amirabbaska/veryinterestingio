		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eye movement is controlled by a couple different mechanisms that are essentially reflex mediated. The first is saccadic movement. This is the fast, voluntary movement you use to 'lock onto' an object. The movement of the eye is so fast that there is a phenomenon called saccadic masking where the brain ignores visual input during the saccade to avoid blurring of the vision during eye movement. Yes, you go temporarily blind when you move your eyes with saccadic motion. Saccades are controlled by the frontal eye fields and the superior colliculus allowing for fixation of the eyes on a point. Saccades can rotate the eye up to 500^o per second. </p>
<p>The next type of reflex/eye movement is called smooth pursuit. The exact neuronal circuitry for this is still up for debate, but we do know that the cerebral cortex, cerebelleum, and superior colliculus are involved. This eye movement allows you to track a moving object without the need for saccades. This reflex also requires input from the pre-frontal cortex, and is often suppressed under the effects of alcohol. This is why a sobriety test involves tracking a finger across the visual field; under the influence of alcohol the brain cannot perform smooth pursuit so the brain resorts to saccades, resulting in what looks like nystagmus. </p>
<p>The next type of eye reflex is the vestibular-occular reflex. This mechanism takes orientation/acceleration input from the inner ear and processes the data so that as your head moves, your eyes move in the opposite direction. This is why your vision doesn't jump around when you walk or move. You can try it by nodding your head up and down: your head moves, but your eyes move opposite, so the resulting visual image appears stationary. It even works with eyes closed.</p>
<p>So in summary, there are three main control mechanisms for eye movement, saccades, smooth pursuit, and the vestibulo-occular reflex. Saccades allow for precise fixation, smooth pursuit allows for tracking a moving object, and the V-O reflex reduces signal noise from head movement. </p>
<p>E: Thanks for the gold, really cool. I just got home and saw this, I'll try answer the unanswered questions.</p>
<p>Just a couple points of clarification: saccadic masking takes the blur out and replaces it with the end image after the saccade. You don't actually go blind, your brain still 'sees something'. This is why if you saccade onto the second hand of a clock it can seem to pause longer than a second. Apologies for the unclear wording above. And to everyone asking about 'why' vs 'how' these reflexes work/exist I'll just leave you with the words of <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=0h0m4s&amp;v=MO0r930Sn_8" target="_blank">Richard Feynman</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two followup questions:</p>
<p>1) How come if I look at an RGB light source (or any other made up of components for that matter) it looks white to me when looking at it, but if I dart my eyes back and forth across it I can temporarily see the individual red green and blue components?</p>
<p>2) I can smoothly move my eyes while keeping my head stationary. I just need to defocus a little. But when I do, I feel a pressure behind my eyes (almost as though its at the back of my head) - what's that?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
