		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add a little to this, you may be conflating mathematics and arithmetic.  Unsolved math problems are not &quot;find the solution to this equation&quot; types of problems.  Here's an example of an unsolved math problem:</p>
<p>Consider a math game where you start with a number.  If it's even, divide it by two.  If it's odd, multiply it by three and add one.  Either way, take the resulting number and apply the same rule to it.  Etc.</p>
<p>So, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1</li>
<li>2 -&gt; 1</li>
<li>3 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1</li>
<li>4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1  </li>
<li>5 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that those examples all eventually reach 1?  Well let me ask you this.  Does <em>every</em> number <em>always</em> end at 1?  Can you prove it?</p>
<p>This is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture" target="_blank">Collatz conjecture</a>, and while many mathematicians suspect that every number ends up at 1 (and every one computed so far has) no one has been able to <strong>prove</strong> that is the case for all possible numbers.  And you can't just try every number, because there are infinite numbers.  So this problem remains unsolved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you're confusing two senses of the phrase &quot;math problem&quot;.</p>
<p>One, like the problems you're used to doing from math class in school, is solving some particular instance of a problem.  If you've got  some equation (eg: 14 = 3x^2 + 2) and then &quot;solve for x&quot;, that's this sort of problem.</p>
<p>The <em>other</em> sort of problem is where you solve more abstract problems (eg - find x for all values of A,B &amp; C when A*x^2 + B*x _ C = 0).  Some of these problems are <em>very</em> difficult to solve, even if the problem <strong>seems</strong> simple.  For example, Fermat's Last Theorem states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>no three positive integers a, b, and c satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any integer value of n greater than two</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...which took over 350 years to find a solution for.  In the end, they had to basically invent a whole new branch of math to do it.  The problem with providing a universal solution is that you can't just show that it works for n=2 through n=1000000, you have to actually prove, logically, that it works for all possible values of n which can be quite tricky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Current top answer describes how Collatz conjecture works. It's an example of an open question in mathematics. You can check thousands of numbers whether they all come back to cycle 4 - 2 - 1 eventually, but just finding that every number we've tested does come back to this cycle, doesn't prove they all will.</p>
<p>Math generally is about ideas. Each theorem is about how different ideas relate to each other. Fields of math are characterized by ideas they describe and utilize. For example, in measure theory you start from the idea of <strong>sets</strong> having something that resembles our idea of length. This &quot;something like length&quot; is then called <strong>measure</strong>. Turns out in a way, area of two-dimensional thing is similar to length of one-dimensional object. Both of these can be thought of this measure. Having this idea of &quot;measure&quot;, after carefully defining it, now has implications. Like, does every set have a measure? We started just by trying to assert some sets have that kind of thing(like, stick having a length), but where does this definition really take us? That's where theorems come in. You can make proofs about which sets have a measure and which don't. But you notice that this is not really much about numbers, but rather about ideas interacting.</p>
<p>So if I ask you, are there infinite amount of twin primes(primes that are 2 apart, like 3 and 5, or 11 and 13), where do you find a fruitful way of thinking about this problem?</p>
<p>And the individual problems themselves may seem artificial. There are no practical applications for Collatz conjecture, for example. But these are more like spring boards that help us view shortcomings in our understanding of ideas themselves. So while solving that problem one way or another may not have impact, what we're really interested in seeing is, what logical tools allowed solving it. How do you go from that problem statement to knowing the solution? Could those tools be used to solve other problems as well, problems that actually are useful?</p>
<p>That's why the problem statements themselves are kinda dry. They're meant to be as helpful for mathematicians trying to tackle them, but their use is not usually found in solving them, but rather in whatever tools that you end up generating in the process of solving them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In 1928, mathematician David Hilbert asked a related question (known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem" target="_blank">Entscheidungsproblem</a>) which asks if there is an algorithm that can determine whether any given mathematical statement is true or not.  With such an algorithm, we could theoretically just ask a computer to resolve unsolved problems like the Collatz conjecture.  However, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing showed that such an algorithm is impossible.  The argument goes something like this:</p>
<p>Suppose that M is an algorithm that tells us whether a mathematical statement is true or not.  Any algorithm can be described mathematically.  This makes it possible to write a mathematical statement that means &quot;algorithm M says that this statement is false&quot;.  Now if we run the algorithm M on that statement, it would be wrong if it says that it is true (since the statement says that M would say it is false) and it would be wrong if it says that it is false (since in that case the statement is true)!  So that means our assumption that such an algorithm exists is wrong.</p>
<p>The upshot of this is that, not only do unsolved problems still exist, but they always will, because we can never have a systematic way (an algorithm) that can solve every problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
