		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I oftentimes find that I can see clusters of stars (sometimes just a couple slightly larger ones) better out of the corner of my eye. But tonight I observed what I’m assuming is part of the Milky Way better when not directly looking at it. In fact, when directly looking at it, I really couldn’t make out many stars.</p>
<p>Why might this be?</p>
<p>Edit: this has been super informative, thanks for all the insightful answers!!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 types of photoreceptor cells in the eye: rods and cones. Rods are more sensitive to light than cones, and they are more concentrated on the edges of the retina. Thus peripheral vision is more sensitive to faint lights. When you look straight at the stars the light falls on centrally located cones which are less sensitive to light, and you can't make out the stars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the peripheral part of your retina has more rods, which are a lot better at detecting light. The central part of your retina has mostly cones, which are good at seeing color (but aren't very good at detecting weak light). If you want to see something at night, circle your eyes around it, don't look directly at it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you’re describing is what people in the observing hobby refer to as “averted vision”. You’ll find if you look 8 to 16 degrees to the side of an object that is very feint you’ll be able to see more detail. With practice you’ll get better and better at it, too, as you get used to viewing things slightly out of the side of your eye.</p>
<p>Here’s an article that describes the practice of using averted vision: <a href="http://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/feature/how-guide/how-master-art-averted-vision" target="_blank">http://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/feature/how-guide/how-master-art-averted-vision</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is definitely something astronomers take in to consideration when looking through a telescope. When youre looking at extremely dim stars or other deep sky objects, you get a better view using &quot;averted vision&quot;, which is looking not directly at the object, but just to the side to get a cleaner, crisper view. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Averted vision is a common technique used in amateur astronomy, through the telescope or naked eye.  If you look directly at the Pleiades naked eye from a dark sky location, most people will see six or seven stars in a small dipper shaped figure.  If you look at it with averted vision, you'll see a fuzzy patch about the size of a postage stamp at arms length, which is the combined light of the hundreds of stars in the cluster.  It will really pop out at you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
