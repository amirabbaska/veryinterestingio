		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The graph doesn't really show a reduction, rather a 'boom and bust' cycle with a reduction in amplitude in the last couple of phases.</p>
<p>This is neatly explained by the other comments to a greater or lesser degree.</p>
<p>But when reading graphs of this sort you must read all that is shown and understand the limitations (what is not shown)</p>
<p>To get you started, first notice that the measure is number of cases Reported, not the true number. There are clues there to possible distortion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not clear there's enough information in the graph to make any conclusion.  The CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00053391.htm" target="_blank">points out</a> that measles was drastically underreported before 1963:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before measles vaccine was licensed in 1963, an average of 400,000 measles cases were reported each year in the United States (8). However, because virtually all children acquired measles, the number of cases probably approached 3.5 million per year (i.e., an entire birth cohort).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We might speculate that perhaps only the most serious cases were reported, and with steady improvement in home medical practices, less serious cases of measles occurred leading up to the vaccine date.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the deadly childhood diseases were in decline before the introduction of vaccines or antibiotics. This is because public health efforts and clean environments (clean running water, hand washing campaigns, etc) improved. Vaccination and antibiotics are still hella important and save lives, so don't feel like you don't need them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The graph falls when the &quot;baby boom&quot; falls. It needs census data added - there are less cases of measles when there are less new children who haven't had measles.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postâ€“World_War_II_baby_boom#/media/File%3AUS_Birth_Rates.svg" target="_blank">Here is the baby boom graph from Wikipedia.</a></p>
<p>Edit: /u/brain dead zombie pointed out that is birth <em>rate</em> vs <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/702zyo/this_graph_appears_to_show_a_decline_in_measles/dn0y2hq" target="_blank"><em>number of births</em></a>. <a href="https://m.imgur.com/sXPEC4E?r" target="_blank">So here is a baby boom graph on <em>number of births</em> from that data.</a> There is still a birth decline at the point that the number of measles cases on OP's chart declines. Less new babies, less new cases of measles.</p>
<p>Sorry for the crummy chart labels, best my tablet will do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real issue is simply with your interpretation of the data. The lines don't represent the data points, only the squares do. What the graph shows is that at the sample prior to vaccine introduction there were ~470k cases, and in the following sample (which is after vaccines) the number of cases was ~270k. The line between the samples represents the linear interpolation between those two values, but it is not an actual sample and cannot represent the higher frequency changes in the data. To see the exact trend you're expecting you need a higher sampling rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
