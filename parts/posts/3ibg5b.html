		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neuroscientist here. On mobile so have to keep it brief, but the short version is that it's hard to give a straight (no pun intended) answer.</p>
<p>Is it common? No. I did a quick lit search and only found one published paper of case studies that included a sexual orientation change with brain injury... and in that paper, there was only a single case (alongside cases of other sexual behavior changes, such as hypersexuality, that are more common). And the one patient they described had a lot of other issues (e.g. eating feces), so it's a pretty messy example.</p>
<p>Now, is it possible? Probably. The neuropsych literature is FULL of crazy-sounding syndromes. Foreign accent syndrome. Believing your friends and loved ones have been replaced by zombie/robot clones (Capgras syndrome). Believing you're dead, or that paralyzed body parts belong to someone else. And one of my favorites (if you can call it that), Anton-Babinski syndrome, where people who are blind report being able to see perfectly well (if not looked after, they walk into things a lot... no joke). And there are many different flavors of memory loss.</p>
<p>In short: There are, in scientific terms, a flobbity jillion different ways the brain can be injured, and a lot of different consequences you can observe from that, both in the initial loss of function, and then in the weird ways the person's brain tries to compensate for that loss in order to make some sense of the world. Injuries are rarely clean, i.e., they rarely affect just one functional brain region or type of behavior.</p>
<p>So, I would not rule out the possibility that someone could have brain damage with exactly two consequences, memory loss and sexual orientation change... but it does not appear to be common, nor, according to my understanding of functional neuroanatomy, particularly likely.</p>
<p>Also, a caution to OP: It appears from other comments that you're referencing a specific occurrence. Be wary of violating the site's policy on asking for medical advice.</p>
<p>Edit: I see /u/cjbest just linked the same article I referred to in my second paragraph and also gives a solid answer.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Wow, I see this post/comment blew up a bit while I was at work. Thanks to all for the upvotes and replies. I'll try to answer a few. Also, I know I'm a mod here and we are supposed to stay on topic, but since there was much discussion of the phrase &quot;flobbity jillion,&quot; I feel compelled to explain that it's a reference to How I Met Your Mother. Most of the Internet seems to spell it &quot;floppity jillion,&quot; but I just re-listened to confirm, and Robin distinctly says &quot;flobbity.&quot; Season 1, Episode 17, &quot;Life Among the Gorillas,&quot; around the 14:30 mark -- available on Netflix in the USA if you want to verify.</p>
<p>Edit 3: I suppose I should have mentioned this earlier. It sounds like a lot of the folks wondering about this have a very &quot;movie&quot; conception of what amnesia is. In the movies, people get hit on the head and forget who they are and all of their life experiences. Although there are many different types of amnesia, the movie kind is not typically one of them (in fact, I'm not sure if such a case like that has EVER happened). There are many variations, but patients with different types of brain injuries may experience some anterograde amnesia (inability to form new memories) or some retrograde amnesia (loss of earlier memories, most typically from the last 2-3 years before the injury) or both, but complete episodic amnesia is not really a thing in real life like it is in Hollywood. So even if you are working under the supposition that maybe if you lost all of your memories, you'd forget your original sexual orientation -- the &quot;lost all your memories&quot; thing is not really a realistic starting point. Thanks again for reading!</p>
<p>Edit 4: Just saw the gold... thanks, anonymous Redditor! Now I really have to go. If anyone responded to me and I didn't reply and you really want to know something, PM me and I'll try to answer when I can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you include traumatic brain injury and the attendant memory disruptions that are apparent in some cases, I think there is an article here that will interest you. (Pdf warning.)</p>
<p>The article discusses sexual preferences changes in four of eight TBI patients. </p>
<p>www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1028946/pdf/jnnpsyc00100-0015.pdf</p>
<p>Sexual disinhibition is a symptom for some TBI patients. The second article below states that changes in sexual expression may occur after a traumatic brain injury, including memory loss being a factor affecting those changes. </p>
<p>Basically, TBI can cause an increase in sexual desire and patients may even act out 'inappropriately' but they don't go into specific detail about sexual preference changes. I suspect that those who were too inhibited to act on pre-existing same sex desires may, for instance, find that inhibition to be less of a factor after their TBI. </p>
