		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you had some it would be exactly like regular helium except 3/4ths the weight because it has one neutron and two protons while helium-4 (regular helium) has two neutrons and two protons. You could fill expensive party balloons with it.</p>
<p>He3-D fusion also produces no stray neutron radiation and quite a lot of energy. Neutrons are generally bad. They make nearby materials weaker by carving out microscopic defects and they transmute atoms into other potentially less stable isotopes (they make things radioactive). A helium-3 fusion reactor would be even cleaner than other forms of fusion and potentially easier to maintain.</p>
<p>Mining the moon for it is currently pretty much insane because no fusion reactor can profitably burn anything. However, if you needed starship fuel this would do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, that was fake news. Also taken out of context.
India does not plan to, nor does the entire world have the technology to [feasibly] mine helium 3 from the moon.
<a href="https://thewire.in/126926/isro-helium3-fake-news/" target="_blank">https://thewire.in/126926/isro-helium3-fake-news/</a></p>
<p>On on to helium3 </p>
<p>Helium3 is an isotope of Helium. And its proposed use in theory is to use it as an alternative to Hydrogen in fusion reactors to produce neuclear energy. Moon has an abundance of helium 3.</p>
<p>However, even Hydrogen fusion reactors are still a matter of the future as the longest sustained experiment was only 102 seconds. ( <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/china-s-nuclear-fusion-machine-just-smashed-germany-s-hydrogen-plasma-record" target="_blank">https://www.sciencealert.com/china-s-nuclear-fusion-machine-just-smashed-germany-s-hydrogen-plasma-record</a> ) </p>
<p>As far as Helium 3 is concerned, it's going to be a long time until its used [commercially] anywhere except experimental physics. </p>

India doesn't plan on mining the moon for helium-3, it was something taken out of context for a good headline. It was from a talk about future and past energy sources but they never mentioned actually planning on doing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do to solar radiation and a lack of magnetic fields on the moon, the helium 4 present there can be converted into helium 3.
In fusion reactors deuterium and tritium are traditionally used as they are abundant in water so are easily harvested. However the problem is the products are helium and a neutron whereas if deuterium and helium three are used the product would be helium and a proton.
Fusion reactors get so hot that normal walls could not hold them as they would melt this is why we use magnetic fields to contain them. As neutrons have no charge they cannot be contained by a magnetic field and so they fly off into the walls of the reactor.
This may not seem like a problem but the helium only contains about 20% of all the energy in the products. This means if we use helium three instead of tritium we will have five times as much energy from the reactor and no neutrons heating the shielding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different atoms of a given element can have different numbers of neutrons. These are called <em>isotopes</em>. Helium-3 is an isotope of helium with one neutron.</p>
<p>The stable helium isotopes are helium-3 and helium-4. Almost all of natural helium is helium-4, but about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_helium" target="_blank">0.0002% is helium-3</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the specific uses of helium-3 are listed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-3" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
