		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Migraines are actually caused by a few physiological reasons, but mainly it's inflammation of blood vessels in the head that put pressure on other parts of the head and skull.</p>
<p>Migraine medications, for example, do not actually take migraines away but prevent them from starting. Imitrex is a popular one. It works by being taken when &quot;warning signs&quot; start for migraines, mainly called auras - as a sufferer, you usually see rings or glowing outlines to dark objects in bright light. Once you notice these symtpoms, you have to take the Imitrex to prevent the blood vessels in your skull from dilating and opening up. If you're too late, then the blood vessels will expand and the medication specifically PREVENTS them from expanding - they won't constrict the vessels back down if they already inflated.</p>
<p>Other headaches are variations of this, and for most people, avoiding foods that cause blood vessel dilation throughout the body (nitrates and nitrites) and staying thoroughly hydrated can keep headaches as rare as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although it may feel like it, a headache is not actually a pain in your brain. The brain tells you when other parts of your body hurt, but it can't feel pain itself.
Most headaches happen in the nerves, blood vessels, and muscles that cover a person's head and neck. Sometimes the muscles or blood vessels swell, tighten, or go through other changes that stimulate the surrounding nerves or put pressure on them. These nerves send a rush of pain messages to the brain, and this brings on a headache.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Headaches don't come from the brain. They come from everything <em>around</em> the brain. Most headaches are caused by congestion of one fluid or another in the skull, whether it's blood in vessels or mucus in the sinuses, or intraocular fluid in the eyes. Migraine headaches are caused by overstimulation of neurons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
