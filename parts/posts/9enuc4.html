		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogen is just very inert, it's not reactive and is not easy to take out of the air for use in reactions.</p>
<p>But there is a cycle, naturally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation#Biological_nitrogen_fixation" target="_blank">nitrogen fixing bacteria</a> take nitrogen from the air and turn it into nitrogen compounds like ammonia, this is what plants and other organisms use to incorporate nitrogen into other compounds (it's required for many amino acids). These bacteria typically live in the roots of Legume (plants like soybeans and peas). Thus nitrogen is a critical fertilizer for plants and it's required for all plants but not &quot;fixed&quot; many places.</p>
<p>We use a synthetic process to make ammonia, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process" target="_blank">haber process</a> because we needs LOTs of ammonia to grow crops on a huge industrial scale the way we do. We spend over 1% of all the worlds energy doing this, essentially to accelerate the nitrogen cycle.</p>
<p>All that nitrogen eventually goes into living things to make their proteins. Some things will eventually release the nitrogen back as a gas (some bacteria will do it, as will just burning plant/animal matter). In general, there isn't much movement outside of this bacteria and human pathway to take nitrogen out of the air, and it's very stable in the air, so things tend to just turn to N2 and stay that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nitrogen molecules that make up 80% of the atmosphere are very stable and it's therefore hard to do anything with (or to) them.</p>
<p>In nature, some amount of nitrogen is essential for plants and animals to create proteins. But they cannot use atmospheric nitrogen for that, only some bacteria are able to turn atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogen compounds that are useable - these are then used by plants, and by the animals that eat the plants, and by the bacteria and fungi that decompose dead animals, and then again by plants... You can see the whole cycle here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_cycle#/media/File:Nitrogen_Cycle.svg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_cycle#/media/File:Nitrogen_Cycle.svg</a></p>
<p>Nitrogen is an important component of fertilizer, and there are some parallels to fossil fuels - nitrogen deposits are created by plants or animals in some circumstances, and in some places we're harvesting thousands- or millions of years old deposits to fertilize our fields. However, this is less critical than fossil fuels because it doesn't really have an impact on the atmosphere, and in any case the fertilizer can also be produced artificially.</p>
<p>Oh, and another thing nitrogen is used for is to make explosives and rocket fuel. The amounts  are pretty irrelevant on a global scale, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one is really answering question I think if you are talking about respiration and the circulatory system. </p>
<p>Nitrogen doesn’t too much at normal atmospheres except help your alveoli stay open. If you breathed 100% oxygen not only would you have issues with atelectasis but you could incur oxidative stresses as well. </p>
<p>Nitrogen gets more wonky as you breath it at high pressures such as being underwater. As you go down you your body becomes more saturated, this isn’t too big of a deal until you try to resurface without giving your body enough time to wash out the nitrogen from your tissues. What can happen here is called DCI it decompression illness. Amazingly enough there is still not a lot very well understood about the mechanics of it, and divers are overly conservative because everyone is so variable not only from each other but themselves on a day to day basis.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogen is an “organic” element, meaning it’s found in all life. Carbon is also found in all living life (not to be confused with carbon dioxide, just elemental carbon). Hydrogen is another element that is found in life. Nitrogen can be found in soil, various minerals and plants, and in the air.</p>
<p>However it is non-reactive for the most part. Nitrogen doesn’t change very much the way carbon and other elements do. This means that, while it’s found everywhere on Earth and in our atmosphere, it doesn’t come in many forms.</p>
<p>Elements like carbon can be shaped into gases, solids like diamond, soft solids like graphite, etc. Oxygen can bond with many things like hydrogen (becoming hydrogen monoxide, which is a lethal gas), water, carbon, and many other elements. But nitrogen is sad and lonely because it’s usually all alone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
