		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The crab-eating-frog is the only known saltwater amphibian. However, it cannot live in saltwater permanently and can only tolerate 2.8% salinity, which is less than the oceans'. They live in mangrove swamps in SE Asia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>amphibians cant remain in saltwater for any extended period. Amphibian skin is permeable, water and even air for breathing can pass through it. through osmosis, water is taken out of the frog so that the water to salt ratio is the same in the frog and the ocean water. since the frog has very little salt in it at all, the frog will have all of its water pulled out of its body until the frog is shriveled up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers here are totally blowing my mind. It was my understanding that the first terrestrial vertebrates were amphibian analogs. Did they evolve in the limited, not connected, freshwater portions of the world? Is there a lake zero for all terrestrial vertebrates as they could not swim in saline water? how did they spread all over the world without being able to enter saltwater?</p>
