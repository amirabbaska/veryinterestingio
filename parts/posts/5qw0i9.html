		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cortisol is a hormone released when you are stressed. Itâ€™s produced in the adrenal cortex in response to stress (physical or emotional) and to natural cycles that tend to correlate to circadian rhythms. Cortisol makes the body respond more to normal levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine, and can therefore cause vasoconstriction which in turn can cause chest pains (which can mimic angina). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question, and one I'd been wondering just recently! I had surgery done back in November, and it had been healing without a peep the whole time, until someone I used to know suddenly popped back into my life in early January. It had been years since we last spoke, so I welcomed him back, hoping we might be able to get along. Unfortunately, it soon became evident that nothing had changed, and we started arguing over the same stupid crap we always used to. Sometimes the arguments would become so escalated, I could feel the area where my surgery had been done starting to feel sore. That freaked me out to the point where I knew this person and I needed to stop communicating again. Things have been fine ever since, but I'd never experienced anything like it before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever I'm nervous or stressed out, my right index finger starts aching intensely. Things like going on a date, speaking in front of people, my finger hurts like crazy. I can only guess that years of mousing with that finger have stored a solid mass of pent up frustrated emotions waiting for stuff to compute.
After a bad relationship breakup I realised (again) that a broken heart actually really hurts physically, as well as chills and body aching. Worse than flu or dengue fever. Foetal position, ocasional soup, basically. You can even die from a broken heart

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MD with significant clinical experience with pain and close relations with world renowned pain researchers here.  The simplest answer I can gave that it's very complex and any answer on Reddit will be at best incomplete if not totally wrong.  The simplest &quot;wrong&quot; answer is that there is a process that can be simply termed hyperalgesia, which means noxious stimuli that causes pain in a &quot;normal&quot; person causes more pain in a person that has undergone a hyperalgesic process.  So my pain score is 2 and yours is 8.  The process can be so significant that non-noxious stimuli can be interpreted as pain (allodynia).  This process is complex and has a lot to do with central (nervous system) and peripheral sensitization of the nervous system.  Another element of hyperalgesia can come from mood disorders (such as depression).  The biological framework of this is extremely complex and cannot be simply explained by any single process.  To be even more simplistic and incorrect, but kinda true, is that when you feel emotionally down you are more aware of noxious stimuli that was always there but now your threshold for experiencing this as pain decreases.  On top of all this is pain is subjective and placebo effects in treatments are far higher than that of other medications, again tying emotional cognitive aspects to the experience of pain. Hope that helps.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
