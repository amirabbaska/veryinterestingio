		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A type I supernova begins when the star undergoes electron degeneracy collapse - meaning that all the electrons and protons in the star undergo reverse decay and merge into neutrons.  The process takes about 20 seconds, which is a pretty amazing speed for anything to happen on the scale of a red giant.</p>
<p>But other posters are right, the actual explosion (which happens when the outer layers of the star rebound against the newly-formed neutron core) would take several minutes to become apparent.  Though still, that's incredibly fast for an enormous, billions-year-old star.</p>
<p>edit: gilded!  Thanks guys!  (Not really, but I just always wanted to say that.)</p>
<p>edit: gilded <em>for real!</em>  Thanks!  It's like my very own supernova.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would also be very bright.  I can't link right to it as I have done frequent before, but XKCD is again relevant.  In his book the author quotes a well known astrophysicist in saying &quot;However large you think a supernova is, it's bigger than that.&quot;<br />
To get an idea of how bright a supernova is, he compares viewing one from one AU away (from here to the sun) to watching the detonation of a hydrogen bomb while the device is pressed against your eyeball.  The supernova would still be brighter.  <em>By nine orders of magnitude.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look at the light curve of a supernova, it takes on the order of days to reach its luminosity peak. The actual process that releases the energy only takes seconds to maybe a few minutes, but it takes a long time for the emission of electromagnetic radiation (light etc) to peak. The electromagnetic radiation is just a minor byproduct of the supernova.</p>
<p>SN 1987A was first discovered in February 1987, but it only reached peak luminosity in May.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
