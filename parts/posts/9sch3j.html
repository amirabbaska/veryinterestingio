		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really names but a lot of cervids (deer and elk) can tell their offspring apart by smell. Each individual has it's own unique smell that they can tell apart. </p>
<p>In the case of white-tailed deer whole families even tend to have a unique smell so not only can they tell who their kid is by smell but also who is their sister or cousin. Studies have even shown that when a lone individual joins a group they will run against and nuzzle other individuals in that family to learn the groups scent and get the group to learn their scent. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about names but cattle use scent largely with identifying their calves. Have never seen any scientific studies, but a cow actually uses the scent of the calf's manure to identify it in early life. Every time a cow gets separated and reunited with their young, they will sniff the tail head. For example, when you &quot;graft&quot; an orphan calf onto a mother that lost hers, you leave the tail on the dead calf's hide when you skin it. We've had much better success with grafting when we leave the tail on. On the other hand, they also make a powder that smells like blood and euterus juice that can aid with the cow  claiming it. Probably more that'll you wanted to know lol </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With the exception of more intelligent species (like dolphins, elephants), animals don't have such a sophisticated language to express things such as names for their offsprings.</p>
<p>They might alert others for dangers, food or just call upon them, but instinct alone is what make parents and pups so close, there wouldn't be the need of a name.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
