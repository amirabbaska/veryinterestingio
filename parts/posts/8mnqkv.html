It seems like it would be akin to a wrecking ball vs. a car. Is it the same reasoning as the falling explanation? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Multiple reasons:</p>
<p>The exoskeleton of the ant distributes the force more quickly across its entire body (due to being more stiff than fluffy human tissue), protecting more vulnerable parts.</p>
<p>The small size makes it more resistant to blows - this is because volume (and mass) scales faster than surface area (r^3 instead of r^2). So smaller objects have a larger surface area per unit mass, which makes them move more easily even with light forces (like wind). The mass is what causes inertia (&quot;pushing back&quot; against your finger while you apply the force) and the force is distributed over its surface area. So your applied force is distributed across a relatively large (compared to its volume) surface area (leading to a relatively low pressure), while the low mass (very low, due to aforementioned scaling) makes it easy to move. This means you won't be applying your force for more than a fraction of a second before the ant is moving along with your finger, no longer receiving any significant force. Since you're not applying this force over any time (or distance), the total energy transferred into the ant is very small. This, combined with the effective armor exoskeleton, is why it's difficult to kill insects by swatting them into empty space, but if you push them against a solid object, they squash easily.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Resistant exoskeletons and general properties of small objects make them less likely to be crushed by an outside force.</p>
<p>True ELI5: It's like trying to break a balloon by punching it in midair. The punch is certainly hard enough, but the balloon just kind of gets pushed away.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they are light. So they are easily moved instead of deformed. If you flick against the ground they will get squeezed and die, but if you just flick them in the air, most of your force is directly translated into movement, which is not dangerous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The square-cube law means that smaller objects are stronger.  Hit a car with a wrecking ball and it's crushed; hit a toy car with a ball bearing and nothing happens.  Strength scales with the square of an object's size but mass scales with the cube so the toy car might be 100 times smaller and 10&#8239;000 times weaker, but the ball bearing weighs 1&#8239;000&#8239;000 times less than the wrecking ball.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ant doesn't have enough mass or area to absorb the energy from you flicking - the force you're pushing is extremely spread out. If you could concentrate the energy into the area of a knife blade, you would cut it. It's like hitting that car with the moon. It won't be 100% fine, but mostly the moon will just push the car.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
