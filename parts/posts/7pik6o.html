<p>The relationship between turns and efficiency should really just be driven by the resistance of the wire, the air or other core doesn't 'care' if a field is created by a higher current or more turns, it's behavior remains the same all the way through saturation.  (Neglecting edge effects)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>Not in principle. In practice, there are limitations. The insulation on the secondary might break down. The resistance of the secondary might be so high that you can get a million volts open circuit, but can't draw more than a microamp without the load voltage dropping to 1V.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the relationship between the efficiency and turns ratio of a transformer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There isn't one. No transformer is 100% efficient, but the efficiency is not a function of the turns ratio <em>per se</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many people have given you the technical answers but the real practical answer is cost, size and weight.</p>
<p>Any increase in voltage, power rating or complexity in a transformer will increase the cost, size and/or weight.</p>
<p>The size/weight are sometimes forgotten as esstential considerations. This transformer will need to pass under and over bridges on the way to where it is being installed. These bridges will have height and weight limits. The vehicle carrying it will also have a limit on what it can carry. Some utilities (I believe this is widespread in spain) use trains to transport them and so you have limitations on the height and width to match a train car.</p>
<p>These considerations are in other industries too. Did you know that the solid rocket boosters for the space shuttle are the same width as two horse and carts? This is because they had to pass through a tunnel on the way from where they were made. This tunnel was made to be just wide enough for two horse and carts to pass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The maximum voltage is limited (generally) by the core saturation.  Flux density is a function of the volts/turn.  The maximum flux density depends on the core material.  The higher the excitation, the higher the core losses.  Load losses are largely a function of the winding resistance.  Thinner wire, higher losses.  Also, if there are a large number of turns, conductor length will be longer, increasing losses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is also the thickness of the required insulative varnish. It is possible to make it thinner than the common type, but the copper wires can be made incredibly thin. The part of the windings that convert the magnetic field into current is the copper mass, and it is possible to make the copper wire diameter so tiny that it is equal to the added thickness of insulation in the cross section.</p>
<p>The &quot;window&quot; in the transformer secondary loop must be filled completely to harvest the maximum amount of current that can be produced. Decreasing the diameter of the wire allows for more turns in the inductor, which raises the output voltage. However, the total watts produced is the volts times amps.</p>
<p>If the insulation thickness stays the same for all wire diameters, then the thinner the wire, the greater a per centage of the total diameter becomes insulation, which does not produce any current. Also, as the voltage rises, it may even be required to thicken the insulation.</p>
<p>The secondary inductor of a common microwave oven transformer typically produces around 2,000-volts, and it can easily kill a person, or...make pretty lightning-bolt patterns on wood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
