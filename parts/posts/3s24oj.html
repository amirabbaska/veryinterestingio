		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>DNA organizes their cells same as it does yours. The rest is mostly reflexes and some simple sensory data they detect with their tentacles.</p>
<p>When the doctor tests your reflexes by tapping your knee the signal that causes your leg to twitch actually synapses in your spinal cord. Your brain doesn't play any part in that process. That's roughly what is at work in jellyfish--they have a network of nerves that, although it is de-centralized, has simple reflexive process programmed in and that's all they need. </p>
<p>They can detect when they've encountered an obstacle and change their shape to be more or less buoyant to try and move around it, they can detect saltiness and will avoid freshwater as best as they are able, they can sense light, their tentacles are programmed to basically try and eat anything they can grab, and they can undulate their body for very simple locomotion. I'm sure they have some other chemical-sensing organs in their skin for lole detecting the best time to reproduce, but other than that... that's about all there is to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't have a brain, but they do have basically a collective of nerves forming a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_net" target="_blank">nerve net</a>. This allows them to sense and respond to stimuli.   </p>
<p>Jellyfish do actually have some sensory organs, such as ocelli, which are light sensitive organs. Not really eyes, per se, but they do detect light conditions. Interestingly enough, box jellies actually do have complex eyes which have a lenses, retinas and corneas! They have 24 eyes, clustered in sixes on each side of their box-shaped bell. These clusters are called rhopalia. Only 2/6 of these eyes actually have the complete set of lens, retina and cornea; the other 4/6 are ocelli. Now, we're not exactly what they see - do they see images or just really good light differences? They probably don't see images like we do, but it's still freaky, eh? You can check out more eye properties of the box jellies here: <a href="https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/detailedresult.php?img=2825319_359_2010_506_Fig1_HTML&req=4" target="_blank">https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/detailedresult.php?img=2825319_359_2010_506_Fig1_HTML&req=4</a>   </p>
<p>So as it turns out, blood isn't really a necessary part of life. Let's think about what blood does in our bodies. The circulatory system is basically the highway system of the body, and blood constituents are gonna ride it to the other parts of the body. The main purposes of blood are to facilitate gas and nutrient exchange. It delivers oxygen and nutrients, while also taking away carbon dioxide and metabolic wastes. If you're a jellyfish, your body is literally just a gelatinous network of cells. It's so thin that oxygen and metabolic wastes can just diffuse in/out, which is why they don't need/have blood.  </p>

<p>Sponges, corals, bryozoans... lots of animals :)   </p>
<p><strong>Here's one that will really trip you out:</strong>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichoplax" target="_blank"><em>Trichoplax adhaerens</em></a> They have no organs,  and no nerves, sensory cells or muscle cells:   </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, a lot of animals don't have brains. Or at least not what we would consider brains. I will first go a bit into what makes jelly fish tick, and then I will go into what organizes the cells. </p>
<p>Jellyfish belong to the phylum Cnidaria, which is characterized by radial symmetry, and aquatic lifestyles. (Among other things). Cnidarians have &quot;nerve nets&quot;, which is a web of nerve cells spread throughout the animals body. This nerve net is responsible for the jelly fishes interaction with its environment. The jelly fish responds to stimuli (odor, or damage for instance) with a set of reactions. For instance, the jelly may follow the source of the odor if it is food. They have a very limited set of actions, probably basic things such as &quot;hunt&quot; &quot;escape&quot; or &quot;float aimlessly&quot;. This is all accomplished through the nerve net. Without any brain. Which probably explains why they are so stupid.</p>
<p>To answer your second question. Jellyfish get by without a circulatory system because the vast majority of its tissue is in direct contact with water, which allows it to directly diffuse oxygen in, and carbon dioxide out. </p>
<p>As far as cell organization is concerned, the brain actually has very little to do with it even in humans. The vast majority of cell organization begins early in development through the creation of chemical gradients from the first few cells of an embryo (in the case of mammals). The cells know what to do based upon the concentration of chemical signals surrounding it. </p>
<p>Clams are also animals that have no brains. They too have nerve nets, much like Cnidarians. These animals are also quite stupid, also probably because they have no brain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
