		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically what happens is that Mr Wi-Fi is told to deliver a bunch of packages to your house. He delivers some of them but on one of the trips a bad guy distracts him and now he can't deliver the packages.</p>
<p>Command center doesn't know that until suddenly they can't contact Mr Wi-Fi anymore! Now they have to finish the delivery, but they forgot what already made it to your house. It's Data Boy to the rescue!</p>
<p>Data Boy lives on the other side of town and has to find a new way to bring you what you need. He goes to a new warehouse nearer to his house to get you everything, since Command Center forgot what they gave you. </p>
<p>Anyways my point is; since Mr Wi-Fi and Data Boy don't start from the same place, and they can't communicate, Data Boy has to start from scratch to give you the package.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Edit: Gold! Thank you kind stranger. </p>
<p>Edit2: a lot of people are asking why you can't have them work together. I did some digging on Google and it's time to ELI5!</p>
<p>So as I understand it, the way it works right now is that Command Center is working hard to send things to everybody, but this is hard because they have itty bitty roads. </p>
<p>Not only are these tiny roads, they are also tough to walk on! So right now only one hero at a time on a tiny road.</p>
<p>Very smart people are making a nice highway so heroes and side kicks can work together, but that is very hard and they are still figuring put how to build it. Also, the highway will be easy to walk on, so normal people can walk on it too!</p>
<p>Until we have the highway, we have to be good kids and wait for the heroes to send the packages.</p>

<p>It isn't for everything though, and I do remember it being very specific about the phone temperature being cool enough...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly because of routing. Your wifi and your mobile data represent two completely different sources on the internet and it is unlikely that their connections (even to the same site) would follow the same path. There is nothing inherent in internet protocols that would allow the two connections to be easily coordinated. This would have to happen, otherwise you'd just be downloading the same data twice, not different parts you could then assemble on the receiving end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
