		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an artificially screwed up market.  Quad core tablets are competing with all the other tablets, phones, laptops and etc. </p>
<p>Graphing calculators are REQUIRED- usually in certain standard types like the TI-83, for all sorts of educational classes- starting with high school algebra and going through high level college courses. </p>
<p>Your teacher doesn't want you using Johnny's Graphing Calculator because it won't have the identical TI-83 interface, meaning they'd have to spend a lot of time just telling you what buttons to push instead of teaching the math with a graphing calculator as a tool.  This then means that everyone knows how to use a TI-83, but no one can use the HP 1001. So they keep and buy TI-83s.</p>
<p>Essentially the same reason college textbooks are so expensive. The Professor wants to be able to say- &quot;turn to page 586&quot;, so he uses a certain book, so they can charge whatever they want because you don't need <strong>A</strong> biology book.  You need THAT book. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In 1972 HP released the first pocket scientific calculator (the HP 35). They proceeded to be the dominant competitor in that market for at least 15 years (there was something of a race between them and TI). HP's business model focused on engineers and scientists. TI eventually focused more on students.</p>
<p>In the late 80s and early 90s engineers and scientists started getting really good access to computers that had more precision and functionality than these calculators. By the mid 90s, calculators had gone out of fashion for engineers. TI was still happily focusing on students, and by that time had firmly entrenched themselves.</p>
<p>This of course, ignores some of the other manufacturers that popped up along the way, but people forget how huge HP was and TI still is. Those two companies dominated that market hard for decades.</p>
<p>If you look at the HP models from the 80s, you'll find that they STILL sell for good money. This is because there are still engineers and scientists who use them for actual work. Why? Because not everyone wants to carry a graphing calculator, and modern scientific calculators don't have the same level of functionality as scientific calculators from 1980 to 1995.</p>
<p>I'm 100% serious. Go look at what the HP 15C, HP 41, HP 42s, TI 68, etc could do. Now look at a TI 36X Pro or a Casio fx-115ES Plus. They're not even in the same ballpark.</p>
<p>Now look at what those calculators sell for on Ebay (and they DO sell). Even the HP 15C remake (from 2008 I think) goes for $400!</p>
<p>Personally, I carry an HP 42s and an HP Prime in my backpack. The TI 36X Pro is good, but not nearly good enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Schools often mandate specific calculators for specific classes.   This is for two reasons. One is that instructions can be very exact: hit this button then that button then enter these numbers and get a result. Also it's to prevent cheating that you could do on a general purpose computer. </p>
<p>So since students have to buy these calculators, just like text books they have a smaller market than general computers (costs are spread over a smaller market), and since buyers are forced to buy them, they can set a higher price and margin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for TI, and while graphing calculators are one of our most forward facing products (we don't typically sell to end users), it's one of our smallest and least profitable business units. So there really isn't a lot of focus on it outside of the jokes about how we make calculators. It's mostly because we don't have any incentives to bring the price down, there is no competition, it's not a growing market, etc. From a business perspective, it doesn't make a lot of sense to lower the cost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
