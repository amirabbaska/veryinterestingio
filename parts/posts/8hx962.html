		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yesterday, I saw an add from ExxonMobil -- it wasn't <a href="https://www.ispot.tv/ad/wuqT/exxon-mobil-seven-ingredients" target="_blank">this one</a>, but it made a similar claim about their seven ingredients being precisely formulated to do wonderful things (I think it was improve gas mileage). I know that I've heard similar claims from other gas companies claiming that <em>their</em> gas is the best (cleanest! best fuel economy! longest engine life!, etc.). </p>
<p>Is this all just marketing gimmicks, or are there actual chemical differences between the various companies' gas?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes there are subtle differences. Fuel (at least in Europe, and I assume in the rest of the world) must comply to a certain specification. This fuel sits in huge tanks at the depot. During the loading of the road tankers additives are added to the fuel, these additives are usually very expensive, and a very small dose is required for one tanker batch. Additives are usually (not always) exclusive for a certain oil company like shell or BP - they have their own stash and dedicated pipes at the depot. But the main fuel still comes out of the same large tank(s). So there is a difference between the premium and normal fuels, there are things blended into the fuel. How much of a difference these additives make I don’t know though…</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
