		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I mean does a low energy beta emitter produce as much power as a higher power emitter? (in a power cell) (if so - why? why can't we use the higher energy electrons better?) </p>
<p>As far as I understood it it isn't the extra electron produced that &quot;becomes&quot; the power but it has something to do with a technology like solar cells? (could we use other materials to capture for instance gamma rays to produce power?)</p>
<p>What happends to the electron later - Does it add to the power output by itself so to speak? (if we just packed a beta emitter inside a metal casing, would the casing get a higher voltage potential from capturing the electrons?)</p>
<p>Are there even vast differences between beta decay energies of different isotopes to begin with? (I'm having some problems finding tables of beta decay energies and are finding weird (what seems like probability) graphs of energies. Cobalt-60 beta decay energy seems to be comparable(-ish) (in orders of magnitude) to carbon-14 decay energies if I understand things right).</p>
<p>I know this is a lot of jumbled together questions, but I guess my main curiosity is the title one.</p>
<p>Thank you</p></div></div>

<p>Yes, but that would be horribly inefficient.</p>

<p>~20 keV (tritium as notable example) to the low MeV range. Yes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Beta decay energies tend to be around 1 MeV, but there is some variance spanning between a few keV to a few MeV. There's also the fact that beta particles are not monoenergetic, since the final state in a beta decay has three particles. All three share the decay energy, and how much each one gets is not uniquely determined, as it would be for a two body final state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
