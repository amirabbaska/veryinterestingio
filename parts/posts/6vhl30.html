		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Working on small gas engines as a kid has definitely left a romanticized impression of fuel smells. Those were fun times, and spilling a little gasoline on my jeans was common, mix that with a little burnt oil smell (since I revved my dirt bike engine too much anyway) that is a recipe for summer love. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
