Well, if a material is bonded to itself really strongly (tungsten), it will take a lot of energy (heat) to force them to spread out. If they are weak (plastic), they will spread out a lot further with application of the same amount of energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with how asymmetrical the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ruoZIaO" target="_blank">bond energy curve</a> is. </p>
<p>As you can see, if you raise the energy from equilibrium, the atoms could go either way on the curve: closer together or further apart. The real answer, as you probably know, is that they oscillate. If the curve is symmetrical, the bond distance doesn't change. If the curve is shallower on the right, as in this diagram, the average bond distance shifts right and becomes larger as you increase energy in the system. Incidentally, most materials expand when heated because the slope on the right represents only electromagnetic force, while the slope on the left also includes electron degeneracy pressure (a &quot;force&quot; created by electrons not wanting to occupy the same states).</p>
<p>Why do different bonds have differently-shaped curves? Don't ask me, I'm just an undergrad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm really glad someone asked about this because I wrote a dissertation about a year ago on this topic. The responses so far mainly cover it, but I will add a few remarks. </p>
<p>There are actually a number of different phenomena that can contribute to what we term positive thermal expansion (PTE) or negative thermal expansion (NTE) for some given material ... and there has been considerable scientific effort to studying materials with NTE. Materials that display PTE are commonplace, but what's comparatively rare are those that display NTE. This where instead of expanding on heating, they contract. We often seek to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for this NTE behavior. The proposed mechanisms vary, but in one case, some cubic rhenium trioxide type materials (such as CaZrF6 and ScF3) are currently thought to maintain NTE as a consequence of the coupled rocking of their polyhedra which shifts the metal cation centers inward upon heating. See the following two publications: <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja106711v" target="_blank">JACS 132 (44)</a> and <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b00662" target="_blank">CHEM MATER 27 (11)</a>  </p>
<p>This widespread interest is motivated for a number of reasons. If you can appropriately combine a positively thermally expanding material with a negatively thermally expanding material in the right proportion in what's called a composite, you can potentially introduce dimensional stability with zero or near zero thermal expansion. That happens to be a very important concern for precision optics, where thermal stability in the instrumentation is crucial, especially for the aim of reproducibility in measurements. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great topic. Just wanted to share that this is a little understood problem in plumbing long buried supply lines using PVC. If you put
500' of 1.5‚Äù schedule 40 PVC together at 80 degrees F, once you burried it, it would try to tear itself apart as the linear contraction is a cumulative ~10 inches (iirc). The glue welds will break, or the pipe itself will. Flexible lines (PE) are better for the application because they are laid slack.</p>
<p>Also, exterior house materials like hardisiding (fibered cement board) have a much lower coefficient than many other materials (wood for example)and because of that hold paint better/longer.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
