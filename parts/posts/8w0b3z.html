		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hooo mouth shape makes the air go faster which pulls other air along with it. So the warm air from your mouth is closer to normal temperature air because it's mixed more. The faster moving air feels cooler because it can absorb a little heat from whatever you're blowing on and move away to let other air do the same.</p>
<p>Haaaa mouth shape doesn't pull other air along with it as much so ends up being closer to the temperature inside your body (warmer) which is normally warmer (and more humid) than what you're blowing on so it feels warmer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the air coming out of your mouth is (almost exacty) the same temperature. To prove this to yourself, &quot;hooo&quot;-blow on the back of your hand from a very short distance away. The air is warm, just like when you &quot;ha&quot;-blow. But move your hand farther away, and the &quot;hooo&quot;-blown air feels cool. The reason is that &quot;hooo&quot;-blown air is moving so fast, it can pull a lot of surrounding, cooler air with it. Ha blown air, doesn't move very fast, so it doesn't pull surrounding cooler air along and keeps feeling warm and humid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the way your lips are. When your lips are pursed and going “oooh”, the air that comes out has a narrower exit point which increases the air’s speed thus decreasing temperature. When opened, there’s a larger exit point thus slower speed and maintaining heat. Basically, the faster the speed, the faster the cooling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
