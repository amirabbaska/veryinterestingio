It's noted that it has a lot of very unique benefits, and is essential to our health and well-being, but this question is made even more complicated when you consider that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/jellyfish-caught-snoozing-give-clues-to-origin-of-sleep/" target="_blank">we've recently discovered that even brainless creatures have need of sleep!</a></p>
<p>Needless to say, this is going to be a very important avenue of research, because why would a brainless creature need to sleep? Why would its cognitive ability be impaired if it has no brain to speak of? This is one of those magical areas where science doesn't quite have all of the answers just yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: A few responses in this thread say the same thing &quot;we don't know what sleep is for&quot;, which is a true statement. However, we <em>do</em> know what it is <em>not</em> for, hence my responce below. </p>
<hr />
<p>What is clear is that sleep primary function is not energy conservation. What isn't clear is if it adds to, or plays a role in sleep at all. </p>
<p>It is clear from various proofs that energy can't be the primary or even a major factor is <em>why</em> organisms sleep (or have sleep-like states). To give some quick ones:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hibernating animals wake up intermittently to both sleep and pee.  e.g. squirrels, don't continuously hibernate. They get out of their hibernation a few times and [in those times they spend most of that asleep^1, ^2]( <a href="http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/276/2/r522" target="_blank">http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/276/2/r522</a>).   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For humans the energy savings of sleeping vs laying awake but resting is the equivalent to a slice of bread (~50 calories). This is hardly worth losing vigilance for 1/3 the day for.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The correlation of [body mass and sleep amount is weak at best^3]( <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/cr_data/article_fulltext/s80000/80731/img/fig3.jpg" target="_blank">https://www.dovepress.com/cr_data/article_fulltext/s80000/80731/img/fig3.jpg</a>). Although generally smaller mammals, for example, sleep more than larger mammals, you can't really guess at the amount of sleep an organism has by their size.  e.g. Lions, Platypuses &amp; chipmunks all sleep around the same amount of time^4.  </p>
</li>
<li>Almost every organism appears to have a sleep-like state^5. Even single cell organisms. With these organisms it's unclear if &quot;sleep&quot; is even happening, but it's doubtful that reduced stimuli responsiveness does much for their energy expenditure.   </li>
</ul>
<p>The third point, though, show that there is a bit of correlation (even if weak), which indicate that perhaps there are some side benefits of energy conservation in sleep.  </p>
<p>I've only highlighted some of the key evidences about energy conservation. There are many, and there is wide consensus that energy conservation isn't the point of sleep.  I will say though, that I think we often make a mistake by trying to see a function of sleep as a ubiquitous thing that <em>must</em> be the same across all species (but that is just my thinking on this)   </p>

^5 ^(Sleep-like rather than &quot;sleep&quot; since we often define sleep as we see it in humans --i.e. laying down, less responsive to stimuli and brain changes-- but in many organisms, we can't see most of these with the exception of stimuli responsiveness. Hence &quot;sleep-like&quot; rather than &quot;sleep&quot;.)   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question, but nobody knows. From a neuroscience perspective, sleep is required for the brain to consolidate experiential information into knowledge. One idea is that in order to avoid new memories from interfering (overwriting as it were) with old ones, you have to somehow interleave reactivation of old memories with new ones. Memory suffers greatly with insomnia - just ask someone with a newborn. </p>
<p>There is probably no way of reducing the amount of down-time needed for this. So even if you can solve the energy restoration 'problem', there will be a cognitive price to be paid for chronic deprivation of sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, it clearly achieves both, so I'm not sure how to apportion relative weights to the two.</p>
<p>We now know of many actual mechanisms by which sleep achieves its functions, which go far beyond just energy conservation. These include </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Restoration of ATP stores in neurons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clearance of some waste products from the brain via the
<em>gylmphatic system</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reconfiguration of synapses. There is a theory that sleep is largely involved in syaptic <em>downscaling</em>, but it's far from consensus at the moment, as there are some contradictory findings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consolidation of memories. The mechanisms here are only partially understood, but the function itself is well established across multiple species.</p>
</li>
<li>Numerous other functions, including bone growth, release of growth hormone, normal glucose-insulin regulation, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>With respect to how much energy is saved by sleeping, sleep uses about 80% of the energy per unit time compared to lying still but awake at the same time of day. (These numbers are obtained from the excellent studies at Boulder by Wright et al., where energy expenditure is very carefully tracked.) So, overall, it's a modest saving in terms of total daily energy expenditure. <strong>If you reduce your sleep duration from 8 hours to 5 hours per night, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/14/5695.short" target="_blank">you increase your daily energy expenditure by about 5%</a></strong> (assuming a typical amount of daily exercise). </p>
<p>[<em>Note that this is NOT an effective weight loss method, as sleep loss also messes with the hunger regulating hormones leptin and ghrelin, causing people with insufficient sleep to overcompensate with energy intake!</em>]</p>
<p>In terms of evolutionary fitness, that's definitely enough to make a difference, but I most sleep researchers would not consider it to be sleep's primary function. If that were the primary function, it would probably be more effective to shut off metabolism to a greater degree (e.g., a torpor-like state). The brain is overall quite active in sleep, and uses only slightly less energy than it does in wakefulness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
