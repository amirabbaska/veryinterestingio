I guess that's the aftermath. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a process of gradually eating more and more food to help expand your stomach. Also being able to chew and break up the food is important as well. Smaller pieces of food will pack inside a stomach a lot more efficiently. Having strong monster jaws helps a lot. </p>
<p>All competitive eaters purge after these competitions. That’s the aftermath, lots of puke. </p>
<p>Edit: most competitions don’t let you puke or make you hold it in for a certain amount of time. During training they will puke a lot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the consumption, practice. They need to eat progressively larger amounts of food or liquids per a period of time so their stomach can (somewhat) comfortably stretch to hold it all and they can get used to eating/drinking way past their body’s ‘I feel full’ point. I don’t know about the rest, it isn’t talked about much.</p>
<p>Edit: Liquids too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was an episode of some TV show, I think it was MTV's True Life that followed competitive eaters preparing for the Nathan's hot dog competition in New York. The reigning champ was some tiny Japanese guy. He basically just worked out all day, and when he wasn't working out he was stretching his stomache by eating pounds of food. Obviously he worked up to that point, but that's the general idea.</p>
<p>Eat a ton of food every day and exercise enough to maintain your health.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually know a lot about this! </p>
<p>Training involves eating a high volume of low calorie foods and letting it pass naturally. A common thing would be eating an entire head of cabbage and drinking a gallon of water in an hour.  This is a large volume that doesn’t put much into the body in terms of calories, so they can do it fairly often and maintain their health.</p>
<p>One reason that everyone up there was so skinny is because of the “fat belt” phenomenon. This is where the larger you are, the more your fat belt restricts the expansion of your stomach. Many of the gurgitators (the unofficial name of professional eaters) are pretty athletic people and go to the gym often.</p>
<p>As far as the aftermath, it’s somewhat of a pride point to not throw the food back up. It doesn’t disqualify you to do so after the time frame, but most of the top eaters pass it all naturally. </p>
<p>If you have continued interest in the topic, read “Eat This Book” published about 12 years ago. It talks about many of the famous eaters, how the circuit got started, and the other glorious adventures of professional eaters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
