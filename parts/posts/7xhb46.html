<p>Yes, the current will continue to flow for a very long time. This is how superconducting electromagnets work. You just cause a current to start flowing through a coil of superconductor, and then just let it keep flowing. It produces a nice static magnetic field. Since superconductors have negligible resistance to DC, you can have hundreds of Amps flowing through the coils at a time. You just have to be sure not to exceed the maximum current for the superconducting phase, or you can cause the coil to quench.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. What's more I can show you a video of it. You can induce an electric current in a conductive surface by passing a magnetic field through it. This results in an opposing electromagnetic field being produced in the material that will slow the source of the original magnetic field. Here is an example in a non-superconducting material: <a href="https://youtu.be/sENgdSF8ppA?t=58s" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/sENgdSF8ppA?t=58s</a></p>
<p>There is some resistance to the magnet in that clip produced by the electromagnetic field generated by the flow of electrons in the copper, but since it is not superconductive the magnet eventually falls.</p>
<p>Now here is an example of the same trick done over a superconductor: <a href="https://youtu.be/nWTSzBWEsms?t=26s" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/nWTSzBWEsms?t=26s</a></p>
<p>No resistance to the flow of electricity means that the superconductive plate can sustain an induced current indefinitely and as such provide an opposing magnetic field to the magnet above that does not degrade. Without any losses due to electrical resistance the magnet never falls to the surface. That is, until the superconductor warms to room temperature where it no longer has superconductive properties.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Onnes conducted an experiment, in 1912, on the usability of superconductivity. Onnes introduced an electric current into a superconductive ring and removed the battery that generated it. Upon measuring the electric current, Onnes found that its intensity did not diminish with the time. The current persisted due to the superconductive state of the conductive medium.&quot;</p>

<p>Since it requires to be near 0 Kelvin, it has to be done in a careful way.  If powering up and causes heat the coil loses it superconductivity there is a chain reaction of heat and resulting in heating the liquid helium which turns to gas in a sudden startling way called a quench.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yup. It would flow forever. The experimental evidence says the resistance zero or at most very, very low, and the theory says it is exactly, precisely, zero.</p>
<p>We usually speak of &quot;resistivity&quot; rather than &quot;resistance&quot;, because resistance is geometry-dependent: a wire of twice the length has twice the resistance, a wire with twice the cross-section has half the resistance, etc, but the resistivity of the material is constant. Resistance is measured in Ohms, and resistivity is measured in Ohm-cm.</p>
<p>Some numbers: Copper is among the best conductors at room temperature, and resistivity of Copper at room temperature is about 1.7 x10^-6 Ohm-cm. Most metal have lower resistance at lower temperatures, and Copper drops to about 1.7 x10^-8 Ohm-cm as the temperature approaches 0. (Copper never goes superconducting)
The best measurements of the resistivity of a superconductor I know of <a href="http://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.1702504" target="_blank"><a href="http://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.1702504" target="_blank">http://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.1702504</a></a> are from 1961 and put the resistivity at less than 4 x 10^-23 Ohm-cm. That's 3 million <em>billion</em> times lower than cold copper.</p>
<p>The experiment goes a lot like what you propose: Set up a current in a superconducting ring, and measure the magnetic field over time. If the current goes down at all, the magnetic field will diminish. If there is any resistance at all, the current will decay exponentially according to the equation I=I0<em>exp(R</em>t/L) where R is the resistance and L is the inductance. Assuming the highest resistivity not ruled out by experiment and a 1m diameter loop of made from 1cm diameter wire, it would take about 7.5 million years for the current to drop to around 1/3 it's original value. In practice, we can measure very tiny changes in magnetic field so we don't have to wait for a drop that big, and we can make smaller coils with smaller inductance to speed up the time constant, and that's exactly what is done. The longest measurement I know of ended in 1957 after 30 months, without the slightest measurable change in current before they got tired of keeping the darn thing cold.</p>
<p>Superconductivity is a phase transition, which means it's not just following a general trend like &quot;lower resistance at lower temperature&quot;, but whole new rules come suddenly into effect. As an analogy, consider dropping a ball bearing through a fluid. (In this analogy, the height of the ball corresponds to the current in a ring.) In air, the ball drops very quickly (basically no viscosity). In water, the ball drops a little more slowly (some viscosity). In syrup the ball drops slow enough to time by eye (high viscosity), and in road tar, the ball might take years to reach the bottom, but it still gets there (stupidly high viscosity). In each case, we are talking about fluids with different viscosities, like we might talk about metals with different resistance. Now consider water: it has a viscosity that goes up as the temperature goes down (that's why you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri_4dDvcZeM" target="_blank">tell by ear if someone is pouring hot or cold water</a>) so the ball bearing takes a bit longer to fall every time we try again at a lower temperature. At some point though, the water freezes into a block of ice (a phase transition) and the ball bearing just sits on top without falling at all. One might ask: &quot;maybe the viscosity is just really, really high?&quot; And you could watch for a really long time to see if the ball bearing starts sinking through until you get bored. Experiment says &quot;basically no falling at all&quot; and theory says &quot;the water is a solid with a fixed crystal structure, so viscosity is not a useful/valid concept anymore. It's not like super-thick tar, it's a frikkin' solid!&quot;
With superconductors, experiment says &quot;the resistance is pretty much zero&quot; and theory says &quot;resistance isn't a useful concept anymore, it's a frikkin' superconductor! Call it 0 Ohms if you <em>must</em>&quot; Anyway, we should always keep in mind the <a href="https://youtu.be/9hMp65SzyTU" target="_blank">results from 1998</a>, when he Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, who plummeted 16 ft through an announcer’s table.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
