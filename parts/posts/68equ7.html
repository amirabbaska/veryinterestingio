		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always been curious:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why most flies are impossible to get your hands on without a fly-swatter</p>
</li>
<li>Why some flies don't possess this trait, and can be swatted with a napkin without noticing anything</li>
</ul>
<p>Is it like a sense? What causes it to stop, age? Exhaustion? Environmental effects?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I should make it clear, I know these flies <em>are</em> flies, not other insects.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in an electronics manufacturing plant that used lead solder. Any insect that found its way in there (usually flies and crickets in the summer) just behaved <em>strange</em>. Flies would fly with less and less coordination, usually in divebombing circles that landed on the floor. Crickets wouldn't hop, they'd walk. Sometimes dragging their back legs. Many flies lost their ability to fly and would just crawl around, and eventually die. While I'm sure they ran out of food, I also can't help but think the likely layer of lead coating everything neurologically killed them slowly. I wish I would've got lead tested during my time there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fly reaction times have a lot to do with availability of food and the ambient temperature.  Next time you attempt to scoop one up, think about the environment and time of year and see how that compares to your success.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Last summer I endured a fly infestation due to a rotting carcass trapped within our walls. In total, this plague occurred 2x and lasted roughly 7 days each time. During this time period, I had the unique opportunity to observe the same species of fly in a controlled environment (bathroom).</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, I was in a state of confusion. It seemed that every time I returned to the bathroom, I found several more flies. These young flies were smaller and active. They were nearly &quot;impossible&quot; to kill, as you have described.</p>
<p>Several days later, it became extremely apparent that the source of the flies was hidden within our bathroom walls. Every time I entered the bathroom there were 20-30 new flies. These flies were average size but were <em>easier to kill</em>.</p>
<p>Near the end of the week, the flies were <strong>huge</strong>. I'm guessing here, but perhaps 0.75 inch in length. However these flies were not moving whatsoever. I could walk right up to them, make any sort of noise, but they were motionless and unresponsive. I killed them all.</p>
<p>I am not a scientist, but from my observations, flies are not unlike humans! In general, younger fliers are more active. Bloated flies, especially ones originating from a rapidly deteriorating food source, are much slower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

So if you clap you hands straight up from where they are resting it will fly right into your clapping hands to his death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
