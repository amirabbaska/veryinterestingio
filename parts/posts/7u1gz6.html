		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept of &quot;vocal cords&quot; is pretty misleading. What you have instead are &quot;vocal folds,&quot; which are two flaps that let air travel through your larynx, which we manipulate into certain sounds using our tongue, teeth, and lips. Part of the low voice sound is the vibration your vocal folds make when they're more closed than open. When these two folds come together, the small area that air escapes through causes them to vibrate and slap together, and your voice sounds &quot;lower.&quot; Try it now; when does your voice sound lower, when you're making an &quot;s&quot; sound or &quot;z&quot; sound?</p>
<p>The deepness of one's voice is mostly determined by how low their larynx is. That's why tall people often have lower voices because their larynx is lower, which gives their vocal folds more space. Children have high voices because their larynxes have no depth, thus small vocal folds. You can raise and lower your larynx at will to make your voice higher or lower, which is what someone is doing when they're making their best attempt at a &quot;Darth Vader&quot; voice (lower larynx longer folds). </p>
<p>Therefore, during a falsetto, your larynx is raised, and your vocal folds are open.</p>
<p>EDIT: Clarity
EDIT: I changed some wording around about larynx size because some people were losing their shit about the word “neck.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like u/beto1460 said, your vocal &quot;cords&quot; are actually vocal <em>folds,</em> flaps of skin inside your larynx. When you make a sound, they flap open and closed a bunch of times per second and to regulate air flow out of your throat. Typically, though, the deepness of your voice isn't so much dependent on how low your larynx is, but on how long and thick your vocal folds are: Longer, thicker vocal folds will produce a deeper voice, because they vibrate more slowly. When you make your voice higher and lower, what you're doing is manipulating the shape and tension of your vocal folds to change the speed at which they vibrate.</p>
<p>When you speak in falsetto, your vocal folds don't close all the way. However, the vocal passage is <em>not</em> entirely open: Your vocal folds have mucus membranes on the edges, sometimes called &quot;false vocal folds,&quot; and when you speak in falsetto, those are what's vibrating together to produce the noise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Similarly, I've always wondered what is the physical difference in the vocal folds and larynx when you switch from normal voice to head voice to falsetto.
Why do they each have their own different range?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
