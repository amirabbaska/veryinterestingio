		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are deposits of melanin in the skin, similar to freckles or moles. They are formed along with the rest of the epidermis around 14 weeks.Birthmarks are areas of discolored skin that are on a baby's body at birth or that show up within a few months after delivery. Over 80 percent of babies have some kind of birthmark. Some endure for life, while others fade away over time.</p>
<p>Most birthmarks fall into one of two categories: vascular or pigmented. Vascular birthmarks are caused by blood vessels that have accumulated below the surface of the skin. They range in color from pink to red to bluish, depending on the depth of the blood vessels. Pigmented birthmarks — usually brown, gray, bluish, or black — result from an abnormal development of pigment cells. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A birthmark is a congenital, benign irregularity on the skin which is present at birth or appears shortly after birth, usually in the first month. They can occur anywhere on the skin. Birthmarks are caused by overgrowth of blood vessels, melanocytes, smooth muscle, fat, fibroblasts, or keratinocytes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
