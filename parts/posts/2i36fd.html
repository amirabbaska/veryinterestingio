		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The latest consensus is that if you have a well-balanced diet there is no reason to take a MV (with maybe the exception of vitamin D). </p>
<p>Late last year the Annals of Internal Medicine released several studies that showed no benefit of daily MV use in regards to several outcomes (including cancer) when studied in large cohorts <a href="http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1767855" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1789247" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1789246" target="_blank">3</a>. </p>
<p>That being said, the major limitation of those studies was that it was not known whether or not the participants possessed any nutritional deficiencies. </p>
<p>That being the case, the question is if daily MV use is beneficial for someone who is deficient or in a certain disease state or within a certain sub-group. The answer is we don't know. <a href="http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/pdf/10.2217/whe.14.2" target="_blank">Here</a> is an editorial that summarizes a lot of the issues that that topic currently faces.</p>
<p>Another issue is that MV are made by companies for profit and are not regulated by the FDA. That has resulted in quite a backlash against the original sources I cited. Many responses have been issued that attempted to discredit the meta-analysis-some of which is justified and some of which is not. <a href="http://imjournal.com/openaccess/guilliams131.pdf" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/flawed-research-used-to-attack-multivitamin-supplements/5365047?print=1" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="http://www.myvitaminpacks.com/mvp/beware-media-spin-machine/" target="_blank">3</a></p>
<p>Lastly, here is a <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/post/Is_Multivitamin-Mineral_MVM_Supplementation_Unnecessary_Specifically_Are_there_real_micronutrient_deficiencies" target="_blank">great back-and-forth</a> by some scientists at ResearchGate (think of it as Facebook for scientist) that describes the current state of the NIH and other regulartory committees in regards to daily MV use and research</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://examine.com/faq/do-i-need-a-multivitamin.html" target="_blank">http://examine.com/faq/do-i-need-a-multivitamin.html</a></p>
<p>Probably only useful in people with malnutrition, some evidence of benefit in prison populations/people with antisocial behaviours (who are likely suffering from nutrient insufficiencies).</p>
<p>Superdosing with certain nutrients commonly found in multivitamins in hgih amounts is bad. Two examples include:</p>
<p>Alpha-Tocopherol (one of 8 types of Vitamin E, but generally the only form found in the majority of multivitamins). Taking an excess amount of a-tocopherol has been shown to reduce levels of beta, delta, and gamma tocopherol, as well as all four tocotrienols (a, b, d, y).</p>
<p>Beta-Carotene, a pro-Vitamin A compound. Although it doesn't have the same toxicity associated with retinol (activated Vitamin A), but excess appears to be bad, particularly in at risk populations (smokers). Other forms of pro-vitamins have not been associated with the same risk (alpha-carotenoids, all the xanthophylls).</p>
<p>Some of the B-vitamins in excess can cause flushing, diarrhea, and even neuropathies. Vitamin C in excess can cause diarrhea, as can magnesium.</p>
<p>So the lesson is: superdosing with any one nutrient (or one subtype of a nutrient) = bad</p>
<p>But multivitamins still have some weak evidence of benefit in at risk populations (prisoners, psychiatric inpatients, and people with malnutrition), with equivocal evidence in the general population.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Multivitamins are at best useless/ever so slightly beneficial for the average person, and potentially harmful (due to potentially creating an imbalance of micronutrients, or delivering an excess of certain types) at worst.</p>
<hr />
<p>There is however evidence of nutrient deficiencies being corrected for <em>individual</em> nutrients commonly lacking in the diet, and people seeing benefit long term.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<p>Iron (gen pop, particularly women and people of lower SES)</p>
<p>Vitamin D (gen pop, particularly older people)</p>
<p>Calcium (post-menopausal women)</p>
<p>Folate (alcholics and pregnant women, people with MTFR mutations may require metafolin, rather than folic acid for significant benefit, MTFR mutations/polymorphisms are fairly common in the population).</p>
<p>Zinc (people who are physically active, endurance athletes in particular, also people with psychiatric conditions occasionally)</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm too lazy to get more sources right now, but for the nutrients in particular you can go down the rabbit hole and look at Examine. There is a few trials (both open and RCT) regarding the multivitamin supplementation and prison populations on pubmed. There's also some on omega 3 regarding antisocial behaviour, as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do not know of very many studies on multivitamin intake on the malnourished. There is this one:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20142823" target="_blank">Effects of multivitamin and mineral supplementation on adiposity, energy expenditure and lipid profiles in obese Chinese women.</a></p>
<p>Which showed that these obese women lost 7 lbs of body fat over six months compared to a placebo. Their resting metabolism increased and their cholesterol profile improved.</p>
<p>Obesity researcher Stephan Guyenet had to say about that study, &quot;<a href="http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.ca/2010/06/low-micronutrient-intake-may-contribute.html" target="_blank">it has not been a general finding that micronutrient supplementation causes fat loss, and the result needs to be repeated to be believable in my opinion.</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>If the results of that study were proven to be true, you could say &quot;multivitamins make those with a poor diet healthier&quot;, but it would still be a far cry from optimal health or a balanced diet. With poor absorption rates, many micronutrients not in bioavailable forms, missing essential co-factors, it's hard to imagine someone regaining more than a small percentage of their optimal health back. Add in the studies cited by others here that multivitamin supplementation appears to do nothing for the average person and studies on supplementing with specific vitamins even showing a decrease in health, I would be surprised to see a 10% overall increase in health from a person of poor nutrition taking multivitmains, and probably a realistic number would be closer to 1 or 2%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
