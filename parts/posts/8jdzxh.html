The thing you have the most control over is the technique which you employ to memorize details. However, genetics can play a role in this. This <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3889822/" target="_blank">study</a> suggests that hippocampus size, the part of your brain responsible for storing memory, can have a direct relationship with short and long term retention. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, OP. First time actually responding to an r/askscience request. I'm  surprised there hasn't been a more thorough response yet about the neurobiological basis of memory. Disclaimer: No doctorate, I'm finishing up my Bachelor's in cognitive neuroscience next month before running off to grad school. My research is mostly on language, semantic memory, and phonological information processing. Anyway, here's my best attempt at explaining the cell neurobiology of it:</p>
<p>Memory is more than just genetics you're born with. I'm not sure how much you already know about memory, OP, but when we recall any bit of information we are reconstructing sensory information in our brains and experiencing the same sort of sensory content we have stored in one way or another. It's also important to note the distinction between different forms of memory; for example, episodic (e.g., recalling specific moments and episodes), or short term (e.g., the brief moment the color red is in your vision and processed). One way is through strengthening neural networks. Genetics is not the end all be all in neural activity, epigenetics is a thing. Its one of the reasons we aren't carbon copies of our parents. Typically though, when specific sensory information continuously fires down certain sensory pathways and through the hippocampus (for episodic memory), neurotransmitters (specifically glutamate) are constantly binding to AMPA and NMDA receptors. Its believed that NMDA receptors plays a huge role in long term potentiation (LPP), or the long lasting strengthening of neural circuits which is widely believed to be responsible for the ability to learn.</p>
<p>Typically a neuron will fire and pass along its electrical signal to the next neuron(s) it is connected to when enough stimulation is received in the form neurotransmitters. NMDA receptors are somewhat unique in that they are both a ligand-gated channel and a voltage-gated channel. In other words, they require both an alteration in the voltage across the neuron's membrane, as well as a neurotransmitter (still glutamate). When NMDA receptors are continuously triggered, certain proteins and enzymes in the cell eventually start placing additional NMDA and AMPA receptors along the cell membrane. In other words, continuous firing of neurons make the neuron more sensitive to future signals (Hence, Hebb's famous saying: &quot;Neurons that fire together, wire together.&quot; This can also eventually cause a particular protein or enzyme (I'm blanking on the name) to actually transcribe changes in the neuron's DNA to produce even more receptors. Hence, what I mean by born genetics not being the end all be all.</p>
<p>So, now that we have neurons firing at each other, whose connections are more sensitive due to additional receptors making them more prone to passing along information, brain regions responsible for the sensations that constitute a memory are now more easily able to be triggered when receiving particular stimulus. For example, you hear a car crunch (say someone down the street rear ends someone), if you have been in many car accidents, you may recall those feelings of panic, frustrations, and images associated with it. This is especially true for fear, or other emotionally-laden memories. Try thinking of a memory, OP, where you felt very strong emotions. It's a lot easier to recall than a memory of you just routinely commuting to work/school. This is because the amygdala is also in play here. That's a whole 'nother bucket though, so I'll stop there.</p>
<p>In essence, some people have better memories partially by genetics, partially by continuous practice and conscious thought of particular sensation/stimulus, and especially because they have established an association with information and made it emotionally laden. Other more psychological studies have shown that when we associate information with ourselves or something absurd (i.e., I need to remember to pick up some milk after work, so I start thinking about a scene where I'm being doused by milk) we tend to remember it better. Probably something to do with evolutionary psych. This activates stronger pathways already in place, making it easier to remember. And of course, continuously doing this or consciously thinking about something to recall will make remembering easier as your neurons continuously fires at each other habitually. It's something you have to actively work on if you have bad memory.</p>
<p>Okay I'm exhausted now and should really get back to studying for my anatomy midterm. Sorry for being a little all over the place. Hope this helped OP!</p>

<p>A lot of my reference material for is from lectures, so these are a few of the many original source materials. Can't find some of the older material from my cell neurobio course, so this is the best I can do for direct sources especially since the topic is very broad and general. Let me know if there was something specific you needed!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Your brain tries generally to get rid of unnecessary information and tends to work very well in situations where high levels of emotional stimuli which is why eye witnesses testimony is so unreliable. But, in rare cases, people with photographic memory have brains that don't relinquish frivolous details and just have a ton of used up space in the brain. I'm not aware that its necessarily bad as I've never heard a case where its affected people negatively, but its generally considered counter to the way our brains organize and store data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
