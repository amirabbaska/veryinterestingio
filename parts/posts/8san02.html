<p>I'd also add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_dust" target="_blank">spinning dust</a> to that list; those are nanometre sized interstellar dust grains that spin at microwave frequencies of 10-60GHz with a peak at 20GHz.  They rotate billions of times a second, but since they're only billionths of a metre across the linear velocity at the edge is only 63m/s for a 1nm dust grain spinning at 20GHz.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Or at least part of it.
Had to do some research at my uni and it was on this as they had broken the record and I needed to review their article and give a presentation on it.
The fastest spinning object is an insulating sphere of a material that has a different refractive index (how much light bends going through it) depending on the direction of the beam, suspended in a cylindrically polarised beam of light (the polarisation of the light changing direction like a single spoke on a wheel) causing the object to spin.
The reached 10,000,000 revolutions per second! And that was with the note they could do faster if they spent more time working on it.
It's the fastest revolutions I could find of anything in the known universe and I spent a while searching.
Here's the article
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-23861397" target="_blank">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-23861397</a></p>
<p>Fastest natural thing I'm less sure of but I thought it was a neutron star which clocks in at around 712 revolutions a second</p>
<p>Can see they smashed it

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a ballpark calculation for the limits on man-made things:</p>
<p>Engineering materials range in properties by orders of magnitude, but lets just consider a material like aluminum with a tensile strength of 300MPa, a density of 3000 kg/m^3 , and a poisson's ratio of 0.3. The peak tensile stress in a rotating disk is given by</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amesweb.info/StructuralAnalysisBeams/Stresses-Rotating-Rings.aspx" target="_blank">(3+v)ρ(rω)²/4</a></p>
<p>Plugging in the numbers gives a maximum value for rω of around 350 meter-radians-per-second. So for a disc with a radius of 1 meter, that means a maximum speed of ~350 radians per second (~3300 RPM). While you can increase the angular velocity by going to smaller radius, a disk will still be limited in the velocity of the outward edge to this value around 350 meter-radians-per-second. You could probably push that by another factor of 3 using really high-end composite materials  (since it's proportional to the square-root of specific strength). In principle you could push it arbitrarily high by using geometries other than a disc (for instance, a symmetrical <a href="http://fchart.com/ees/heat_transfer_library/fin_efficiency/hs220.htm" target="_blank">concave cone</a>) but I can't see why you would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, I’m sure it isn’t the absolute fastest, but I’ve always found automotive turbos really amazing. They spin at up to and over 200,000 RPM, and this isn’t something the size of a grain of dust, it’s a sizable impeller you can hold in your hand. That’s more than 3,000 revolutions per second! Also adding to the coolness is that these aren’t billion dollar scientific instruments at like CERN, it’s literally under the hood of your average Ford Fiesta.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
