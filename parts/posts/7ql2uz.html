		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Defibrillators were first demonstrated in 1899 by Jean-Louis Prévost and Frédéric Batelli, two physiologists from University of Geneva, Switzerland. They discovered that small electrical shocks could induce ventricular fibrillation in dogs, and that larger charges would reverse the condition. </p>
<p>Basically they tested it on dogs before human use. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have no sources for this but you will find that a lot of medical advances were discovered by experimenting on animals. Probably started small until they got up to the size of a cow. While Defibrillators are used in life saving scenarios they can also be used to normalize a heart suffering from less lethal arrhythmia like Atrial Fibrillation. AFib can be painful and make a person feel terrible but other than throwing a clot it isn't usually lethal. It can persistent for days, week, or last a life time. A shock from the defibrillator can restore the patient back to sinus rhythm. Assuming animals can get the same condition it could build a path to animal to human trials.</p>
<p>Or someone saw it worked on animals and used it as a last ditch effort. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most automatic defibrillators respond to a specific electrical rhythm of the heart.  That rhythm (ventricular fibrillation) which in plain language can be described as uncoordinated electrical activity of the heart and visualized as an horizontal chaotic sharp zigzag line with different height of peaks. Because this rhythm is so specific it is easily recognizable and because there is never a pulse (heart beat) with that rhythm, algorithm upon realization that heart is in vfib will deliver a shock. Now in order to test if the machine will fire you can use electrical simulation to see if the defiblirator will deliver shock or induce vfib using drugs (medication) in animals. </p>
<p>Now there is also another rhythm called ventricular tachycardia. It is sort of organized and smoother than vfib kind of like drawing waves with rounded peaks instead of sharp lines.Problem is that with vtach you can have a pulse and even be awake as well as not having a pulse and being in cardiac arrest. Problem with shocking a conscious person is that additional precautions should be taken and sometimes medicine may be chosen to do a conversion (amiodorone).  Depending on a flavor of the year (which aha study is favored at the time) or institution that has a defibrillator on premises algorithm that recognizes hearth rhythm may be updated to recognize vtach as well and logic behind it is that even if person is alive but unconscious correcting the rhythm is more important as without correction chances are person will die. Also even thou they are alive vtach caused enough damage to perfusion that person became unconscious and requires more invasive intervention. They also hope that if you have a sitting and talking person you will not be applying an AED to them.</p>
<p>Manual defibrillator like the one you see in the latest emergency series where doctors put paddles on patients chest, yell clear,  shock them, than jump on patient chest yelling &quot;nobody dies on my watch&quot; and finally end up marrying their patient are just machine that delivers the electricity based on your command. It's up to you to have a patient hooked up to an EKG machine and recognize the rhythm visually and deliver the shock when everyone is ready. In certain rhythms defibliration called cardioversion has to be synced meaning that shock has to come at the specific time. To do that you place the paddles on persons chest, press the shock button and hold the paddles until they sync with the rhythm and fire. Paddles are thing of the past and things being used now are pads that are applied to pt chest and stay there. </p>
<p>Since in pretty busy ED certain rhythms are more common than others and waiting for a rhythms that would be suitable for testing defibrillators would be time consuming like I mentioned before animal hearts were used. Specific rhythm was induced either with medication or using low voltage electrical impulses. Now when you defibrillate or cardiovert somebody you are hoping to correct the rhythm by &quot;resetting&quot; the &quot;bad&quot; heart rhythm and hope that when it restarts it will be normal or at least better than before. Early defibrillation saves lives especially in vfib arrests.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been coronary care units for a long time now. EKG machines are really ECG machines, electrocardiograph machines. The K comes from German where a lot of work is done. In other words a lot of work has been done many places. Animals were used to test theories. When it wa seen that interventions could prolong lives they were implemented.</p>
<p>The signs of defib are clear and can be recorded. Without intervention death occurs so a working technique was quickly adopted. Intervention was possible and done in CCUs for a long time before the automatic machine was made available.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
