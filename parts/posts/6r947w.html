		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are able to distinguish their own individual 'calls', even in noisy environments. They can only use their own call for echolocation, because the bat itself needs to be the source of sound for echolocation to work.</p>
<p>Moreover, bats can only keep track of one call at a time. If they make a new call, they stop listening for their previous one.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Furthermore, bats aren't blind nor do they have poor eyesight. This allows them, in lighted environments to not use their echolocation and merely eat as per usual. You can see this if you have bats near street lights and listen. This wasn't really much about your question, just adding more information on top of what has already been said. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carlsbad Caverns said on one of their bat flight shows that the bats actually memorize their way out of a cave and don't rely on echolocation for the most part. They use it mainly on their first few flights but after that know the cave better than you know your daily route home. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
