			<a href="/posts/3gky7w" onclick="return false">Nuclear fusion reactors use supermagnets to suspend plasma and prevent it from damaging the containment structure. However, fusion also produces neutrons as part of the reaction, which have a net charge of 0. What steps have scientists taken to mitigate the damage from these high-energy neutrons?</a>
