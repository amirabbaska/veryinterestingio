			<a href="/posts/3gky7w" onclick="return false">Nuclear fusion reactors use supermagnets to suspend plasma and prevent it from damaging the containment structure. However, fusion also produces neutrons as part of the reaction, which have a net charge of 0. What steps have scientists taken to mitigate the damage from these high-energy neutrons?</a>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does cause a great deal of damage, and developing materials capable of withstanding high energy neutron bombardment of a period of years without dramatic changes to material properties (eg thermal conductivity) is one of the biggest problems in fusion research. For Deuterium Tritium fusion, the 14MeV neutrons create cascades of damage to the material crystal structure, some of this repairs itself through thermal motion, but some remains permanently. As this builds up over time parts will have to be replaced. The neutrons also cause transmutation of elements in structural materials, forming radioactive isotopes, which creates problems for component replacement and decommissioning. The lifetime of these components will be crucial in determining the fraction of time the reactor is actually generating electricity, and the cost of that electricity.</p>
<p>To combat transmutation the steels used (such a EUROFER 97) are designed so that radioactive elements that appear are relatively short lived. I don't believe there are currently definite solutions for neutron damage itself, but clever ideas such as high entropy alloys are being considered. Material testing for high 14MeV neutrons is currently difficult as there are no neutron sources which can be used to achieve the expected or equivalent neutron fluence in a reasonable length of time, though there are plans for a materials testing facility IFMIF.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers here give excellent detail on neutron damage, but I just want to add some information on why we <em>need</em> the neutrons (at least in current reactor designs) and how we make them work for us.</p>
<p>If we want to generate electricity, we have to capture some of the energy that is released from the fusion reaction - and the way we do that is by using the neutrons. In this sense, the fact that the neutrons have no charge (and so are not confined by the magnetic field) is very convenient because they carry 80% of the energy that is released in the fusion reaction - so that is 80% that we have relatively easy access to.</p>
<p>There are two key things the neutrons do for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We have them give up their energy in some layer of material around the reactor as they slow down, causing that layer to heat up. We then use that energy to heat water, make steam, drive turbines ect.</p>
</li>
<li>We need them to interact with Lithium in order to produce Tritium, which is one of the fuels (the fusion reaction is deuterium-tritium). Tritium is not naturally occurring as it decays with a Half-life of 12 years, so the only way for us to get it is to make it through nuclear reactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current designs for fusion reactors seek to combine both of these requirements into one piece of engineering called a 'blanket'. The blanket is a hollow layer which surrounds the entire reactor and is filled with Lithium (and possibly other things) which may be in solid or liquid form.</p>
<p>The idea is that the neutrons will interact with the Lithium layer, causing it to heat up as well as producing the tritium we need. While this is going on, a coolant of some form is continuously flowing through the blanket layer, transporting this heat out of the reactor so we can use it for electricity generation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This topic is a very significant challenge that the nuclear materials community is facing. My Ph.D. research is on studying the damage tolerance of structural materials that are being considered for use in fusion and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_wave_reactor" target="_blank">travelling wave reactor</a>. These reactors are going to experience doses in excess of hundreds of dpa. Dpa stands for &quot;displacement per atom,&quot; which refers to how many times an atom is displaced from its lattice site. So a dose of 1 dpa essentially means that, on average, each atom in the material has been displaced from its site one time. These reactor materials are going to see hundreds of dpa over the course of their lifetime.</p>
<p>But how can we damage test these materials to such high doses without having to build a test reactor and run an experiment for years? To accelerate the process, and achieve a higher damage rate, ion beams are being used as a surrogate to neutrons. Ions can create similar atom displacements to neutrons within the material and thus similar microstructural changes (such as void formation and swelling, and precipitation of new phases).</p>
<p>Now, there is a lot of debate in the community about how well ions can actually mimic neutron damage, but recent work has shown that it actually works pretty well. Special care needs to be taken into account on the differences in ion damage vs neutron damage (such as the much lower depth of penetration of ions, and
the lack of transmutation reactions). But a lot of this challenges have actually been accounted for with creative experimental procedures--like using dual ion beams (one to produce damage and the other to mimic the production of Helium).</p>
<p>This is an exciting field, but much more work is required in testing and validating structural materials for these high dose applications.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>yeah I've followed the progress at ITER and basically they have the world's best material physicists working on creating walls that will sit and absorb the bombardment. Regardless, you're creating a very small star, so the cost of running it won't be 0 like people think. It's going to cost a tremendous amount, and eventually they will have to shut it down and replace the neutron bombardment walls. The goal is to get walls that will survive ~10 years so they can keep it running for a long time (obviously re-starting it will be difficult)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
