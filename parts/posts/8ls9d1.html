		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By &quot;pigeons&quot;, you mean feral pigeons: these are pigeons that were kept and raised by humans as racing pigeons or even pets, and escaped or never came home; and their descendants. When they went feral, they tended to live in cities: they weren't afraid of humans, and the tall buildings were naturally attractive to them as they were bred from rock doves which nest on cliff-faces. Since their young grow up in that environment, they are similarly not afraid of humans: humans are just these creatures that they see all the time and which usually ignore them -- some of them even throw some food their way.</p>
<p>Sparrows that grow up in cities can also lose their fear of humans: even ones that grow up in small towns can become quite cheeky. In some cities, you actually have to be careful where you tread, because you're seriously in danger of stepping on a sparrow.</p>
<p>Even in the country wild birds can become very familiar with humans. I live in central Europe, and blue tits and great tits (don't laugh, they really are called that) are regular garden visitors. Although they'll take flight if a human suddenly appears, a few of them return immediately and feel perfectly safe feeding mere feet or even inches away.</p>
<p>European robins (a completely different species to the various species of robin native to North America) are an interesting case. On the European continent they were once actually hunted, but in Britain hunting robins was discouraged because they eat garden pests. Thanks to that, British robins are rather less shy than robins on the continent, and will frequently perch somewhere where somebody is digging in the garden, ready to swoop down if he unearths some tasty treat.</p>
<p>And if you're really very patient and a bit lucky, you can get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAP_-X011wI" target="_blank">some of these birds</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxdxf-RnzGE" target="_blank">eat out of your hand</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sparrows and robins are prey animals even in the suburbs, so they're a bit skittish if you get too close.  They're heavily hunted by predatory birds and a few straggler land predators like cats and coyotes that have managed to persist in human occupied areas.</p>
<p>They're definitely <em>not</em> very afraid of humans though, they'll approach pretty close if you have food and have no issue with building nests and raisng hatchlings five feet from your den.</p>
<p>Pigeons (specifically the rock doves that successfully nest in bridges and skyscrapers) once had the same predatory pressure, but their great success in our predator-free major cities has made them more fearless over the generations.</p>
<p>Their close suburban relative the mourning dove is a favorite snack among hawks and isn't so brave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in Galway, Ireland and most of the birds there aren't afraid of humans. Crowe's, Pigeon's, Seagulls. Even one of my favourite coffee shops called The Secret Garden have 2 Robbin' s that live in the seating area out the back and regularly land on your table. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I often feed and interact with wild birds so I can answer this.</p>
<p>European Robins don't have much of a fear of humans, they are wary of humans, but if you talk or sing to them nicely they will come to you, they are very clever and can learn to trust individual humans. </p>
<p>Pigeons are panicky birds but get use to humans if fed often, they are very much group birds and do what the other pigeons do. They can make a whistling noise with their wings to signal panic, if one pigeon panics and makes the sound the group will usually flee without question.</p>
<p>The Pigeons in the city get use to humans but will still evaluate your behaviour, they can learn to recognise hostile and friendly actions as well as humans that they know by sight. Because they are a big group bird they evaluate individuals more than the paired birds do.</p>
<p>Birds like European Magpies and small song birds are terrified of humans because people would capture them to eat them(Magpie) or to hear them sing(songbirds).</p>
<p>The birds who survived to witness others being captured taught their offspring to fear humans, this eventually became a trait in the birds and now these birds are all naturally very afraid of humans.</p>
<p>Individual birds though have different personalities, I've had a wild magpie say hello and I've sang a duet with a blackbird, so as a species they are different, groups can be different and so can individuals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
