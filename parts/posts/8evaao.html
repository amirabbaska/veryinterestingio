<p>I went to a show last night where the main act played from 8:15 to 9:30 and I thought that was so much better. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long time lurker, rarely a caller, but I know the answer to this question. I’m a concert promoter and have done thousands of shows over many years in the business.</p>
<p>As with many questions that include the word “generally,” the answer is complicated and includes several “correct” answers and the answer isn’t always the same tour to tour, show to show, or city to city, but the below is my best explanation of why concerts are timed as they are “generally.”</p>
<p>Lots of people think that as soon they purchase a ticket that the promoter, venue, and artist are done trying to get money from them. This is far from the case. As soon as you walk in the venue, you will be inundated with opportunities to spend more money, which are each an ancillary revenue stream for one (or more) of the promoter/venue/artist. When you walk into a show (or even before you enter the venue) you should have the opportunity to buy: Alcohol (no surprise this is the biggest one by FAR), artist merch, venue merch, reserved seating, table service, meet and greets, special/valet parking, access to’VIP’ areas, lawn chairs, ponchos, food, tickets to upcoming shows, etc. Once you start seeing a concert in this perspective, you start seeing that the best way to have the most profitable show possible is to keep people in the venue as long as possible. Thus, you open doors as early as reasonably possible (after the working day is done so people can get there, and after production has had a chance to set everything up) and put on your headliner as late reasonably possible (add more support acts, lengthen changeovers, but have to do it within he bounds of local regulations and sound ordinances, as well as what you think “the market will bear”).</p>
<p>This is not to say the other answers are wrong. Setting up concerts does take a long time, and artists are “generally” night owls, but the core is making a profitable show, and we work around those constraints as best possible to make money.</p>
<p>Sorry to be crass. It’s called show business.</p>
<p>TL;DR: to make money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of times the concert doesn't actually start later than they planned, but later than they advertised. If you ask the venue what time the show is scheduled to actually start and finish they will often tell you the real time (and be right!)</p>
<p>EDIT: classical music concerts start later than advertised to minimize disruptions. People are generally poor at time management.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>We try <em>very</em> hard to make sure shows start at their advertised time. We will typically hold a show 10-15 minutes if the majority of pre-sale tickets haven't come through the door.</p>
<p>If a show starts more than 20 minutes late then:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The artist is in their dressing room demanding a masseuse and more drugs (I have seen this happen)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The artist isn't finished drawing dicks on every available surface (I have seen this happen)</p>
</li>
<li>The artist doesn't feel obligated to start on time (I have seen this happen way too many times)</li>
</ul>
<p>TL:DR If the show starts more than 20 minutes after the advertised time - the artist is an asshole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
