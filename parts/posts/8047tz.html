		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TP rolls are not sterile. We do heat the paper to extreme temps while being made on the paper machine but they are sometimes not converted for a few days. </p>
<p>Once it goes through the converting process it is cased and send to the warehouse.  It can sometimes be there for a week before it’s sent to the store for purchase.  </p>
<p>You can see there are multiple ways that contamination can happen.  However.  I can tell you that in my particular mill it is kept VERY clean.  Housekeeping, safety, and quality  are the top priorities.</p>
<p>If all machines run correctly and we have no stoppages the paper should go from pulp to case to consumer without ever being touched by human hands. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern paper manufacturing processes use heated rollers (filled with steam) to quickly dry paper and keep the assembly line moving.  The sterilization is an unintended byproduct of this process that they're passing off as a selling point; it's basically equivalent to putting a &quot;Gluten Free!&quot; sticker on a steak.</p>
<p>As for how the paper doesn't burn, it's simple.  Paper catches fire at ~420-475 degrees fahrenheit (depending on the kind of paper), and water boils at 212 degrees fahrenheit, leaving you a 208-degree safe zone where water will boil but paper won't burn.  Just sterilizing takes even less heat; 161 degrees for 15 seconds will do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is like to add onto your question. Ive never seen tp rolls say they are sterilized but wouldn’t they become in-sterilized once you took them out of the wrapper and hung it in the wall? It’s sitting next to a flushing toilet so there’s no way it can keep sterile right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
