<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Can someone please explain why I had a sturdy plastic bucket literally explode into fragments when I mixed 2 different brands of pool chlorine together? I've never seen something explode like that when exposed to open air.</p>
<p>So what I would normally do is mix the chlorine with pool water and then pour everything into the pool, no problem.</p>
<p>One day we switched chlorine brands, so I poured the last little bit of the original chlorine into the bucket (there might have been a little water in the bucket to begin with) and topped up with the new chlorine. I noticed vapor coming off the mixture almost immediately as I started mixing. The reaction started bubbling and boiling and within about 10 seconds, the mixture started putting out a thick yellow cloud. This was when I knew I had to GTFO, mainly to avoid breathing in any of the noxious fumes. I can't quite remember if I was going to call someone or to get water to dilute the mixture.</p>
<p>I turned around and started walking and as I turned a corner about 5 meters away from where the bucket was left standing, I heard an incredibly loud bang and saw pieces of the red bucket fly past me and land in the pool and on the lawn over 10 meters away. There was literally nothing left at ground zero other than a few white stains from the powder. It was a really powerful explosion.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This happened quite some years ago when I used to look after the pool at home, so the details may be a bit sketchy. I've always thought about that incident, what if I hadn't moved away? I could have been permanently blinded, or developed some kind of respiratory issue, possibly even hearing damage?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>P.S. the brands were HTH and Clarity in that order (i think)</p>
<p>There was no outside contamination that I know of.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the replies and explanations so far. I'm glad I'm not the only one surprised/confused by this. Just a couple things, This <em>was</em> a long time ago like I said, so it might not have bubbled for 10 seconds, the gas might have been green instead of yellow, etc. All I know for sure is that it was loud, it started raining red plastic bits, there was definitely no lid on the bucket and that there were 2 brands of chlorine in a bucket.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to the MSDS of <a href="http://fileserve.newporthigh.co.uk/Manuals/Volume%207%20of%208/Buckingham%20Pools/16.%20HtH%20Calcium%20Hypochlorite%20tablets.pdf" target="_blank">HTH</a>, the source of chlorine for the disinfectant is calcium hypochlorite. It also contains some calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate to keep the pH above 7 which prevents the creation and release of poisonous chlorine gas. I couldn't find any information on Clarity as a pool disinfectant. However, it is likely that the Clarity brand contained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichloroisocyanuric_acid" target="_blank">Dichlor</a> which is an acid based pool disinfectant (pKa = \~6 for the non-chlorinated isocyanuric acid - dicloroisocyanuric acid will definitely be much more acidic). Mixing the acid pool disinfectant with the calcium hypochlorite produced green chlorine gas, which you observed, and a lot of heat.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT 1: Are you sure Clarity is specifically a pool disinfectant? I did some more digging and found a general peroxide disinfectant called <a href="http://www.peroxychem.com/chemistries/peracetic-acid/products/clarity" target="_blank">Clarity</a>. Peroxides also react with hypochlorites to generate heat but oxygen gas instead. This also removes the chlorine source giving dissolved chloride. I'm now unsure how the chlorine gas (which it what you seem to describe) is produced.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Clarity is most likely trichlor or dichlor which produces chlorine gas and a lot of heat when mixed with hypochlorites. This seems to be a very explosive reaction. see this <a href="https://www.chemaxx.com/pool_chemical_explosion5.htm" target="_blank">video</a> posted by u/Vew below.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_trichloride" target="_blank">trichloramine</a>.  It is an oil that will sink to the bottom of the bucket.  It is a primary explosive that when shocked or heated will detonate violently (the person who discovered it lost some fingers on his hand).</p>
<p>The~~ <a href="https://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/9131" target="_blank">TRICHLORO-S-TRIAZINETRIONE </a> oops~~  <a href="http://phoenixproductsco.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sodium-Dichlor-0030.pdf" target="_blank">Dichlor</a> in one mixture was acidified and as you can read from that link that acidification produces trichloramine.  Other commentators have noted the source of the acid.  You made it even more efficient as you added more sources of chlorine which increase the yield of the NCl3 production.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
