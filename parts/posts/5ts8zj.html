		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you look at the landscape of the United Kingdom today, the vast majority of it consists of either towns or farmland. The human race has left an enormous impression on what Britain looks like, perhaps more so than most other nations on Earth.</p>
<p>What would Britain have looked like during, say, the middle Paleolithic? Or at least before the development of agriculture. I've always imagined it to be heavily forested, perhaps resembling rural Canada or Scandinavia today. But I have no real knowledge on this subject - is my view in any way accurate? Or is there even any way of knowing for sure? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually an area of ongoing debate. In the past, it has generally been assumed that Britain was largely covered by forest - primarily because forest is seen as the inevitable result of succession given the ecological conditions in Britain. Note that in most of Britain this climax community is temperate broadleaf or mixed woodland, where as your vision of Canada and Scandanvia might well be of boreal coniferous forest.</p>
<p>However, in 2000 Frans Vera published a book called &quot;Grazing ecology and forest history&quot; which suggested that prior to human arrival and dominance, large grazing herbivores (e.g. aurochs, the extinct ancestors of domestic cattle) would have had a strong effect on the landscape by browsing on trees and shrubs and hence preventing succession from occuring. This, coupled with other disturbance forces such as wildfires, storms, diseases and pests, and floods, with have lead to a relatively open park-like mosaic of wood and grassland. One question that this hypothesis answers is: where did all the open-country species live? Many species in Britain (noteable many butterflies and wildflowers) are strongly associated with open landscapes and direct sunlight, and would not be found in continuous woodland.</p>
<p>So, how can we find out? One of the most common techniques is to analyse long term sediment cores from lakes. Pollen is trapped in the sediment, and changes in the presence and relative abundance of different species' pollen can indicate changing plant communities. Furthermore, sediment also contain fungal spores; certain spores are associated with herbivore dung, and therefore the abundance of these spores can be used as an indicator of the abundance of herbivores and hence infer the grazing pressure. Another technique is to use ecological inferrence - we can use exclosure or introduction experiments to try and understand the impact that the presence or abscence of large mammals would have had on the vegetation, and then try and estimate which situation is most applicable to Britain.</p>
<p>However, part of the reason that this debate is still ongoing is that the arrival of humans into Northern Europe coincided with the end of most recent glacial period; as such the impact of human arrival is confounded with changing climatic conditions and natural recolonisation of species into previously ice-covered areas.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Britain was mostly forests and marshes. In fact, nearly the entire eastern coast of England was marshland and the coastline itself actually looked quite a bit different before the Romans (and later Saxons) came and cleared all the marshes. Ireland was mostly bogs and oak/hazel forests. Most of the forests were cleared for farmland or timber, much of which was used to build and maintain ships for the Royal Navy during the English settlement/occupation (like what happened in England). And the bogs were (and continue to be) cut for turf to be used as fuel. Ireland has even fewer &quot;natural&quot; forests left than Britain. Apart from some very small national parks, most of the forests in Ireland today are made up of non-native coniferous trees mainly used for timber.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ecologist here. Some answers are good, but I'd chime in that the most probable answer would come from matching climate classifications and biome distribution patterns with Gulf Stream-corrected latitude. Because of the UKs position on a northern hemisphere west coast at sub-boreal maritime-influenced latitudes, I'd probably pin it as looking like puget sound or Vancouver island. The Southern Hemisphere equivalent would be Southern chile, or maybe Tasmania. </p>
<p>I don't think megafauna would be a very significant contributor to ecosystem structure - ice age retreat lets forests grow back, and megafauna don't do so hot there, especially in conifer dominated sustems. They can structure ecosystems, sure, but to an extent that's still largely influenced by climate (cf. woods bison vs. Great Plains bison, or African vs asiatic elephant).</p>
<p>BUT - much of ecology, especially biogeography, is essentially chaotic. That's part of the trouble with predicting what's going to happen under climate change - this is a pretty novel set of initial conditions for a trajectory we don't know much about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
