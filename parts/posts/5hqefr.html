<p><strong>Tl;dr:</strong> Once the clock-hands (wheels) rotate faster than our eyes can process, they appear to move backwards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is called the wagon wheel effect where a wheel appears to be rotating opposing the direction it is actually rotating. This happens because the image is sampled too slow. Too slow is if it is sampled less than twice the rotational speed (nyquist rate). In the example provided by u/Lux_Obscura, after scenario 2 the wheel appears to slow down until it reaches the sampling rate where it appears to be standing still.</p>
<p>This does not happen because the eyes sample the world. It either occurs when watching a video of a wheel or if there is a strobing effect in real life. In a video, the sampling rate is determined by the camera between 24 times per second (hertz) and 240 hertz for modern phones and cameras. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's assume you already know about another ELI5 for &quot;how do movies move when they're actually lots of tiny pictures.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;backwards wheel&quot; happens when the pictures you see look &quot;closer&quot; to a slow reverse than a very fast &quot;forward&quot; because it's moving so fast that there aren't enough &quot;in-between&quot; pictures.</p>
<p>Now, when using your <em>own eyes</em> to see things directly, you'll usually see blurs instead of this illusion, because (unlike a video-camera) your eyes are always flicking around and combining a constant stream of information. </p>
<p>So the reverse illusion usually happens when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're seeing a video, and the video-camera was taking whole pictures at a certain rate</li>
<li>You're seeing it yourself, but under a flickering light (which you might not always notice) so that certain <em>times</em> are leaving a larger impression</li>
<li>You're seeing it while your eyes are vibrating (e.g. riding in a car) so that your eyes are getting more information during tiny moments of stillness</li>
</ul></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's caused by the AC power making street lights have a strobe effect. When that strobing light hits the spinning wheel, the uneven frequency of the light versus the speed at which the wheel is spinning makes it appear to start spinning backwards. That's why you only see it at night. If you shined a flashlight on a spinning wheel, you wouldn't see this because it's a constant current with no strobe. This same effect can be observed when a spinning wheel is videoed, since video is really just strobing sequences of images.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
