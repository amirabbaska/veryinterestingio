<p>And another question: when our modern calendar was invented, how on earth did THEY know how long a year was?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few ways. Today we can do it by measuring distant stars parallax that changes slightly as we make a circle around the sun. We can look at other plants since we know their orbits and speeds.</p>
<p>Finally, we can do what ancient people did, look at a pattern the sun makes in the sky. Each week exactly at the same time it's in a slightly different place in the sky. If you take a photo each week and combine them, you will get an 8 figure pattern. The sun returns to a starting position after a year.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can, for example, measure how long each day is (from sunrise to sunset) or how high the sun gets in the sky at noon and then count the number of days between when the day is longest or the sun is highest and when it is longest/highest again. This will get you very close to the true value. To get more accurate it gets complicated because Earth's orbit isn't actually a closed loop, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82p-DYgGFjI" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
