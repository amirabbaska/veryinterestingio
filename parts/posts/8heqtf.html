		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Genetics determine appearance. If you have a group of people who all have a similar genetic pattern it stands to reason that they would display similar characteristics. Genes present within the 21st chromosome result in a person with trisomy of that chromosome (third copy) having those physical traits. It's not just the facial traits either, Downs also causes a much higher rate of congenital heart defects. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure how, but the chromosomal trisomy somehow affects either the differentiation or migration of neural crest cells.
These then generate a number of structures troughout the body, but mainly nervious tissue (they are vital for development of the brain), pharingeal arches (which derivate into jaw; incus, malleus and stapes;  hyoid apparatus) and several skull bones and cartilage (yes, this inclues facial bones and cart, giving their distinctive facial featuees).
Additionally, neural crest cells also originate a heart valve (dont remember which) which tends to develop abnormally in downs syndrom patients and is partly why they seem to have more heart problems than usual.</p>
<p>TlDR: abnormal neural crest cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an aspect of the condition. The extra copy of chromosome 21 or parts of it in the people with down syndrome results in significant changes to body and mental growth and function, because its directly changing the way their DNA goes about creating and directing all the parts of putting someone together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
