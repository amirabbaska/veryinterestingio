<p>EDIT: Thanks for the answers. Pretty sure I understand the link now.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Interest rate is 40%, not raised by 40%. I'm sure all the answers are still appropriate</p></div></div>

<p>If interest rates go up people get more money for saving it. They then don't spend it. This makes companies sad as less people buy their stuff,so they lower prices to invite them over. This lowers inflation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is called &quot;tight money&quot;.  Inflation and interest rates are inversely proportional to each other in the short term.   If a country's inflation is too high, a central bank will often raise interest rates in an attempt to keep inflation under control.  The tradeoff is that higher interest rates will slow the economy causing unemployment.</p>
<p>Argentina's inflation rate is way too high, though.  Very high inflation is very problematic in the long term because people start to <em>expect</em> the price increases and it they become baked in (they won't necessarily be associated with low unemployment anymore).  Interest rates of 40% are an extremely drastic measure to try and lower inflation down there.  Its no surprise that this interest rate is causing jaw-dropping headlines in the news this week.</p>
<p>A useful example in the United States is the tight money policy that Paul Volcker at the Federal Reserve implemented in the late 70s and early 80s.  The US had high inflation at the time -- over 10% some years.  That inflation had persisted for several years and had become 'baked into' the economy.  It stopped being associated with high growth and low interest rates.  This 70s period of high inflation, high interest rates, and fairly high unemployment was called 'stagflation'.  Anyhow, Volcker implemented 'tight money', raising interest rates up to 20%.  This caused a sharp and drastic recession.  Unemployment went up to 11% as interest rates made it hard to invest in the economy.  Inflation came way down, though.  Then the Fed spend the next several years slowly lowering interest rates while making sure that inflation was not coming back.  This led to the 1980s economic boom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what is said here, high interest rates of say 40% are very very attractive to investors which means a lot of people internationally will be looking to purchase bonds from Argentina and these must be bought in pesos.  Therefore there will be a higher demand for pesos with all the prospective investors and the value of the peso should increase. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some great responses here but not exactly in ELI5 terms, so I'll give it a shot.</p>
<p>When we say that a currency is crashing, we mean it's losing value. In other words, your money today will be able to buy stuff today than tomorrow. This is called inflation. </p>
<p>To illustrate this, imagine having a basket of goods. This basket represents an entire economy's output in a year. This theoretical basket, this year, might cost $100. One year from now, this <em>same</em> basket costs 110, or 10% more than last year. Now let's assume that you made the same amount of money as you did last year. That means that your money can now buy <em>less</em> than it did last year. This is inflation, and Argentina's inflation rate is so high, that the money in their pockets is worth less and less each day. How does this happen? Well, lots of reasons. Mainly, it has to do with how much money is flowing in an economy and how fast. Central banks (the Federal Reserve, or &quot;The Fed&quot; in the US) can, to an extent, take money out or put money into an economy. More money = more spending = higher prices, and vice versa. </p>
<p>But Argentina is messing with interest rates? Why? Remember, more spending = higher prices; less spending = lower prices. So let's think. If interest rates are high, people are more inclined to put their money into savings accounts, because they will be paid interest for keeping their money in the bank. If people are saving more money, then they must be spending less. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if rates are low, people have less incentive to save. Now, perhaps, they have a bigger incentive to take out a loan for a new car or house because loans are more affordable. So, by Argentina raising interest rates, they are now creating a pretty big incentive for people to save their money and minimize their spending. As businesses begin to sell less and less product, they are ultimately forced to lower the prices of their goods so that they can actually stay in business. Higher rates = less spending and lower inflation. </p>
<p>I'm glad to elaborate a bit more if anyone actually reads this and cares enough to ask! I like to think I'm at least a little qualified after tutoring economics for 3 years. There's a ton of other factors at play here but this is my best (and first) attempt at an ELI5. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People often talk about the economy “speeding up” or “slowing down.”  The idea is that when people have lots of money, they spend it more freely.  With more money changing hands and more money in people’s wallets, stores feel free to raise their prices and people think less about their purchases.  </p>
<p>Think about it this way:  If you have $20 to buy food for a day, you will probably buy nice things to eat.  But if you only have $2 to buy a day’s food, you will probably think carefully about how you want to spend it, and you are probably going to be eating Ramen noodles.</p>
<p>So more money = more spending = rising inflation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, less money = less spending = slowing inflation.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for interest rates?  Bank lending and debt is one way governments control how much money is in circulation.  The idea is that if interest rates increase, people will be less interested in borrowing.  If people borrow less, they will have less money, and we already talked about what happens then.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the country’s economy is stagnant and everyone is pinching their pennies, the government might decrease interest rates to make borrowing more attractive, and try to get the economy “sped up” by injecting more cash into the system by offering easy credit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
