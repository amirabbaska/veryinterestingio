		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bacteria that are inside of you will still be the same bacteria that left you (toothbrush) and go back inside you (brushing teeth) again. It stands to reason that if they don't make you sick while they were inside you before, they shouldn't make you sick when they go back inside of you again.</p>
<p>Obviously, the same isn't true if you're using someone else's toothbrush.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are not sterile people. You have many living communities of fungus and bacteria all over and inside of your body. We don't get sick because our immune systems prevent them from spreading out of control and forming an infection. Trust me, there are many bacteria and fungal spores growing in your mouth. </p>
<p>As long as you are healthy this isn't usually a problem. lets say you took antibiotics for a week though. It kills off the bacteria in your mouth, which kept the fungus in check, and you wake up one morning with a thick carpet of thrush growing on your tongue. It's yucky, but in that case the combination of killing the only competition the fungus had, and usually taking steroids like methylprednisone (which suppress your bodies immune response) results in the fungus being able to gain a foot hold in your mouth that's not normally present. </p>
<p>So the simple answer to your question is the bacteria on your tooth brush usually pale in comparison to the active colonies already in your mouth. The different bacteria and fungus in and around your mouth are in constant battle with each other, and with your immune system, and it's a stalemate with none of them gaining a foot hold. So long as you don't get weak, or upset the balance with drugs.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bacteria you scrub off your teeth don't make you sick, they just ruin your teeth. Ingesting them won't do you a whole lot of harm, but like /u/Dirt_E_Harry said, this may well not be the case if you use someone else's brush.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Straight after you finish brushing your teeth the bacteria on the toothbrush are the same as the bacteria in your mouth, so brushing your teeth twice in a row won't make you ill. Bacteria on the toothbrush are adapted to living in the mouth so won't thrive on the toothbrush because it usually dries out and doesn't have much food on it (unless you never rinse it after use which would be kind of gross). This means the toothbrush won't grow enough bacteria to make you ill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
