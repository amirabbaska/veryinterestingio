		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: Oh boy this got big... So I've gone through this and corrected my terminology to better explain myself. </p>
<p>Oh man I did a thesis on this!</p>
<p>Premature labour is in a bad place. No one is really sure what triggers it and medical science as a result can only be reactive, which is far from ideal. The term for the initiation of labour is partuition. </p>
<p>Now this is pretty much controlled by hormones. To condense a lot and keep it simple, the utureus begins to contract rhythmically in the process of partition. But you definitely do not want that happening before it's ready, so uterine contractions are suppressed by the hormonal action of pregnanolone and estradiol. </p>
<p>My study examined the RNA editing of a certain receptor called the GABA^A Receptor (Specifically GABRA3-- the α3 subunit, and even more specifically the GABA^A that is expressed in uterine tissues, which contains the π subunit (GABRP, that is expressed basically nowhere else in appreciatable quantities that I'm aware of) over the course of mouse pregnancy. The study itself was crude (bachelor thesis, can't expect miracles!) but definitely implied that the editing changed definitively over the course of the pregnancy. The edit was present throughout the pregnancy until the final couple stages, where it seemed to vanish or at least dip below the detection of basic PCR. </p>
<p>So our working hypothesis was that RNA editing was at least part of the mechanism that inhibited partuition-- GABA^A has a suppressive role when interacted with (In the brain it inhibits action potentials in neurons but can also inhibit the <em>contraction of smooth muscle</em>) and the edit occured within a portion of the protein that was within the membrane of the cell. So, an edit (or in this case the ceasation of an edit!) could destabilise this receptor, causing it to be taken into the cell faster and lowering the number of receptors that pregnanolone can reach. The result? Less inhibition of uterine contractions. The fact that the edit occurs in the π subunit acts to prevent such deregulation in other GABA^A Receptor rich areas-- the most notable of course being the brain.</p>
<p>Do note that unless further research has been done recently that this is all a hypothesis we came to. Our study was preliminary and a lot more work was needed when I graduated.</p>
<p>The biochemistry and endocrinology of preterm labor is absolutely an area of active research right now. GABA^A Receptors are mostly studied in terms of neuroscience and the π-subunit DOESNT occur in the brain so it frankly gets almost no attention. The fact that it occurs in the uterine walls though is perhaps a big hint. We basically know nothing about what the π-subunit <em>does</em>.</p>
<p>This may be a tiny portion of the biochecmical regulation of labour, but in such situations when you have lots of little changes piling up, big things can happen...</p>
<p>As a side note, the project taught me something else about studies-- people are a lot more likely to pour money into Alzheimer's than a very common issue that few people realise is a medical conundrum. It taught me to REALLY drive home the impact of a disease. The current treatment for preterm birth is either to hope for the best or tocolytic drugs to essentially freeze the birth like sticking a plug up there. They can have utterly horrendous side effects and are becoming more and more frowned upon. Understanding the chemical basis of preterm birth is essential then-- we can only design safer and specific drugs and more importantly a way to detect it occuring early if we understand the mechanism causing the issue.</p>

<p>Unfortunately theres a derth of detailed or even <em>recent</em> study. Fujii there provided a lot of background for my paper.</p>
<p>A point of clarification: the study was more sold as a potential <em>biomarker</em> of preterm labor. Drugs are a lofty goal indeed, but one of the reasons preterm labor is so nasty is that once it's started its already too late. Finding a biochemical change that can be monitored would be a huge boon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There isn't a prefect, defined signal.  There are a lot of things happening at the end of gestation that can cause a baby to come early or late or on time. One of these is the growth and development of the fetus and when things are developed and it's just growing. If i rememeber correctly this is around 37 or 38 weeks. </p>
<p>Another is the placenta, where the nutrients are exchanged between mom and fetus. Around 42 weeks the placenta will start to decline in function because it's done it's job and isn't programmed to last much longer. This is one reason they don't want people to go past 42 weeks. </p>
<p>Mother's health and any chronic conditions also play into it. If she has been having high blood pressure or gestational diabetes that can change when things &quot;go&quot; or how big the fetus gets at certain points in time. This can cause her to carry longer or shorter depending on how her body handles things </p>
<p>There is also moms body being triggered to go into labor when the fetus settles into the pelvis and pushes on the cervix, along with stretching of the lower uterus, etc. Fetus knows when it's ready the majority of the time (Not a conscious &quot;let's do this&quot; but more of a hormone and cell signal type thing) and starts to move into position. </p>
<p>It's really a concert of hormones and receptors and signals that all work together to determine the right time.  Sometimes those things trigger at the wrong time, or something happens to mom and that triggers it (trauma, drugs, disease, poor cervical tone, etc). Sometimes it's the anatomy of mom and her cervix can't hold shut well enough so when there's too much it decides it's labor time, or often this can cause miscarriages earlier in the pregnancy. There are a variety of other things that can cause those as well. </p>
<p>And of course, emergencies can cause mom to need to go into labor or have a c-section earlier than they want because of risk of death to either mom or fetus. I know someone who had a baby at 28 weeks because her blood pressure was dangerously high and she was going blind (preeclampsia). Both of them are great now, but he had to spend a few weeks in the NICU since he was so small. </p>
<p>I hope that helps. There's so many thing but I tried to cover some of the big ones we learned about. If i made a mistake please let me know. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good question.</p>
<p>There is a lot of research going into understanding the biology and genetics of parturition and the simple answer right now is &quot;we don't know&quot;.  </p>
<p>Preterm birth (defined in humans as giving birth before the 37th week of pregnancy) is a particularly important focus of research because it is <em>the</em> leading cause of infant mortality. What we surmise is that preterm birth is a complex problem that seems to have both a strong genetic component (e.g. it appears heritable) and an environmental component (e.g. preterm rates vary between countries). </p>
<p>The genetics of parturition is especially complicated because even in the same mother, every pregnancy involves a novel combination of genes. While the mother's genome (her DNA) remains a constant, the fetus' genome is a 50-50 mix of genes from mom and dad. This is vital point because both the fetus and the mom make a very important organ called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta" target="_blank">placenta</a>.  Because the fetal component of the placenta will contain different sets of genes from pregnancy to pregnancy, and because the genetics of preterm birth are often only focuses on the mother's genotype, it's likely that we are missing a very large fraction of genetic picture.</p>
<p>Likewise, the environmental component is tricky because of multiple confounders, many of them unknown.  For example, here is the <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs363/en/" target="_blank">WHO's list</a> of countries with the highest <del>rates</del> numbers of preterm birth. </p>
<ul>
<li>India: 3 519 100</li>
<li>China: 1 172 300</li>
<li>Nigeria: 773 600</li>
<li>Pakistan: 748 100</li>
<li>Indonesia: 675 700</li>
<li>The United States of America: 517 400</li>
<li>Bangladesh: 424 100</li>
<li>The Philippines: 348 900</li>
<li>The Democratic Republic of the Congo: 341 400</li>
<li>Brazil: 279 300</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that he USA us right in there.  Surprised? In fact, the US has the highest pre-term rate of any industrialized country and no one has a good answer as to why. Some of the biggest predictors seem to be both the prevalence of C-sections in the US and the reduction of inter-pregnancy intervals; both of these independently increase the risk of a preterm birth, and they often occur together in the US. So the implication is that among environmental factors, even our reproductive medicine can interfere long-term with the natural mechanisms of parturition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
