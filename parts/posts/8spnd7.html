		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/Rannasha gives the &quot;proper&quot; answer, but I'm going to add a few twists to this question that can significantly reduce the probability immensely.</p>
<p>The answer u/Rannasha gives makes two assumptions:  one that there is a singular entity that we can call a &quot;perfect order&quot;, and secondly that the &quot;shuffling&quot; is perfectly random.</p>
<p>I'll tackle &quot;perfect order&quot; first.  What is &quot;perfect order&quot;?  If we assume it's the order the cards were in when you first open the box, or that it has a single definition (such that the suits and values have to be of a fixed ordering), then there is only 1 out of 52! ways to achieve a &quot;perfect order&quot;.</p>
<p>But what if we don't care about the order of the suits?  Maybe SPADES, HEARTS, DIAMONDS, CLUBS is just as valid as HEARTS, DIAMONDS, CLUBS, SPADES.  You can reduce the <del>probability</del> permutations by a factor of 24 if the suit order doesn't matter.  And what about the ace?  Is it before the two or after the king?  If it can be either, you can reduce the probability by another factor of 2.  Combine both together, and you've reduced the <del>probability</del> permutations by a factor of 48.  That reduces the <del>probability</del> permutations from 1 in ~8 <em> 10^67 down to ~1.6 </em> 10^66.  That will still take you forever, but it <em>is</em> a slight improvement.</p>
<p>But what if I told you I could <em>guarantee</em> you can do it in only eight shuffles?</p>
<p>&quot;Shuffling&quot; is usually thought of conceptually as &quot;randomization&quot;, and while that's the intent, the mechanical principals of how cards are actually shuffled aren't purely random events.  Take the standard riffle shuffle for example.  You split the deck into two nearly even halves, and than alternately drop a few cards from each pile into a new pile.  This isn't a purely random series of events:  the bottom card of the pile that has the first drop will always be on the bottom of the shuffled deck, for example.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you're so very skilled in shuffling that you <em>always</em> split the deck into two perfect 26-card sub-decks, and then <em>always</em> start the shuffle with a card drop from the same sub-deck, AND <em>always</em> perfectly interleave the cards one at a time, you can &quot;shuffle&quot; the deck in a completely predictable way (this actually has a name, and is known as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_shuffle" target="_blank">out shuffle</a>).  And if you do that, after only 8 shuffles you'll have your original deck layout again!</p>
<p>I suspect this isn't what you meant by &quot;shuffle&quot;, &quot;accidentally&quot;, or &quot;perfect order&quot;, but if you're somewhat flexible with these definitions, you can get the probability down to something you can achieve in less than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Added mention of (and link to) &quot;out shuffle&quot;.<br />
EDIT 2: Thanks to /u/unspeakableadvice for noticing I had substituted &quot;probability&quot; when I really meant &quot;permutations&quot;.  That's what I get for typing up replies at 0300 when I should be sleeping.  Also, thanks for the gold, kind stranger!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The number of possible shuffles of a standard deck of cards (52 cards) is 52 <em> 51 </em> 50 <em> ... </em> 1, or otherwise written as 52!. This number is approximately 8 * 10^(67) (an 8 followed by 67 0's).</p>
<p>To get an idea of how unimaginably large that number is, lets assume that we can create a billion different deck-orderings every second. That's 3.6 trillion per hour or 86.4 trillion per day. At this rate, it would take about 10^(54) days to exhaust all possible orderings. Or about 3 <em> 10^(50) years. For reference, our universe is about 1.5 </em> 10^(10) years old.</p>
<p>The chance of shuffling a deck of cards into one specific order is so incredibly small, that it is effectively impossible. You stand a better chance at trying to win the jackpot in the lottery multiple times in a row.</p>
<p>edit: To anyone with the urge to reply &quot;So you’re telling me there’s a chance?&quot;: This joke has already been made (repeatedly). Find some new material :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The very first time I played poker, on the very first hand I was dealt a royal flush. I didn't know a thing about the game (and still barely know anything about it). When it came time for me to place my bet, I didn't know what to do so I just showed my hand to everyone and asked, &quot;is this a good hand&quot;? Everyone freaked out, one guy just threw his cards on the table and left the game. But I remember someone asking &quot;do you know the odds of that happening?&quot; I had no idea. Every game I ever played after that has been such a let down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you start out with a deck of perfect order and then do 8 perfect riffle shuffles in a row, you will end up with the same order as you began with. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically it is possible, but the probability for a specific deck to appear is 52! = 8 × 10^67, or an 8 followed by 67 zeroes.
To give idea how big that is:</p>
<p>the radius of the observable universe is equal to about 4.4×10^26 meter. A disc with that size would require about 2.2×10^74 hydrogen atoms [1], or about 3.6×10^47 kg of hydrogen. [2]</p>
<p>You could make a 27,000 lightyear high ring of hydrogen atoms around the observable universe, with 52! Atoms.</p>
<p>The sun weighs about 2×10^30 kg, or about 10^57 hydrogen atoms. So if you take 80 billion suns, you roughly have enough hydrogen to give all the atoms a unique card deck.</p>
<p>Needless to say, 52! is a lot, and still the deck you shuffle next time you play cards is equally likely to happen as a perfect order one, since it's just the chance of on specific card deck.</p>
