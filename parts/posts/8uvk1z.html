It's also often used as a defensive manouver - to distract, deter, and even mark others. A glow might signal prey trying to communicate, but also a commotion where prey is likely to be found.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's not always an obvious trap. You're looking at from the aspect of angler fish has a lure only. In the deep ocean the big fish eats the smaller fish cliche is pretty standard. For example, copepods eating bacteria cause the bacteria to light up. The bacteria can be seen in the almost clear digestive tract of the copepods, and surrounding water. The bacteria is hoping by showing the copepods' location, something else will eat it.</p>
<p>A lure that looks like a glowing copepods might attract something that eats copepods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is the bleeding edge of the evolutionary arms race.</p>
<p>In each generation, the lantern fish who flub the trap go hungry and their genes disappear, leaving only the best anglers. </p>
<p>Similarly, the stupidest prey who fall for the trap die off, leaving only the smartest fish behind. </p>
<p>So now you have +1 smartness angler fish VS +1 smartness prey fish.</p>
<p>But one of them has to lose right?</p>
<p>So you still get fish being eaten, and the cosmic ballet goes on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
