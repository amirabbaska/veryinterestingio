		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All sounds are waves in a material. The wave is formed by compressing and expanding the material at some rate. If 2 things try to expand and compress the same piece of material then they will interfere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine someone is pushing and pulling on you. You will shake around. If a second person pushes and pulls on you then you will only shake in 1 pattern that is the result of both people pushing and pulling on you. So interference of sound waves results in a new sound wave. So if you record all the pieces of a band and all their sound waves, you can combine them into 1 new sound wave that when played back sounds like all the instruments playing together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It works just like your ear, only the opposite.</p>
<p>Your outer ear is shaped specifically to funnel sounds into your ear canal.  At the end of your ear canal there is thin membrane called your eardrum.</p>
<p>When sound waves contact your eardrum it vibrates.  These vibrations cause a series of small bones in your middle ear to strike another small membrane in your inner ear.  Which becomes the sounds that you hear.</p>
<p>A speaker works essentially the same way, just the opposite.</p>
<p>Unlike your eardrum which vibrates when exposed to sound waves, speakers vibrate to create sound waves.  An electric current triggers an electromagnet which then causes the diaphram of the speaker to move back and forth creating sound waves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's useful to understand what a sound is, exactly. Humans have a perception of a thing called 'pitch', which is our way of summarizing frequency. I.e., if I hit two rocks together once a second, this is a frequency of 1Hz (1 cycle per second), which is very low, far too low for humans to perceive it as a distinct pitch - we hear individual beats instead. Eventually, when you get up to the 20Hz range, the individual beats become a (low-frequency) continuous sound. The way this works is through sympathetic vibration of certain hairs in your ears (a particular hair vibrates best in time to 20 beats per second, another hair vibrates best in time to 1000 beats per second, etc.).</p>
<p>What's important to understand is that this pitch is a <em>continuous</em> phenomenon. You cannot get a pitch of 1KHz with a single beat - you need a bunch of beats (thus, frequency) over a continuous period for sound to be perceived as pitch.</p>
<p>What this means is that there is NO SUCH THING as instantaneous pitch. The way we perceive sound has no meaning at the level of an instant - there is only the level of the impulse (the amplitude). It's not until audio waves strike the ear over a longer interval that these impulses resolve into frequencies.</p>
<p>Of course, all of these things operate on the level of the millisecond, so as far as we're concerned it might as well be instantaneous.</p>
<p>So let's examine what happens in the speaker. Let's say we have three separate sounds going on at once, a drum beat that vibrates at 60Hz, a singer singing a note at 440Hz, and a guitar playing a note at 880Hz.</p>
<p>At a given moment, all of these sounds might combine to produce a single impulse. But over a slightly longer interval, each of these notes oscillates at a different frequency, and thus will contribute a different amount to the impulse at each moment. Just thinking of it as a series of beats, if they all beat at time 0, the drum will next beat at time 1/60 s, the vocals at 1/440 s, and the guitar at 1/880 s. So, if we measure again at 1/880 s we would only get the impulse from the guitar. At 1/440 s we'd have the impulse from the guitar and the vocals. At 1/60s we'd only have the drum. Etc.</p>
<p>The ear takes the continuous stream of impulses and separates it out by frequency over a short period of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My time to shine! I did my senior research paper in College on psychoacoustics (how your ear and brain work together to make hearing possible).</p>
<p>So- how does your ear hear multiple instruments even though the speaker is a single membrane? The simplest answer is that your ear is really, really, really good at hearing things, and your brain is really, really, really good at figuring out and organizing what you hear into something you can comprehend.</p>
<p>Its actually pretty amazing. Lets use the example of two instruments. A clarinet and a snare drum. </p>
<p>A clarinet produces even, beautiful, and regular sound waves. They gently push and pull your eardrum in smooth and repeating fashion, back and forth, back and forth. This is back and forth is repeating <em>thousands</em> of times a second! But your ear is so finely tuned, and so good at what it does, that even at thousands of back-and-forths per second, you still just hear the lovely tune of a clarinet.</p>
<p>Now lets take the snare drum. Its waves are messy. When its struck, it moves air wildly. Those wild waves push and pull your poor little eardrum in hard, irregular waves. It may push it severely, and then pull it back awkwardly, never repeating the same pattern twice. Again, this is happening thousands of times per second! And again, our amazing ear keeps up no problem, hearing the drum with great clarity.</p>
<p>Now what happens when the two play together? When you add two waves, the sum looks like a combination of the two. In the case of the clarinet and the snare, it would look like jagged but still repeating waves going back and forth. The literal child of the two waves.</p>
<p>So when we play both together, the wave that hits your ear looks very different from the originals! Its not the same as a clarinet or a drum! Its pushing and puling thousands of times per second, in jagged waves that are the children of their wavy parents. </p>
<p>But how do you <em>hear</em> that is a drum and a clarinet! That wave was so different from the old ones! This is where things get fuzzy. We hear both instruments because our brains are really good at recognizing patterns. We <em>know</em> what a clarinet sounds like, and we <em>know</em> what a drum sounds like. So hearing them together is an easy task for our brain to break down. Two very different sounds happening at the same time. Just sitting in the room you're in, you're hearing all kinds of sounds. But your brain can still pick up individual ones, simply because... it can! Your eardrums are <em>exactly</em> like speakers in reverse. You only have two, and yet our incredible brains allow us to figure out whats what without even thinking.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes we can get overwhelmed, think of trying to hear someone in a crowded room, or picking up the sound of a single violin in an orchestra. Music is <em>intentionally mixed in a way that is easy for our brains to interpret coming from only 2 speakers.</em></p>
<p><strong>TL/DR Your ears are amazing. You're amazing.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
