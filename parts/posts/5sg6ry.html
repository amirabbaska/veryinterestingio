		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>60 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30. Lots of options for splitting time into neat segments. You can divide 60 into halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, sixths, tenths, twelfths, fifteenths, twentieths, and thirtieths.</p>
<p>10 is only divisible by 2 and 5. So you can only divide it neatly into halves and fifths. It's just not as flexible.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm a political junkie, so I comment on a lot of threads featuring hot-button issues. But according to my inbox, this is the most incendiary comment I've ever made.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;There are two entirely different kinds of &quot;minute&quot; or &quot;second&quot;, and
you have to be careful not to confuse them.  In each case, they are
1/60 of some larger unit.  When we measure time, we divide each HOUR
into 60 equal parts called &quot;minutes&quot;, and each minute into 60 equal
&quot;seconds&quot;.  We also do the same thing when we measure angles, so that
each DEGREE is divided into 60 minutes, and each minute OF ANGLE is
divided into 60 seconds.  The units are different; an hour is not the
same as a degree in any sense, and their relationship has nothing to
do with the angle corresponding to a minute on a clock, or in the
earth's rotation.</p>
<p>Here's what happened.  The ancient Babylonians liked the number 60,
and in fact based their number system on it almost the way we base
ours on 10.  So any unit would be divided naturally into 60 equal
parts.  That worked well for various reasons, so early astronomers
used that scheme to measure angles, dividing a circle into 360 parts
(6 times 60), and then dividing each of those parts into 60 minutes,
and then into 60 seconds.  The word &quot;minute&quot; just meant &quot;little
part&quot;, and &quot;second&quot; meant &quot;second division into little parts&quot;!</p>
<p>At some point people started wanting to divide time into smaller parts
too; in ancient times it was hard enough to measure hours, but once
mechanical clocks were invented it became possible to divide hours up.<br />
How many units should there be in each hour?  They might have used 12,
as they had long before divided the day and the night each into 12
parts; but someone felt that 60 parts would be nice (probably an
astronomer!).  So they needed a name for 1/60 of an hour, and since
&quot;minute&quot; already meant &quot;1/60 of something&quot;, they called it a minute.<br />
They probably never considered the confusion it would cause when
someone looked at a clock and asked how far the hand had moved.  If I
say it moved 30 minutes, do I mean 30/60 of an hour on the dial, or
30/60 of a degree of angle?  That's unfortunate; but if you remember
that the size of a degree has nothing to do with the length of an
hour, and that the two kinds of minutes are just 1/60 of an hour or a
degree respectively, then you can see that they just aren't related.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people mention the Sumerians, but they definitely didn't have hours, minutes, and seconds to measure time.</p>
<p>Rather, the answer lies with the Greeks.  In Egypt.  Because Egypt was Greek at one point.  Specifically, the famous 4th century CE astronomer Ptolemy, whose wildly incorrect views of the universe were the basis of modern science until basically Galileo.  In his time, we didn't have decimals.  I mean, we didn't even have <em>digits</em> yet; those came from India a few centuries later.  So we used fractions, and thanks in part to the astronomical traditions inherited from the Babylonians, the common method of approximating numbers was with fractions in base 60.  You had some whole number of a quantity, then some number of minute divisions, and some number of <em>second</em> divisions, <em>third</em> divisions, etc., each of them 1/60 of the previous one.  So degrees were divided into minutes (1/60th of a degree), seconds (1/60th of a minute), thirds (1/60th of a second), and so forth, and that's how Ptolemy did his astronomical calculations in the Almagest.  Since his book was so influential, it's what people continued to use, in Arabia and then Europe, for centuries until Ptolemy's geocentric view was replaced by actual orbital mechanics around the Sun.  Meanwhile, a system of describing time needed to be precise as well for these calculations.  They didn't have <em>clocks</em>.  They had divided the day and the night into 12 hours each, and these were standardized as being all the same length so there'd be 24 equal hours in a day (this was an Egyptian thing too), but there were no clocks so it's not like you could see what time it was.  But the numbers were used in the calculations, so they were divided the same way degrees were, into minutes, seconds, thirds, etc.  Note that even if you assume geocentricity, the Sun still goes around the Earth on a 24-hour cycle, so you could draw that circle of the Sun going around the Earth and use it as a reference point for the other celestial events being modeled.</p>
<p>Well, eventually we got clocks, and since we were already using minutes and seconds as divisions of the hour, those became standard.  Thirds were too small to use, so there was no point.  That's why today we don't bother with thirds, just minutes and seconds, and we use decimals (because they've been invented) to get smaller bits of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
