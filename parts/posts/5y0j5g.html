You can think of a new guitar string compared to an old stretched out, worn, or frayed guitar string.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once hired a voice artist for a job based only on the demo reel provided by his agency. He had a great voice on his reel, but I didn't realise it was super outdated. An 80+ old man showed up for the recording who I had to help walk up the stairs, very very slowly. </p>
<p>When he managed to get a few consecutive words out, he sounded fantastic. He still had the tone and timbre. The problem was that it seemed like his face/mouth/throat/whatever muscles were so old and tired that he basically sounded like a drunk slurring most of the time and was constantly out of breath. Imagine a really tired and tipsy Ian Mackellen. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several things occur, the larynx also ages at about 30/40 years of age.
Cartilages begin to ossify including the cricoiarytenoid joint (responsible for bringing the vocal folds together). So the vocal folds will not be able to come together as much as they used to, this may make the voice sound more breathy since air is escaping during speech.</p>
<p>The thyroarytenoid is the muscle that makes up our vocal folds. It begins to atrophy, so the vocal folds get thinner and decrease in elasticity. Women experience vocal fold swelling, and the larger the vocal folds, the lower the frequency. That is why women's voices lower with age. </p>
<p>Because of atrophy and losing muscle mass, men tend to have higher voices as they age. A lot of this is hormonal factors coming into play. For women, it has to do with less estrogen, for men, less testosterone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
