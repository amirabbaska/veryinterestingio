		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When an acidic solution is created, heat is produced. The stronger the acidic solution, the more heat that can be made.</p>
<p>Basically, if you add water to acid, those first few drops will make a very acidic solution (since you have a tiny bit of water, and a lot of acid), and you risk the stuff boiling, splashing, etc. If you add acid to water, then those first few drops won't be able to do anything but make a very weak solution, which doesn't have this risk. </p>
<p>It pretty much just comes down to the fact that when you add water to acid, there's a higher ratio of acid-to-water and that produces more heat. Add the acid to the water though, and the ratio favors your water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Think of it like this. When you add water to acid, you have just a couple molecules of water getting attacked by millions of molecules of acid. </p>
<p>When you go the other way, you have just a few molecules of acid with millions of molecules of water. You still get the same reaction, but the extra water helps keep everything cool. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
