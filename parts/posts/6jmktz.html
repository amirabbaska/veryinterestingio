		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a bit complicated.  The easiest answer is that the music industry &quot;allowed&quot; it to happen.  When music was getting restricted, there was a backlash.</p>
<p>However, music remains profitable because the artist in question plays live, and tours, and music is a medium where people want to see live performances.  Hence, the act of giving away recordings (with some advertising) doesn't usually hurt the artist.  It hurt the record companies.</p>
<p>With movies, we're not looking for the actors to tour the country re-enacting Jurassic Park live.  Most films couldn't be done live due to visual effects and realistic sets.  So you have this industry that has no artist equivalent to &quot;touring.&quot;  A theatrical production isn't really the equivalent to a live music concert when we're talking about most films.</p>
<p>So the movie studios of the world defend themselves from markets offering free movies.  If movies were free, we'd stop getting movies.  You don't need a record company to make music, but you do need a movie studio to make most of the popular types of movies.  You can't make Guardians of the Galaxy on an iPhone and Adobe Premiere.  You could make Stairway to Heaven in a modified garage with microphones and pro tools.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, its important to remember that you do &quot;pay&quot; for your time spent of YouTube or Spotify, either through ads that you have to watch, or through a subscription fee. </p>
<p>Second, its not &quot;any song, any time.&quot; There's more than a little wheeling a dealing behind the scenes just to get permission to put these songs onto these services legally. Ultimately, if the record label doesn't want it on those services, they have plenty of resources, like take down notices, to get that song removed.</p>
<p>Third, consider the price difference between the two options. The average consumer will pay $5-$15 to watch a movie, but hesitates to pay $0.99 for a song. If you put all of your movies up for &quot;free&quot; on a streaming service, then you're leaving a bunch of money on the table. It works for some studios, or for older movies, but new movies rarely want to lose that money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The music industry has accepted that very soon the only way to make money from music will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>tours</li>
<li>merchandise</li>
<li>copyright for ads and such</li>
</ul>
<p>For all 3, the more people listen to your music, the better.</p>
<p>As for the movies, besides costing thousands of times more as pointed out by others, most of your profit still comes from buying the product itself (box office, TV channels and streaming services, etc)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spotify is not free, or has ads and restrictions on devices. </p>
<p>Youtube has lots of restrictions and much of the content on there is illegal.  </p>
<p>Nevertheless, movies cost thousands of times more to make than music does so earning pennies per view is not acceptable.  Yet we still have Netflix which is essentially exactly what you describe.  No one service will ever have all films ever made.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a long story behind services like Spotify but the biggest reason that music became 'free' before movies is that music is cheaper, shorter and more disposable than a movie.</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The average movie is around 200x to 400x bigger than the average song in the size of the file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People listen to more individual songs than they watch individual movies</p>
</li>
<li>Back in the early 2000's it was possible to download a 3 minute song  over the average internet connection</li>
</ul>
<p>Music was therefore destined to be the commercialised on the internet before movies. It started with piracy and music sharing services, the average person could download a song in a few minutes, which is enough to build up a collection. Music labels refused to sell their music online and if they did it was only their own music and only through their software which made their services pointless. Then Steve Jobs convinced enough major record labels to allow their music to be sold for 99c and suddenly iTunes was the first real commercial internet music service.</p>
<p>After that, it was inevitable that 99c would become 'unlimited, flat fee' and finally 'advertising supported'.</p>
<p>Today we've reached the point where the average internet connection is easily fast enough to stream a high quality movie. I still remember when that fact alone was just a dream. However, the Prophet Steve Jobs (P.B.U.H.) is not here to tell the movie execs to get their shit together. Movies still need to make a load of money in the box office and then they try to stagger their release around the world by selling them on these shitty disks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
