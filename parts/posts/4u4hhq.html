		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In most cases, no. You can read up on a quick summary by Peter Pressman of Cedars Sinai Medical Center and Roger Clemens of the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-food-cravings-the-bod/" target="_blank">here</a>. The gist of it is that cravings are more a factor of sociocultural factors, stressful environments and hormonal fluctuation than nutritional deficiencies. You can read further on the topic <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/08/food-cravings_n_1940299.html" target="_blank">here</a> where Karen Ansel, a registered dietitian, discusses how cravings work, and what areas of the brain are activated. She asserts that most cravings are dictated by social tropes, visual cues, or childhood memories. </p>
<p>The one caveat to this seems to be pica, where people eat non-food items such as soil, clay, stones, etc. From the little research that has been done on pica, the cause seems to point to a mineral deficiency, most likely iron. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Generally they would eat balanced diets instead of favoring just e.g. meats or cheese or fruit.  Some even displayed unusual choices that may have benefited particular conditions they had.</p>

<p>the answer is that no, the vast majority of studies have concluded that food cravings don't seem to stem from nutritional deficiencies. i'm not really going to go and find links to a dozen abstracts for you, but here's a google scholar search for you to get you started: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=food+cravings+nutrition&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5" target="_blank">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=food+cravings+nutrition&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5</a></p>
<p>cravings tend to relate to foods high in calories (also what most people tend to find tastes good). they also tend to stem from sociological and psychological factors (reward mechanisms, what you grew up eating, etc.).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The surprising thing we are discovering, is that the microbes in our our bodies have powerful influences on our minds. It's the microbes that do the 'craving', based on what they want the best - <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2014/08/116526/do-gut-bacteria-rule-our-minds" target="_blank">citation of an article, with a direct link to the study if you care to read past the synopsis</a> - also note that is an older article, there is more data now in 2016 that continues to point to this causing our behaviors and cravings - <a href="http://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Abstract/2016/06000/Gut_Microbiota_and_a_Selectively_Bred_Taste.12.aspx" target="_blank">Link from a more recent study</a>.</p>
<p>I personally have come to believe, by reading these studies for years, that the cause of much of our dietary behaviors, and health problems caused by diet, are strongly correlated with the brain-influencing power of our gut microbes. They are - in short - why dieting is &quot;hard&quot;, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.201400071/full" target="_blank">they are fighting you, actively, to get they food stuff they like best.</a> This is a study that explores the differences in gut bacteria and a relationship to diabetes in those differences - <a href="http://gut.bmj.com/content/65/3/426.short" target="_blank">Article</a> - it also covers how they affect overall health by specific types of microbes(A. muciniphila in this case).</p>
<p>I hope I cited enough, there's a ton more good info out there. <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2016.1182295" target="_blank">Here's another one</a> just in case, that covers how the different cultures of microbes process our food is important in health outcomes - ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
