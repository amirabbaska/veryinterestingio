<p>Disc and disk are two variants of the English word for objects of a generally thin and cylindrical geometry. The differences in spelling correspond both with regional differences and with different senses of the word. For example, in the case of flat, rotational data storage media the convention is that the spelling disk is used for magnetic storage (e.g. hard disks) while disc is used for optical storage (e.g. compact discs, better known as CDs). When there is no clear convention, the spelling disk is more popular in American English, while the spelling disc is more popular in British English.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Loosely related: &quot;disc&quot;, &quot;disk&quot;, &quot;discus&quot;, and &quot;dish&quot; all come from the same Latin word, <em>discus</em>, itself borrowed from the Greek <em>diskos</em>. Due to repeated contacts between English and Latin or Latin-derived languages over the centuries, the word for a flat, round thing kept getting borrowed, but with more and more specificity.</p>
<p>The reason dish is spelled and pronounced that way is because Old English pronounced &quot;sc&quot; and &quot;sk&quot; sounds as &quot;sh&quot;. Shirt and skirt were both general terms for a short garment, but while &quot;shirt&quot; had been around long enough to undergo the Old English sound change, &quot;skirt&quot; came with the comparatively more recent Danish invasions of the 8th century.  And since we now had double the terms, they could be applied to more specific things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I couldn't tell you why the 'k' spelling is more popular in American English (translations of the Odyssey? Numismatics?), but I believe that the reason we use the 'c' spelling for CDs is the influence of Phillips, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, where they sometimes say &quot;discus&quot;. This is also part of the reason Commonwealth English uses the 'c' spelling more often: they tend to have a Continental European influence to their spelling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;Disc&quot; is the chiefly British spelling while &quot;disk&quot; is preferred in the United States. As IBM was the US company that pioneered the development of computer hard drives they chose to use the &quot;disk&quot; spelling and the convention stuck to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Otherwise they are fully interchangeable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
