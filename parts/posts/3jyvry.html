		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is, but counter-intuitively there is also a bulge on the other side <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KN5bOrM.jpg" target="_blank">as shown here</a>. You can rationalize this phenomenon in terms of the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force" target="_blank">tidal forces</a>, which arise from the fact the the gravitational force from the moon is not uniform over the Earth. Simply put, the moon's gravitational pull is closest on the side of the Earth facing the moon and weakest on the opposite side. These differences give rise tidal forces that have a distribution across the surface of the planet <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Field_tidal.svg/1000px-Field_tidal.svg.png" target="_blank">as shown in this diagram</a>. The atmosphere closest to the moon is pulled towards it, but on the other side of the Earth, it effectively pulls away in the opposite direction, creating a bulge at both extremes. This is also the explanation for the fact that there are two high tides per day since (as the name implies) the tidal forces are the key source of tides on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I would like to expand my answer a bit, especially with regards to tides since there seems to be quite a bit of interest on the subject. Everything I said above is true within a simplified Newtonian model, however there are some subtleties to the actual mechanism at play. Let's make a crude assumption and treat the Earth as an onion-type sphere with a solid core, a thin uniform liquid layer around it and another gaseous layer on the exterior. Then when you apply a non-uniform gravitational filed (like that created by the moon) on the water or  atmosphere (which you can treat as a continuous fluid shell), it would become deformed into an ellipsoid with two lobes at the extremes (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l37ofe9haMU" target="_blank">as shown here for the atmosphere)</a>. </p>
<p>However, especially as tides are concerned, this effect is not just due the stronger pull of the atmosphere locally since even at the extremes, the local deviation of the moon's gravitational pull from the mean is very, very small (on the order of 1*10^(-7)<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth" target="_blank">g</a>, or 10 million times weaker than Earth's own gravity). Instead, you have to consider the total effect of all the tidal forces <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Field_tidal.svg/1000px-Field_tidal.svg.png" target="_blank">shown in the diagram I posted above</a>. The very small differences from the pull and push in the region facing and opposing the moon <em>as well as</em> the squeeze from the size accumulate over large enough volumes (i.e. seas and oceans) to produce large tides. Think of it this way, each infinitesimally small bit of fluid (e.g. water) only experiences a small effect, but because each bit of stuff pushes against the surrounding fluid, these small differences effectively add up and over large enough volumes they can become substantial. This effect still exists in smaller bodies of water such as lakes, but is far smaller exactly because the volume over which these differences can add up is far smaller.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Contrary to what most people are saying in this thread, <em>no</em>, the bulge in the Earth's atmosphere does not constantly face the moon. In fact, depending on a number of factors, the atmospheric tide is likely to be primarily thermally driven by solar heating of portions of the atmosphere, causing them to expand. While the earth is rotating near the resonance frequency of the atmosphere (resonant period being defined as the length of time for a lamb wave to propagate around the Earth, currently about 21 hours), the same relative portion of the atmosphere is heated all the time, which can result in <em>very</em> large tides, shown in this <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Y6wTW5l.png" target="_blank">figure.</a></p>
<p>When the Earth was rotating near resonance, there would be some interesting effects. It is very likely, depending primarily on the atmospheric <em>Q</em>-factor, that the Earth would become stuck at a relatively constant day length, with the torque from the atmospheric tide fully canceling the torque from the lunar tide, quite possibly for a period of over a billion years. This was first outlined in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11542096" target="_blank">1987 by Zahnle and Walker</a> and was been the subject of a paper (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01421" target="_blank">arxiv:1502.01421</a>) I co-authored.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and also on the opposite side of the Earth as well. The same is true with the oceans. This is due to what we collectively call &quot;tidal forces&quot;. </p>
<p>However, there is a common misconception as to why this occurs. Most people are under the impression that the gravity of the moon is simply pulling the mass of the water or air up as it passes overhead, but if this were true we would only see the effect on one side of the planet at a time, and one would also expect to see it affect other objects too. </p>
<p>There is a great PBS Space Time video that explains this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwChk4S99i4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwChk4S99i4</a></p>
<p>Basically, the force of gravity from the overhead moon is VERY small. 1 ten millionth of Earth's gravity. But the Moon isn't directly overhead of the entire Earth. Sure it's pulling straight up on the things that it passes over, but it's pulling slightly to the side (tangentially) on everything else. In a very large fluid body (like the oceans or the air), each of those small sideways pushes nudges the next bit along, and the next bit, and so on until in the middle (along the Earth/Moon line) you get a big bulge.</p>
<p>As an aside: While the Moon may orbit the Earth relatively slowly, the Earth is constantly rotating under the Moon. As such the tidal bulges are constantly being &quot;pulled&quot; by this rotation ahead of the Moon in it's orbit. This has some very interesting effects. The increase of mass in the bulge &quot;pulls&quot; back on the Moon transferring angular momentum from the Earth's rotation to the Moon's orbital speed. The increase on the Moon's orbital speed causes the distance between the Earth and the Moon to increase at a variable rate of about 38mm per year. Yes, the Moon is running away. If given enough time it will escape orbit and we will no longer have a moon. As angular momentum is always conserved, this transfer of energy also has the effect of slowing the Earth's rotation, making our days about 15 microseconds longer each year. Back when T-Rex was stomping around Montana (say 80 MYA), for instance, the Moon was always &quot;super&quot; and the days were about 20 minutes shorter.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The atmosphere does bulge out, both towards the moon and away from it. Similar to the tides in the ocean the phase of the atmospheric bulge lags the moon and the moon's antipodal point. Apparently the atmospheric bulge follows the ocean tides rather closely and is mostly due to the bulging of the ocean below the atmosphere and less due to the atmosphere actually stretching or moving. </p>
<p>A large daily effect on the atmosphere is sun forcing. That expands the atmosphere and creates bulges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are tidal effects in the atmosphere caused by the moon, but these are small compared to the effects caused by the sun. Such effects include changes due to solar activity, the geomagnetic effect, the diurnal variation, seasonal variations, etc. These are well-studied phenomena, due in part to drag on satellites caused by residual atmosphere.</p>
<p>There are lots of models used to predict solar effects, e.g. Naval Research Laboratory's MSIS and J77. Here's a link:</p>
