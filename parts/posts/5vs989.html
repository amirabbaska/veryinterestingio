		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is indeed possible to yo-yo in space. The only thing is that if you &quot;free wheel it&quot; (sorry not a yo-yo expert) it tends to float around. It will however try to keep its orientation due to gyroscopic effects. This is sometime used on spacecraft to either stabilise them or to turn them (with moment gyros).  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni4j5K4Lz3o" target="_blank">Here is a great video</a> of my favorite astronaut Dr Don Pettit inventing new yoyo tricks on board the international space station.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't need gravity to yoyo. Think of how you can throw a yoyo out perpendicular to the ground and have it return.</p>
<p>The way a yoyo works is this: the string isn't tight to the bearing which is how you can walk the dog etc. If you cause enough snap, it starts to wind, then due to the spinning, causes it to wind back on the string itself. Gravity plays no real part in basic yoyoing, only in certain tricks</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. A yo-yo's functionality is not based on gravity.  You throw it, the string strains, and bounces back.  To be honest, a Yo-yo in space would bounce back harder I believe.  The gravity would not be affecting the yo-yo's repercussion.
Long story short, yes, it would actually make a yo-yo more effective; or annoying depending on how you treat it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because you can throw the yo-yo and when it reaches the end of it's string it will rewind itself.</p>
<p>The mere fact you can yo-yo horizontally proves that gravity has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>It is purely the yo-yo and the string interacting with the force of your throw.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A yo-yo returns solely when the string catches on itself and rewinds. Gravity has no role in this process.</p>
<p>At times when the yo-yo is spinning at the end of a string without winding, the string is kept taut by the yo-yo's weight and/or swinging the yo-yo, preventing it from catching on itself. Once the string is loosened (by giving it a short tug or moving your hand towards the yo-yo), it will usually rewind.</p>
<p>On cheaper models, there isn't a bearing. The string can be knotted around the axle too tight for it to spin freely, and so may always rewind rather than hang.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
