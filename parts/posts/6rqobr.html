		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel qualified to answer this as I work at startups during that early growth phase and helped build one of the ones you mentioned, though not at the zero user phase.</p>
<p>Initially after the demo is written the idea is to gather friends, former coworkers, etc to use the service. You see lots of these demo class services around Silicon Valley and San Fransisco because the people in the area are very experimental and love the next hot tech startup. Paid services will often offer the service for free to users that join during this era. The idea is to start to gain &quot;traction&quot; at this phase to show that you are a viable long term product.</p>
<p>Once that is done, you raise a bunch of money to fund your product and start working with partners to promote your service. Typically this would be a paid person to either use your service, or talk about it, all while being on a major channel. Nobody joins Twitter after seeing a 30 second commercial, but seeing stars starting to slowly join, or bands, etc. If you can get this wide distribution going then people will join and put up with a bit of a ghost town feeling because that star/personality they like is on it. The unspoken truth is that the person might only be on the service because they are being paid. :)</p>
<p>Next, once you have these outside people coming in you have to retain them by showing them more than just the paid star or personality. Once they get hooked you can stop paying for power users to promote your product. Scaling back will show you if your growth can beat out your retention losses and then its just a game of keeping growth high while losing as few people as possible.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This post pertains primarily to the rise of Reddit more so than the others.</p>
<p>Back when I was a teenager, sites like Break.com, CollegeHumor, and eBaum's World were the places to go for funny stuff. Usually comments on posts and things there would link to other sites, so a word-of-mouth type thing. One of the popular sites in those days was Digg. Digg was a lot like reddit, with user submitted content and up and down votes to determine exposure (IIRC anyway, obviously been a while). Digg was a fantastically popular website in its heyday, and generated tons of traffic. However, they went the way of Icarus and flew too close to the sun. They weren't content with their advertising revenue, and started curating sponsored posts in exchange for money. This led to Digg deleting posts, changing content, and hiding submissions, since the companies paying didn't want their brand associated with anything controversial. It turned very much into a &quot;walled garden,&quot; and word about the new fangled Reddit quickly spread through comment sections and internet forums.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this seems to be a natural life cycle. The last few years have seen Reddit adopt a similar business model (just google &quot;Online Reputation Management&quot; and see how many companies are in this business now). A few examples from just the last 12 months would be the Rick &amp; Morty viral marketing campaign, the McDonald's Szechuan sauce campaign, tons of The_Donald, and lots of the Resist/Left Wing/Bernie stuff everywhere. The entire Tiny Trumps sub is the best example. Go back and look at some of the original posts on the sub, the user accounts are usually several years old, but only began posting in 2016, and all political. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2016/12/14/how-we-bought-reddit-for-200/#46cf0f4d44a8" target="_blank">This Forbes article</a> goes into greater detail about it. Political astroturfing is nothing new, and both sides are guilty of it. Unfortunately their tug of war over Reddit has a great chance of eventually collapsing the platform.</p>
<p>The long and short of it is basically websites featuring user driven content are cool. People like and use them. Companies that specialize in &quot;online reputation management&quot; create thousands of accounts and leave them dormant for months. When the site reaches a certain level of popularity, these reputation management companies are hired for viral advertising. This becomes standard practice until the bigger content creators no longer use the platform. Disaffected users eventually find each other through forums and comment sections, and the next big website is born. It develops through its infancy, and is eventually sucked back into the web of viral astroturfing. The platform is destroyed, users flee, and the Phoenix is reborn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reddit was a minor player until Digg 4.0 killed the site and users mass migrated to Reddit. Reddit had promoted itself through Digg users, but acceptance was low until Digg screwed up.</p>
<p>This is also how 4chan took off initially. SomethingAwful had a huge banwave and many users flocked to 4chan. Then years later Attack of the Show did a special on 4chan in 2008 and the site <del>went to crap</del> got even worse with new popularity.</p>
<p>I want to say Facebook benefitted from MySpace being cluttered with music, promotions, and overly decorated personal pages (with auto-playing music), but Facebook also had a slow growth in popularity due to exclusivity. I joined during the university only era, and it felt good to have no one advertising to me or parents on it. Facebook also only overcame MySpace in 2008 when smart phones were fairly new. So I imagine their mobile site helped, though I didn't use it at the time.</p>
<p>As you can see, Facebook had many factors in its growth.</p>
<p>Tinder is self-promoting. &quot;I hooked up with this person Tinder.&quot; <em>Hmmm... maybe I should look into that.</em> I believe the gay versions were popular and came first, but I could be wrong. My roommate used them a lot.</p>
<p>Twitter had celebrities and news channels reporting on it constantly. Even then I feel like everyone is talking and few are listening on Twitter. A lot of bots, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soft openings and open beta tests. Before you release your service to the public, you recruit a small amount of people to use it ahead of time so others have people to interact with when they sign up.</p>
<p>I'm sure the Reddit creators grabbed some people from Digg to test the site first, as well as friends from any other message boards they were on, fixed flaws these people pointed out, and then opened for the public at large.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Reddit foundes have been pretty open about the fact that their submot form had one extra field: nickname. </p>
<p>They basically spent all day posting content and comments as different users to set the vibe they wanted the site to have. So when actual users came, it already felt like an active place.</p>
<p>Oh and there were no subreddits as to not fragment the fledgling user base too soon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
