		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Economics student here with a focus on developmental economics. I'm late to the party but hopefully a few people can get me some upvotes for visibility.</p>
<p>Africa is impoverished for many reasons. </p>
<p>In no particular order, I will list some:</p>
<h1>All tropical areas tend to be more impoverished because they are more prone to disease</h1>
<p>-- You may notice that Northern areas and very Southern areas tend to be better off than Equitorial areas, especially wet ones. Places like the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Argentina used to be among that list of prosperous countries but had bad governance, and Chile is now quickly joining them. </p>
<p>This is because of disease. Until very, very recently (as in, since maybe the 1980s) people in those areas could not rely on being healthy tomorrow. Tropical diseases of many sorts, as well as diseases also common to temperate areas, ravaged them. This leaves working age people disabled or dead. Without a good ratio of healthy people to sick, an economy cannot be productive.</p>
<h1>Africa has suffered from bad governance</h1>
<p>--Since European contact, Africa has suffered from bad governance -- mostly from Europeans but also from African leadership as well. For a few hundred years, Europeans <strong>really</strong> wrecked the place with extortive policies aimed to overtly impoverish the population. This eased European rule and thus the capacity for Europeans to extract what they wanted from the area.  </p>
<p>Immediately upon independence, bad governance continued in many, but not all areas. Why? </p>
<p>Because those areas wanted to practice <em>autarky</em> (autarky is the opposite of free trade &amp; open migration -- Trump loves autarky if that makes it easier to understand). Why did they want to practice this policy?</p>
<p>They wanted to close their borders because of their history of subjugation at the hands of foreigners. So they decided to not trade with anyone, not accept investment, and not allow labor migration. </p>
<p>This left them without a means to transfer technologies from more technological areas, and without a way to get out of destitute poverty since they could not generate investment from exports or from foreign aid, or from foreign direct investment. They couldn't build industries at home because they had no source of income.</p>
<p>Today, many many African countries are much better managed. But, they've got a lot of growing to do. Nigeria, Botswana, and Kenya are some of the best examples of growing prosperity.</p>
<h1>Africa has recently been suffering from armed conflict, as is common among newly independent states</h1>
<p>-- Whether it was the fall of apartheid, the genocide in Rwanda, child soldiers in Sierra Leone and Uganda, or the ongoing civil war in the Congo, many Africans have not had their most fundamental need -- safety -- met. Without safety there is usually economic contraction, and often it is severe. This means that these areas, which were already poor, become more destroyed and more poor due to ongoing war. </p>
<p>Any political revolution, on the short and medium term, tends to cause economic contraction due to a loss of faith in contracts and jeopardizing safety. Some revolutions tend to cause economic growth -- sometimes huge growth -- on the long term. An example of this is of course the American revolution. Another would be the fall of Apartheid, from the fall of Apartheid until the rise of Jacob Zuma South Africa had very robust growth (but Zuma killed that with tribalist division).</p>
<h1>Africa lacks mature, essential institutions.</h1>
<p>This one can unfortunately be blamed mostly on colonial powers, as most African nations haven't been independent long enough to have developed fundamental institutions. It also falls as part of bad governance, but should be cited on its own.</p>
<p>While public schooling in Africa is becoming fairly common <strong>now</strong>, previous generations often were illiterate or had not finished elementary school. So, until this generation grows up the workforce in Africa -- while cheap -- is unviable. Sure, African workers will work for less than those in Bangladesh... but they can't read. They can't read instructions. Again, not all. The region is in a period of huge transition right now and places like, say, Kenya or Botswana, or South Africa are much further along than, say, the former Zaire or Sierra Leone. </p>
<p>Additionally, they lack banking industry. They lack large corporations and large bureaucratic structures. They lack a fully fleshed out police force especially in rural areas. A farmer in Namibia cannot, unlike an American farmer, enter in to a long term contract with a large purchaser to sell all of his, say, grain for the next two years at a fixed price. He can't do this because there aren't good courts and if there were then even if he won there aren't police out in the boonies where he lives to make the person pay him. He has his word, his family, and their collective weaponry to enforce agreements, and that's it. This limits the capability of investment and tends to cause disastrously volatile pricing which is extremely dependent on local conditions for that season. </p>
<h1>The keys to prosperity in this world are fairly intuitive.</h1>
<p>We need safety -- not only from violence, but from disease and dirty water too. Then, we need justice. -- those in power cannot be performing backhanded deals or serving their own profit. Finally, we need to be open -- freely exchanging with our fellow man and allowing the inflows and outflows of goods and people.</p>
<p>Africa had none of these things until recently. Now they need time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: It is my opinion that the hypothesis I've written about below is one that <em>adds</em> to the discussion rather than explains entirely why Africa has had developmental problems.  I am also aware that aspects of it may sound racist, however that does not warrant completely ignoring the hypothesis.  It's not my hypothesis, and while I do believe it may have some truth, I don't fully agree with it nor the economists who espouse it.</p>
<p>There is a fascinating concept called the &quot;geography hypothesis&quot; that might explain the economic hardships faced by subsaharan Africa.  There are wide ranging causes of economic despair across the globe.  When looking at a globe however, there seems to be a noticeable divide between the wealthy nations and nations with low income levels.  Nations that lie in the tropics are on the wrong side of the tracks when it comes to economic prosperity.  According to economist Ricardo Hausmann, these tracks exist at twenty degrees latitude and nations below this line are cursed with stagnant, declining, or slow economic growth rates as well as noticeably shorter life expectancy rates.   Nations in the temperate zones exhibit overwhelming economic success by comparison.  The temperate zones contain twenty-seven of the thirty wealthiest nations, the three exceptions being Brunei, Hong Kong, and Singapore.   These nations seemed to have escaped the curse by having extensive coastlines allowing them access to global markets.  Singapore for example is a small and flat island with few natural resources other than, arguably, the sea that surrounds it and allows the nation to enjoy low import and export costs.   The rest of the tropical zone is not so lucky, and economists who subscribe to the geography hypothesis have three main reasons for this: the tropics are geographically prone to diseases, tropical agriculture cannot use technology from other geographic zones because the different climates produce equally different crops, and the countless landlocked nations of the tropics face exorbitantly high transportation costs for imports and exports.  Many nations in the tropics face all three of these geographical obstacles simultaneously, and without the resources to overcome them these nations will continue to experience little or no growth.</p>
<p>Malaria is a useful example to study for this topic due to the vast amount of data collected on the disease, and it has such strong associations with the economically impoverished tropics that it has been dubbed the ‘disease of the poor’.   Ninety-eight percent of all malaria deaths occur in thirty-five countries, five of which are in Asia and the other thirty are in Sub-Saharan Africa.   Malaria is often treatable depending on the severity of the strain, however the most severe strains are virtually exclusive to Sub-Saharan Africa where they cause jaundice and frequent loss of consciousness in their victims.  The disease also claims more lives there than anywhere else.   One out of every twenty children under the age of five in Sub-Saharan Africa dies from malaria and adults, while more likely to survive, suffer frequent and long-term debilitation.   The crippling effect malaria has on workforces in Sub-Saharan Africa has made investors wary and growth elusive.  The disease has effectively isolated the region from international trade and tourism by raising transactions costs to prohibitively high levels.   This unfortunate reality is sustained by the geographic attributes of the topics.  The tropical climate allows malaria to thrive year round, whereas colder temperatures spare temperate zones from having to contend with the disease as an economic hurdle.  Malaria continues to pester tropical economies as relentlessly as the mosquitos that spread it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Born and bred West African here who spent the first 24 years of his life on my beloved continent. Problem numero uno in my opinion is bad leadership. One thing you always have to remember about Sub Saharan Africa is that a lot of these nations are artificial non homogeneous creations by European powers. Take my home nation of Nigeria as an example. There are three ethnic groups within its borders with populations of over 20 million each. Sure they may have all looked black to the British but these groups are as culturally and linguistically different as Russians are from Chinese (if you think this is not a problem, imagine aliens invading Earth and declaring that henceforth, Greece, Turkey and Russia will be one country). Throw in another four or five groups with populations roughly equivalent to that of Ireland and another 20 or so numbering over a million and you have a recipe for chaos as individual groups jostled for power. It's no accident that the Nigeria of my childhood was wracked by constant military coups. In such a situation, it's not the cream of the crop with drive and vision who rise to leadership. It's the most brutish and the most unscrupulous who force themselves into positions of authority.</p>
<p>Something else people tend to forget is that the colonial period is still relatively recent. When I was a toddler, Zimbabwe, Angola and Mozambique were still engaged in conflicts related to their wars for independence. Apartheid was still a thing in South Africa. Heck, 7 years before I was born my own country was engaged in civil war. These conflicts were devastating and take time to recover from.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm optimistic about Africa. I believe the younger generation are far less hung about ethnic identity than previous generations. People now take as much pride in being Nigerian, Senegalese or Ghanaian as they do in being Igbo, Wolof, Yoruba, Akan etc. Skilled African migrants are returning home to setup businesses as a kind of reverse brain drain. The internet has made the world a lot smaller and you can sit in a small village and pick up valuable skills by browsing MIT Courseware. The politicians are still no prize but they are a lot better than they were when I was growing up.</p>
<p>I choose to remain positive. Give it 50 years and I think this is a story that turns out well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is probably going to get buried in the comments but Paul Colliers book titled, <em>The bottom billion</em> does a great job explaining this. He boils down poverty and economic disparity to these 4 main problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Never-ending conflict (countries plagued with conflict will never be economically successful in any meaningful way. Without security there's no economic success)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The natural resource trap (poor nations who are blessed with a few natural resources that should theoretically make them rich end up squandering the money and concentrating all their efforts into these resources while neglecting all other industries)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being landlocked (Surprisingly this actually has a huge impact on the success of developing nations. Countries on the coast or those with access to the sea have a greater ability to trade and move around goods and people. If you're landlocked then you're in trouble because you're dependent on neighbours for trade and if they happen to be a neighbour that's in conflict, poor or badly run then it's not just unfortunate but your own economy will suffer as a result). </p>
</li>
<li>Bad governance (this one pretty much speaks for itself and unfortunately most countries in sub-Saharan africa suffer from this)</li>
</ol>
<p>The book goes into depth about all these points but it's easy to read and really informative. Highly recommend!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume you're asking about Sub-Saharan Africa, yes? Because the African Mediterranean coastline has always done pretty okay, at least in comparison to parts further south. And it ought to be pretty clear why <em>Saharan</em> Africa is pretty poor: for the most part it's a godawful wasteland where almost nobody lives. So I'm assuming that you're really interested in Sub-Saharan Africa here.</p>
<p>As to that, the simplest answer I can come up with is that Africa is a continent where just about everything wants you dead, from lions on the macro scale, to microbes on the micro scale. </p>
<p>European explorers/colonists travelling to Africa had a distinct tendency to <em>die like flies</em>. There's a reason European countries spent almost three centuries colonizing North and South America before seriously turning their attention to Africa (which they'd <em>always</em> known about!), and this is a big part of it. Infectious diseases endemic in Africa--yellow fever and malaria in particular--contributed to such a high European mortality rate that Africa was known as the &quot;white man's grave,&quot; and not for no reason. The climate is about as fantastic a breeding ground for the spread of infectious disease as one could imagine. The parts of Africa that aren't tropical are sub-tropical. It almost <em>never</em> freezes, meaning microbes and the bugs that carry them never have to go dormant. </p>
<p>Well if Europeans died in such large numbers, how did Africans survive? Part of the answer is that African populations do seem to have developed a certain resistance to some of the more common tropical diseases. For example, there's a recessive genetic disease, sickle-cell disease, that's pretty miserable for people who have it. But for people with only one copy of the gene carrying the sickle-cell traits, it provides a fairly robust resistance to malaria. Sickle-cell carriers can get malaria, but it's a lot less severe when they do get it. There are some other examples, but that's a classic one.</p>
<p>But the other part of the answer to how Africans survived in places Europeans died so much is that they <em>basically didn't</em>. European mortality rates in Sub-Saharan Africa during the colonial period could be fairly described as &quot;catastrophic&quot;. African mortality rates in Sub-Saharan Africa during the colonial period, by contrast, could be described as merely &quot;pretty damned bad&quot;. Life-expectancy in Sub-Saharan Africa has pretty consistently been among the lowest in the world for a <em>very</em> long time. Assuming the lions (or whatever) didn't eat you, and the monsoons cooperated to the point that you could bring in at least <em>something</em> in the way of crops, there was <em>still</em> a really decent chance you were going to catch some bug and die. </p>
<p>There are certainly other reasons. European colonial misadventures certainly didn't do the continent any <em>favors</em>, that's for damned sure, and certainly contributed to Africa <em>staying</em> poor a lot longer than most of the rest of the world. But Africa has trailed more temperate regions in terms of physical prosperity for a <em>very</em> long time. It's just a really tough place to live. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
