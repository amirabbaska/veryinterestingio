		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a 2013 paper published about a dog with migraines.</p>
<p>The dog in the 2013 study occasionally experienced episodes of apparent fear, which were followed by the dog emitting vocalizations. These episodes were observed throughout the dog’s life, beginning when she was about 6 months of age.</p>
<p>The episodes would typically begin with the dog hiding under furniture and withdrawing from her family. A few hours later, the pain appeared to set in, and she would cry out relatively continuously.</p>
<p>She often suffered from both photophobia and phonophobia (sensitivity to loud noises) during these episodes, and she’d sometimes refuse to eat and drink. Many times, she also displayed symptoms of extreme nausea, such as drooling and frequent swallowing.</p>
<p>These symptoms are all consistent with a migraine, but there was one more piece of important evidence: The pooch would usually act lethargic and exhausted for a few days following the episodes.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the poor pup’s owner took the dog to several different vets, who searched far and wide for a cause. The spaniel’s results all came back normal, so a variety of different medications were administered to try to treat the symptoms. Most – including opioid painkillers – failed to produce any results.</p>
<p>However, as the vets continued to rule out one condition and medication after another, they considered migraines. This led them to prescribe Topiramate, an anti-epileptic medication commonly prescribed for humans who suffer migraines. Thankfully, this appeared to have a noticeable effect, and although it didn’t eliminate the episodes altogether, it significantly reduced her symptoms and the duration of the episodes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure) can cause something akin to a migraine in dogs due to the acute increase in pressure on the optic nerve. If the retina is already non-visual and enucleation (surgical removal of the globe) is performed, you can see near immediate relief in some dogs based on their demeanor before and after the surgery. </p>
<p>For example, my own dog developed severe glaucoma over the course of three days, IOPs in the upper 80s mmHg. She had very dull mentation, quit eating, and overall was just not herself. The affected eye was enucleated and upon recovering from anesthesia later that day she was bright, alert, and back to her normal personality despite having a surgical wound on her face.</p>
<p>In contrast, cats tend to develop glaucoma more slowly and can go years before IOPs become high enough to cause discomfort.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Horses are suspected to get headaches due to certain diseases like liver or kidney disease.  At least that’s how we interpret it because we see them press their heads into the wall, presumably because the back pressure helps relieve some of the pain.  NSAIDs (like aspirin and ibuprofen in people) also help.</p>
<p>But pain in animals in general is a big topic with lots of educated guesses and unknowns.  Pain is very subjective and it’s hard to ask animals the questions we consider appropriate to ask people when we research pain. We also wonder about pain vs suffering in animals; and about the extent to which emotions affect pain as we know it does in people.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've heard about elephants getting something called Musth which causes them to become highly aggressive. The temporal glands swell up and press on the elephant's eyes and cause pain. It's believed to be comparable to a severe root abscess toothache. It could be similar to, or cause, a headache.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certain dog breeds have a congenital disposition for severe headaches. For example Crocker Spaniels.</p>
<p>Iirc their brains keep growing when they get older. But their skulls don't. (edit: just looked it up - it's a bit more complicated than that...) This causes severe headaches and can lead to the dreaded &quot;cocker rage&quot;. Also called SOA (sudden onset aggression). </p>
<p>As the dogs always have headache when they are around their owners some tend to associate their pain with their owners. The results are sudden, furious attacks.</p>
<p>Attacks such as these cannot be prevented with training because it is a problem that the dog seemingly cannot consciously control.</p>
<p>And as it turns out, dogs can also have migraines : <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jvim.12167" target="_blank">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jvim.12167</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
