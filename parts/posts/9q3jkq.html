		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any chemical can serve as an energy source if there is a more thermodynamically-stable energy state, such as glucose being oxidized to carbon dioxide and water. Both of those are more stable than glucose and the oxidation of glucose into them produces energy.</p>
<p>There are many such compounds such as methane, decaying plant matter, and minerals that might come from another source and drive the ecosystem. For example, in the deep ocean organic matter falling from above can feed lower life. Deep lakes can have material washed down into them from the surface or they can feed on previously-buried matter.</p>
<p>There are also other sources of energy such as geothermal and nuclear decay that can provide energy to an ecosystem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They may also adapt similarly to deep sea life that lives off of/near hydrothermal vents if they're present in the underground aquifer</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of cave dwellers are sustained by rare calorie inputs from surface sources, so they too rely on the sun for food. For example, bats bring nutrient-rich guano into caverns, enough to feed a whole ecosystem of amphipods, cave crickets, and centipedes. Many troglodytes are also adapted to have extremely slow metabolisms so that they can take advantage of the rare bit of food that comes into their cavern from the outside world. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olm" target="_blank">olm</a>, a cave salamander, is able to enter stasis when food is scarce, and can re-absorb organs when it needs the calories (and grow them back once it finds a morsel of food). They can last as long as ten years in between a meal. As for what they eat, the olm only lives around underground rivers with connections to the surface, so every so often an insect or a small crustacean will get washed into the cave from outside and the olm is there to grab and devour it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s pretty much already been explained by others  here but perhaps you’d enjoy looking up online about “chemo-heterotrophs” I believe this is the life you are speaking of.</p>
<p>The “chemo” part meaning energy is derived from chemical compounds in the environment, whilst we also have “photo-heterotroph” which derives energy from sunlight (photosynthesis).</p>
<p>This greatly increases the possible habitable environments on other planets/moons (i.e. IF there is life on Titan they’d be too far away to receive sunlight benefits and may be chemo-heterotrophs, or similar).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
