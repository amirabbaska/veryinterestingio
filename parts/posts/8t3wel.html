		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While I'm no expert at this (as in I'm not a medical practitioner), I am familiar with how we hear the world around us. The &quot;magic&quot; behind how we hear is actually located in the inner ear in what is called the cochlea. It looks somewhat like a shell when viewed from a two-dimensional perspective; however, it is more like a spiral-like structure. Within the cochlea you have tiny, TINY, hair cells that literally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_HUgzhmq4U" target="_blank">vibrate</a>, which connect to the auditory nerve that sends those signals to your brain. You have inner hair cells and outer hair cells. The outer hair cells help reduce the energy from the sound entering your ears so that your brain isn't overwhelmed with the amount of audible stimulation. This actually helps the ears to pick up higher frequencies much better and to hear softer noises.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the outer hair cells function improperly in that they continue to vibrate (I believe this is correct although I'm not 100% certain) when it doesn't need to do so. This causes the temporary audible sensation of that high-pitched ringing in your ears. When you notice that your hearing temporarily decreases, it is actually your hair cells reorganizing and reverting themselves back to their normal state. After a few moments, your hearing should be back to normal.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a current theory that everyone experiences this ringing sound or tinnitus all the time but the brain can just tune it out. If you cause some change or damage to your hearing system (i.e. noise damage, prescription drugs, something that effects the blood flow to the ear) this brings attention to the fact there is this constant noise (the electrical impulses in your brain/sound of blood flow). If this change is temporary it goes away pretty quickly, but if you do permanent damage and your brain latches onto this and concentrates on it, consciously or subconsciously, this causes tinnitus. Then how you are psychologically towards it determines how much of a detriment it is to your life. </p>
<p>There is no known cure for tinnitus at the moment, but the best way to treat it is to change the way you think about it. If you think/believe its the worst thing in the world it can affect you really badly, but if you can find a way to ignore/embrace it it's not too bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I learned in psychology is:</p>
<p>Within the inner ear there is this thing called the Cochlea which basically looks like the shell of a snail. Lining the walls of the Cochlea are thousands of tiny little hair follicles that detect the pitch of sounds and relay them to the brain via “electrical” impulses through the auditory nerve. Near the opening of he Cochlea (the part closest to your outer ear) the hair follicles detect high pitched sounds. As you continue inward the hair follicles detect lower pitched sounds. The hair follicles nearest the Cochlea’s entrance are obviously the most vulnerable to damage as they are closest to the outer ear. When a hair follicle dies, whether due to damage or natural causes (they do have a life span), it will emit one final signal to the brain. This call correlates to the pitch that particular hair follicle is in charge of detecting. This is very common after exposure to loud noises such as loud music or explosives, but it can also just happen at random for no particular reason. </p>
<p>TLDR; That sound is one or more of your hair follicles dying. As it slowly fades into darkness it lets out one final plea, an attempt to grab your attention so you may finally notice all the work it has done for you over the years. Alas, the plea often lands on deaf ears as we simply regard this sound as “annoying”, unaware that we will never hear it again.
Rest easy, little hair follicle, I will cherish your final call for the rest of eternity. Thank you for your service. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is known as &quot;burst&quot; tinnitus. We're not entirely sure of the causes but we know it's of central nervous system origin (somewhere in the brain or brainstem) rather than the ear as the problem still happens to people who have had their auditory nerves totally severed. It can be caused following noise exposure, can be an aura warning of an oncoming migraine or seizure, or can just be random for no apparent reason. Part of the fun of being sentient meat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
