		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trunks do leave visible attachment marks for muscles, ligaments, &amp; such on the skull. However, from osteological correlates alone, it would be impossible to infer exactly what the trunk looks like. In what is perhaps a &quot;reverse-application&quot; of this line of reasoning, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2009/03/20/junk-in-the-trunk/" target="_blank">trunks can be rejected for sauropod dinosaurs</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="http://markwitton-com.blogspot.ca/2016/08/trunk-or-no-trunk-short-or-giant-ears.html" target="_blank">Another discussion of osteological correlates of trunks</a>, this time applied to the giant rhinoceratid <em>Paraceratherium</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>yeah you can tell where extra ligaments and muscles would attach to bone so there will be more surface area like spines of bone to allow muscles to attach and function.
for example the skull of a silverback gorilla has a flaring on the top called a sagital crest and large cheekbones, so that the dominant males can bite harder </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Going in the opposite direction, there's speculation that the ancient Greeks invented the Cyclops myth after finding the skull of a dwarf elephant and mistaking the &quot;trunk hole&quot; in its skull for an eye socket.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is very much &quot;eh sorta&quot;. /u/GlobalAmnesia is right on the money that you can see where muscles and ligaments would attach, but that can only get you so far. Up to a certain point, you have to start making educated guesses, based both on modern-day descendants and modern-day analogues. So, say we had absolutely no images or depictions of anything even vaguely &quot;mammoth-y&quot; from prehistory, we'd be able to tell that it probably had a very elephant-like trunk based on comparison with modern-day elephant skulls and knowledge of how the animal could physically be built.</p>
<p>But, I mean, after a certain point you do slightly have to start making educated guesses. It varies from fossil to fossil though, and paleontologists are clever people. We're pretty good at guessing this stuff, and our guesses usually turn out to be right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a similar vein to your question, I love seeing old drawings of animals the artist had never seen, but had only a second or third hand description to go by. If I wasn't at work on my phone I would look for some examples, but a quick search should provide you with some interesting renditions of African animals from European artists who had never seen them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
