		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Atomic electrons are bound in quantum-mechanical orbitals which can't really be thought of as classical trajectories. In order to answer the question, interpreting it literally, you'd have to define exactly what you mean by &quot;motion&quot; of an atomic electron.</p>
<p>Are they literally zipping around with well-defined trajectories? No. Do they have nonzero average kinetic energy even in the ground state? Yes.</p>
<p>If you have a bunch of atoms at absolute zero, they are all in their quantum-mechanical ground states. That means that they have the lowest energies that they possibly can, but their average kinetic energies are not necessarily zero.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They would still have what is referred to as zero point energy.  The  the electron still has to obey the uncertainty principle, which says that if you know anything about where it is, you cannot know its momentum to infinite precision.  If you knew its momentum was exactly zero, you would know its momentum to infinite precision, and so the uncertainty principle does not allow this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I agree with most if what has been said already, but the premise of the question is worth a comment.  We are taught that temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a system.  That is valid when classical statistics can be applied- when there are many accessible quantum states available to the molecule within a range of the average thermal energy (kT).  So at high enough temperatures this might hold true for electrons and for the motion of atoms within molecules or crystals as well as for molecules in a gas, while at low enough temperatures it will break down for all of them.  (Due to their small mass, quantum levels are spaced far apart for electrons and so this approximation only would apply at very high temperatures and low densities.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
