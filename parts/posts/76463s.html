On occasion, we have noticed some weird results when testing samples from the top of a tank compared to a sample from the bottom of the tank.  </p>
<p>Mainly we noticed this with a product that is primarily water and isopropanol.  I know that water and IPA are miscible.  Would the difference in testing of a top and bottom sample be a result of improper mixing or do the two liquids form a gradient concentration mixture throughout the tank after a certain period of time?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How tall is your tank? It’s possible that a gradient will form based on pressure differences regardless of prior mixing.  The two fluids can’t be perfectly miscible, so over and extended period of time, and with a large enough pressure difference, a gradient can form.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Unlike ethanol or methanol, isopropyl alcohol is not miscible with salt solutions and can be separated from aqueous solutions by adding a salt such as sodium chloride. The process is colloquially called salting out, and causes concentrated isopropyl alcohol to separate into a distinct layer.[7]</p>

<p>Suggesting a possible reason for your specific mixture to separate.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631070507002435" target="_blank">paper</a> (Y. Tsori, L. Leibler, C. R. Physique 8 (2007)) states that a fast enough centrifuge can induce a clear phase separation in an otherwise miscible mixture.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, yes, a homogeneous mixture of two miscible liquids can become non-homogeneous over time.
However, it's not obvious if such a thing happens on its own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For as long as I know, a homogeneous mixture will remain homogeneous as long as conditions don’t change. I have some suggestions you can try to find the origin of the problem:</p>
<p>-Check for condition variations. Pure iPrOH and water are miscible in all proportions <strong>at room temperature</strong>. But if the mixture contains other compounds, the miscibility might change (I used to work with a 1:1 mixture of water and acetonitrile which are fully miscible, but after solving LiCl, miscibility dropped and became very dependent of temperature). A few degrees of difference in temperature might cross the line from 1 phase to 2 phases, and this implies a change in composition as both phases will be different. As an anecdote I know a couple of Physics who had problems with the magnetism of a sample a few years ago, as the new measurements were completely different from the measurements that made 4 months before. It turned out the sample contained gadolinium and the critical temperature is very close to room temperature. The first measurements where in winter (just under Tc) and the following in summer (above Tc), and that made a huge difference in its properties.</p>
<p>-As you suggest, it might not be mixed as well as it should. It doesn’t harm if before the first measurement you vigorously mix/stir the sample. It won’t hurt and it will fix it in case it was the problem.</p>
<p>-Some mixtures look homogeneous but they aren’t. A true heterogeneous will form 2 phases or at least will look milky or opaque. If it looks clear, it might be a colloid. It is unlikely, but testing for it requires only 5 seconds. Just make use of the Tyndall effect to discard the presence of a colloid. If the solution is Tyndall positive, well… it’s not homogeneous.</p>
<p>-Are you sure the container is completely sealed between assays? If the container is not tight, some solvent might evaporate. iPrOH will evaporate faster than water, and composition can change (Raoult law’s). Also, check the cap of the bottle. The iPrOH tank I used to have in my laboratory had a tiny hole to protect it fror overpressures, and that might be a leak for your tank. Also, a very slight composition change might happen if you just open the bottle and then close it again. The solvent vapor will leave and when you close, it will re-evaporate until achieving vapor pressure, which will change very slightly the composition. This is only important for small amounts of sample and very fine analyses (trace or microtrace), but I don’t know what kind of analysis you perform.</p>
<p>-Sometimes, given enough time, the compounds of the mixture can react. I saw this with acetone we bought in very high volumes. In theory, acetone is stable, but it can react with itself by an aldol condensation reaction. It’s very slow, but it can be accelerated with trace amounts of acids, bases, metallic cations (We’ve found trace amounts of some metals even on the polyethylene of the bottle, some polymerization catalyst are left behind depending on the production method of the plastic)… If you give it enough time between assays, this reaction becomes important and changed the composition of the tank noticeably. The same thing might happen in your mixture: reactions between other components and water/iPrOH, or even of the solvent with air or each other, catalyzed by some other compound present in the solution. You can test it taking a small sample of your product, leaving it on a closed recipient that you can analyze (we used NMR, so we placed it in a very tightly closed NMR tube) and testing if every few days to see if there are any changes.</p>
<p>-Also, we had problems a couple of times with tanks of acetone because they should be clean when they bottle it, but it wasn’t perfectly clean. Maybe you have viscous residues of former batches on the bottom of the tank and you haven’t noticed it. Just to be sure of all possibilities.</p>
<p>Those suggestions are all that I can find that fits to your observations. I don’t know if they will solve your problem, but at least are things that I would consider if I was having the kind of problem you have. Try to think on all the compounds you have and how they can affect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in flavors and we see this from time to time.  MOST of the time its simply our floor workers not mixing solutions well enough and phases forming as some of the other materials tend to solubilize in different solvents better.  We remedy this by making pre-blends if possible of solvent systems.  More rare is some synergistic effect happening from order of addition.  This requires some benchtop experimentation to see what the offending materials are and readressing the order of addition or isolating phases (ex. aqueous, oil, EtOH phases before combining all of them).  The last and most rare issue is over saturation caused by heat from our mixers.  This is most rare because we prototype on stir plates in beakers with negligible heat.  This is on the chemist being sloppy and not watching solubility limits.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order for a phase transition to occur in a homogeneous solution would require the temperature to change to where the components are no longer miscible. Otherwise, where does the energy come from to power movement from one phase to the other. Some other element other than the solvent was poorly mixed in the huge tank. Get a bigger Lightin' mixer!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
