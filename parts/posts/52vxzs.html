		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can anyone provide ballpark figures as to the energy requirements required for complete dissociation of a human body and the range at which a thermonuclear device could satisfy these conditions?</p>
<p>The thing I'm trying to get at here is that, colloquially, we all believe that there's a range at which a nuclear bomb just turns material to gas. This is true, for certain ranges. Obviously the bomb's casing is vaporized. However, I'm also aware that there are things called ablative shields (such as those used on spacecraft) these can be friction heated to very high temperatures (granted not as hot as a nuclear blast) but only lose maybe a few millimeters of depth because of the huge energy requirements to vaporize them.</p>
<p>The human body is mostly water which has a relatively high heat of vaporization. So the root of my question is really, given the relatively short duration of the nuclear blast, is it actually reasonable to assume a large radius (&gt;500m) at which vaporization will occur, or is it actually much smaller than a layperson would normally assume?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These are quotes taken from the novel <em>The Last Train From Hiroshima</em> by Charles Pellegrino. It's a very lengthy explanation so I'll paraphrase and combine the parts to create a 'tl;dr' version. The following passage describes the untimely demise of one Mrs. Aoyama, who had the unfortunate distinction of being directly below the bomb as it detonated over the city of Hiroshima.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&quot;After only one-hundred-millionth of a second, the core (of the bomb) began to expand and the fission reaction began to run down. During this nanosecond interval, the first burst of light emerged with such intensity that even the green and yellow portions of the spectrum could be seen shining through the bomb's steel casing as if it were a bag of transparent cellophane. Directly below, Mrs. Aoyama was still alive and completely untouched by the flash. After one ten-thousandth of a second, the air began absorbing the burst and responding to it. Under the hypocenter (of the expanding neutron field created by the bomb's detonation), the blood in Mrs. Aoyama's brain was already beginning to vibrate, on the verge of flashing to vapor. What she experienced was one of the fastest deaths in all human history. Before a single nerve could begin to sense pain, she and her nerves ceased to be.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&quot;Unlike the man leading a horse across the nearby &quot;T&quot; Bridge, Mrs. Aoyama could not possibly leave a permanent shadow on the ground. From the moment the rays began to pass through her bones, her marrow would begin vibrating at more than five times the boiling point of water. The bones themselves would become instantly incandescent, with all of her flesh trying simultaneously to explode away from her skeleton while being forced straight down into the ground as a compressed gas. Within the first three-tenths of a second following the bomb's detonation, most of the iron was going to be separated from Mrs. Aoyama's blood, as if by an atomic refinery.&quot;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, it is a combination of a great many factors. Radiation, heat, and the blast wave all combine to create an incredibly fast death. Assuming you're at ground zero.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book itself is incredible, and absolutely worth a read if the subject interests you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the flip side, <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2012/07/16/156851175/five-men-agree-to-stand-directly-under-an-exploding-nuclear-bomb" target="_blank">these guys stood at ground zero under a nuclear blast</a> and all six are either still alive or lived another 40 or 50 years, they kept on not dying of radiation poisoning or cancer from the blast.</p>
<p>That was a 2 kiloton nuclear bomb detonated in the atmosphere directly above them, but still some distance away.  Naturally if you're standing right next to the thing when it explodes an immediate death is the expected result.  </p>
<p>At Hiroshima and Nagasaki there were many people who were very close to the blast but somewhat shielded from the radiation who lived out long natural lives.</p>
<p>There are several things that COULD kill you.  The concussion from the blast, the heat from the blast, the lack of air from the blast, the radiation that can sterilize your cells so you die from blood and other cells not reproducing. Many people in Japan died not from the bombs but from the fires that spread after the bombs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

TL;DR:  The nuclear detonation sets off an immense amount of radiation (light), which will heat up all surrounding objects. The ropes holding the device in place was vaporized in less than 1ms.<br />
So a person would be vaporized: He'd heat up so hot, that the whole body will become a gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
