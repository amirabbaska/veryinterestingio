<p>2.If this were possible what would that look like on official documents and would it be impossible to get a passport?</p>
<p>3.Can you also renounce this citizen ship in later time?</p>
<p>4.Is it also possible to renounce and denounce your citizenship constantly? As in, there is no limit to how many times you can become an american and then subsequently denounce your american citizenship? </p>
<p>5.Finally is there a limit to how many citizenship you are allowed to have? </p>
<p>6.does renouncing or denouncing a citizenship have any effect on this?</p>
<p>7.If you were to have 2 citizenships and another country would not recognize you as a citizen unless you remove one would that mean your technically force to denounce a previous citizenship to become a citizen of that specific country?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called statelessness, and it's possible. More often it happens at birth or involuntarily. Several UN conventions have aimed to reduce it. However, the U.S. hasn't signed them, and unlike many countries, will allow citizens to renounce their citizenship with nothing to replace it. This has happened at least a few times. Renouncing U.S. citizenship as an adult is irreversible.</p>
<p>You don't want to be stateless. No country is obligated to give you a passport or legal documents, provide protection or services, nor even to take you in. You can be in limbo indefinitely.</p>
<p>There's not an obvious limit on multiple citizenships, though it's hard to get more than a few. Some countries won't allow their citizenship to be held in combination with others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, yes, it is possible to voluntarily give up all citizenship, at least in some scenarios: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statelessness#Renunciation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statelessness#Renunciation</a>. </p>
<p>A stateless person is not eligible for a passport, and many things become difficult, for a person without citizenship in any state. </p>
<p>The specifics of gaining and losing any particular citizenship vary by country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a subsequent question to this one- Let's say I'm an American citizen and I renounce my citizenship, where do they put me afterwards? I've only had citizenship in america all my life. Do they bring me to the nearest airport and leave me in the customs gate? I am genuinely curious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add a bit to #5: while there's no international set limit on how many citizenships you can hold at the same time, some countries do not allow dual citizenships (if you obtain a new one, you're considered to have automatically renounced your previous citizehship) and some countries do have a nominal limit of how many you can hold or which specific countries you may be a dual citizen of. Considering the requirements for obtaining citizenships, I think there was a discussion from a while back where it was shown that the maximum number you can feasibly obtain and hold at the same time, assuming you're wealthy and live a long life, is around 15-18.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a direct answer to your questions but I went through something similar so here's my story. </p>
<p>I renounced my foreign citizenship for a job I got hired for in the USA that required a secret clearance. I was a dual national before this.</p>
<p>I walked into the embassy in NYC, explained what I was trying to do and why, they checked to see if I could stay in the US if I did (I could), filled out some forms, they punched a huge hole in my passport, gave it back to me and wished me farewell!</p>
<p>They said I would always be welcome back as long as it did not bring any shame to their country, lived in the country for minimum 5 years, promised not be a strain to society!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
