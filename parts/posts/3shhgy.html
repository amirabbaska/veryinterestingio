		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello, economist here. Yes, there are real world examples and we do look at these. The problem is that it can be very difficult to actually figure out convincingly what the causal impact was of the minumum wage policy. It is not impossible but it is difficult, and so the evidence is not always clearly on one side. When we introduce a minimum wage our main concern is what the impact will be on unemployment. Economic theory says that the effect on unemployment is ambiguous, that is, a minimum wage can raise or lower unemployment depending on the level of the minimum wage and the circumstances.</p>
<p>Now, unemployment in a given area changes lots all the time, so even if it goes up after a minimum wage is introduced it is not clear whether this is because of the policy or it would have gone up anyway. One very popular strategy to get around this is to compare how unemployment changed to that of a similar place. Suppose the two places had unemployment rising and falling in the same way beforehand, then if the minimum wage is introduced in one place and unemployment suddenly rises there but not in the other place then this is evidence the minimum wage caused the rise. There are still big problems with this though, unemployment does not tend to be so parrellel between regions so the evidence is never so clear. Also worrying is that a minimum wage introduced in say, one state will affect nearby states (maybe workers from those states go to the new one to take advantage of the higher wages for instance) this could alter the affect of the policy but would not occur for a federal minimum wage.</p>
<p>My preferred strategy is what is called 'structural estimation'. Economic theory tells us that the effect of the minimum wage depends on certain features of the labor market (which is the kind of metaphorical market place where firms hire workers for certain wages). We may be able to measure these thing by using lots of data about the labor market. In fact we can create quite complicated models, sometimes requiring computer simulation, that take into account people crossing borders etc. Whether this kind of very theory-heavy approach or the mostly 'atheoretic' approach above is better is a subject of heated debate.</p>
<p>Anyway, there is a huge literature trying to estimate the effects of different levels of minimum wage using various approaches and data from various times and places. As for why there is still debate, well as you can gather from the above, the difficulties involved mean that evidence is not entirely conclusive. However, in the 90s when the federal minimum wage was set under Clinton there was much attention to the economic literature which at the time seemed to clearly support the idea that a minimum wage at the Clinton level was good for employment. I might add that even if there were very clear evidence there may still be disagreement. Even if a higher minimum wage would substantially raise unemployment then you could support it anyway because the lower paid workers who stay employed get higher wages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody has given a satisfactory answer to  the OP's questions, so I'll give it a shot. In reverse order, because it's more illuminating:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q). Are their real world examples of minimum wage increases that can be studied to determine the truth?</p>
<p>A). Yes, <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/REST_a_00039" target="_blank">here's a link</a> to recent study on minimum wage increases from MIT. The researchers compared contiguous counties with asymmetric minimum wage laws (due to differences in state minimum wage laws), and found no adverse effects. This question has been looked into a lot, actually -- this is just one of the studies that I pulled from a relevant <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=minimum+wage+county&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C38&amp;as_sdtp=" target="_blank">Google scholar search</a>. Paul Krugman gives a rundown of the economics on his blog <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/minimum-wage-economics/" target="_blank">here</a>, the relevant part here: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, as <a href="http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/min-wage-2013-02.pdf" target="_blank">John Schmitt</a> (pdf) documents at length, there just isn’t any evidence that raising the minimum wage near current levels would reduce employment. And this is a really solid result, because there have been a <em>lot</em> of studies. We can argue about exactly why the simple Econ 101 story doesn’t seem to work, but it clearly doesn’t — which means that the supposed cost in terms of employment from seeking to raise low-wage workers’ earnings is a myth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q). Why do Republicans and Democrats argue about what happens when the minimum wage is increased?</p>
<p>A). Some part of it may be ignorance of the data. However, as with a lot of the debates between Republicans and Democrats, it comes down to a question of values, not information. A Republican could want to lower or even do away with the minimum wage entirely because he or she values economic freedom, regardless of the economic effects of the policy. Conversely, a Democrat could support raising the minimum wage because she or he values increasing the bargaining power of workers, independent of any economic effects of the policy one way or the other.<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem is when it comes to governmental policies, there's no lab to experiment in.  Hard sciences can do that, soft sciences can't.  There's always variables that aren't identical to other situations, so there's always going to be disputes about how things would go for any given implementation.  Like:</p>
<p>&quot;Well, last time that was enacted, it resulted in [X]!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, but that's because during that time, in that place, there was also [Y], so the results wouldn't be the same!&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They argue because because even facts can be viewed from different perspectives.</p>
<p>In general, economists view minimum
wage the same: it is a type of price floor. This leads to an excess of supply and not enough demand. In the case of minimum wage, young, uneducated people have higher rates of unemployment. Economists compare countries all the time and in general, similar countries with different minimum wages, the one with the higher minimum wage has higher unemployment. Even one of the most liberal economists around, Paul Krugman, describes minimum wage this way in his text book. (I know because I own a copy).</p>
<p>Now, that is a pure economic argument. There are plenty of good moral reasons that involve fairness and equity to argue in favor of minimum wage.</p>
<p>So, the question for everyone is, do I want the most efficient economy, or am I ok with giving up some efficiency to have a more equitable society?</p>
<p>People and politicians will probably be having these same arguments 100 years from now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because there is a small kernel of truth to what both parties are saying, and upselling their story while downplaying the opposition story serves their interest.</p>
<p>If a business can replace a worker more cheaply with a process/machine/algorithm they will.  Raising the minimum wage changes the dynamics a bit, so business functions that are &quot;on the bubble&quot; will end up getting phased out.  Of course if your job can't be replaced cheaply, it won't be and you'll just start to get paid more.</p>
<p>Let's use McDonalds as an example.  If the minimum wage goes up some, McDonalds may opt to try replacing one or more cashiers with a self serve kiosk.  They will still need fry cooks and burger cooks though, since the cost of replacing them is a bit higher.  Of course then what if the minimum wage goes up a bit more?  Now McDonalds begins experimenting with robotics to automate some of the food preparation.  The payback of this isn't worth it when someone can be paid $7 and hour to do it, but at say, $15 an hour they begin doing it because it's more cost effective.</p>
<p>So bottom line if the minimum wage goes up a few people will lose their job and the rest get paid more.  The proportion of this depends on the wage increase. If you're for an increase you will downplay the job loss and sell the pay increase; if you're for the status quo you'll sell the job loss and gloss over the pay increase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
