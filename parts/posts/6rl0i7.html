		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here are a couple that I always notice:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>) Audio quality. It makes a big difference to have someone's vocal audio sequestered from any foley that occurs in a scene, such as door closes, foot steps, clothing. Everything is normalized together, in the same input mic, so you hear EVERYTHING on the sound stage, including the echoes of every sound in the scene. It may appear that they're walking around in a tuscan villa, but it SOUNDS like they're walking on particle board with no insulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>) Framerate. Not sure why they do this, but they run at 30 or 60 fps, yet snap to 24 FPS when they step outside. This inconsistency is jarring. A higher framerate doesn't make it bad, but it sets it apart from traditional cinematic features that run at 24 FPS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>) Everything is formulaic. Everything. You watch a soap opera from today, and put it next to a soap opera from 30 years ago, and you won't find much difference. Probably just the hair and fashion. LOL! The camera angles, the lighting, the music, and the plot lines are all the same. Scene opens. Music intro. Enter Actor A and Actor B. Actor A's body language clearly shows that they like/dislike Actor B. Camera films Actor A talking to Actor B. Camera films Actor B's reaction, and holds for a music stab on dramatic scene conclusion. It's amazing what simple things like establishing shots, higher/lower/closer/skewed/contextual camera shots do to a scene to make it more visually interesting, and how it changes the context of the dialog.</p>
</li>
<li>) There is no real story, no overarching character plot or development. You're essentially watching dramatic improv revolving around the personal lives of a collective group of individuals in a single location. The show is about how Actor A wrongs Actor B, and how it gets resolved by Actor B retaliating against Actor A, which somehow affects a third party, Actor C. Now, Actor B has done the wronging, Actor C retaliates, and Actor A is somehow wronged. Rinse and repeat. Add as many actors as you like to keep it varied, and maybe broaden the audience's demographic by letting more people connect with more actors with different identitarian traits (gender, race, culture, creed, age, etc...). It's gossip personified, which some people are absolutely fine with wasting their time on, but most of us aren't. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the image, and there are several parts to it; like some people have mentioned, the lighting tends to be very functional; the cameras are also often cheaper, (though even cheap cameras are excellent these days). As far as I know though, frame-rate has very little to do with it - though high frame-rates can give stuff a &quot;hyper-realistic&quot; look, that's not what's going on with soaps. I have no idea why people keep saying it's frame-rates, I mean there's a standard of 25 for PAL or 30 in the US, corresponding to 50Hz and 60Hz, and while you can get some cool effects these days by shooting at multiples of these, it's not like soaps looking cheap is a new phenomenon. </p>
<p><em>EDIT: Looking at some of the other answers, there may be something to this theory when it comes to modern soaps, on modern TVs - &quot;the Hobbit effect&quot;. However, like I said, it's not a new phenomenon, so it's still just a piece of the puzzle.</em></p>
<p>More than anything, there's a lack of serious color correction in post; like I said, most cameras today are actually very good, but just look at your own camera phone - a normal still shot can look terrible, and sometimes kind of &quot;flat&quot;, but add a cool filter, and suddenly it looks almost professional. Same with &quot;home videos&quot; - even with a great camera, they often have this... soap-y look - but give me enough time with some good digital tools, and I (actually, my editor) will make your vacation video look like it was shot by Hoyte van Hoytema. For movies and TV, color correctors will spend ages making sure every single frame has <em>juuuuusst</em> the right look, and correcting any lighting/color errors (and this is where an expensive camera shines, often having more information in each frame, allowing for more correction) . For soap operas, not so much - you just go by the scene lighting, perhaps sometimes putting a general filter on a whole scene if something is actually offensively horrible.</p>
<p><strong><em>However, all these are just symptoms of the real reason</em></strong> - soap operas are designed to be aired 4-5 nights a week, almost year-round. They are produced incredibly cheaply, at an incredible rate; some are shot &quot;as-live&quot;, with almost no retakes (typically 60 minutes shot for 30 minutes on-air), and edited overnight. It's not that the people working with them are incompetent (often quite the opposite), it's just... there's no time. So it's original lighting, barely any color-correction, little to no retakes, and speedspeedspeed.</p>

<p>tl;dr All the &quot;reasons&quot; are just symptoms of the fact that soaps are produced at an incredible rate, for almost no money. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of all of the above, but I'd say that lighting is the most important.</p>
<p>Normally, when a movie or higher-quality television show is filmed, each shot is individually lit. For example, for a dialog between two people, they would set up one camera pointing at one person and light the scene for that camera's benefit. Then, they'd switch it all around to point at the other person and shoot the scene again. Then they edit the two takes together to get one where the point of view changes.</p>
<p>With a soap opera or something else that has to be filmed quickly and/or on a budget, they set up two cameras and do the whole scene in one take. This means that the lighting has to be set up in a more bland way to accommodate two cameras at once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've tried to figure it out too, and the best I can come up with is this:</p>
<p>1) Everything is filmed on a soundstage. There are no outside shots, no city streets, not even any greenscreening. It's all very clearly done on a series of indoor sets. Fake cars, fake trees, no indications of what buildings look like from the outside. This above anything else makes a soap opera feel like some kind of community theatre play.</p>
<p>2) No sound effects. Outside the occasional gunshot or screeching tires, the only sounds are the sappy music and the dialogue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it is because the soap opera seems like a stage performance. The charm (for lack of better word) of soap operas is that they make you feel like you aren't watching a real life scene. It's more like you're sitting in on a theater performance. </p>
<p>This same feeling is the feeling I get with all the new shows on 4k televisions. They seem so real that the setting seems staged now. I'm watching House of Cards these days and I feel like I'm watching a stage performance, when before it felt like I was a fly on the wall in the Oval Office. When you can see every single prop (coffee mugs, folded newspapers etc) you realize that this was intentionally placed by someone and it bothers me now.</p>
<p>But back to soap operas. Soaps have little time to get settings right so they seem natural since they are recording every day almost. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
