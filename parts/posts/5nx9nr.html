		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. It would be much better if they were able to do that and hopefully they will, but it's naive to think that's going to happen anytime soon. Even though we have common enemies to some extent, both sides don't want the same things.</p>
<p>When Obama first took office, he did try to calm things down with Russia. He unilaterally withdrew planned missile defenses from Eastern Europe. He reduced our nuclear arsenal well below treaty limits. In contrast, Russia invaded Georgia (prior to Obama's tenure), he's built up the Russian nuclear arsenal well in excess of treaty violations, is developing new missile technologies Russia which are in blatant violation of treaty, conducted a proxy war in Ukraine, war crimes in Syria, has been flying bombers into West Coast airspace, buzzing US ships and jets, has been enabling Iran's nuclear program, etc.</p>
<p>The US wants peace, stability and to overall maintain its influence and the status quo. Russia is not happy with the status quo and wants to increase its own power and influence. Russian attitudes have grown increasingly disdainful of the US and sanctions employed to curb Russia's behavior only antagonized them further.</p>
<p>Russia hasn't kept to its current treaty agreements and has no intention of doing so. More talking is unlikely to change that...unless...do you have something novel you think they should talk about?</p>
<p>The US has a few options.
1) We do nothing and passively let Russia do what it wants. This avoids escalation for now but emboldens Russia and other nations to take advantage of our absence to do all sorts of things we don't like. This may lead to even larger conflict later (think how European diplomacy failed to prevent WW2).</p>
<p>2) We employ more sanctions. This may weaken Russia but is unlikely to curb behavior. It didn't work in Cuba, it hasn't worked in North Korea and it isn't going to work with Russia. Additionally, our allies in Europe depend on Russian oil among other things, so the sanctions would be fairly limited. We also run the risk of pushing Russia to establish deeper ties with countries who are already our adversaries.</p>
<p>3) We escalate the situation. <em>The point of this is to avoid war. </em> When the US says &quot;Hey man, I have zero intention of fighting you. Let's talk and cool things down,&quot; that does not have the desired effect. It just tells Putin he can do things with impunity since no one will stand up to him. When you say, &quot;you chill the fuck down or I am prepared to annihilate the ever living fuck out of you,&quot; he'd be more inclined to listen. That also risks war and a bad one. On the other hand, shying from conflict now may risk an even larger conflict in the future. </p>
<p>4) We tell Putin he's awesome and we love everything he's doing. We try to be just like him, help him do all sorts of stuff and hope he will see us as his buddies. This achieves none of our policy goals. It enables Russia. It weakens the US.</p>
<p>This situation is a bit different from the Cold War. Back then, the US and the Soviets had 2 very ideogically opposed world views and both thought the other side may risk nuclear attack at any moment. Russia knows we don't want to  nuke them. And we...well...reasonably expect Russia isn't about to nuke us out of the blue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Complicated question. Depends whom one asks. But stuff is political and there are longstanding tensions between the two, so you're unlikely to hear 'yes'. This will probably get long, convoluted and appear to be tangential (there are a lot of threads and it's past midnight). </p>
<p>You have to remember it was only about 25 years ago the USSR dissolved. Before those 25 years there was about 40 years of intense propaganda, competition and distrust on both sides. Those things reduced, but did not halt, after the dissolution. So there are still many, many people who have ingrained in their beliefs that Russia is an enemy. It's become a cultural thing in some respects to continue to view them as an enemy. </p>
<p>Now with respect to Russia and it's recent events, there are two broad camps. There is the Russia is expansionist and a threat to the west view. There is also the view Russia is threatened, acting like a cornered animal and the west fucked up. That second one is rarely repeated even though it is a serious position held in academic circles. Why is it not repeated? A combination of Donald Trump being pro-Russia (and Trump being a very disliked president elect), the above propaganda and anti-Russian culture and western/American exceptionalism (this is  related to the propaganda, but I feel like an elaboration on this would be useful). </p>
<p>What is American/Western Exceptionalism? At it's heart it's the idea that people tend to view themselves as being exceptional. That's not abnormal really, most groups of people (or individuals) tend to justify their actions and beliefs, while struggling to see the viewpoint of the other side. Unfortunately, this can and has lead to a biased and hypocritical view, especially in combination with the propaganda. E.g., how the two other replies at this point justify/explain the actions of the US. One has justified it by saying it's exporting democracy (which is very recent and even then debatable)*. The other has justified it because Russia invaded a country. The problem with this view is the US has invaded more countries, involved in more wars, more interventions etc in recent times (they're completely mistaken to think the US does it far less), so if that's a valid justification we should expect all to abandon the US. Those are two very common justifications by the way and implicit it those is their side is right. There is a kind of cycle where these kinds of views and thinking are shaped by the media at the same time as shaping the media. </p>
<p>*I've heard it said western exceptionalism is the modern equivalent to white mans burden. An interesting thought whether you agree or not. </p>
<p>And on top of all of that complexity, there does exist real conflicts in interests. The EU and NATO want to expand eastward, the US supports both (and it makes sense strategically from their own perspectives). Russia views the encroaching of those organisations as threats. They back different sides in Syria (again, makes sense from the respective positions). </p>
<p>TLDR</p>
<p>It's the combination of historic, cultural, political factors as well as conflicts of interest that gives the appearance of it not be acceptable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn't it make sense if they sat down &amp; talked things out?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might, it depends on if it were to result in any change. It really is difficult to tell from where we stand. For instance, if one were to view China as the enemy (and Trump does seem to be signalling that at the moment) it makes sense to try and deprive China of their friends, friends like Russia. In that case increased ties to Russia would be very important. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because both are great powers with conflicting interest. Russia isn't a model of democracy, but that's not really the reason why the US isn't friend with them. Saudi Arabia is probably worst than russia in that department, but their interest somehow align with those of the US.</p>
<p>Ukraine. Both the US and Russia don't really care about what the people in Ukraine really want. The US want to expand their influence in the region and limit Russia's influence. Russia on the other hand feel threaten. Think about it, poland, hungary, baltics, etc. They are used to be friendly with russia. It's a great buffer zone to protect your territory. Missile are thousand kilometer away from your border and so are enemy troops. But now the US have anti-missile shield unit in Poland, Romania and Turkey. Hell they even have nuclear missile in Turkey and Germany. Russia also have lost of alot of their access to the Meditterean. They still had a base in Sevastopol that their lease from Ukraine, but with Ukraine possible joining NATO, they just couldn't protect their trading line anymore. Russia just used the presence of Russia speaking people in Ukraine to protect their interest there. Not really democratic, but I pretty sure the US would be doing the same if needed. They invaded a couple of country for the same reason in the last 60 years.</p>
<p>Syria. A lot of people think that the involvement in of Russia and US in syria is to back their own friend in the region and prepare work for a pipeline. The US back Saudi-Arabia and Qatar pipeline going from Qatar to Turkey go through all US ally except Syria to sell Arabian oil to europe. But their is also a Russian backed pipeline going from Iran to Syrian mediterrean port for export. Syria is highly unlikely to allow both pipeline going through and the winner will have a huge economic advantage in the years after the war.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A normal, positive, bilateral relationship first requires both sides to honor their agreements and act responsibly.  Russia has invaded it's neighbors to oppose their desires for closer ties to the West -including invading and annexing a portion of Ukraine, ignored its treaty obligations, ramped up confrontational tactics (illegal flyovers, subs in national waters, irresponsible confrontational maneuvers around allied military planes and vessels) with NATO nations, and used hacking and disinformation campaigns to sow discord and meddle in the elections of the US and our allies. </p>
<p>Ignoring all of that and saying, &quot;Aw shucks, let's be friends, pretty please?&quot;  doesn't promote normal, positive, bilateral relations. It legitimizes the illegal and/or dangerous actions of a bullying nation.  If and when Russia returns to operating within the bounds of responsible society, they'd be welcomed within it.  Now?  It's always a bad idea to legitimize a bully and his tactics.  Of course with trump coming to power, it seems Putin has a chance of getting the US to agree to just that.  Disgraceful. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Countries that try to become some sort of Empire (in the economic sense) or at least dominate those around them have a problem if another country tries to be an Empire. </p>
<p>Why do you want to be an empire? Basically it is about getting ressources to produce things with and markets to sell those things to, there might be ideology and military strategy in it, but it basically is about ressources and markets. From that follows everything else: You want to keep your markets? You need to control the seaways from and to. You need to have some sort of military control over your areas of influence to not lose them.</p>
<p>Now imagine there are two or three or five of those &quot;big countries that want to be Empires&quot; and obviously there will be intersections of the areas they want influence in. Obviously, there are &quot;problems&quot; that arise. </p>
<p>For example take Syria: Russia has influence in that area via their local dicator, the US wants the russian influence gone, as such the russian-friendly local dicator. Russia wants to keep it. The US wants it gone. This is just an extreme case, but the world is littered with &quot;areas of influence&quot; of this &quot;country that wants to be an Empire&quot; or &quot;that other one&quot;.</p>
<p>This, in a pretty simple nutshell, is geopolitics explained. </p>
<p>It lead to the european powers start WWI (GB, Germany, France, Austria, Russia, Italy), GB and France start wars in Africa, Japan to attack the US in WWII (they wanted a pacific-empire), the Vietnam-War (US vs. Russia), China having problems with the US over Taiwan, ...</p>
<p>The &quot;sitting down and talking it out&quot; has precedences in history. For example during some parts of the Cold War there was an agreement of &quot;Don't fudge with our areas, we don't fudge with yours&quot;, which mostly worked. You also had the then-superpowers Spain and Portugal basically split the world among themselves 1494, simply because they knew that a big conflict would destroy them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
