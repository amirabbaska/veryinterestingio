		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In some animals, fasting inhibits the action of myostatin. Myostatin is the hormone that break down muscle tissue. When you eat enough nutrients your muscles will always want to grow. It's their natural state. They're prevented from constantly growing by the presence of myostatin. </p>
<p>Google images of myostatin dogs and cows. Those animals are jacked, but it's not like they're hitting the gym or getting supplemental testoerone. They've genetically mutated to have more expression of myostatin inhibitor genes.</p>
<p>In humans, fasting also increases the levels of human growth hormone, which is also muscle sparing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bears can apparently recycle the urea that they produce (urea is a byproduct of protein breakdown). I'm not sure if this is common among other hibernating animals, but according to this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/21/science/hibernating-bears-emerge-with-hints-about-human-ills.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">random NYT article</a>, urea from their urine has turned up in various proteins. While myostatin down-regulation is definitely part of the answer (and definitely happens), it's not the whole story. Bears seem to have some ability to rebuild the protein that they break down while hibernating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscle degeneration during hibernation would have been a major disadvantage... natural selection would immediately favour any variant or mutant that could put degeneration on pause during hibernation. </p>
<p>This is different from non-hibernation situations of declining muscle mass, where a decreased use of muscles may demonstrate a lesser need for muscles, and so a lesser need to maintain them. Wasting resources on unnecessary muscle mass is also a major disadvantage in the wild.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, that's &quot;why&quot;. Fortunately, someone has piped in up too about the physiological pathways affected, so the whole story is here</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>muscle degeneration isn't just what happens to all muscles if they don't get used, it's an evolutionary trait.  it happens to people because it's advantageous to people to lose superfluous muscle.   but that wouldn't make sense for hibernators because the muscles that go unused in hibernation aren't superfluous so that trait never became a thing.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
