		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You often hear left-handed people (in left-to-right countries) complain about the fact that their palms smudge pencil lead on paper, leading to an awkward, hand-unsupported way of writing. Some even complain of hand and wrist pain. I imagine this would have been worse when very wet and smudgeable inks were the main medium of writing.</p>
<p>Why then, (assuming most civilisations are right-handed) are there some civilisations which write right to left? Wouldn't the development of writing that way be seen as disadvantageous because of the amount of inconvenience?</p>
<p>I'm less curious about writing horizontally vs vertically because I don't see any drawbacks to either that would lead to one being particularly dominant, so the existence of both isn't very notable to me. I do notice that right-to-left writing does seem to prefer writing vertically down though, so maybe it's important after all.</p>
<p>Edit: Is the difference between right-to-left and left-to-right whether they started with ink or chisels? That would explain it well I think. Ink-based civilisations would write left-to-right since they're holding the &quot;pen&quot; in their right hand, whereas chisel-based civilisations would write right-to-left because they're holding the chisel in their left hand and the hammer in their right, hammering towards the left (that's how I use chisels and hammers anyway). Chisel writing isn't particularly quick, but around the time of the advent of writing itself I don't think speed was much of a concern.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can’t speak for other languages, but for Chinese, the tradition is to write in on bamboo slates, vertically from top to bottom. When a slate is filled, it is removed so ink smudges was never a problem. It’s possible that they use their right hand to do both writing and slate-moving, so right-to-left makes it easier. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>However, I believe also arab countries had (maybe even still have) strong feelings against being left-handed and still write R-L.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
