		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Echoing what the others say, it's all about &quot;available water&quot;.</p>
<p>Salt and sugar does the same thing - draw water away, or make the water too salty/sugary for bacteria to live in it.</p>
<p>Things that change the acidity kind of does the same thing - they make the water inhospitable, so the bacteria can't live in it.</p>
<p>You can also make a mix of the two, using a bit of vinegar and a bit of sugar.</p>
<p>Drying something also takes away the water.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is what is done with jellies and jam and fruit preserve and a lot of other things - olives too.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing that's different from all of these only works on things that are sterile - you can cover the outside in something that's toxic.</p>
<p>The toxic thing can be a mold, strangely enough - because the mold makes toxins to protect itself, so other bacteria and molds can't survive. But it means you have to cut the outside away when you want to use it, and then you can't leave it, because you've opened a door for bacteria and different molds to &quot;enter&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Camembert is like this - the outer layer is a living mold that kills everything else.</li>
</ul>
<p>The toxic thing can also be residue from smoke  because the thin outer layer is toxic, the bacteria can't enter. We can take a big bite of it, though, because the layer is very thin, so there's not enough toxin to affect us.</p>
<ul>
<li>bacon and fish are often preserved like this</li>
</ul></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jumping in here, and speaking almost strictly from a microbe standpoint (as opposed to oxidation or chemical degradation) salt and sugar are already mentioned at length and they preserve food by making water unavailable to microbes because the concentration of salt or sugar is too high.</p>
<p>Another very common preservative what I don't see mentioned is acid.  Low pH also prevents microbes from growing - particularly dangerous ones.  This is one reason why you will see anything from baby food to beverages to mayonnaise with acid added especially citric, phosphoric, vinegar, lemon juice, and a favorite ascorbic (aka vitamin C). PH is also a primary reason that beer and wine cannot harbor pathogens although alcohol helps a lot with that too. </p>
<p>Speaking of which alcohol is a great preservative and is primarily reason homemade (highly alcoholic) eggnog won't kill you even if it's kept in a bottle for weeks or months. </p>
<p>The preservatives you may be asking about are chemicals like potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate which prevent microbes from growing via chemical means. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All a preservative is, the whole thing, is something that makes stuff not go bad as fast.</p>
<p>The two most common preservatives are sugar and salt. They work by soaking up all the water so there is no water left for bacteria, fungi, etc. to use to grow. No water, no growth, means your food lasts longer.</p>
<p>I don't know enough about the other types of preservatives, so I'll pass the baton.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I'd like to know is how they preserve lettuce in bags, because they have to do <em>something</em>. If I buy a head of romaine and chop it and put it in a bag, it will last a day or two tops before turning brown, limp and useless. If I buy <a href="http://www.dolesalads.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/blends_choppedromaine.png" target="_blank">a bag of chopped romaine</a>, that shit stays perfect for up to two weeks. And yet, every single bag says &quot;Preservative-Free&quot; on it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
