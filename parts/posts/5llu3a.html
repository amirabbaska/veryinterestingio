		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were once some smart guys that realized that math problems that can be solved by humans can also be solved by machines if we can come up with some kind of sequence of steps to tell the machine what to do to carry out the computation. This set of instructions is called an algorithm. Church-Turing relates computability (i.e. the potential for a problem to be solved by a machine) to the properties of the machine and the underlying algorithms that the computer is operating on. </p>
<p>Specifically the machine must satisfy these conditions: a) it must support abstract assignment of numbers and b) it must support bounded AND potentially unbounded iteration. Basically this means that you can tell the computer what symbols represent what (like saying &quot;x = 3&quot;) and you can tell it to do something over and over until some condition is met (like saying &quot;while x is TRUE: do y&quot;). If a machine supports these physical functions it is called a Turing machine. If a programming language supports programming this kind of behavior, it is called Turing complete. Today, we take it for granted that all computers are basically Turing machines and all languages are Turing complete. I say basically a Turing machine because a Turing machine is a math model for a real computer. A Turing machine is not constrained by run time or memory bounds (which real computers are).</p>
<p>Now the deeper, philosophical implications of Church-Turing is that it goes both ways, meaning that not only can any algorithm on the natural numbers be programmed for execution on a Turing machine, but humans <em>can only discover algorithms that could be executed by a Turing machine</em>. It makes a lot of sense, because you basically can't describe an algorithm to another person, or even yourself, without assuming some basic formalities on how the steps will be executed. Church-Turing outlines these basic formalities and relates it to the physical properties of a machine that is designed to solve any math problem. </p>
<p>Hope this answer is good. My understanding of this thesis comes from my CS minor and the book Godel, Escher, Bach by Douglass Hofstadter. I highly recommend that book if you're interested in computation and its relation to human activities and philosophy. It really is a gem of non-fiction.</p>
<p>edit: Forgot to mention the Turing test. The test is supposed to be the benchmark for a computer being indistinguishable from a human. However, we have built machines that pass the Turing test (at least on some samples) that are most certainly not intelligent. You can look up the rules for The Turing test, but modern computer scientists don't really take it seriously anymore because we've realized that the rules for the test are much too lenient to really serve as an identifier of an intelligent machine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Church-Turing thesis is a proof of what computability is.  It basically says that if you can write a program to do something, that program can be written as a Turing Machine and as the 'Lamda-Calculus'.  Both the Turing Machine and the lamda-calculus are not particularly useful for actually computing stuff because they are sort of just mathematical constructs, but it is important to be able to ground computability in math.  It also says that there are certain tasks that computers are incapable of solving, but that's a bit more minor.  The Turing test is a completely different thing that deals with knowing whether or not an AI is actually intelligent, or, at least how good it is at pretending to be a human.  I'm happy to go into more detail about either of those things if you would like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank">Turing Test</a> and what it's point is:</p>
<p>At one point, some people said that you could make a computer intelligent.</p>
<p>Some other people said that a computer couldn't really be intelligent, because there was something special about humans that let them be intelligent but wouldn't let computers be intelligent.</p>
<p>The argument got bogged down in philosophical questions over what really counted as &quot;being intelligent&quot;.  Some people thought that this wasn't really important.  One man, Mr. Dijkstra, summed this up as &quot;The question of whether machines can think is about as relevant as the question of whether submarines can swim.&quot;  People were simply arguing over what the definition of intelligence should <em>be</em>, instead of what we could actually make computers do.</p>
<p>Mr. Turing wanted to break this argument, because he didn't think that it was very important.  What Mr. Turing proposed was the idea that if a computer acted in a way that externally, we couldn't tell it apart from a human, then we should not get hung up on what's happening internally in the computer, and just say that the computer was intelligent.  That is, we should <em>define</em> &quot;intelligence&quot; by what we can see externally and not by trying to analyze the way the artificial intelligence works.</p>
<p>I like to compare this to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism" target="_blank">behaviorism</a> movement in psychology.  Psychology used to have all sorts of mystic and dubious ideas attached to it, and had people not really doing a good job of measuring things.  Part of the effort to make it more of a real science was the introduction of behaviorism, where we stopped asking people to try to describe what was happening inside their head and simply started measuring how people actually acted, since this could be externally-measured.</p>
<p>Anyway, there is a famous counterargument against using Mr. Turing's test as a definition for intelligence from a philosopher named John Searle called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room" target="_blank">Chinese room argument</a>.   Mr. Searle proposed an example that most people would agree does not intuitively &quot;feel&quot; like intelligence to us.  However, it could pass the Turing test, and so it could be an argument against using Mr. Turing's test to treat something as intelligent, since it would include some things that don't &quot;feel&quot; intelligent to us.</p>
<p>There are also some contests that computer scientists have for fun where people try to make computer &quot;pass the Turing Test&quot;, and fool someone into thinking that they are human, but that's not really the point of Mr. Turing's proposal.  He wasn't trying to really have computers pass or not pass -- he just wanted to say that whether they're intelligent or not should be judged based on how they act, not how they work internally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Church-Turing thesis says that if a computer has certain basic properties (defined  as Turing machine), it is capable of computing anything that can be computed.  Given sufficient time and resources, your phone can do anything a network of supercomputers can.</p>
<p>The Turing Test is something completely different.  Turing posited that if a computer's responses were indistinguishable from a human's, that could be taken as sign of innate intelligence.</p>
<p>Note that the Turing Test is <strong>extremely</strong> misunderstood.  It is not some sort of threshold to intelligence.  When computers first started to be useful, there was a philosophical question whether or not machines could think.  People offered all sort of objections to the notion, computers were not conscious, computers had no souls, computers could not be creative, computers cold not learn, etc.  In his landmark 1950 paper, <em>Computing Machinery and Intelligence</em>, Turing used the Turing Test as sort of a thought experiment to help dismantle these objections.  He never intended it to be any sort of rigorous test of a computers capabilities.  In fact, today the test is less about a computer's ability, and more about human psychology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
