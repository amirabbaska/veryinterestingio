<p><a href="http://reviverestore.org/events/tedxdeextinction/the-first-de-extinction/" target="_blank">Alberto Fernández-Arias</a>, head of the Hunting, Fishing and Wetland department in Aragon, Spain worked with his team in 2003 to bring a bucardo (a species of wild goat) back from extinction using cloning methodology. It was the first successful de-extinction. Unfortunately, the cloned bucardo only survived 10 minutes and died of respiratory failure.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you count extinct in the wild, I know of at least one case, the <a href="https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/conservation/birds/california-condor" target="_blank">California condor</a>. The population got so low that all 27 surviving birds were rounded up into captivity in 1987. They've bred the population back up to several hundred, including 170 in the wild in California as of 2017, but it's a little too soon to call them &quot;back&quot; for sure. I'd be surprised if there aren't more examples, I just happened to stumble on this one by chance on a wiki walk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We’re so much closer to bringing back a more recently extinct species (like the Northern White Rhino, technically a subspecies, effectively extinct when the last known male died earlier this year) that we have well-preserved samples and intact genomes for than an ancient species like the wooly mammoth that we’d have to piece back together. The current plan is to make the IVF technology more efficient due to very precious, limited samples before using a Southern White Rhino as a surrogate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although true extinct species resurrection may not be possible, scientist are attempting a much simpler trait resurrection.  This involves using the DNA of a preserved wooly mammoth and splicing it with the mammoth’s closest living relative, the Asian elephant, reducing habitat restrictions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
