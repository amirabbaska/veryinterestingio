		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a factory in the 1960's.  They say they don't discriminate against women, because they have front office staff who are women.</p>
<p>They say they don't discriminate against black people, because they hire some black people in the factory floor.</p>
<p>The problem is that they only hire men for the factory floor, and they only hire whites in the office.  If your identity is both black and a woman (the intersection of the two), then the company will never hire you.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The discrimination you, as a unique individual, face is the result of the intersection of all the aspects of your identity.  This was was not widely thought about in historical social justice movements, because feminism was concerned about women and racial justice organizations were concerned about racial minorities, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are ways that society could change, to be more fair to <strong>women.</strong></p>
<p>There are ways that society could change, to be more fair to <strong>gay people.</strong></p>
<p><em>However.</em></p>
<p>Many of these ways would not make society fair to <strong>black gay women</strong>.</p>
<p>The problems that you can have on account of being <em>both P and Q</em> are not just the sum of the problems that people have by being <em>P</em> plus the problems that people have by being <em>Q</em>. There can be separate <em>P and Q</em> problems. And even if we solved all the <em>P</em> problems and, separately, solved all the <em>Q</em> problems, that doesn't actually mean that we solved all the <em>P and Q</em> problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kimberle Crenshaw coined the term, though the concept had been thrown around a lot before her by people like Audre Lorde or by the combahee river collective. The idea is that bigotry and oppression manifest in different ways depending on our identity.</p>
<p>Things like racism and sexism exist, but popular narratives frame them usually in only certain ways. Crenshaw noted that while women weren’t allowed suffrage until 1920, there were other laws preventing citizenship for women of other races from voting. Not only that, the suffrage movement discounted the voices of black women and their inclusion for the sake of the success of their movement. In that sense, sexism manifested differently between white women and other women.</p>
<p>Another example Crenshaw uses is domestic abuse. We like to think shelters from abuse are easily accessible, but factors like immigration status can curtail that access. Immigrant women might not leave abusers due to fear of being deported. And language barriers might not even prevent immigrants from getting information on where they can find a shelter, but shelters sometimes turn women away due to not having bilingual resources.</p>
<p>Ultimately, intersectionality is simply recognizing that oppression and bigotry doesn’t always manifest in a singular manner, and we need to account for that. Black women don’t experience sexism in the same way that white women do, and they don’t experience racism in the same way that black men do. Acting intersectionally involves taking into account a spectrum identities on an issue and listening to people we hear from less to move beyond the simpler, more popular narratives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the concept that we have to look at and consider the intersections of different demographics. For instance, women have a hard time in Western Society. Black people have a hard time in Western Society. But specifically thinking about how Black Women have problems that other women, and other black people don't. Intersectionality is the idea that we have to consider that people often belong to multiple groups, and that their experiences are different than those who aren't such. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ll try this - People don’t fit in only one category at a time. They fit in several. We’re not just white. We’re also women. And Asian. And rural. And low-earners. And, and, and. </p>
<p>Depending on how those categories interact, you can look a lot like the other Asian people or not at all like them. You could look like other rural people one way, and completely unlike them in another. </p>
<p>This is relevant when we talk about equality for this-or-that group, marketing to this-or-that group, programs or laws to right a wrong directed at this or that group. Black people might have a certain shared experience with prejudice but black people who are gay women and high earners might have a very different experience. So when we talk about justice, equality, oppression, reform, and reconciliation, and all the laws, systems, cultural norms that enact those things, we have to see the whole system and the whole person.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
