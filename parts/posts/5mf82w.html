		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides what's already been explained, I'll just pitch in a bit of anecdotal explanation:  </p>
<p>Mother's been in the nail industry for over a decade and owned her own salon for two years, I myself have been involved at the front/in business management for about five years.  </p>
<p>Despite her college education in Korea, her foreign degree amounted to essentially nothing at the time we arrived in the US (2000s). With few roots in the country and therefore almost no connections to get her a stable job, she stumbled upon the nail industry via a fellow church member (Korean churches and other similar monocultural institutions are invaluable resources for new immigrants in the US). The work was relatively easy, obtaining licenses wasn't too difficult (plus she could work unlicensed and learn in a real-time environment), and there were tons of other fellow Koreans in a similar situation, meaning she had coworkers she could communicate clearly with and learn from quickly.  </p>
<p>Time goes on, she gets better at the work and becomes fully licensed with lots of experience, climbs up to a managerial position but still works just as much as other employees. Work starts to get harder, more stressful with managing employees and the inevitable side-eye/dislike that comes with being a boss of sorts. </p>
<p>She gets tired of the talking behind her back and finds herself starting to disagree with the owner, decides that starting her own business may be the best option for herself (to rest her deteriorating wrist because of work and get away from the whole gossip drama thing).  </p>
<p>Buys a pre-existing nail salon from Chinese owners, sets up shop.  </p>
<p>A commenter in here was asking why Asian immigrants seem to be more disposed to this work than others, and as another commenter explained, it seems to be purely because of tradition/a long-established status quo. I have seen a number of black-owned/employed shops and white-owned/employed shops, but they're often associated with higher/lower costs/quality. Guess Asians are just the standard given their long history in the industry?  </p>
<p>Also want to add that because so many salons are Asian, so are salon supply stores -- stronger communication/language compatibility between supply store and salon means possibly better prices and service, so this may deter some non-Asians from utilizing the often cheaper supply stores, raising their costs and so on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once a community of people has established themselves within an industry, they will help other members of the same community to expand their business within that industry. So the owners of Korean or Vietnamese owned nail salons will help their friends and family to open more nail salons, South Asian/Middle Eastern bodega owners and taxi drivers will help their friends and family to open more bodegas, or buy more taxis. </p>
<p>Many industries within a city, state or region will become dominated by a single or a few close-knit communities of people helping each other to maintain dominance in that industry. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Already saw Tippi Hedren mentioned here and her contribution to training the Vietnamese women refugees to become beauticians. As more and more refugees arrived, they all got into the trade because of the refugees that arrived before and were trained. Made the language barrier a little easier to overcome and established steady jobs.</p>
<p>Another interesting story similar is how most donut shops came to be owned and operated by Cambodians. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Ngoy" target="_blank">Ted Ngoy</a> fell in love with donuts after working at a Winchell's, worked his way up and eventually opened up his own store. Started to hire Cambodian refugees and had them operate all of his stores through handshake agreements. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We had a store next to a Chinese restaurant many years ago. The owner came here from China and a relative of his who was already established in the US with his own restaurant took the guy under his wing and helped him get started. Little by little, more and more relatives from China started showing up and working there. They all lived together in a tiny shitty apartment and worked like crazy. When they made enough money, they bought a second restaurant, and half the family went there. They both kept bringing more family over, living cheap, and saving for more restaurants and the cycle repeated. Their business model was somewhat like amoebas where they split and grow exponentially. </p>
<p>I'm guessing the Asian nail salons are similar in that regard. You have a bunch of family to support and guide you, and help you get established in your own business.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
