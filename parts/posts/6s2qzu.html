<p>Salt preserves food (by drying it) and is readily attainable (from the sea). Pepper preserves meat (piperine kills bacteria and repels maggots but is harmless to humans). </p>
<p>Over time, cultures that embraced preservatives like this prospered and their cuisine spread. In India, they use a whole different set of spices. In China, there are even two different words for spices called La and Ma (edit see below). One is fiery like capsaicin and the other, referring to Szechuan pepper corn, is electric like a battery on your tongue. It's amazing. </p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> side note: people seem really curious about Szechuan peppercorn. It actually used to be illegal in the US but <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/food/amp/The-Szechuan-peppercorn-is-back-after-a-long-term-1265515.php" target="_blank">as of 2005 you can now buy it</a> </p>
<p>The reason salt and pepper came to grace restaurant tables with all those other spices out there is <strong>French cooking and Louis XIV. </strong></p>
<p>At the time that formal dining came into fashion, French culture was influential throughout the western world. Louis XIV was an influential man as the king of France. He didn't like as much salt or pepper in his food but others did so he created the custom of having his chefs put it on the table rather than cooked in. The custom spread and western culture helped spread it all over the world. </p>
<p>Edit: black pepper contains piperine not capsaicin.
Edit 2: Chinese is hard. La (not Lada) and Ma are more nuanced and appear to refer to different things. La is the word spicy generically. And by region (Hunan vs Szechuan) Ma la refers to the numbing spice (that I described as electric feeling) see the comments below for detail. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add something slightly different to most posts I want to mention our nervous system, which works using salt (sodium ions). <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK50958/" target="_blank">Your taste buds are more receptive</a> in the presence of salt. Because of this, if you use a suitable amount of salt you can enhance the taste of almost any food. Be aware though, if you regularly use a lot of salt (but not so much to make the food taste disgusting) when you return to eating food with less salt it may appear to taste worse.</p>
<p>As such, this 'enhance all taste' property of salt is desirable for the dinner table.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt is an essential electrolyte.  We need to have regular intake, just like other animals that will seek out salt licks, etc.  If we don't have enough salt, or replenish it at regular enough intervals, cramps and other signaling/electrolyte problems will arise.  For the same reason, we have evolved taste receptors that make any food with salt in it &quot;taste&quot; better to us.</p>
<p>Pepper aids in digestion and pepperin, a component of pepper, helps the intestines uptake nutrients.  So it's a co-factor in our getting better nutrients in our diet.  For the same reason, it tastes good to us (much of our sense of taste has evolved around things we need).</p>
<p>Things that we need to intake almost daily and/or with virtually every meal, are integrated into our sense of taste as seeming to complement everything rather than fundamentally altering the flavor profiles of foods.  These things are known as seasonings, rather than spices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It got 'common' by desire for it. If you mean 'common' by quantity, that's to do with trade routes opening up.
The Romans started it off - the sole Roman cookbook, purported to be written by Apicius, calls for pepper in 80% of the recipes, and Pliny the Elder moans about why pepper should excite so much enthusiasm amongst his contemporaries, considering that it cost so much to bring it from the East.
On to the mediaeval period, pepper served a number of uses, including humoural - some foods were considered dangerous (eels for example, because they look like snakes) and so you needed to counter-balance or offset humours in food with spices - pepper being a hot, dry humour. They were also used in almost every dish concocted and therefore demand drove the spice trade.
Related to this, spices in general were also used as medicine - I can't find much on pepper as medicine, but it was used to stifle a cold (being hot).
There's also the allure of spices: spices were generally associated with Paradise - or being close to it - Prester John's land was supposed to have forests of pepper, which was only 3 days journey from paradise.
As for the amount of pepper, that comes through the spice trade. Because generally it came from the Far East it cost an awful lot originally, but even that was dependant on the levels of import - some years it could cost you a lot of money (163 Gold dinars in Alexandria in 1333 for 500lbs), some years it would drop precipitously (11 years later in Alexandria, it had dropped to 75 dinars per 500lbs). As trade opened up with the East, pepper imports grew - during the 15th century, Venetian merchants brought in an average of 400 tonnes of pepper from Alexandria. Once the route to India had been discovered by the Portuguese, this only increased - one estimate of 4 Venetian galleys brought in 4 million pounds of spices (not all of it pepper), and another convey the following year brought in 2 million pounds, pepper making up about 1/2 of that amount. As pepper was generally in the hands of the Portuguese (and later the Dutch), they had a habit of raising the prices - and by the 1500s, pepper was an every commodity that you couldn't do without - this is why Queen Elizabeth I was so interested to support expeditions to find pepper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Hold my beer while I butcher it.</p>
<p>Salt suppresses bitter tastes/unpleasant flavours in a lot (all?) foods. Which gives a more balanced flavour which humans like. You can add a small amount to coffee beans that are a bit old to negate the &quot;old and bitter&quot; flavour coffee gets later on.</p>
<p>Given the choice, we'll tolerate something that's too salty over something that's too bitter.</p>
<p>Pepper has crude antibacterial properties that humans can also tolerate/consume (there are other things that are anti bacterial but also anti-human). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
