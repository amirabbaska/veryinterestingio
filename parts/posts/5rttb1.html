		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI13: The Thalamus is the brains stimulus filter. it decides what stimuli are important enough to be processed. The humming of electricity, the feeling of your underwear against your butt, and the smell of wet dog in your house are ignored. Your thalamus has determined that these things are not dangerous and you can ignore them. A siren passing in the distance, a bomb going off, or a bright flashing light will attract your attention because it is different and considered important.
When you are asleep, your thalamus works the same way but on a more lenient system. Some stimuli might wake you up but if it isnt important enough you will fall back asleep without even remembering (a light turning on in the hallway or a dog barking). Others might keep you up for hours (a door slam, gun shot or the smell of smoke). It all depends on the type of stimulation and how important your thalamus decides it is for you to be awake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we sleep, we are inhibiting loads of different parts of the brain, so a stronger stimulus is required to activate them. </p>
<p>Think of it like this - when we are awake there is a copper wire between the auditory centre of the brain and the higher centres of our brain that process and understand this auditory information and then respond to it. Copper is a very conductive metal, so even a very small voltage will mean that electricity passes through this circuit. </p>
<p>When we go to sleep, this copper wire is switched out with a lead wire. Now lead can still conduct electricity, but it is much less conductive than copper. This means that a much higher voltage is required to get any activity in the circuit. Standard, background sounds of the night are unlikely to provide a big enough voltage to get a current to run though the wire. A really loud sound, however, will provide enough voltage and will wake us up. Other sounds that have very strong associations in our memory, e.g. our ringtone, alarm tone or a doorbell, may also provide enough voltage in the circuit even if they're a bit quieter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might be after the Reticular Formation nuclei within the brainstem. </p>
<p>Wiki briefly explains their role during sleep, acting as a filter to external stimuli. Repeated and expected noise such as ambient traffic noise or the distant chatter of people at a library for instance, will not be a hindrance to sleep. </p>
<p>Sudden unexpected noises will be passaged to the cerebrum for conscious attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_formation#Function" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_formation#Function</a></p>
<p>This may be an interesting article, discussing the neurodegeneration of the ReticForm in Parkison's Disease and the effects on sleep:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The RAS (reticular activating system) which is actually a diffuse network. </p>
<p>It responds to all the senses except for smell. One time I had a college student ask me if the RAS didnt respond to smell how someone would wake up when they were given ammonia to smell (a common way of trying to wake an unconscious person) - the answer is they arent waking due to the smell but because ammonia irritates the mucosa of the nasal passages. </p>
<p>The RAS distinguishes between things important to good survival and things not. So if you move to a lake and there are ducks quacking all night, they may keep you up a few nights but soon you will learn to filter and tune them out and sleep right through the quacking.</p>
<p>it is also why if you suddenly start dating someone who drives a specific car you will suddenly see that make of car EVERYWHERE. Because you are interested in breeding with them, passing on DNA and its important to survival - you will notice things related to your sexual partner.</p>
<p>What is important to me is that we filter things related to success.</p>
<p>I wrote a small self-published book of true stories designed to help condition a persons RAS to filter in things for success, and filter out things for failure. </p>
<p>There are always opportunities to succeed or fail around us and some people notice the opportunities and some notice the opportunities to fail.  </p>
<p>The stories are designed to change the filter a person has to success. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>at about 900 comments, i figure there's a halfway decent answer already. To supplement, it should be noted that even if you don't wake up, the quality of your sleep is thought to be affected if you're exposed to high intensity and irregular noises. Living near an airport, for instance, is thought to increase your risk of a cardiovascular disease even if you say that you don't mind it or enjoy it or whatever. </p>

<p>so while you might not literally wake up when you hear an airplane overhead, the evidence does seem to indicate that you do, &quot;wake up,&quot; in the sense that there is a physiological response.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
