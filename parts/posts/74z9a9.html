I've also been told this is due to the nuclear binding energy, which is released when the nucleus is brought together from its constituent parts. (I guess a sub question I have is where the nuclear binding energy come from, is it taken from the neutrons and protons' masses, which results in the decrease?)</p>
<p>I've also been told by the same teacher that nucleons are much heavier than the quarks which make them up, and this mass is energy that comes from the strong force. This seems like the same scenario as the previous one... But why does the mass increase here? </p>
<p>Why do nuclei get lighter when brought together from constituent parts, whereas neutrons and protons themselves get much heavier when created from their own constituents (quarks)?</p>
<p>I know there's something I'm missing here but I really can't figure it out. Thanks in advance!</p></div></div>

<p>It doesn't make sense to try to &quot;locate&quot; the binding energy. It is a property of the whole nucleus.</p>
<hr />
<p>Typically bound states (like atoms, nuclei, planetary systems, ...) have lower energies than the individual components together. If they have more energy, the components can just fly apart, and if that is possible it will happen eventually.</p>
<p>Hadrons (like protons and neutrons) are special. Their quarks cannot just fly apart, because that would lead to isolated quarks, something that doesn't exist in nature. If you still try to separate them, you have to put in so much energy that you create new particles in the process - and then the particles have more energy than the particle you started with. In that aspect the situation is still similar to other bound states: To split the system you have to put in energy.</p>
<p>Why is the neutron and proton mass so large compared to the quark masses? This is a more complicated question. Protons and neutrons are very complex objects. Describing them via their valence quarks (two up one down or two down one up, respectively) only is not very accurate, most of what makes up these particles comes from the strong interaction itself. The proton and neutron mass doesn't depend strongly on the quark masses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, the reason why the mass of 6 free protons and 6 free neutrons is larger than that of a carbon-12 atom is indeed due to binding energy. In order for a stable bound state to occur, the bound state must have a lower evergy to that of the un-bound state, otherwise the constituent particles will prefer to wander off. The difference in those energies is called the binding energy, and it has to come from somewhere. Due to mass-energy equivalence this somewhere is the mass of the constituent particles. This is true for all bound states, including the atom. </p>
<p>Inside a proton things are wildly different, as seen by the fact that the total mass of the three quarks which makes the proton only amounts to about 1% of the total mass of the proton. The rest comes from the gluon field, the field associated with the strong force. The mass of the proton is the invariant mass of the system of quarks and gluons that makes it, that includes the mass of the quarks and their kinetic energies but more importantly the energy of the gluon field that binds them together, which is certaintly the largest contributor due to the immense strength of the strong force. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could go pretty far down a quantum rabbit hole answering this question, but I'll give you the short version: most of the energy of a nucleon is in the strong force's equivalent of light waves. If you're adopting a particle view of the nucleon, you'd think of this as the kinetic energy of the quarks and gluons. Or in a wave model, you'd think of it as the vibrational energy of the waves. Hopefully it makes sense that if you want to get a particle moving or a wave vibrating, you need to put in some positive amount of energy to do that; well, in a nucleon, it's as if that has already been done and the energy is already in there, so that amount of energy contributes to the nucleon's mass.</p>
<p>Binding energy is something entirely different. It doesn't come from motion, it comes from position, so the classical analogue would be <em>potential</em> energy. Imagine you have two rocks far apart and you want to get them close together (but keeping all else equal, i.e. still not moving). You'd actually need to <em>remove</em> some energy to do that - we call this adding a <em>negative</em> amount of energy - because otherwise when they get close they'd be going really fast. That negative amount of energy is the binding energy. It's not associated with either of the two rocks specifically, it's associated with the interaction between them. And it's the same way with nucleons. When they get close together, unless they're flying past each other at high speed, the interactions between them have some negative amount of energy, which is the binding energy. It's not associated with one nucleon or the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because I haven't yet seen the following stated, I feel like I need to add:</p>
<p>If you consider a system of two separated quarks (this system is not dynamically stable, but you can theoretically consider this configuration), and you weighed the <em>total</em> system, it would weigh more than the bound state of the same two quarks. There will be a huge amount of energy in the configuration, which would also consist of a huge flux of the quantum chromodynamical force in a tube connecting them, which would contribute to a large mass-energy. So the situation is not really that different from the EM case. (In fact, this explains confinement - the energy in this tube is so large that you can create more quarks out of the vacuum to screen the strong charge and create bound states.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
