Especially when it's a presidential candidate or even the president himself. Why do we not have things in place to hold our leaders accountable when they intentionally try to deceive us when they report false facts or deny things they did?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In our systems there's a fine line between fact checking and censorship.</p>
<p>In the US if the lie doesn't amount to libel or defamation, virtually anything can be said.</p>
<p><em>Legally</em> there is a very good reason for this. Some statements are simply incorrect. Some are mistakes. Some are meant to be rhetorical hyperbole. Some statements are made based on facts that may be proven false at a later date.</p>
<p>No one would argue for punishing someone who made a simple mistake. Correct? Ok so if someone says a false statement, who decides if it was a mistake or malicious? Whose the arbiter of this decision?</p>
<p>Do you see how this could get political real soon?</p>
<p>If there is a Republican running for mayor who states that the city lost 16 million dollars last year. What if the sitting democratic mayor orders the police to arrest the Republican for presenting false information? What if the fact was 16.6 million dollars? The Democrat just imprisoned someone who made a simple mistake or a rhetorical shortcut.</p>
<p>Now what if the Republican goes to court and the presiding judge is a democrat? What if the populous is overwhelmingly democrat and doesn't care about injustice, they just plain don't <em>like</em> the Republican?</p>
<p>Do you see how this could slip into a very damaging problem for free speech? Everyone would be afraid to speak out against the government for fear they'll be arrested for false information. </p>
<p>This is why it's dangerous that our president wants to expand libel and defamation powers.</p>
<p>Now back to our Republican candidate. Even if he fights and wins in court, he's lost Alot of money, time and Capitol fighting those charges. Now he has to answer questions about jail time to voters when he could be making his case for why he's the better mayor. </p>
<p>All of this differs from corporations who cannot present false adverisement. As this is a law for consumer protection. Because of industry trade secret, it's difficult for consumers to absolutely know all information regarding a product.</p>
<p>In contrast, our system entrusts the voters to properly &quot;punish&quot; those who &quot;lie.&quot; That's why you need a strong Press with plenty of leeway to report. That's why we need access to proper education so that we can develop problem solving skills. That's why we need more visibility for what government officials are doing on behalf of us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it is almost impossible to make sure you are telling the truth 100% all the time, simply because person can not know everything but has to make assumptions and guesses. So we have to leave a bit of grey area to get some communication done in time. We can't always wait how thing turn out and then knowing what should've been done is kind of stupid.</p>
<p>Politicians just started running wild with that excuse more and more in the last 2 decades and voters do not seem to care. Media has not done good job either, establishment half truths spread in mass media has been the norm for.. for ever actually. I'm not on any sort of &quot;fake news&quot; crowd on any side but large part of the problems we see now is the lack of challenge on the part of commercial news media. In countries where there is nothing else, the situation is the worst, countries with stronger national, publicly funded broadcast is much better. Not good but better. it is much harder to pass so bold lies, allthough Brexit is good example how little people actually want to know and how much they want to believe.</p>
<p>It's getting worse, globally. And we are the ones that should do something about it but aren't.. Don't keep voting liars to power is my plea. Much rather put the boring dude who has no radical ideas how to improve anything than the one who swears he is goig to change everything but has no rational plans to do so. And under no circumstance should one vote for people who want to destroy government's power as they are going to sabotage the whole thing; that is their agenda ffs, &quot;government doesn't work and we should get rid of it. Vote me in the government.&quot; It for SURE will not work after that guy is in power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it is because regular people allow them to. When i talk with friends and family about their political positions, they will support a politician who is caught in a blatant lie.  In addition, we do not reward politicians when they do tell the truth. Politicians have learned for example, that they should over promise both more spending and lower taxes and that doing so will not keep them out of office.  But if they said &quot;we have to raise taxes to pay for the services we provide&quot; they won't get elected. So I think our whole society needs to be willing to elect honest people.  Then, the free press has been eroded. One of the reasons for that is the flattening of expertise and the amount of noise on the internet. Anyone can claim anything they want  and people will listen to them. The public needs to support scientific integrity for example and say - I will support scientists' right to not be political tools in order to get better information from government agencies. Or- I won't look at random blogs and then conclude that hundreds of thousands of experts around the world are lying to me. Because people have spent a lot of time undermining the reputation of the press,scientists, and others who might have more insight,  some people will believe anything.  I think fake news is a huge problem. Its like we have purposely infected our whole society with a parasite.   Overall, our society does not punish lying, and cannot sort truth from fiction </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the media, which would be the primary check against this behavior by the politicians, has settled into a pattern of not being &quot;pushy.&quot;</p>
<p>The papers, stations, sites, whoever, prefer to not &quot;burn the bridge&quot; with both individual politicians and larger organizations like state and national parties.  If the bridge isn't there, they don't get interview or quote requests granted, they don't get tipped off with advance information on things the politicians are doing, and so on.  The media outlets have collectively more or less demonstrated they'd rather have the access than to act the way most people <em>assume</em> media would act; as an information channel and check on what comes out.</p>
<p>We're seeing it right now with how Trump and his administration are treating a large number of media entities.  Closing off access, not calling on them for questions; that's just what we can easily see.  If that's happening in view of the public, then it's extremely likely that none of the outlets are able to receive replies to phone calls, emails, whatever, from the folks on the far sides of the burned bridges.</p>
<p>Does it suck, that they value the bridge over doing what most of us would assume to be their job?  Yes.  Will it change?  At this point, probably not; because it's <em>easier</em> to keep that bridge so they don't have to work as hard.</p>
<p>In the current situation, possibly we might see some of the excluded outlets see increased ratings as they revert to pre-bridge behavior and start pushing for confirmed information.  If they do get more ratings, well, news isn't a service (though most people assume it is, or at least should be); it's a business.  If they make more money acting properly, then they'll start acting properly.</p>
<p>Which also sucks, but these enormous media companies have a lot of power to control the information flows.  They use it to enrich themselves, and rarely even pay lip service to actually disseminating real info.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we let them.  &quot;Government of the people, by the people, for the people...&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone puts 100% of the responsibility on the politicians.  It's up to us (the people) to research them, keep them accountable and make sound choices.  And when there are no sound choices, it's up to us to step up and either field a candidate or become one.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
