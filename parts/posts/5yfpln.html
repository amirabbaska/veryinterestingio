		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Significant, I wouldn't say. The source of the water changes its composition, and therefore also the taste. If two brands get water from the same source, they would be practically identical, unless one of them really screwed up the bottling process.</p>
<p>Unless you have a serious mineral deficiency, I can't imagine one brand being measurably more healthy for you, and if you had a mineral deficiency, you should get a proper supplement for that anyway, not bottled water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are differences.  Poland Spring really is spring water from Maine.   Dasani (owned by Coca Cola) is the local municipal water supply run through some filters and bottled.  </p>
<p>Mostly its a matter of taste.  Which most people don't pay enough attention to make a difference. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My mother recently started a bottled water facility, from what she told me:</p>
<p>The processes that are run to treat the water can be different from brand to brand. Just to name a few: reverse osmosis, ultra violet rays, filtering. Also where they get the water from, some come from springs (if they come from springs, the label must say which one), others from treated water. This also affects the taste of water as well. <del>Also, you cant sell 100% clean water because just like in a pool you would get algae after some time inside of the bottles.</del></p>
<p>Edit: As some of you pointed out, and my mom explained me better: Algae may show up when the purification process is simple, it doesnt purifies the water enough. Also, once you open a bottle of water it gets contaminated with air and bacterias, its really bad to let an opened bottled of water for long periods of time, specially if it gets hit by the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had an in home taste test of bottled waters sold at Kroger. 4 adults drinking water and comparing notes.</p>
<p>Tops was Nestle Pure Life, which has a Lighter, sweeter quality. Fuji was of a lighter character too but tasted more mineral-ey.</p>
<p>Dasani was heaviest and saltiest (they tell you on the bottle they add salt). </p>
<p>All others incl Kroger Generic fell in the middle somewhere.  Deer Park was unremarkable and did not call attention to itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, taste is noticeable between different brands. There's this one brand, I think Dasani, that I personally hate because the added minerals make it taste like ass to me. Minerals and amount of filtering make a big difference when it comes to taste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
