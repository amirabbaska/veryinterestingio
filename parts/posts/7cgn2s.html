<p>Edit: I saw a few of these in the comments, and I actually have a story about my own ingrown toenail. My the toenail on my big toe was growing into the left side of my toe, and causing an infection. I knew about this, but also just hoped it would go away. It ended up getting very infected and I had to go and get the ingrown portion cut out. They did this by cutting down straight on the side of my toenail, and pulling the ingrown part out of it, now that it was cut out. If you’re morbidly curious, I’ve attached images of the ingrown part of you’d like to see just how much toenail was into the side of my toe.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your fingernails and toenails are made up of cells that form into a hard surface called keratin. Keratin is also what makes up your hair and other parts of animals, like horse hooves and rhino horns. Underneath your fingernail is a soft surface called the nail bed. This is what produces the cells that harden and turn into keratin. The nail grows because it works kind of like the plates that make up the Earth’s crust: The nail bed forms new cells, which push on the older ones and make them grow outward. The whole structure inside your finger doesn’t extend much past the bottom of your visible fingernail. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nail is generated (grows from) the germinal matrix and grows over the sterile matrix (nail bed).</p>
<p>If the nail is crushed, injured, or removed, the germinal matrix and nail bed need to be protected .  A defect to those structures can cause permanent nail deformities.  </p>
<p>So after a crush injury, it's standard practice to remove the nail and inspect those structures.  We use a freer elevator to gently lift it off.  Once any repairs are made, the nail is slid back into place and sutured back to hold it as  a splint.  The nail regrows and pushes the old nail off.  </p>
<p>If there is a nail deformity, we can either remove the nail and attempt to address the deformity, or remove the nail bed and matrix to eliminate the nail regrowth entirely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
