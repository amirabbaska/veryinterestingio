		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we are talking about saltwater reef fish (generally tropical), there are a number reasons for this.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many display <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism" target="_blank">aposematism</a>, which is a bright coloration pattern to warn predators of toxicity. Examples of this include the lionfish, trunkfish, moray eels, and pufferfish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some species use mimicry of the toxic ones to ward off predators.  Examples are like the sea breams that mimick fang blennies and marine bettas that mimick spotted morays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reef ecosystem is one of the most crowded biomes on Earth in terms of population density.  Fish use their coloration to signal to individuals of their own species (&quot;we're schooling this direction now&quot;) and others (&quot;back off&quot;).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reef fish have, in addition to visible spectrum light receptors in their eyes, a fourth receptor for UV light.  As a result, what they see is not exactly what we see against the background of a textured (and often colorful) reef.  So some patterns actually aid in camouflage, though they would be obvious against a plain dull background.  Additionally, <a href="https://dtmag.com/thelibrary/reef-fish-colorful-science-behind-beauty/" target="_blank">many big predators are colorblind</a> and rely on rods more than cones, so movement and pattern are more important than color to them.</p>
</li>
<li>Many reef fish change their color patterns from juveniles to adults, or as mating season starts.  Some (like clownfish, wrasses, anthias) even <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/04/science/sex-change-in-fish-found-common.html" target="_blank">change sex</a>!  Their color patterns are under endocrine and hormonal control. These different color patterns may serve in mating competition, to attract mates, or to show adults of the same species they are juveniles (noncompetitors).  In the case of the gender-benders, the death of one dominant sex  may trigger the transformation of one individual of the opposite sex (usually the dominant one) to cross over the sexual dichotomy divide and advertise this to other fish of the same species.  Female to male change is protogyny (<a href="http://www.reefcentral.com/forums/showthread.php?t=972936" target="_blank">anthias</a>) and male to female change is protandry (<a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/08/clownfish-are-all-born-male-a-dominant-male-will-turn-female-when-the-current-female-of-the-group-dies/" target="_blank">clownfish</a>).  </li>
</ul>
<p>In ichthyology, we also learned about some color patterns are due to iridescence textures and some due to specific pigment cells... I don't remember this well, maybe someone else can cover this.  There is also something about countershading when a predator from below tries to see a fish above it, which explains why many fish have a lighter belly (like triggerfish).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are a few reasons why some fish are more colorful than others. It is important to note that warm water fish tend to be  more colourful than cold water fish.  OP,  I trust you mean the colour disparity you see between tropical reef dwelling fish vs one you might catch in the river by your house...</p>
<p>A few of the factors affecting colour intensity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>turbidity of the water.  You don't need to be colourful if no one can see you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>schooling or shoaling behaviours.   Many fish in large groups can have bold patterns to confuse predators. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sexual dimorphism to attract mates for some species </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>need for camouflage.  Ironically,  on the reef,  there are many predator species that hide and ambush rather than prey species. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>presence of bright coloured corals or sponges in your habitat. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>types of predators that hunt you, ie birds swooping down from above vs Other fish. Also important is whether you are predated mainly at night versus daytime. </p>
</li>
<li>biodiversity in specific area.   The number of different species can by itself drive for differences between how fish look.  They need to be able to identify their own kind.  Some even advertise they are poisonous or otherwise not good eating through colour. </li>
</ul>
<p>All of these factors can select for or against bright colours or patterns. Evolution has selected for bright colours in some situations and duller colours in others. Clear water,  reef for protection, large schools, warm temperatures, all lead to bright colour.  More solitary fish in cold dark turbid water tend to be duller.      </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fisheries biologist here.  There are some things to clarify and consider here. First, I do not think the dichotomy between freshwater and tropical is exactly what you intended. I am assuming you mean a perceived difference between freshwater and saltwater (marine) fishes. Tropical simply means found in the tropics (~between 30 deg N and S), so there are tropical fishes in both freshwater and saltwater.</p>
<p>Next, as /u/hglaber pointed out, there is probably an issue with selection bias. When people (at least those in temperate climates) tend to think of freshwater vs. saltwater fishes, they think of what they catch locally vs. what they see in an aquarium or on a documentary, which are often tropical reef fishes. This is really an apples and oranges comparison without a smoking gun answer.</p>
<p>So what <strong>does</strong> influence color among (fish) species? Keep in mind that there are over 30,000 fish species worldwide, and therefore many exceptions to any rule. Generally speaking, though, color is used for:</p>
<ol>
<li>camouflage -  mimicking parts of the environment (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leafy_seadragon" target="_blank">leafy seadragon</a>, counter-shading (dark on the type, light of the bottom; e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_white_shark" target="_blank">great white shark</a>), mirror-siding (think really shiny silver bodies; e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookdown" target="_blank">lookdowns</a>, and disruptive patterns that break up the outline of a fish (like the mottled patterns on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallmouth_bass" target="_blank">smallmouth bass</a>).</li>
<li>mate selection and identification, often associated with sexual dimorphism (the sexes differ, in this case in color; e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulonocara" target="_blank">peacock cichlids</a> in Lake Malawi) </li>
<li>other forms of signalling, including warnings to predators, often because of venomous spines (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterois" target="_blank">Lionfishes</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>I think a better way to ask your question is, <strong>why do brightly colored fishes appear more frequently in the tropics than in cold water environments?</strong> This is not a freshwater vs. saltwater issue. It is remarkable to consider that nearly half of the astounding 30,000 fish species are freshwater, despite this constituting only 0.3% of available global water.  Much of this diversity (in fresh- and saltwater fishes) is concentrated in the tropics. The Amazon river basin, for example, has over 5,000 species of freshwater fishes, many of which are very colorful (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_tetra" target="_blank">cardinal tetras</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discus_(fish)" target="_blank">discus</a>. Tropical reef systems are equally diverse and, as you've noticed, they harbor many colorful species. This sheer abundance of species is at least part of the <strong>answer to your question</strong>. With so many different species crammed into such (relatively) small areas, you are bound to end up with a wide diversity of colors, shapes, and patterns; the most extraordinary of these are the most memorable to us. Another interesting dimension to this is that the way a fish looks relays information to members of its own species as well as other fish species. Bright colors make you stand out not only to a mate, but also make you look different from other closely related species that might also occupy your habitat (which happens a lot in these high-diversity environments). </p>
<p>Another thing to consider is that existing tropical environments, on average, tend to be older than many temperate environments. They have not been repeatedly bull-dozed by glaciers and did not entirely dry out during cooler, drier periods. For example, many freshwater fish genera (and even species) have 10-million-year fossil records indicating that they changed very little during that time, suggesting consistent environmental conditions for long periods of time. These stable environments provide refuges for diversity when environmental conditions are poor elsewhere, thereby preserving much of their diversity, whereas other environments need to &quot;reboot&quot; diversity-wise when conditions improve. Maintaining this inherent diversity may help foster the wide array of forms we find in tropical systems (note that this hypothesis is not without its criticisms; please see the <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/setting-the-record-straight-on-the-refugia-hypothesis" target="_blank">Pleistocene refugia hypothesis</a>).</p>
<p>Certainly, you can find examples that run counter to what I have outlined, like brightly colored, cool-water fish species (e.g., male <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_darter" target="_blank">rainbow darters</a>). You can also find very young tropical lakes with high endemic fish diversity (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Victoria" target="_blank">Lake Victoria</a>). As I mentioned previously, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to your question, but I hope I have at least clarified the topic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, you may be looking at some selection bias. </p>
<p>You've already noted the freshwater fish you think of, and they are all game fish - likely to be caught for sport, not for appearance. That's very common. People are often shocked at the number of native fish in temperate climates because they mainly only know those large enough to eat a lure. All of the minnows, darters, sculpins, madtoms, etc. never make it into the boat. Throw some of those darters or sunfish into an intensive breeding program like discus or guppies have had and I'm sure you could get lots of bright colors and patterns. </p>
<p>Conversely, is it safe to assume that most of the tropical fish you're familiar with are in the pet trade? In other words, chosen for their bright colors? Some of which are even the result of years (sometimes <em>hundreds</em> of years) of selective breeding to enhance those colors? </p>
<p>So you end up with small, colorful tropical fish in the pet store, and big, drab, tasty/fun to catch fish in your live well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I've always found certain angelfish to be quite colorful. . .Gold and Kois, for example.</p>
<p>Or maybe you were talking about common, cold freshwater fish found in say, American waters, versus tropical, in which case, never mind, but enjoy the pics. :)</p>
<p>Rainbow and cutthroat trout, Bluegil and Sunfish can be pretty colorful fish found in American waters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
