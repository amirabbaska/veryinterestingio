I find videos on how they make ramen from flour...  but not on how they give it that shape that holds even after being boiled.  </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Curly ramen noodles (from the dry pack) were fried.<br />
When you put them in water, it's like boiling a corn or potato chip.<br />
It will mostly keep the shape it was fried in until you really cook the crap out of it and the starches break down. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the same reason that your doughnut doesn't droop after you've taken the first bite out of it: there is more noodle on the outside edge of each of the wiggles.</p>
<p>As for how they make them like that, I don't know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I guess, i dont have an explanation, but i think its because they fry the noodles before. They are not raw, they're pre-fried, thats why when you eat a uncooked ramen, it'll taste and feel like biscuits.
That being said, because they're pre fried, they keep their &quot;wiggly&quot; state(?)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
