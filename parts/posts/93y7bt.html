		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you eat something, your stomach makes juices to help digest it. If it's only the vitamins going down, your stomach makes more acid than needed for just the pill and that extra juice causes irritation. That's why it's recommended to have a small snack and some water with your vitamin, to help give the juices something else to digest other than the lining in your stomach.</p>
<p>quick edit: As someone (/u/awhq) mentioned below, there are fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) that take longer to digest, since they need fat to bind with and dissolve faster. There are also water soluble vitamins, such as B and C, that will go down easier with just some water. So, depending on what supplement you take, you should snack accordingly!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vitamins A, D, E and K are fat soluble.</p>
<p>If your multivitamin contains these or you are taking them separately, you need to take them with food that has some fat.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be a lot of fat.  I usually take mine with a piece of buttered toast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially you're taking a concentrated dose of vitamins and minerals that would normally be in foods but mixed with fiber, protein, sugar and fat. So for starters it's not the most natural thing to put in your body.</p>
<p>Also vitamins are not all neutral in terms of ph. For example vitamin C is ascorbic acid and has a low ph. In an orange it's one thing...concentrated in a pill is another.</p>
<p>Eating something with a bit of protein usually helps prevent the feeling of nausea and helps slow the absorption a bit. Think of it like drinking alcohol on an empty stomach vs eating at the same time. </p>
<p>Personal theory: You might actually get more from the vitamin with food because many of them are water soluble so whatever you intake in the moment is what you get (except fat soluble ones such as A, E, K, etc...which will store in your system). Food might slow the absorption just a bit to possibly give you a small percentage gain.</p>
