		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I watched a documentary once that talked about gelada baboons, and how their vocalizations have complex patterns that could actually be a form of speech. They showed them slowly working their way across a field all day chattering to each other while they grazed on grass. I tried but I had trouble finding a video that had as good a sound recording as I remember it being. Here's an example from YouTube :  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, most of these responses are not getting at the root of the question. </p>
<p>The short answer is no. No mammal comes close. </p>
<p>The trait that you are talking about is generally referred to as <em>vocal learning</em>, particularly vocal production learning or the ability to modify vocalizations in a meaningful way. We know of three families of birds (<a href="https://youtu.be/POiLhy3nfWQ" target="_blank">oscine</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/ULzJc8CLeVA" target="_blank">songbirds</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/p0E1Wny5kCk" target="_blank">parrots</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/wkUokgJx3Tw" target="_blank">hummingbirds</a> ) and five families of mammals (humans, <a href="https://youtu.be/hnVAv77gEqo" target="_blank">dolphins</a> /<a href="https://youtu.be/7Xr9BYhlceA" target="_blank">whales</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/O3n_3XH5-A4" target="_blank">bats</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/qHR__ugsNBg" target="_blank">seals</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/0bI0Hh4jozc" target="_blank">elephants</a> ) that have this ability in the current measurable form. This largely is noted by an ability to learn and modulate vocal patterns from external sources (mimicking parent sounds) and the absence of that ability with deafness or isolation. As well, these animals share generally convergent brain circuitry in cortical regions to regulate this behavior - interesting on its own but outside the scope of this question. </p>
<p>Primates have been studied very extensively over the past several decades and while there are occasionally some papers that talk about slight modifications to one call or another, there is no comparison in their abilities to say a dolphin or a sparrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/3lsF83rHKFc" target="_blank">Vervet monkeys</a>  are often cited for their vocal abilities, but this is categorized as vocal <em>usage</em> learning - taking innate vocal calls and assigning meaning to them. They might have the cognitive substrates for the kind of communication humans have, but are not equipped to put that into any meaningful vocal capacity. </p>
<p>This is not to say that there aren’t other vocal learning species out there. It’s not an easy criteria to study in the wild, and it’s been proposed that it is not an all or nothing trait, instead falling along a continuum. For instance, <a href="https://youtu.be/wVQVw478Rh4" target="_blank">lab mice</a> have only recently(?!) been shown to regulate their calls in different contexts and have a <em>very</em> sparse but parallel brain circuitry to vocal learning species. From these findings, there’s no telling what might pop up in other species like dogs, hippos, or marmosets. </p>
<p>This is kind of my area of expertise so if anyone has any other questions I’m happy to answer them.  :)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjE0Kdfos4Y" target="_blank">lyre bird</a> (wait for it) may well surpass human vocal range and ability.</p>
<p>If not, their talent for mimicry certainly does. </p>
<p>Note: Lyre birds in the wild are not likely to mimic some of the things that the bird in that video does, apparently that particular program used a couple of captive lyre birds which learned to mimic things they heard in captivity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
