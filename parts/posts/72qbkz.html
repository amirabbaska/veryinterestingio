		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've never posted here before, so I'm sorry in advance if I mess up. </p>
<p>My main question is this: How much fat can a person really gain from a cheat day? Is there an upper limit? It seems unlikely to me that if someone consumed 20 pounds worth of calories in addition to maintenance, that they would then actually gain that much in fat, but maybe I'm wrong. Is the upper limit just how many calories a person can manage? Or is there a limit to how much fat the human body can create in a particular window of time? Something else? </p>
<p>I've read that a pound of fat is 'worth' 3500 calories. I just googled that to check if that's true, but I'm still not sure. That number is apparently from a 1958 study. Multiple sites call 3500 an oversimplification, or 'a general rule of thumb', but I don't understand why. That's not actually my main question, but it seems important to it.</p>
<p>I ask because I've been counting calories (5'5&quot;, woman, 1200 calories a day, starting weight 188 pounds, current weight 135 pounds, goal weight 125 pounds) and I've been too nervous to try a cheat day. I don't want to reverse my progress, but I've also read that moderate cheat days can help with weight loss. While I have no intention of attempting 20 pounds worth of calories, I'm curious to know more about how the body handles large caloric surplus.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unless the cheating is so hardcore that you actually throw up or ..throw up from the other end without digesting, there is no limit. Even though there is only so much a body can process at a time, the rest of it is just going to sit around in your intestines waiting its turn.</p>
<p>3500 kcal/pound is about right, it might be an oversimplification given other effects eating has on the body and how that might affect your metabolism during that specific time but in the long run that is the amount of weight change you are going to see per that amount of calories.</p>
<p>I think the reason that &quot;cheat day&quot; is often a part of diets is because several studies have found that people who regularly eat less than is required to maintain their weight don't actually cheat too bad during the cheat day so maybe they figured the morale boost outweighs the little setback.</p>
<p>The most recent one I red was about alternate day fasting so basically one day you don't eat (just 0 calorie drinks drinks) and the other day you eat as much as you want. They found that people ended up eating 120% - 160% (with 130% being the highest point on the curve) of their caloric requirement during their eat day which overall resulted in the same pace of weight loss as if they had eaten 60-80% of their caloric requirement every day.</p>
<p>Good for weight loss, not so good for the study though since they were looking into ways of incorporating regular fasting into daily lives due to its health benefits and not everybody needs weight loss.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>Cranking up intake doesn't seem to cause food to &quot;get lost&quot; - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1414963" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1414963</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>But...</p>
<ul>
<li>Different people get different results when they eat way too much: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28077863" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28077863</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>If you eat drastically more than you're used to eating, your body will crank up energy levels in a number of areas to try to burn off the excess; you'll make more heat, feel more of an urge to move, etc. Different people get different amounts of this effect.</p>
<p>Your body will naturally want to reject food above a certain amount all at once, the main way of doing this being throwing it up. The other end can participate in this too, but it's surprising how little of a difference simply poopin' more makes... I've seen numbers as high as an extra 10% of calories, but not more. It's possible that the number gets higher with really extreme amounts of food, but I haven't seen the study.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It is true that some People tell you &quot;3500&quot; is an oversimplification. But always keep in mind that there is a huge industry that sells nothing but diets. You can buy books, supplements even hire trainers. They often try to generate some kind of mystery around the subject while reality is pretty easy: eat less then your body uses and you will lose weight. </p>
<p>So the single reason why you're still unsure is this artificial mystery. They talk bullshit and try to sell their products.</p>
<p>In the end - if a diet works - it almost every time comes down to calories. Low carb diet is a good example. If you eat 300g roastbeef with fries(200g) every day and suddenly remove the fries from your diet plan and replace it with more steak or even salad, you will lose weight because you've just reduced your caloric intake extremely. 200g fries have significantly more calories then 200g lean roastbeef. The same with noodles(mostly in cause of the the sauce). Or bread/buns. </p>
<p>A exclusion is rice. Or cooked potatoes. Or oven-roasted potatoes without fat. In fact there are countless exclusions. So in my opinion low carb is even harder then if you just count calories, because you have to leave out a LOT of healthy AND tasty stuff that is actually good for diet. I love backed potato with 0,5% fat herb-curd, roasted mushrooms and lean, roasted cured ham on top. You can eat 500g of that stuff, will be super stuffed and are only at about 500kcal. Or you replace 200g potato with 200g grilled roastbeef. </p>
<p>Counting calories needs a bit of training. But after a while you learn it. Even after years without diet i still know that 100g potato = 80kcal. 100g 1% fat curd = 60-80kcal. 100g lean cured ham 90-100kcal. 100g mushrooms, roasted without fat = you don't even need to care. It really helps to learn more about what you're actually eating and therefor to change your life fundamentally. You also automatically eat less hidden fats. If you are not sure how much of fat and sugar you get if you eat something you tend to avoid it and start to prefer a &quot;honest&quot; style of meal, where you actually see most ingredients you eat. </p>
<p>You also have to be generally careful about people, when you talk about Diet. Diet is for many people like a religion. People hate it and it gets ugly fast if you criticize their religion too carelessly. And if you ask what kind of diet you do you're basically asking: &quot;what religion is better? islam or catholicism?&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is going to get buried, but:  </p>
<p>Calorie counting is about long term averages, not daily counts.</p>
<p>If you eat 1200 calories every day for a month, your average is 1200 calories a day.  If you DOUBLE that count one day a month, your daily average skyrockets to... 1240/day.  Two 2400 calorie cheats in a 30 day period would bump you to 1280/day.</p>
<p>If you wanted to maintain a 1200 average and still have a 2400 calorie cheat day, you could drop the other 29 days to 1159 calories each day.  IMO, this is pointless, though, because your calorie counts are estimates anyway, no matter how accurately you weigh your food, and we're talking about less than 5% deviations here...</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you only cheated twice a year, you could keep the 1240 average and eat 8500 calories both days... :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem with cheat days - if you're a compulsive overeater - is that they may trigger you into a state of constant binge that could last days or weeks. It may not happen the day after the binge - it could be a week or a few days after. It also keeps you in the diet vs. lifestyle mentality and as someone said earlier - diets fail. </p>
<p>You've done a great job so far with the weight loss, and the question I would ask you is what's making you think about a cheat day to begin with? Do you feel deprived? If so, you may need to reconsider your approach. </p>
<p>CICO works well for many people but for compulsive overeaters, if you are one, it may not be the solution in the long term, as deprivation may lead to an eventual return to old way of eating and living followed by weight gain - usually more the amount originally lost. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
