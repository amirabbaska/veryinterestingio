		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plumber here. </p>
<p>The mechanical function of the toilet is a siphon. Sort of like when you take a hose to a tank of gas. You create a suction (using a pump or your mouth) which pulls the rest of the gas out of the gas tank. The same concept applies to both tank and no tank toilets.</p>
<p>The toilet in your home has a tank of that has about 1.28 gallons and when you push the lever it floods the bowl. There is enough water to fill the waste line to create the suction and pull the #1/#2 down the drain. On cheaper toilets the siphon breaks early and you are left with remnants of said #1 &amp; #2.</p>
<p>The toilet at the local Wallie world works the same way, but, instead of holding the water in the tank, the valve has the ability to let 1.28 gallons in a couple seconds and shuts off.</p>
<p>Side note (Not ELI5)- the pressure of the water in your house and the pressure in commercial buildings wont vary too much (in the city) the reason the toilet takes so long to fill is because of the 3/8&quot; line connected to 2 outlets (fills bowl and tank simultaneously).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Architect here. A few reasons.    </p>
<ol>
<li>Maintenance. Tanks are easy to tamper with, and require maintenance to keep the tower operating and water from running.    </li>
<li>Cleanliness. Tankless water closets are easier to wipe down. No nooks and crannies like between the Tank and Bowl on a traditional toilet.    </li>
<li>Stronger flush. This keeps it from being clogged and has the added benefit of being able to be flushed more frequently (you have to wait for the bowl to fill in order to get pressure to flush).    </li>
</ol>
<p>Tankless toilets are also loud and you don't want that in a residence. And like someone said, a tank type guarantees a flush no matter what the water pressure is (its generally less in a home than it is in a commercial development but that's not always true). Last item is cost. Tankless cost more initially (flat cost and installation) but you save that on service calls and cleaning personnel over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being a plumber, the tankless toilets use larger water lines for more water pressure to handle whatever is thrown at them. They are also pretty loud so that's why it's uncommon for them to be found in residential settings. Another reason tankless toilets are used in commercial settings is the vandalism aspect. I remember friends pulling pranks back in the day and removing the water line from the tank and wedging it under the lid so the person flushing the toilet would get sprayed with water once they flushed. </p>
<p>Edit: Never thought my plumbing experience would earn me fake internet points. My plumbing memories are fading as I pursue a degree in computer science. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there toilet fans! Toilet salesman here! :)</p>
<p>Here in the UK, toilets come in several varieties, these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close coupled</li>
<li>Back to wall</li>
<li>Wall hung</li>
<li>Low level</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of this question, we are going to look at the differences between close coupled and back to wall.</p>
<p>Close coupled toilets are those that have a visible china pan and cistern (yup, we call the thing you shit in a pan), while back to wall units have a cistern hidden in the wall or a small furniture unit behind the pan (if installed in a home).</p>
<p>Toilets work by holding an amount of water in the cistern as a sort of capacitor. When you flush, the water in the cistern is drained into the pan, removing all the... stuff in the pan. Regardless of whether you use back to wall or close coupled, the amount of the flush is <em>supposed</em> to be the same (maximum 6 litre flush as dictated by cistern capacity) because our government likes to get up people's arses. Why is it the same? Well, in an ideal world you're not going to shit twice as much just because you're out in public. Remember, this is in the UK, so US toilets work in a different manner - sometimes without a cistern.</p>
<p>In people's homes, it's completely up to the customer what kind of toilet they have, though a lot of brochures sell sanitaryware as four-piece sets (pan, cistern, basin and pedestal) as it's easier for customers to match the toilet to their basin so the bathroom doesn't look like a mismatched mess. This means that closed-coupled pans and cisterns are marketed towards people who just want a set of sanitaryware they like the look of. Back to wall options are available for homeowners, but it's a lot simpler to just look at a four-piece picture and say: &quot;I want that.&quot;</p>
<p>Remember that this is all visible china that is marketed as a luxury product (Rule #1 in toilet sales: Don't remind the customer what it's going to be used for). So to this end, cisterns and pans are made to look nice and add a certain feel to a bathroom, be it a rounded feel, square feel, or maybe just to create more space. This is why home toilets have cisterns: They add something to the bathroom. There is a trend towards furniture-based bathrooms growing, but that's beside the point for today.</p>
<p>Now, back to wall in public is a different kettle of fish, namely because you're dealing with the public. The public like ruining things, you see. Either because they're drunk, stupid, young or a combination of any of the above. Companies don't like spending money on people to repair cisterns (which are easier to wreck because of all the moving parts inside, and the potential to cause floods) so they just hide the bloody things instead.</p>
<p>Normally this is done via a cubicle system, which allows for a cistern to be hidden behind a pretty looking wall, while still being accessible to someone who knows what they're doing. The upshot of this is twofold. One, the cistern is hidden so the public can't get smashy-smashing. Second, there are no tempting horizontal surfaces. </p>
<p>Horizontal surfaces in public toilets mean one thing and one thing only: Somewhere to stuff half of King's Cross up your hooter (translation: cocaine abuse). Police officers sometimes test public toilets for cocaine residue in places like pubs and clubs. OK, sure, some junkies will snort it off the seat or the ceramic of the pan where people might have been pissing or shitting earlier (eurgh), but your more upmarket cocaine abuser would prefer the top of a cistern where no-one's arse has been. No cistern = nowhere to do a line = happier landlords.</p>
<p>For more information on toilets... Don't bother. I wish I didn't know half this stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
