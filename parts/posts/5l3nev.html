		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The explanation is that solids can be in equilibrium with a gas just like liquids. In other words, atoms can (and do!) fly away from solid into a vapor and vice verse all the time. The atoms coming off from the solid create a finite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_pressure" target="_blank">vapor pressure</a> that depends on the specific material and its state. In some cases this vapor pressure is so low that you can safely treat an object (say a metal coin) as unchanging over years. On the other hand in other cases, say ice cubes in your fridge, the rate can be sufficiently high that you will see the cubes get smaller over the course of days. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's due to the pressure and temperature of the substance.  Take a look at these phase diagrams:</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/700px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png" target="_blank">Water</a></p>
<p><a href="https://stevengoddard.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/co2_phase_diagram.gif" target="_blank">Carbon Dioxide</a></p>
<p>On the water diagram, look at the red line ~100kPa (1 atm).  This is the typical pressure we find on Earth.  Follow it along the x-axis (temperature) and you'll see the familiar solid until 0 C, liquid until 100 C.  Now if the pressure was slightly under 1 kPa, you'll see we hit a triple point, this is the temperature/pressure at which water will exist in all three phases at the same time.  Below that pressure, water sublimes, going directly from solid to gas.  You'll also notice water has a bunch of different solid forms, this is due to rearrangements in the crystalline structure of ice at different pressures/temperature.</p>
<p>On the CO2 diagram, you'll see at 1 atm, it sublimes from solid to gas.  We would need to put dry ice in a container pressurized  above 5.11 atm to get liquid CO2.</p>
<p>Phase diagrams are different for every single substance.  Pressure and temperature, along with intermolecular forces and such, will determine what phase a substance will be, and whether it is able to sublime or will pass through a liquid phase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sublimation, and indeed any phase change, is determined by several intensive properties of the system, including temperature, pressure, and the molar density of the compound in each phase. The ultimate reason any phase change occurs is because the molecules can do work to move from one phase to another. This may seem like a somewhat cyclical definition, but in order to relate phase changes to thermodynamic quantities we need to start out simple.</p>
<p>The way we formally describe phase changes is through the quantity of chemical potential µ, AKA the amount of free energy per molecule. The formal definition of µ includes a term that is the &quot;standard&quot; free energy, a function of the temperature and pressure of the system, and a term that increases as density increases. </p>
<p>Now free energy is the amount of energy available to do work, i.e. the total energy minus the random thermal energy. We can think of a phase change as the phenomenon where molecules move from one phase with energy G to another phase of energy G', which takes an amount of G' – G work to accomplish. Phase changes occur spontaneously if the molecule can move to a lower, more stable state. G is just the macroscopic analogue of µ, so this is analogous to saying that molecules will move from a higher µ to a lower µ'. This is much like how gasses move from higher pressure to lower pressure, however µ is even more general since it accounts for pressure, temperature, and density. IIRC Josiah Gibbs (the guy who formalized all of this science) originally referred to µ is &quot;pressure of mass action&quot; or something like that, which I think is a good intuitive description.</p>
<p>So now I think the crux of your question is how can it be that you can skip liquid when sublimation occurs. Don't you have to step up through each phase of matter sequentially as you gain chemical potential? </p>
<p>The answer is no. If you have enough chemical potential then the matter will simply not be able to condense into liquid and will fly out straight into the gas phase. Note that pretty much every substance has a certain ranges of temperature and pressure at which it can sublimate. Even water. The important thing is that these occur at relatively lower <em>pressures</em> compared to your normal solid-liquid phase change. If pressure is low, then molecules have to do less work to change from solid to gas because they have fewer other gas molecules to push out of the way. If they don't have to do much work to make the phase change, then basically as soon as they have enough thermal energy to do the work, they will escape the solid phase. This is an entropically-driven process that is exactly the same as a going from liquid to gas or solid to liquid. Sublimation is a specific special case where it just so happens that so little work needs to be done by the solid phase molecules that when they do the work, its enough to shoot right past the liquid phase and enter the gas phase. </p>
<p>So thats the &quot;what causes&quot; part of your question. The &quot;why&quot; part of this answer is quite complex. The why depends specifically and critically on the chemical properties of the molecules themselves. These properties make their contribution to chemical potential in the &quot;standard&quot; term that I was talking about earlier. You can always increase µ by increasing density, but some compounds just intrinsically have lower µ than others. A good example is water vs. CO2. Water can engage in lots of H bonding interactions, which effectively hold the molecules together more strongly. This means they have lower overall chemical potential than say CO2 molecules, which cannot engage in H bonding and therefore can move around and do work more easily. So now if we think about solid CO2 and solid H2O at 1 atm and 30ºC, you would expect the CO2 to sublimate and the water to melt. The liquid water can grab other H2O molecules more easily with those sticky H bonds, but the CO2 is relatively weak, and so those molecules just shoot straight out into the gas phase.</p>
<p>Thats kind of a hand-wavey intuitive answer, but you could also solve for the boundary mathematically by assuming µ(solid) = µ(liquid) and µ(solid) = µ(gas). Chemical potentials are equal at phase boundaries, so solving these equations is how people figure out how to draw the lines on phase diagrams. You would find that at 1 atm, there are no human-scale thermodynamic solutions in which you could make µ(ice) = µ(liquid) for CO2. Solutions will only appear in excess of 5.1 atm, because at these higher pressures the gas molecules can't just fly off into the atmosphere. The atmosphere itself does enough work on the evaporating molecules to trap them in a condensed phase, i.e. liquid.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of answers here on the phase characteristics that substances show, but those just explain 'what' happens, not the intuition for the 'why' behind it, so lets take another approach.</p>
<p>For the purposes of building some insight, its actually better to think of matter as having only two distinct phases... bound and unbound. </p>
<p>An unconfined gas in in an unbound state, in that each gas molecule is essentially 'free' to move around without being 'bound' by other molecules.</p>
<p>On the other hand, solids and liquids are much better thought of as 'bound' states, where each molecule is held in a network of forces by other molecules around it that 'bind' it to them. </p>
<p>When looked at this way, solids and liquids are very similar, with the only difference that solids are bound rigidly whereas liquids are bound and therfore can't escape the liquid body, but can move around internally. In fact, it is even more deeper... For instance, if you start heating a mtal rod, long before it gets to melting point, it will start becoming soft and flexible, almost to the extent of a wet noodle. So molecules there ARE indeed moving around internally, just with more difficulty. And indeed, if you think about it, even in cold hard solids, many are malleable that you can hammer them to change shapes etc. </p>
<p>Further, solids themselves often have various other phase transitions before the phase transition to liquid state which we call melting. So in fact, melting is NOT all that special from a solid's point of view. For instance, water ice itself has various phases that it transitions through in colder/denser environments before it gets to the liquid phase. And in all of these cases, the same fundamental phenomenon is happening internally, in that the molecules are reorgnizing into a configuration that is most energetically stable at that given temperature and pressure.</p>
<p>Now regarding the 'bound' and 'unbound' stages, any molecule in a bound state that momentarily attains high enough energy will escape from the bound state to be unbound, and 'vaporize' into what we call gaseous stage. When this happens from liquids, we call it evaporation. When it happns from solids we call it sublimation, but it is the same phenomenon! Meaning that, there is always some 'vapor pressure' from these bound stages, whether it be some phase of solid, or liquid. </p>
<p>So looked at this way, the question is only about WHEN exactly the vapor pressure of a 'bound' stage reaches higher than the ambient pressure in that environment. If it is high enough when it is in a solid stage, then it will directly sublimate before/during any possible phase transition to liquid stage. </p>
<p>For instance, regular water ice has some 17 different solid phases, and for most of them, the only transition they can make is from one solid stage to another, but some 5 of those phases can transition into liquid phase, and some two of them can transition directly to gas phase, in some temperature and pressure conditions.</p>
<p>Caveat : Finally, its worth noting that although we talked of 'gas' being in fully unbound stage, of course there is some small amount of inter-molecular attraction there too, and this will become more relevant as we pack more and more molecules in a confined space at high pressure. If you keep reducing the effective intermolecular distance more and more in this way, eventually the behavior will become similar to liquids because practially they are no longer 'unbound' and this state is what we'd call reaching a super-critical fluid, where liquids and gas behavior merges, and there is only 'bound' behavior left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One example of this is Ice losing it's mass to gas in the freezer over time.   Melting is a bulk phase change.   Liquids,  solids and gasses typically are related to the amount of energy of the substance.  When referring to a single molecule it's hard to say if it's liquid, solid or gas as easily.   If a single water molecule of an ice cube gains enough thermal energy to melt we wouldn't even notice it and would be very difficult to identify.  It would probably just re freeze by releasing that energy back into the cube or by some other process.  But we can see if a single molecule gains enough energy from the system to release itself from the cube.   It would then be a gas.  Effectively bypassing the &quot;liquid&quot;  phase. This of course brings up lots of technicalities like what is a gas or what is a liquid which I'm sure some people on here could elaborate on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
