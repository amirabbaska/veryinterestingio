		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heart of your question is really 'How are social networks formed?&quot; The textbook answer is that you need a <strong>critical mass</strong> of users, so that when someone new signs up, there are other people to interact with. Otherwise no matter how many people download your app, the newcomers will just leave if people are just trickling in, which means the app will be perpetually unpopular. The key then is to get a large number of users <em>at once</em>, so that the network becomes sustainable.</p>
<p>However, this answer only leads to more questions because it creates a paradox that many people refer to as &quot;the chicken and the egg problem.&quot; How can you convince the first users to sign up when no one else is around? Unfortunately, there's no easy answer, which is why businesses are willing to pay an incredible amount of money just to buy an existing social network. If you've ever wondered why Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter are worth so much even though they have no clear business model, this is exactly why (social networks are valuable because they are very difficult to create).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, here are a few guidelines that can help create a network. They don't always work (e.g. Google+ have tried and failed), but these are characteristics that successful social networks share:</p>
<p>1) Start with a small but concentrated population. For example, Facebook was initially only available to Harvard students. Once it reached a critical mass of users there, it then expanded to other ivies, and then to all colleges, and finally to everyone. The same can be seen for dating apps like Coffee Meets Bagel, which first started off in NYC, and then gradually expanded to other cities before opening up to everyone. </p>
<p>When you start off with a localized population, you lower your marketing costs and you get more mileage out of word of mouth. It's much easier to simultaneously sign up 1000 users in one city than it is to simultaneously sign up 1000 users in a thousand cities.</p>
<p>2) Rely on users to recruit other users. Social apps become more useful when more people sign up, which means the users themselves are interested in helping advertise the app. For example, Venmo isn't very useful if your friends don't use it, so there's already an incentive for you to get your friends to install it. This growth will happen slowly over time, but because a critical mass requires a lot of simultaneous new users, you can speed up the process by rewarding existing users who help you expand your network. Venmo did this with a $20 referral bonus to both the new user and the friend who referred them. Other apps reward in-app currencies or features, such as letting you message more people on dating apps.</p>
<p>3) Minimize sign up costs for users. If you've ever wondered why many computer games (e.g. League of Legends) and mobile games are free to play, it's because the very presence of a user is valuable. A multiplayer game would be unplayable if no one else is there. Thus, companies will literally pay new users (e.g. Venmo example above) to sign up. Of course, this is very costly, so the next best thing is to offer the app for free. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Social networks rely upon something called &quot;network effect&quot; to provide a benefit to the user.</p>
<ul>
<li>You need a lot of users for the features in the application to work the way they are meant to</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Example:  Using a dating app with only 10 users.</p>
<ul>
<li>You log into the app and only see 10 people</li>
<li>You aren't likely to date any of those 10 people</li>
<li>You aren't likely to even connect with any of those 10 people because you don't match</li>
<li>None of the features like search, messaging, favoriting, etc provide any value because the isn't a network to interact with</li>
</ul>
<p>For many applications the network needs to be in a specific vicinity for those features or the key benefit of the application to be obtained.</p>
<p>Example:  A dating app with 10,000 users but, the users are spread across the world with only 10 users in any given city.</p>
<p>Even though you have many times more users you're still going to have the same shitty experience as if the entire application only had 10 users.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, what do applications that rely upon the network effect to provide a benefit and value to their user?</p>
<ul>
<li>They can create many fake accounts to give the illusion of a big network which leads to actual users joining</li>
<li>They create alternative benefits for users that do not rely upon a network effect--like creating contests or giveaways in the application tied to using it, paying users to use the app, creating affiliate programs paying people to get their own network to join and use the app, specific features the aid in the experience (like personal matchmaking or dating consultation services), etc</li>
<li>They partner with a much larger network and offer incentives to the partner to on-board their users--like an affiliate program arrangement</li>
<li>They acquire an existing company with an establishing network</li>
</ul>
<p>If the application's network effect does require the users of that network to be within a close proximity of one another the strategy is focused on a single specific area at a time.</p>
<p>Dating apps and ride sharing apps are great examples of this. They start in hyper local areas (college campus) and slowly extend outward. Once they capture a large % of the market in that area they roll out to a new area and build further.</p>
<p>Definitely read up on Tinder, Bumble, Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Facebook, Snap, etc for interesting examples of how they each did it a little differently.</p>
<hr />
<p>Everything distills down to an experience.  </p>
<p>A user judges their experience not just upon using the application but, upon every instance of interacting with your company--directly or indirectly through word or mouth/reviews.</p>
<p>Whatever strategy is created and implemented usually supports the overall experiential goal that the social network represents...the key benefit of being a part of that network.</p>
<p>If you're trying to do this yourself, always be aware of this and always do what enhances the experience by having every strategy, decision, and action in alignment with each other and the overall goal.</p>
<p>If what you do does not support that goal, you're only creating confusion/discomfort for the user and taking away from that experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have noted, many of them start off with a small, easy to target niche. Facebook and Tinder started off with colleges because college students have a shared identity that their marketers could leverage, it's easy to test your messaging when you can actually watch people react, and young people tend to be early adopters of new technologies.</p>
<p>Some marketplace-type apps cannibalize their competitors. For instance, AirBnB started off putting listings on CraigsList pointing to their own platform, to get people to switch. I've also heard of companies selling things on eBay and including materials promoting their own apps. That way they're getting the best possible users, the ones who are already doing what they want them to do and just need a better way to do it. That minimizes the number of users they need to get in the door to get a useful amount of activity going through the product.</p>
<p>Some companies use a honeypot approach, where they launch a product that doesn't depend on network effects, then use that to build up their audience enough to later switch on the parts that are dependent on network effects. OkCupid started out as just a bunch of wacky, fun questions that you could share with your friends. Then once they had some number of people, they rolled out the ability to find other people based on how close their answers are to yours.</p>
<p>Some go for broke and just try to sprint past it. They build a product dependent on network effects, raise millions of dollars, and sink most of that money into marketing to almost immediately grow the userbase large enough for the product to be useful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, there's a few ways. You could look to how Reddit did it. Looking through the comments, surprised nobody saw it. Basically, they setup the site and then created a pile of alt accounts. As people would post, they'd patiently remind them of the rules and guide them into the behavior of the kind of user they wanted to attract. They also quite literally had conversations with themselves to give the appearance of a larger (and more cohesive) userbase than actually existed. It was basically a re-enactment of the monkey story -- and eventually it reached critical mass and started growing on its own and the alt accounts went defunct. The site you see today is the result of those early efforts. </p>
<p>Was it dishonest? Maybe. But that's how a lot of sites kick off. Slashdot did the same thing, before it rose to prominence in the IT world... and then they sold out and it all came crashing down. There's actually many, many forum-based sites where when they initially went live, it was mostly the author/owners going to other forums and canvasing to draw people to their site and giving the appearance of more activity to keep people around until that critical mass point tipped over and it became self-sustaining.</p>
<p>There's also examples where they didn't do this and trusted that the mere brand identity or whatever would carry the day: Google+ for example, also known as the Ghost Town of the social networking world, or Hangouts, which is yet another attempt by Google to shove something down people's throats that totally isn't working out. I'm sorry to say, but if you're the only one at a party, more people showing up isn't gonna happen. You need that core glob of people to start roping others in, and even if you have to fake it, it's better than just kicking off the site and then promoting it without that (even fake) activity to engage people. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the simplest methods is simply not to launch until you have X number of users pre-signed up, i.e.:</p>
<p>We are launching soon enter your email to be notified when we do</p>
<p>The peril there is your concept and marketing has to be strong enough to bring them back when you launch. You also need to be aware 1 email != 1 user</p>
<p>There are bots thy just fill in forms, users that don't bother returning, bounced and changed emails and so on. Rule of thumb tends to be around 10-30% usually come back to check it out</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
