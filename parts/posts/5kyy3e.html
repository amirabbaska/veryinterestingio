		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that O- is the universal donor and that AB+ is the universal recipient because O- lacks major antigen groups while AB+ has the 3 major antigen groups.</p>
<p>However, what still confuses me is why the antibodies received from the donor don't attach to the recipient's own blood cells. For example, if an O- person donates blood to an AB+ person, won't the antibodies from the O- donor attach to the RBCs of the AB+ recipient?</p>
<p>Is this just a volume issue? Are there just not a large amount of antibodies present to attach to the recipient's cells?</p>
<p>Thanks for any and all responses!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood group O is an universal blood donor, because as you point out, neither A,B or AB have antibodies towards O (because O is the base glycoprotein).</p>
<p>But as you've pointed out, those who have blood group O have antibodies against A,B and AB.</p>
<p>What you've missed is the fact that when you receive blood from a donor it's &quot;only&quot; the erytrocytes that you receive, the erytrocytes have been separated from the plasma and thus separated from antibodies.
This also means that AB is the universal plasma donor!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In blood donation, they separate the red cells)from the plasma (the liquid that contains all the proteins including the antibodies). People usually receive packed red cells when they receive blood and these don't contain large quantities of antibodies.</p>
<p>In stem cell (bone marrow usually) transplant a similar phenomenon to what you described can occur and is called graft versus host disease. Essentially the donor white cells recognize the host as foreign and begin attacking. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not quite what you were asking, but there is a condition in which people have quite severe reactions after transfusions due to antibodies called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_immunoglobulin_A_deficiency" target="_blank">selective IgA deficiency</a>. They are missing one of the immunoglobulins that all humans have called IgA</p>
<p>Some of these people have antibodies in their own blood against this missing immunoglobulin, so when they get transfusions of blood that contains IgA, they may get an allergic reaction that may even cause anaphylaxis. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
