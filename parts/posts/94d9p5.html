		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is stating that the oils reduce the surface tension. While it is true that the oils are responsible for the defoaming effect, it is not because the oils are reducing the surface tension. The bubble lamella have water in them. As you force the hydrophobic oils against those surfaces, you force the water to want to retract away from the oil.   This essentially results in a disruption of the bubble wall which causes a collapse.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/wSj99tp.png" target="_blank">Here is a diagram</a> that shows the mechanism by which defoaming can take place. In this scenario, small oil droplets are being shown.  The blue part is the water filled bubble lamella. The yellow is the oil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oils of all types are a potent anti-foaming agent.  Things generally like to stick to water, or to oil (polar vs nonpolar liquids), and if you can convince a tiny portion of the non-water content of a bubble to stick to oil, the bubble pops.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surface bubbles generally have very thin walls known as lamellae. When you apply pressure on the surface of a bubble the thin walls and insufficient liquid between the bubble walls causes the bubble to instantly burst. If the bubble has enough liquid between the walls of subsequent bubbles the bubble wall will have a higher surface elasticity and basically stretch and change shape rather than burst. Generally in sodas the bottom layer of foam that is close to the liquid has thicker walls and the upper layer of foam is thinner and more likely to burst first. This answer is just another reason for bubbles bursting other than the fact that oils on the surface of our skin do cause bubbles to burst due to hydrophobicity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
