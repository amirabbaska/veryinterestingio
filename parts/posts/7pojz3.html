		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The feeling of thirst is a creation of the brain to warn about a need for water. When you drink water, even though it may not have effect immediately, the brain knows that itâ€™s effect is coming and therefore has no need to warn about a need of water anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't.  They feel less thirsty.  If you have ever been dehydrated in a serious way it will take hours, even days, for you to &quot;feel better&quot;.  Your body actually feels terrible when it gets dehydrated.  Getting thirsty on the other hand is just a handy dandy tool your brain uses to prod you to drink something and so when you have drunk something it turns off the thirsty impulse.  But 99.99% of the time being thirsty is not being dehydrated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are sensors in your body that detect the volume of water that you have inside you, when you drink you are instantly changing the volume, so your brain instantly shuts down the alarm for thirst given off by these detectors</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
