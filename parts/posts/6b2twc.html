		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth, the MLB does happen to be a reservoir which contains a disproportionate amount of the worlds baseball talent. Pretty much wherever you are in the world, if you are sufficiently good at baseball, theMLB will find you and pay you more than anyone in your home country will to play the game. That's not a good explanation but it is hard to say that any other league in the world could compete with the MLB in their present form.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The general idea that the World Series was named after a newspaper is a nice story and makes an explanation of the name easier, but it's incorrect.</p>
<p>The simplest explanation is when baseball was in its early developmental stages, the competitors of the championship at the time were already seen as America's champions. The hope was that with the spread of American baseball's popularity around the world there would be more international teams playing, and so it was termed the &quot;World's Championships Series.&quot; This obviously never happened and the name was shortened over the years and stuck.</p>
<p>There's also possibilities of marketing tactics and America's obsession with itself that could play a factor, but that's the simplest explanation. I would recommend Josh Laventhal's book World Series if you would like to learn more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The U.S. leagues that use the terms &quot;World Champions,&quot; like baseball, basketball, and sometimes hockey are because they'veâ€‹ established themselves early as competitive on a global scale and now the best players from other countries play in those sports. American football is just now starting to dive into the global market, but most are experiments and have yet to pan out.</p>
<p>If anything, it shouldn't be seen as the U.S. being self-centered but recognizing the rest of the world for providing the talent necessary to beat other teams also consisting of the best domestic and foreign players.</p>
<p>I'd go out on a limb and say that, in most cases, the best rest-of-the-world teams couldn't beat the worst U.S. teams in their respective sports. (There's that self-centeredness)</p>
<p>Edit: wrong and unnecessary English.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question is valid because of course, technically you are absolutely correct - it should technically be called the North American Series since no teams outside of North America can play in it. But it's called the World Series for historic reasons, and I would argue that it still stays true today given the special position MLB occupies in relation to baseball. Let me give you an analogy that might make my argument easier to understand for a Brit.</p>
<p>Let's take a hypothetical. Say that not only was soccer invented in the U.K., but further, while other countries took it up, their national leagues lagged far behind the U.K.'s in quality (I know the U.K. doesn't have one unified soccer league, but take this as a hypothetical). Further, as a result of the enormous money involved in the U.K.'s league, all the best soccer players come to the U.K., further making the gulf between the U.K. and other soccer leagues wider. And on top of it all, let's posit that all of this occurred towards the beginning of the 20th century and that the only organized, professional league for awhile belonged in the U.K. As a result of all of the above, the U.K. decides to call their soccer's championship game (again, I know, not an actual thing) the World Championship. It's not technically accurate, but what's the point of inviting, say, those French men whose league isn't organized and professional yet (analogizing this to the Caribbean in the early days of baseball) or even more ridiculously, the bloody Americans (who are very far away, much like the Japanese in comparison to America in the early days of baseball)? So the U.K. names their game the World Championship since it's where the best play.</p>
<p>As time goes on, other countries get better, but the U.K.'s league is still inarguably quite superior to any other countries's league. The other countries argue that you shouldn't call it the World Championship, but at this point it's also, on top of everything, a marketing thing. If the U.K.'s top team were to lose to the French's top team in one match, which of course could happen even though the U.K.'s team is much better and would win 90 out of 100 games, it would hurt the marketing for the U.K.'s league, and since they've been calling their winner the World Champion for over a hundred years and their teams are still miles better than anyone else's, they refuse to rename the game and still call their winner the world champions.</p>
<p>Hopefully that explains it. History, the current relationship of MLB compared to other national leagues, the best talent consistently playing in MLB...all of this is why it is called the World Series. Technically inaccurate, but totally unfair? I don't think so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
