		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I simply don't understand the sky-high valuations for companies that have not only <em>never</em> turned a profit, but who don't seem to even have a model in place to <strong>ever</strong> be profitable. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Uber</strong>: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-17/an-expert-in-valuation-says-uber-may-have-already-peaked" target="_blank">valued</a> at $28B - $62B despite reportedly being <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2016/01/12/leaked-ubers-financials-show-huge-growth-even-bigger-losses/#24a2a76f5c99" target="_blank">massively unprofitable</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DraftKings</strong>: <a href="http://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/17440674/draftkings-partners-revolution-growth-round-funding" target="_blank">Valued</a> around $1B despite being <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/11/01/would-combined-draftkings-and-fanduel-might-too-big-for-regulators/5UBf4rV2iT9lJNAIt6yDtJ/story.html" target="_blank">very unprofitable</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ClassPass</strong>: <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/leaked-documents-reveal-classpass-surprising-next-move" target="_blank">Valued</a> around $500M despite reportedly being quite unprofitable with some predicting an imminent demise</p>
</li>
<li>List goes on and on: Twitter, Snapchat, Box, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>I used to work for a startup, so I LIVED in that world...and I still struggle to explain it to other people. My default answer is usually:
<em>&quot;Well, they're CURRENTLY losing a lot of money, but investors are gambling on the idea that one day they'll figure out how to turn a profit. Or failing that, they may prove to be an attractive acquisition target for a company who DOES have the money-making thing figured out, e.g. maybe Facebook or a profitable brick &amp; mortar business, who might see them as a valuable new sales channel for their existing business.&quot;</em>
But even that answer seems unsatisfying to me. Maybe someone with a better handle can ELI5.</p></div></div>
