<p>Why not use GPUs for everything?  What can a CPU do well that a GPU can't?  CPUs usually have an instruction set, so which instructions can a CPU do than a GPU cannot?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a fairly common question and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/14bmw4/what_other_than_their_intended_use_are_the/c7bljs0/" target="_blank">I've answered it before</a>.</p>
<p>tl;dr is GPUs are great if your problem is &quot;I want to do the exact same thing to an entire dataset&quot;, not so much if it's &quot;I want to run this set of instructions exactly once&quot;.  There's nothing stopping you from running arbitrary code on a GPU but performance will tank.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always thought about it like the CPU is 4 smart guys and the GPU is 100 dumb guys.</p>
<p>The smart guys can handle most problems thrown at them quickly. Simple tasks are easy to them, has are tough intense tasks, but there's only 4 of them. They can't do something that requires a lot of busy work efficiently.</p>
<p>The 100 dumb guys, meanwhile, can't do really complex tasks that easily. However, when it comes to busy work, they just have a lot more man power. So if they have to do something like draw the same picture 100 times, it takes them a lot less time than the smart guys.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>GPUs are faster for 2 reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they are much simpler cores (missing features see below) and thus smaller and more can fit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GPUs do not try to maximize IPC (instructions per clock); in other words they suck at single thread sequential execution of instructions, only problems that can be efficiently multithreaded are suitable for GPUs</p>
</li>
<li>they are SIMD machines. When you compare a proper AVX CPU implementation of an algorithm with a GPU implementation, the performance difference of GPUs already is more reasonable. When compared to a simple CPU implementation that does not take advantage of 256bit wide data words with AVX, the performance difference to GPUs appears much larger, because SIMD is really a requirement for proper GPU algorithms while it is not the most commonplace approach taken with CPU code - comparisons are usually between unoptimized CPU code and optimized GPU code and the performance difference is thus exaggerated.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a large set of features that is geared towards single thread IPC throughput in CPUs (the reason for that is that most programs are single threaded):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>out of order execution (including register renaming, data dependency conflict detection, ...)</p>
</li>
<li>branch prediction</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there are a boatload of features in CPUs that make them suitable to run a modern operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>interrupts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>multiple privilege levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sophisticated virtual memory management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>connectivity to a more complex set of support chips on the mainboard</p>
</li>
<li>virtualization</li>
</ul>
<p>Each core on a GPU is in essence a very simple SIMD CPU core. Because they lack sophisticated management functions they could not execute a modern operating system. Because programs for GPUs are harder to write they are not used for everything. Because most code executed on a CPU is hardly performance critical GPUs are not used for everything.</p>
<p>When we are talking about straightforward parallel code that is performance critical to the application then GPUs are used for almost everything; if the programmer takes the little extra time to do it right. They are for example used for everything graphics related. They are used for almost everything in the high performance computing community.</p>
<p>The sheer amount of code that a computer executes that is not really performance critical is way larger than the really critical parts, so when you want comfort and do not care about speed then a CPU is just much quicker to program.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>GPU's are like blenders. They are extremely good at this one task, blending things. CPU's are like multi purpose machines that can blend but are not exactly great at that. They can however do 1000 things like make a dough, whisk whipped cream or even slice carrots. All of those abilities are needed by modern SW. You can't do these things with a GPU or it would be insanely slow (think about slicing carrots with a blender). This was ELI3.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
