		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is what happens when the mainstream media and its useful idiots make shit up, publish it, only to have it gobbled up, misinterpreted, and regurgitated by other useful idiots.</p>
<p>The surface web, deep web, and dark web are all manufactured concepts that are almost entirely meaningless to any computer academic.</p>
<p>Summed up briefly, they can be roughly defined as follows:</p>
<p>Surface web: The surface web consists of web pages that are accessible or discoverable through search engines.</p>
<p>Deep web: The deep web consists of content that is not accessible or discoverable through search engines, often requiring extensive navigation or even authentication. Most &quot;deep web&quot; content is obvious, such as password-protected services; for example, the contents of your GMail account will not be found on an anonymously accessible search engine.</p>
<p>Dark web / Dark net: The dark web consists of content that is accessible only through the use of special software, most notably Tor, I2P, and Freenet.</p>
<p>The problem:</p>
<p>It's often repeated that 90% of web content is found on the deep web or dark web. However, a &quot;web page&quot; is entirely impossible to quantify, it's not a metric in any sane sense. Accordingly, it's impossible to evaluate objectively. The static web page of the 1990s and early 2000s is gone, now everything is dynamic. To make matters worse, most &quot;deep web&quot; content isn't actually deep at all, it's expressly excluded from search indexing at the website maintainer's request because it's not search worthy. However, this alone does not mean that it is not indirectly accessible through a search engine by way of another resource that incorporates it. To make matters worse, how big is a piece of &quot;web content&quot;? Are the petabytes of Youtube videos considered to be part of the surface web?</p>
<p>It would have been more appropriate to say that there is a great deal more content on the internet than is available through most search engines; this maintains the largely subjective and highly imprecise and non-scientific matter of trying to quantify and classify the internet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to understand that the <strong>deep web</strong> should not be confused with the <strong>dark net</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>deep web</strong> is simply composed of all the web pages on the Internet not typically indexed by search engines like Google. This includes things like password-protected pages, dynamic pages, or encrypted networks. You visit these pages all the time, usually through means of starting from a page found on the surface web and navigating further through the website.</p>
<p>What you're likely thinking of is the <strong>dark net</strong>, which is a subset of the deep web accessible only through special means, the most well-known of which is likely the TOR network. It is here that you're more likely (but not always) to find &quot;shady&quot; transactions and media content.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question, most people actually know <em>what</em> the deep web is but simply don't know <em>it's called.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surface web/clearnet: google and anything you can find by using search engines. This accounts for the majority of sites and content (youtube, tv shows, pictures, ect). </p>
<p>Deep web: Places you can't get to using a search engine. These include everything from email to databases to online libraries. For example, I can't access my Uni's online records or ebook library without a special login. </p>
<p>Dark web: Refers to content accessible only through a tor browser in order to provide security and anonymity. An example of a dark web site is: <a href="http://deepdot35wvmeyd5.onion" target="_blank">http://deepdot35wvmeyd5.onion</a></p>
<p>This is a mirror of an informative site (deepdotweb.com), if you were to click on it in firefox, you'd get an error message because the address links to a 'darknet' page. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The majority of the internet is on the &quot;deep web&quot; because it is simply not indexed.  This is things like user profiles on private web sites, all pages behind paywalls, and so on.  Basically anything that requires you to log in, since most of those pages won't be indexed.</p>
<p>The &quot;dark web&quot; is a very small part of the internet that also happens to be not indexed (so it's part of the deep web).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
