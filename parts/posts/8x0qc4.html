		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I'm remember my Uni correctly, the first sperm to reach the egg aren't the ones who fertilize it. There's a coating on the egg that is dissolved by the head of the sperm, and it takes multiple sperm to dissolve it. If an egg has 50 locked doors, the sperm who unlocks door number 50 is the one that fertilizes the egg. Something like that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>EDIT: check laderlappe02 pubmed link if you are really interested. even though the article says always that further investigations are needed, there seems to be correlation between transcription rate and fitness! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert, but I've read that sperm don't swim to move forward so much as swim to maintain their place in the moving seminal payload. Therefore sperm-&gt;egg travel is not actually in any way a force in natural selection and the 'best' sperm don't 'swim' any faster or otherwise better to get to the egg.</p>
<p>Intrasexual competition and intersexual mate choice are done on the level of individuals within the species; competition between gametes is not something I am aware of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
