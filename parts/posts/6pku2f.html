		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ya know how USB ports suck because you can never get them in right?</p>
<p>USB C is the solution to the Heisenberg uncertainty port!  There is no right way or wrong way, there is just the way</p>
<p>That is by far its biggest upgrade over classic USB 3.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than that it can provide <em>a lot</em> of power.  USB PD specs it for 60W or 100W depending on the setup, that's enough to charge a laptop</p>
<p>Its fast, it can support 10 Gbit/s, that's faster than SATA (3 the cable that connects to your hard drive)</p>
<p>Its not fairly universal.  Over the last couple years different organizations have been making specs on how to send their data over USB C cables.  It is now supported by Display Port, MHL, Thunderbolt, and HDMI.</p>
<p>So that gives it power, speed, diversity, and most importantly, no frustration</p>
<p>Pretty nifty huh?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's thinner than standard USB, symmetric, and supports multiple high speed protocols including USB, thunderbolt, and video. The MacBook Pros only have USB-C ports but still allow power, video, Thunderbolt, and USB3 using only USB-C ports. </p>
<p>Phones are also replacing micro-USB with USB-C. Within a couple years, almost every new computer and smartphone will use primarily USB-C connectors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beyond all the technical reasons why it's a great standard, people are pumped about it because it's being taken up by many very large manufacturers as their 'one connector to rule them all'.</p>
<p>One lucky guy I know doesn't have to carry different cables for his computer, phone, external battery pack etc- they're all USB-C. Jerk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beyond what others have said: one of the problems with other connectors, like the Apple Lightning connector, is that the springy parts -- which wear out -- are in the (expensive) device. USB-C puts those parts in the (less expensive) cable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not only is it reversible like others said, it supports almost every standard available. You can use it as a normal USB cable, HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA, power up to 100W, audio, and some ports also have Thunderbolt 3 functionality added in which gives it 40Gbit/s speed and PCIE so you could add external GPUs to devices, hard drives, and SSDs. It can do everything that required a separate cable into one cable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
