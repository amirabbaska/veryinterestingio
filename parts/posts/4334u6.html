		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h2>We do!</h2>
<p>^(Note: the answer has been expanded on a few times, as the question became a little clearer: the first section isn't quite as relevant as it used to be to the question, but I've kept it in as people seem to find it interesting)</p>
<p>Talking of the British Isles (rather than England specifically) there are several combinations</p>
<p>In Ireland (not part of the UK) &quot;O'&quot; as in O'Hara etc are common. In Scotland, &quot;Mc/Mac&quot; as in McDonald is, also common. Both are equivalent to &quot;Son of&quot; as is used in Europe. Both are widely used, although Mc isn't perhaps as popular in Scotland as you may believe.</p>
<h2>And English?</h2>
<p>This is common in English too! Very common, in fact.</p>
<p>Johnson, Henderson, Branson, Davidson, Dawson, Wilson... we have tons of them, those are just the ones I'm sat in the same room as (literally, I'm sat in a room with people with those 6 surnames). These names are from the Danish/Norse tradition, and are incredibly common in England. These names are literally &quot;John's Son&quot; &quot;Will's Son&quot;. Similar to &quot;Jensen&quot; in Danish, Johnson is the most common British name: son of Jen, son of John.</p>
<p>We also have many more subtle names which are from the same source, though! They don't look quite as obvious, but how about these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Williams. Jones. Daniels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Confused? How about if I add an apostrophe....</p>
<ul>
<li>Willam's. Jone's (John's), Daniel's</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, wait. Yeah, literally, Willam's. As in &quot;belonging to William&quot; or &quot;William's son&quot;</p>
<p>If anything, these names are probably <strong>more</strong> common in English than in most other languages.</p>
<h2>How about &quot;job&quot; and &quot;location&quot; names?</h2>
<p>Similarly names like &quot;Paul from Kendal&quot;, &quot;John the Smith&quot;, &quot;Alfred of Rochester&quot; were common: they were really designations rather than names, however, and truly meant that John was a Smith, Alfred came from Rochester.</p>
<p>These are very, very common names in English. In short, we <strong>do</strong> have these surnames, they're just a little less obvious than they may be in other languages because they're incorporated into a single word. Let's take an example of one of the first Census's: the Domesday book. We can see lots of entries like this: &quot;Adam son of Hubert&quot;, &quot;Acard (the priest)&quot; and &quot;Acwulf <of Thelnetham>&quot; feature on the first page, for example.</p>
<p><a href="http://opendomesday.org/name/" target="_blank">http://opendomesday.org/name/</a></p>
<p>These names started off as you'd expect, literal &quot;Go and see Paul&quot;, &quot;Which Paul?&quot;, &quot;Paul the Smith&quot;. That would then over time be shortened to &quot;Paul Smith&quot;. This was a gradual process, but particularly came about during the middle ages when people started moving around more (so &quot;Paul of Rochester&quot; made no sense) and taking a different occupation - so where &quot;John the Smith&quot; and &quot;Paul the Smith&quot; in a small village would be related previously, suddenly Paul may become a Baker. As families stopped taking the profession of their father by default, it became more useful to use a name to identify a family. Essentially, people just chose a suitable name at the time, based on how they identified themselves.</p>
<h2>So where did the &quot;the&quot; actually go?</h2>
<p>As to &quot;Why did the 'the' or 'of the' drop in English but not Dutch or Spanish&quot; type queries I'm seeing a lot of...</p>
<p>Well, they did exist. Alfred the Baker, Adelhelm the Smith were both names in the Domesday book. English did use these names, and it's not (as commonly believed) that we just use &quot;the&quot; less than French/Italian/Spanish and the other &quot;romantic&quot; languages. They were used, they just fell out of favour over time.</p>
<p>So where did they go? We're not (or at least I'm not) totally sure, there doesn't seem to be a single deciding factor. It just seems to be that that's how the &quot;fashion&quot; fell at the time names were starting to become formalised, although it's possible that the format of early documents &quot;suggested&quot; using just your occupation or similar. I'd be very interested if anyone has knowledge of a more specific reason than this.</p>
<p>One reasonable theory is that while a family would, at one stage, be &quot;Paul the Baker&quot;, &quot;John the Baker&quot; etc, at some stage &quot;John&quot; stopped being a baker like his father... he was no longer &quot;John the Baker&quot; but &quot;John you would refer to as Baker&quot;... you can imagine this kind of exchange happening, for example</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Go and give this to John&quot;</li>
<li><em>&quot;Which John?&quot;</em></li>
<li>&quot;Baker&quot;</li>
<li><em>&quot;John Baker, got it&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>But in truth, we aren't sure exactly why these types of names were dropped. They existed in 1100AD, they were entirely gone by 1801, and they were seen less and less through that period.</p>
<h2>What about Royal and Noble names?</h2>
<p>This is one area where English <strong>did</strong> use &quot;the&quot; and &quot;of&quot; for much longer. For example Queen Elizabeth is also the Duke of Lancaster. As you can see, though, in English these tend to still be &quot;titles&quot; rather than names. She wouldn't generally be referred to as &quot;Elizabeth of Lancaster&quot;... although she probably <em>could</em> be. Similarly &quot;the&quot; has been used, but generally to refer to attributes, not locations or family.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<ul>
<li>Alfred the Great</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other famous examples of names with this kind of naming</p>
<ul>
<li>John of Gaunt (John o' Gaunt) </li>
<li>Richard of York</li>
</ul>
<p>These names are literally &quot;Richard of the House of York&quot; and &quot;John of the House of Gaunt&quot; and refer to the noble houses of England. Queen Elizabeth is, by this measure &quot;Elizabeth of Windsor&quot; and this <strong>would</strong> be an accurate way to describe her. However, even with our Royal Family, the &quot;of&quot; has been dropped and she is referred to as Elizabeth Windsor, if using a &quot;common&quot; style name.</p>
<h2>Edits and notes and things</h2>
<p>Edit: So this has kind of blown up! Thanks for the gold kind stranger.</p>
<p>Edit2: Just to clarify, this answer may seem a little confusing with the comments now, as I've edited it and also added some context regarding things like &quot;occupational&quot; and &quot;geographical&quot; names. There's also a discussion about names like &quot;Richard of York&quot; when used in an aristocracy/monarchy sense. Please take a quick look through the comments before asking about these, it's probably been covered :) any other questions, though, and I'm happy to answer if I can</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually I feel like this hasn't been fully answered. English names have conventions like &quot;son of&quot; and &quot;belonging to&quot; and place names, yes, but they don't have &quot;the.&quot; This is because Romance languages use &quot;the&quot; far more often than English does. Where we say &quot;I like music,&quot; the French would say &quot;j'aime la musique&quot; (I like <em>the</em> music).  This is a linguistic difference. So we would never have &quot;de la Rosa&quot; but we have plenty of Smiths. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <em>actual</em> reason is that most appearances of a word translated as &quot;Of&quot; in foreign names are noble titles.  This is equivalent to &quot;Duke of Cambridge&quot;, &quot;Duke of Essex&quot;, etc.  However, in <em>both</em> Britain <em>and</em> other European languages, a reference to someone with an aristocratic title/name should drop the &quot;of&quot; unless you refer to them by their full title/name.  So you can say &quot;Elizabeth I executed the Duke of Essex&quot; or &quot;Elizabeth I executed Essex&quot; but you can't say &quot;Elizabeth I executed of Essex.&quot;  The hanging <em>of</em> is pointless. Likewise, &quot;Alexis de Tocqueville and Friedrich von Hayek are both interesting writers&quot; is good, and so is &quot;Tocqueville and Hayek are both interesting writers&quot;, but &quot;De Tocqueville and von Hayek are both interesting writers&quot; is a solecism that comes from half-educated English speakers who don't speak foreign languages but are afraid that if they drop the &quot;de&quot; or &quot;von&quot; they'll sound ignorant.</p>
<p>The reason why it seems to English-speakers that the noble &quot;de&quot;/&quot;von&quot; must be part of the name is that the English aristocracy generally doesn't use their noble titles as family names, whereas in some European countries this is more common.  In particular, there is only one person who can be the Duke of Essex at a particular time; his oldest son will also become the Duke of Essex (eventually), but unless his other children receive noble titles during their lifetimes, <em>their</em> children will simply be commoners.  (You may remember this as a plot point in <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>: although Darcy is related to the aristocracy on all sides and extremely wealthy, technically he and the Bennetts are all commoners.)</p>
<p>The non-noble names that use <em>de</em> and <em>von</em> are a bit rarer, and the English equivalents are things like Williams (i.e. William's = of William, belonging to William), Jones (John's = of John).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>English doesn't use possession as formally as the Latin languages do. </p>
<p>If your say &quot;my brothers house&quot; in English it's &quot;El casa de mi hermano&quot;</p>
<p>They require &quot;of&quot; and &quot;the&quot; which moved over into names.
If youre David Cross or Mike King you might of been David of the cross or Mike of the Kings but no one says that in English. They do more so in Latin languages. David de La cruz or Dean del rey. These things get truncated in latin languages too but the overall structure is more prevalent in them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do, it's that surnames in the British Isles are usually in Old English, Gaelic, or various <del>Celtic</del> Saxon or Scandinavian dialects. For example, my last name means &quot;of the Hollow&quot; and my mother's maiden name means &quot;of Blackwood&quot;. Mostly in British tradition it's dependent on trade, like Smith or Cooper, whereas in Scot and Irish tradition it's based on lineage (it's not really used anymore though). &quot;Mac&quot; means &quot;son of&quot;, and &quot;O&quot; means &quot;grand son of&quot;. Douglas O'Reilly would therefore be Douglas, grandson of Reilly. Similarly, Sean Macdonald would be Sean, son of Donald.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
