		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is larger in size, but similar in form, to southeast Alaska. In Alaska, a mountainous area was glaciated, and every weak spot became a deep valley. Many of the weak spots are old (or still-active) fault lines making long narrow paths. In between are masses of solid rock that form each island.</p>
<p>You would see similarly complicated coastline if (for instance) you flooded British Columbia a few thousand feet deep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
