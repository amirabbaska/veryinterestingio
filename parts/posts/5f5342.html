What I'm wondering is at what distance do you consider something to be global rather than local? </p>
<p>That might be a plain misunderstanding from my part, so alternatively, is it more correct that the local measurment is just an approximation of the global one, since we don't expect any significant space-time curvature in proximity of the measurment (and therefore, the measurment is actually a tiny bit inaccurate)?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the answers! I love lurking in this sub, and really appreciate all the effort and high quality answers you have. </p></div></div>
