Just wondering if anyone knows the earliest (or I guess &quot;lowest&quot;) life form this has been observed in.</p>
<p>Edit: to clarify what I mean by &quot;lowest,&quot; I guess I mean that out of all the evolutionary branches that exhibit this behavior (or a behavior that approximates it), the earliest branch <em>that does not include humans</em> that has extant species.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Bonus if anyone can answer the same question for yawning.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you mean stretching to clear muscle tension, correct?</p>
<p>If so, that would be anything warm blooded (mammals, birds). The primary way we generate heat to regulate our body temp is by keeping our muscles partially tense at all times. However, this can cause cramps and other problems if certain muscles stay tense for too long or get out of sync with the muscles around them. Stretching contracts and relaxes large groups of muscles all at once, and helps correct poor muscle configuration. Stretching also helps to retense muscles that have become over-relaxed during a sleep cycle. </p>
<p>The least “evolved” animal that could stretch died off millions of years ago, since it would be the common ancestors for the entire mammal and avian classes of the animal kingdom, respectively. </p>
<p>If you want the lowest animal in the food chain that can stretch, it’s probably some type of rodent. I’ll go with mice.</p>
<p>(I couldn’t find any info on whether reptiles stretch. I don’t believe they do, but if someone more knowledgeable corrects me, go with their answer.)</p>
<p>Yawning is a little different since it is a reflex to clear the ear canal. According to Wikipedia it has been observed in every branch of vertebrates. (It’s also “contagious” for other species and classes as well.)</p>
<p>Edit: I’m getting a lot of responses here and on my other comment about how turtles/fish/insects/etc move individual parts of their body in a stretch. When I was writing this I assumed we were talking about the type of full body stretching that humans/cats/dogs do. My comment was specifically about that type of stretching behavior, not that reptiles and fish don’t have to move their muscles if something’s been inactive for a while. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe &quot;least complex&quot; might be a more appropriate phrase? I have no clue about this but how can you tell if say a sea anemone is stretching as opposed to a cat? What is a stretching reflex? Could an animal have the urge to do this but be incapable like sharks or fish that don't have the ability?</p>
<p>Are mammals the only organisms that display this behavior? Someone answer OP i have more questions and no answers!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is more likely that animals conduct a pandiculate type of non static stretch.  There is evidence of this type of behavior in insects, as reported in a Time magazine book review:</p>
<p>&quot;In a new book. The Ant World (Penguin Books; 50¢), British Entomologist Derek Wragge Morley keeps insisting that ants are ants, and must not be confused with humans. But readers who follow him on his rounds through the cities of the ants will find many reminders of human behavior.</p>
<p>Ants are not the models of industry that they are reputed to be. They spend many waking hours just lazing around or sunning themselves. They stage mock-battles and wrestling matches. Before they sleep they often make themselves comfortable by scooping smooth hollows in the soil. When they wake they <strong>stretch</strong> their six legs...&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Terms like &quot;low&quot; and &quot;primitive&quot; are generally avoided in evolution, at least when describing whole organisms. Individual traits could be considered &quot;primitive,&quot; though &quot;ancestral&quot; is more accurate, but that's not the way you're using it.</p>
<p>Early-branching is a more acceptable term, but it has to be relative to some other species. In this case, I would assume you mean earliest-branching relative to humans, which is another way of saying the most distantly related species to humans. Does that sound like what you mean?</p>
<p>If so, I think a good argument could be made that insects stretch. At least they contract their muscles against one another in a preparatory way after a period of inactivity to make their activity more effective, which is pretty much what stretching is about in humans. Someone who knows more about insect and human physiology will have to come along and say how accurate this comparison really is, though.</p>
<p>If you want to go even more distantly related, you could look at jellyfish (Cnidarians) or maybe flatworms (Platyhelminthes). Both groups do have muscles, so it's possible they stretch them. I'm not sure, though. More distantly related organisms than that don't even have muscles, so I don't think anything they do could be considered equivalent to stretching in humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even your edit doesn’t really help much. Every branching point has two offshoots, each of which has the same age, and both of them are going to keep branching. The “tree of life” really has no trunk. If you look at <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Tree_of_life_SVG.svg" target="_blank">this phylogenetic tree for example</a>, which branch is “oldest”? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
