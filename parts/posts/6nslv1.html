<p>I have 2 friends both who had babies at around the same time.  One friend cannot even have the TV on downstairs or the baby wakes up.  The other friend had 3 guys over drinking, playing video games and yelling at the TV all night and the baby was asleep IN THE ROOM the entire time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is another issue that no one has mentioned - it depends on the phase of sleep the adult or baby is in when the noise is made. There are many reports of people sleeping through fire alarms going off. When you are deep sleep it can be very hard to wake up, even shaking and yelling may not be enough. In other phases of sleep you can be woken by leaves rustling . . .</p>
<p>We also trained our kids to sleep through noise by not being quiet when they were sleeping. My teenager was sleeping through me hammering nails on the porch 10 feet from his room yesterday morning!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
