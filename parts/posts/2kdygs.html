<p>Summary of the answers:</p>
<p>*Current batteries are based on lithium-ion technology which was developed a very long time ago so it is now very mature. Mature technologies won't change that much more or get that much cheaper.</p>
<p>*Li-Ion battery technology has actually improved considerably in the past two decades. Progress has slowed recently.

<p>*Modern smartphones and other consumer electronic devices also use a lot more power which cancels out the improvements in the battery.</p>
<p>*The trend in consumer electronics is towards smaller and thinner devices so the size of the battery must also be reduced. Smaller batteries hold less charge.</p>
<p>*New batteries based on more promising materials take a lot of time to go from the lab to a commercial product due to concerns about safety.</p>
<p>*Media often over states and hypes new battery developments.
