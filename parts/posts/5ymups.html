<p>Edit: Thanks everyone for the great feedback! Just for some people wondering, I don't go stare into the sun all day with one eye closed haha, I was always just curious as to why this sensation occurred when it was a bright day out.</p></div></div>

<blockquote>
<p>The threshold for &quot;too much light&quot; is determined by the brain for both eyes combined, not individually. That's why if you only open one eye, the brain doesn't think it is too bright, as it effectively uses the total amount of light from both eyes to check. BTW: your eyes can still be damaged by too much light, even if the brain doesn't think so.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You shouldn't be looking at the sun head-on even with one eye.</p>
<p>The damage to your eye is physical, the sensation of it being too bright is perceptual. That is, your brain is telling you it's too bright.</p>
<p>Simplistic analogy if you were a camera. The lens would be your eye and the sensor would be your brain. The lens in this case is light-sensitive and susceptible to damage.</p>
<p>If you cover half the lens, the sensor is getting half the light, so it doesn't say &quot;too bright!&quot; However, the uncovered portion of the lens (your open eye) still gets the full blast of sun and can be damaged.</p>
<p>By closing one eye you're fooling your brain and essentially telling it to shut up when it's trying to tell you that what you're looking at is too bright and potentially damaging. In the end, though, your brain will have the last laugh when you're blind in one eye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While delusional, I ignored the pain and stared at the sun. It scarred my retinas. In the center of my vision is a small dot of blindness that gets bigger if I'm intoxicated. Most of the time I don't notice it unless I think about it. I'm extremely lucky that I can see as well as I do. </p>
<p>Just FYI in case you can manage the pain and think about staring. Don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
