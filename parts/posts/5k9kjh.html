Even when I was smoking upwards of a pack per day, I didn't NEED a smoke after a meal. One time in my life, after sex, I really wanted a smoke, but not normally. So, what is it about a meal or sex that triggers so many to smoke?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's synergy.</p>
<p>Sex releases dopamine in your brain, which is the 'feel good' chemical.</p>
<p>Food also releases dopamine in your brain.</p>
<p>Guess what else releases dopamine in your brain... Nicotine.</p>
<p>Add any two of the above together, and the feel good is better than just the sum of the parts.</p>
<p>You didn't bring it up, but sex and food is also an excellent combination.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm imperfect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All right. So imagine a drain. There's this drain under your brain, and there's this things that make you feel good in your brain, the &quot;Feelgood&quot; hormones.</p>
<p>So when you eat or have sex, your brain produces lots and lots of Feelgood dust, which makes you feel awesome. But then the Feelgood dust leaves through the drain and you feel normal again.</p>
<p>Now, there's this poison, nicotine, that clogs the drain, and that means that the Feelgood Dust stays in your head for longer. Isn't that wonderful?</p>
<p>The problem is that the drain is very delicate. If the Smoke Poison clogs it too many times in too short a time, it breaks and it becomes wider. And then the feelgood dust disappears immediately and you don't feel good ever. So you need to get more and more of the Smoke Poison just to feel normal. That's called Addiction.</p>
<p>But don't worry, just stop getting smoke poison and eventually the drain will repair itself and become regular sized again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know from a film studies course that due to the film production code of 1930(?) people couldn't film anything to imply sex. And shoeing people smoking in the bed next to each other was a wink to the audience saying they totally had sex but allowed plausible deniability because &quot;oh they were just enjoying a cigarette in bed.&quot;</p>
<p>But in real life I don't have an answer for it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
