		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically they are tropical cyclones, and they are called hurricanes, cyclones or typhoons depending where they occur in the world. This <a href="http://www.learnnc.org/lp/media/uploads/2009/12/cyclone_map_large.gif" target="_blank">map</a> explains the names well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/images/1851_2015_allstorms_sm.jpg" target="_blank">Hurricanes</a> happen on both sides of the American continent, but those happening on the West occur south of the US, hitting Mexico and very few parts of Central America.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are called cyclones and typhoons in other parts of the world. The storms require the warm water and weather conditions of the tropics to form, and generally travel in a western direction until the begin to degenerate and then fall into an easterly flow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The coriolis effect is the reason for the shape spin and movement. But its not limited to North America. Everywhere gets hits with similar large storms. Typhoons and hurricanes are the same just names are different.  But mostly Because the earth is not flat.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hurricanes that hit elsewhere are usually known as typhoons. And they tend to hit places like Japan, the Phillipines, and Australia. The reason California never gets hit is that the prevailing winds in the subtropical Northern Hemisphere blow from East to West. Systems that form in the Pacific Ocean are therefore pushed away from California.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Storms of this type have many names. Typhoon, Cyclone etc. To answer this part, America is not alone in the storm, but only in name.</p>
<p>As for why the east/gulf gets hit and the West doesnt... you'll have to ask a weather person, of which I am not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
