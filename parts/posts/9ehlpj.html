		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>White sugar is brown sugar after being processed to take molasses out of it. Originally, brown sugar came first, but most commercial brown sugars are actually made from adding molasses back in to the white sugar, rather than just leaving it in its first stage. Probably because it's easier/cheaper for a company to get a hold of white sugar post-processing than to nab it in its raw form.</p>
<p>Brown sugar makes things softer because the added molasses adds moisture to the baked end result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pro Life Tip:  All brands of white sugar are basically the same: it's simply a pure chemical.  Not true with brown sugar.  Most brands of brown sugar just take white sugar and add some molasses back in.  You can actually wash the brown off and get white sugar again.  C&amp;H brand brown sugar is more &quot;natural&quot;, as it is simple raw sugar that is never refined all the way to white sugar.  The difference in taste and texture are very noticeable - for brown sugar I never buy anything else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a 5-year-old-type explanation, white sugar is dry and refined, while brown sugar contains molasses. The molasses keeps the brown sugar soft (assuming that you store it in an airtight container).</p>
<p>The molasses/brown sugar helps keep cookies moist. </p>
<p>In a side note, white sugar will last nearly forever if you donâ€™t get it wet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
