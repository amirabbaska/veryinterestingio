		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To me, I look at it as multiple associations and connections when you really go through and analyze it. It could be recontextualized that low notes feel &quot;broad&quot;, while high notes feel &quot;sharp&quot;. Think of hearing thunder in the distance, versus a glass breaking. From there, the terms broad and sharp can be associated with tactile feelings. The feeling of warmth brings up ideas of being covered fully in a warm blanket, while cold is biting and sharp. It's not really an objective explanation, but that's what came to my mind from your post</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: The warm/cold association you're having with deep/high notes could come from deep notes having wider or &quot;thicker&quot; sound waves and high notes having thinner sound waves.</p>
<p>A note, as opposed to an atonal sound, is a sound wave that is rising and falling in perfect time, measured in Hz (Hertz), which is a unit of frequency. When the space between the peak and base of the sound wave is the exact same number of Hertz, it creates a note. In the case of an atonal sound, the wave rises and falls at different rates, creating a cacophony of frequencies we usually don't perceive as musical.</p>
<p>The classic example is the note A. A3 is measured at 220Hz (near the center of a piano's keyboard), A4 is at 440Hz (one octave above), A5 at 880Hz, and so on. This works going down as well, with A2 at 110Hz and A1 at 55Hz, and A0 at 27.5Hz.</p>
<p>The warm/cold association you're having with deep/high notes could come from the a deep or low note's sound wave being wider, or some would say &quot;thicker,&quot; whereas a high notes sound wave is thinner. This is the part where I stop saying fact and turn to speculation, but, much like air is perceived as thicker when warmer and thinner when colder, so could you be perceiving musical notes. There may even be a link between how sound is processed and temperature is processed either chemically or psychologically, but again at this point this is just me speculating!</p>
<p>Hope that helped :)</p>
