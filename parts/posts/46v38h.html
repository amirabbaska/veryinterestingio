		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry but most of the explanations on here or partially or completely wrong. I am a vet student focused on equine medicine and was just recently discussing this with one of my professors who is a renowned equine surgeon and has cut open more horses than most people have ever seen.</p>
<p>There are several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Horses are pretty weird anatomically - they have no muscles below the knee. Part of their ability to run super fast is this really incredible tendon/ligament system - muscles higher on the body load the tendons and ligaments with huge amounts of power (picture a spring). Because of this, the bones in their lower leg (which is almost always where they break) are relatively very thin but also generating massive power. This ratio is much more extreme in the horse than other animals, so it means that solving it with a few pins like you might in other animals won't do the trick. In addition, this massive power makes it more likely that the horse will basically shatter the bone rather than just a simple break or fracture . Also, they're just really big.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>u/cantcountnoaccount described foundering well - if the horse can't move his legs around, he can't circulate blood through properly and it somewhat pools in the hoof and the attachments of the hoof to the bottom of the leg weaken. Compare this to a human or dog, where we can wiggle our toes and whatnot to help move circulation through - remember, horses have no muscles below the knee.</p>
</li>
<li>Trying to keep a horse from moving around for any extended period of time is a nightmare. There's a saying I heard that all horses have two goals in life: homicide and suicide. They will colic and die if a bird looks at them wrong. In addition to the possibility of foundering, a horse is pretty likely to just lose his marbles if you try to keep them sedentary for too long - they may try to climb out of their stall, break whatever apparatus they're in, colic (severe and sometimes fatal stomach ache), get ulcers and whatever else. You can't force them to lay on their side for very long at all - they're too heavy and will have difficulty breathing and damage nerves.</li>
</ol>
<p>When deciding whether or not to save an animal, quality of life must always be considered. A dog may do perfectly well and have a wonderful life in a cast for a while and then with a moderate limp - this is not true for horses. Further, cost can be very prohibitive; it's worth it for very very expensive horses (think Barbaro) but for your average pleasure horse, the cost and pain is just not worth it or generally feasible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a horse who recovered from a broken leg. It was a very long, very difficult recovery, and was down to the incredible commitment of the vet and the amazing nature and will of the horse.</p>
<p>Bertie was an Irish Draught X Thoroughbred, and was about 25 when it happened, pretty old for any horse. I was on holiday, and someone had taken him for a ride without my permission, or that of the person looking after him (my sister) for me. I was told that he stumbled while cantering across a field. The vet took one look at him and decided he needed to be destroyed. My sister requested another vet. Geoff agreed to try, but admitted that saving him was incredibly remote. If nothing else the general anaesthetic that would be needed to operate, would be likely to kill a horse of his age. She told them to try. He was in theatre for hours, but he made it through. At this stage I came home and discovered what had happened. His leg was held together with more metal than bone, and the whole thing had been somewhat experimental, and we really were only at the beginning. </p>
<p>Once back home, we made some adaptations to his stable. He needed to stay still, for a weeks, and his big roomy stable wasn't going to work. We put a temporary wall in to cut the size in half, stopping him from being able to move about. We raised his water and feed bowls and so they, with his haynet, were at nose height. </p>
<p>After almost 3 months he was allowed to start moving about. The wall was removed, though he was still tied to prevent him laying down (the strain on his leg while getting down and up again could be enough to destroy his progress) Next we moved on to walking, starting with about 20 feet, gently increasing as he became stronger. It was over a year before he was able to be turned out in the field with his friends, and another before I rode him again. Throughout it all Bertie stayed the same gentle, trusting, beautiful natured giant he had always been.</p>
<p>Geoff (the vet) was incredible. He had fought to get Bertie treated and operated on at the amazing Animal Health Trust in Newmarket (they took him on with no charge), and Geoff never charged a penny for his time either. Geoff is a man of very few words, and most people find him a tad stand offish. After witnessing him 'dropping in on his way home' (which was nowhere near his way home) every night for over a year, I can tell you Geoff is a vet who doesn't give a toss about the owners opinions, he is only concerned about the animal, and in my books that makes him a very good vet.</p>
<p>Bertie eventually passed away 12 years later. He lived to a ridiculous age. He had been unusually quiet and laying down more than normal. I sat in his stable with him and we both knew it was the end, and shortly before Geoff arrived, Bertie had a massive heart attack. Both Geoff and I sobbed as he finally put him to sleep. I still tear up remembering him today. He was a very, very special horse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh, a question I can answer!</p>
<p>It's a combination of issues with treatment, and with the expense of treatment. /u/cdb03b got it right when they mentioned that it's incredibly difficult to get a broken bone to heal correctly in a horse, and that the horse would never have the full use of its leg afterward. Part of it is the density of the bone, and part of it is, as /u/cantcountnoaccount pointed out, the circulatory system of a horse is dependent on pressure and release from the hooves in order to keep blood circulating properly throughout all of their limbs (which is part of what makes them so prone to infection when they lose use of one of those limbs).</p>
<p>The physical difficulty of getting an isolated horse bone to heal well is what leads to the difficulty in treating it. It's incredibly physiologically stressful on the horse. Healthy horses spend like 18-22 hours of a given day standing on all four legs and meandering. If a horse breaks its leg, it must be literally immobilized for weeks in order to not put <em>any</em> weight on the leg, until the healing process is stable. But horses who cannot stand, who are kept laying down, develop a multitude of other problems - laminitis, difficult breathing, sores, lameness in other ligaments/tendons/muscles/etc. You'd be extinguishing a grease fire in the kitchen, only to turn around and realize the wildfire from the forest had consumed the rest of your house.</p>
<p>Also, as /u/cantcountnoaccount pointed out, horses are resistant to anything containing their leg. When you put support wraps on a horse who's about to take a long trailer ride or be stabled for a while (to help with circulation when they can't walk around), a horse who has never had wraps on will spend some time kicking their legs out and high-stepping, until they figure out the wraps aren't going to hurt them. That doesn't even bring the hoof into the equation - horses with items on their feet (even if it's a boot with medicinal stuff like poultice or antibacterial soak that's making them feel better) will go to <em>extreme</em> lengths to get That Thing off their foot - kicking, stamping, flinging, chewing at their own leg. If you were going to effectively cast a horse with a broken leg, it may need its foot casted, which it would <em>not</em> like, and it'd probably need to spend the whole time sedated.</p>
<p>And, lastly, you may have seen other animals with broken legs that have healed, right? Dogs, cats, etc. However, those animals don't <em>need</em> to put weight on their leg, and don't <em>need</em> it for their gait in the same way that a horse does. Cats and dogs frequently find a way to walk on three legs, but due to a horse's skeletal structure and the way they're gaited, they simply can't walk or support themselves long-term on only three legs, let alone trot/canter/pace/etc. If you were going to go to extremes and consider amputation, you'd have to look into expensive and sophisticated prosthetics. Which brings me to my last point.</p>
<p>But BadBalloons, you might say, haven't race horses been effectively treated for broken legs before? And this, my friend, is where it gets sad. <em>Yes</em>, you can immobilize a horse in a sling and cast its leg and treat it for the broken leg, <em>if</em> the horse has a personality type that's amenable to the treatment. However, it would require round-the-clock care, high-tech vet facilities, and lots and lots of surgeries, as well as months of recovery, only to be able to <em>maybe</em> function as a basic-level horse. The simple, sad fact of the matter is that most horse owners don't have extra hundreds of thousands of dollars lying around to treat their horse, only for it to never return to its former utility. Horses already cost high-hundreds to thousands of dollars a month. And at the end of the healing process, a showjumper is never going to be able to show at the same level, a reining horse is never going to be able to slide the same. Even if your horse is just a backyard pet, you're already spending hundreds a month on feed or waste removal. There's no reason to spend that much extra money, and probably go into debt, on a horse who can't do his job anymore. The only horses this isn't true of are racehorses, but it's hugely conditional. Racehorses are a prospecting sport - you're paying for potential, either in the horse or in their future babies. <em>If</em> your horse who broke its leg had enough potential as a stud, or to a lesser extent as a broodmare (not sure if it's worth it to breed a mare who's had a broken leg), then it's worth treating their leg because they can make up the hundreds of thousands of dollars of vet bills in stud fees or future baby sales. But there's only a few top-performing racehorses who have that much potential, at any given time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So much misinformation here...</p>
<p>A horse carries a ton of weight over 4 tiny hooves. When the horse breaks a leg, that weight is shifted to the three remaining. Those three become sore and weak from bearing so much extra weight, and then their &quot;good legs&quot; might go bad during the time it would take the &quot;bad leg&quot; to heal.</p>
<p>Additionally, the lower parts of horse legs have very little meat to them. They are almost literally skin, bones, ligaments, veins, etc. Therefore a break is usually catastrophic; there's no &quot;meat&quot; to protect the bone from shattering horribly.</p>
<p>Thirdly, if you wanted to put the horse in a sling to support its weight and allow the leg to heal, you'd be putting a ton of pressure on the horse's tummy (where its major organs are.) This is why horses &quot;stand up&quot; when they sleep and don't spend 8-12 hours at a time laying on their sides/tummies like humans and dogs and cats do.</p>
<p>Also, a champion super-racer would be worth more as a live stud... there are plenty of champs that would have been worth more alive that surely the owners would have saved if they could have. It's not a matter of &quot;oh that's too expensive&quot; it's &quot;we literally can't save this animal.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Horse bones are incredibly dense and fairly difficult to break, but when they do break they do not heal well, easily, or quickly and are very prone to infection. Most would die a slow painful death from infection, even with antibiotics and other medical care. Those that survive would most likely not have full use of the leg, and have a leg prone to break again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
