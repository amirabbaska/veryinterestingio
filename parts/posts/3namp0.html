		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is really old so my comment won't be noticed, but I haven't seen anyone point out that moon dust is supposed to be very much unlike earth sand which has been rounded off and smoothed through friction and wear. Moon dust is very sticky and very abrasive. Think of smooth river stones compared to brand new igneous rocks. Apparently the moon dust was a big problem and it got everywhere. Also I think that the astronauts said that it smelled like cooked beef (but I could be misremembering).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a collection of processes called &quot;space weathering&quot;.  Mostly meteorite impacts (even the tiny ones that Earth's atmosphere protects it from) and solar rays (ditto for atmospheric protection), both of which break down the existing materials that make up the Moon's surface.  These processes are slower than Earth erosion, but the Moon is really old (4.5 billion years) and the damage just accumulates over time.</p>
<p>Edit:  The age of the moon is an <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/19599/age-of-the-moon/" target="_blank">estimate</a> that very smart people came up with.  Mostly by using radioactive decay analysis of lunar materials.  Depending on which element they choose to use for the dating, they come up with differing answers.  So 4.5 billion is a ball-park, give or take a few tens of millions of years, depending on who you ask.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First,  geological processes on Earth also result in the formation of new rocks, which reduces the amount of smaller pieces (called Sediments).  On Earth there is a collection of geological processes which trap sediments and make them into new rock.  Some are called (naturally) sedimentary processes.  Water doesn't only weather rock- it enables the formation (lithification) of sedimentary rocks by dissolving and precipitating some minerals, often around small grains of sand, silt, and clay, which cements them together. Other sedimentary rocks are almost pure precipitates (like the white scales that sometimes are left behind when water evaporates) .  Other processes do this as well - burial, compaction and heating (metamporhism) and melting (subduction along tectonic plate boundaries, where rock and sediment is shoved deep underground until it melts) also recycle sediments into new rock.  </p>
<p>But since the Moon is geologically dead, these processes either don't happen at all, or if they do, are extremely rare.  So on the moon, once rock is weathered to dust, it remains dust.  Weathering happens because of heating and cooling, breaking from meteor impacts, and the constant but thinly spread falling of dust grains from space.  These things have happened constantly for four billion years- time to build up a lot of dust!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the dust is from meteorite impacts, but also remember that without an atmosphere the moon is subject to incredible temperature swings. Even without moisture, over time even the hardest rocks will fracture when heated to 253 Fahrenheit (123 Celsius) and cooled to -387 Fahrenheit (-233 Celsius), and over untold eons be ground into dust</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Vacuum seal a slice of toast. Leave it on your counter in the sunlight. Every day, punch the toast, without breaking the seal or puncturing the bag, at least 100 times. Do that for the next 27 years. What's left is a good example of why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
