		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just because they <em>look</em> like dress oxfords, doesn't mean they <em>are</em> dress oxfords.</p>
<p>For example, I am not a cop, but my buddy that IS a cop turned me on to duty shoes. I work in commercial real estate. So you kinda are expected to have a professional appearance for showings and whatnot, but it's a 365-day a year job, rain, snow, mud whatever.</p>
<p>Anyways the brand I like are the Bates oxfords, they have great support, are pretty water resistant, have a proper outsole that doesn't slide everywhere on snow and ice, they weigh nothing (like, about as much as a pair of sneakers) and last really really well. These are all the things you want from a low pair of hikers or whatever, but it looks like a dress shoe. Perfect for my job. Not bad on the pricing either - Under $150 in my size (12.)</p>
<p>Though, most of the police officers I see nowadays are more dressed like &quot;Paramilitary Outfit&quot; and less like &quot;Officer Friendly.&quot; Combat boots seem to be more popular than oxfords these days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The dress codes vary from department to department and have been evolving for a long time. </p>
<p>Most officers I know now (pretty high number, nature of my job) favor all black boots on duty. Not western style boots, more of a military / hiking / trail runner style that is pretty comfortable, provides ankle support and foot protection and is conducive to running. </p>
<p>When my dad was a patrolman (early 70s) it was black oxfords and they wore a tie as part of their uniform, which was a holdover from earlier times when even bus drivers and the milkman wore a tie. Usually a clip on so it couldn't be used against them in a fight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cop here. I have two issued footwear. I have my dress shoes for my dress uniform. Standard slick bottom shoes for formal events, funerals, parades, etc. I am also issued boots. The boots they give us aren't the best, but they work. And we can trade our boots in and pay an upcharge to have them order any other pair of boots we'd like. What most officers here do, myself included, is go for whatever style we want and just pay the difference, which is around 50 to 100 bucks.</p>
<p>The kind I use is a boot designed like a pair of running shoes. They offer protection like a boot around the food and ankle, but don't have the rigidity of a boot. Some prefer to have thicker/taller boots though.</p>
<p>The main reason I think there isn't a standard issue black running shoe is due to proneness for injury. While my Brooks GTS would be fantastic to wear, I have been in foot chases before where I've completely eaten my ass. The boots I wear protected me from spraining my ankle or otherwise hurting more than my pride. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is an entire niche industry of companies that make law enforcement specific clothing. There are nice looking button down shirts where the buttons are fake and they're hiding a zipper, dress pants with hidden cargo pockets, and even comfortable reliable boots or shoes that look like dress shoes. Just because a cop looks like he's wearing dressy clothes doesn't mean he is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
