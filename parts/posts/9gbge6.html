</blockquote>
<p>Basically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At what point does the DNA pairing occur, and what is the mechanism for deciding this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sperm's DNA moves near the egg's DNA relatively quickly.  I'm not sure what you mean by pairing, but the mother's copy of a chromosome and the father's corresponding copy of the same type of chromosome don't actually physically connect to one another.  The only time that happens is during meiosis, but that's not a process that occurs in a zygote or embryo.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I understand dominant and submissive traits, is this just done via chemical reaction or is there some sort of physical process controller?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interaction between alleles or genes can vary based on a lot of things.  However, it's not like the cell &quot;turns on&quot; 1 copy of the gene and &quot;turns off&quot; the other copy.  Think of it more like both copies of the gene producing their own proteins in varying quantities and the resulting combination of proteins produces a trait.  In the case of a simple dominant-recessive trait, that could mean something like having an allele that makes a black pigment and an allele that produces no colored pigment, but there's enough black pigment made that the organism's body ends up looking black.  In that case, the black trait is dominant but both copies of the gene are still functioning. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the rezipping occur within the egg cell or in its first division?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a &quot;zipping&quot; process when DNA replication occurs.  That would first occur before the first cell division takes place, similar to how DNA replication occurs during interphase in any other cell. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do all initial division cells have the same DNA or are multiple configurations made from the egg and a &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; determines the dominant combination?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the most part, every cell in the body that has DNA has the same DNA.  Different cells in the embryo will go on to form different structures, but throughout the whole process, muscle cells will have the same genetic code as nerve cells which have the same genetic code as skin cells, etc.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The root question here: at what point could an egg or zygote be considered a unique life form if looking specifically at DNA encoding?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every step along the way, including individual gametes (sperm and egg) and the zygote have their own unique DNA sequence that codes for proteins.  It's never fully independent of the parents, as evidenced by things like maternal effect genes (genes for which the mother's DNA determines a trait in the offspring).  However, the zygote is genetically different from the parents.  That being said, this is not universally recognized as the point at which a developing human, for example, would attain personhood.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well from your use of the words pairing and rezipping, I think you might be under the impression that base pairing is going on with one strand from the sperm and one from the egg. This isn't the case. You get a full 5' and 3' strand from each parent.</p>
<p>You have 46 chromosomes and they all have (or should) complete genes. You get one whole copy from Mom and another from Dad. They don't base pair because the differences wouldn't match. Every one of your cells has all 46 in it. You don't hybridize mom and dad's DNA. (You kinda do when you make your own eggs and sperm for your own kids, so it's posssible they get a gene from each grandparent on the same chromosome). </p>
<p>This is why some conditions we call &quot;autosomal recessive&quot; are so because if you have a non functional enzyme from one parent but you can still produce enough functional protein from the other parents gene. If they are both non-functional you don't have any of that enzyme. Dominant conditions are usually those where misfunction of the mutated product can't be overcome some enzymes being normal. Thats not true in all cases but it's a rule of thumb</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My wife's answer:</p>
<p>When the sperm cell and the egg cell meet, they fuse together. Their cell membranes join together, and the sperm cell empties its contents into the egg cell, and the sperm becomes part of the egg entirely.</p>
<p>The sperm cell is specialized to carry only nuclear DNA (26 chromosomes). This is because they must swim to the egg, which requires a lot of energy from the sperm cell, so they are very small and light to making swimming easier. Unfortunately, this means they carry a very little load. The egg cell therefore must contribute ALL cellular components (think about the cell membrane, mitochondria, etc.) because the sperm cell brings ONLY nuclear DNA. </p>
<p>After the cells have combined, the paternal DNA is moved via intracellular transporting mechanisms to the egg nucleus where the maternal DNA is located. The cell has an internal skeleton-like structure which it uses for transport between organelles.</p>
<p>Once the nucleus of the egg cell contains a complete set of chromosomes the cell is now considered a zygote. I believe that this is the point in which the cell is “a unique life form” – when the cell nucleus has a complete set of chromosomes.</p>
<p>Once the DNA has been combined, then the first cell division will begin, and all future somatic (non-gametic cells like eggs and sperm) will be the same as this initial fertilized cell.</p>
<p>One thing I should note, the chromosomes don’t combine or zip together. Chromosomes refer to the condensed form of DNA. The DNA is usually unwrapped in the nucleus in a messy heap, like spaghetti, so while the maternal and paternal DNA mixes the chromosomes themselves aren’t reassembling.</p>
<p>I hope that clears things up!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>DNA does not recombine like that. It is recessive traits not submissive traits.</p>
<p>Humans have 46 chromosomes that exist in 23 pairs that are &quot;identical&quot; except for the sex chromosomes where we have a X and Y type.</p>
<p>We get 23 from out father and 23 from out mother. The don't combined or are mixed in regular cells. So the result of dominant trait happen when  the information is used in development of the human of in the daily life of the cell.</p>
<p>So we have the exact same chromosomes in our body that was in the sperm and egg that create us. They don't mix.</p>
<p>The fact they don't mix and the genes for the recessive traits are important and was a a early important discovery in genetics.</p>
<p>If R is dominant and r is recessive and both parents have R in on chromosome and r in the other. So they are Rr. </p>
<p>The possible combination are if the first letter if from the father and the second from the mother</p>
<pre><code>RR
Rr
rR
rr</code></pre>
<p>The result is that a child from two patents that have express the dominant traits can express the recessive  trait.</p>
<p>There is a exception for cells used in reproduction. The DNA from both chromosomes in a pair is mixed
so the DNA of a male sperm or female egg have a unique DNA.</p>
<p>The result is that the zygote  that is the combination of the sperm and the egg have a unique DNA combination. But is was created from egg and sperm that also was unique. </p>
<p>So a zygote is a unique but  the result might not be unique because identical twins are formed from a single zygote that separate in two parts after it start to divide and form two embryos. </p>
<p>So identical twins have identical DNA. More exactly there can be some differences because of error when cells divides. But that is also true for a individual so all part of your body does not have identical DNA but there can be a few change base pares.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting point to add to this -  </p>
<p>You know that the zygote gets 23 chromosomes from mom and 23 from dad.  Sperm and egg are haploid cells, as opposed to the diploid cells that are in your body right now, with 46 chromosomes each.  </p>
<p>BUT... technically at the moment when the egg is fertilized, it is not quite haploid -- it still has 46 chromosomes (23 pairs of sister chromatids).  It undergoes the final stage of meiosis after the sperm penetrates the egg, and ejects a small daughter cell called a &quot;polar body&quot; that contains 23 chromosomes.  This happens within a few hours after sperm joins with egg.  </p>
<p>The zygote starts to divide at some point after this.  So when the zygote starts to divide, it has the normal complement of 46 chromosomes -- 23 from mom, and 23 from dad.    </p>
<p>But very early on, there is a brief period of time when the fertilized egg actually has 69 chromosomes inside of it, before the polar body splits off with the extra maternal chromosomes.  So, you might say that the unique genetic code of the new life is not exactly set at fertilization, but when the polar body leaves. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
