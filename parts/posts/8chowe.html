<p>When thinking about things being sticky or slick it’s useful to think of the molecules as tiny little robots with magnetic grabber arms.  Some materials have lots of arms and connect to each other well.  Some materials have very few arms and don’t have a strong connection.  Some materials have the wrong kind of connectors for each other and don’t have a connection at all, in fact they push each other apart.</p>
<p>Sticky things like tape, glue, snot and honey are all made up of little parts, molecules, that have a lot of grabber arms.  They are also really good at getting into all the little nooks and crannies of what it’s trying to stick to.</p>
<p>Slick or oily things like grease, lubricants and ice don’t grab on to other things as well as sticky things because they have fewer arms and don’t do a good job of making contact with the other surface.</p>
<p>This is why pressing on things helps to make them stick better.  You are forcing more of the two things to touch, getting into all the little bits of the surface.  You also add energy by pressing which can cause things like forcing more grabber arms to activate.</p>
<p>Since this blew up a bit, here’s some more info.  Thanks for the feedback and info.</p>
<p>The tiny little robots (molecules) don’t only use their magnetic grabber arms to hold on to other materials, they also try to hold on to each other.  Some robots have better arms for this than others and do a really good job of staying together, this is really important for things like tape and glue.  If the robots can grab the other surface but can’t hang on to each other then it won’t help us to stick two things together, it will just get sticky stuff on two things.</p>
<p>Another thing that happens is changes in the settings of the robot.  Given some time or energy (like heating things up or pressing them) some types of robots will grip harder to other things or to itself by locking into place and not wanting to move or flex any more.  We see this as hardening or setting in glue.</p>
<p>A note on ice... Water is an unusual molecule, its little tiny robots do a lot of things differently than most robots.  One of these things is friction, where we know that ice is slick but are still figuring out exactly why it is.  It looks like it’s the very top layer of machines switch back and forth between ice and water, so stuff flows over the water and the water flows over the ice.  It’s like if the first row of robots just rolled along the top of the other robots, grabbing on while moving a little.</p>
<p>Remember that all of this is happening with robots so tiny that comparing them to us is like comparing an ant to a mountain.  Bumps and scrapes we can see in something can make it feel less slick, but that’s the shape of the item, not the molecular interaction, so we call that traction.</p>
<p>(Edit: minor clean up)
(Edit 2 - added more info)
(Edit 3 - fixed an “it’s” to “its” because even though it’s possessive that’s not how this word’s apostrophe works because it’s a contraction.  English is dumb.)
(Edit 4 - Added illustration form u/pupuren)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2r8ujc/when_i_touch_something_slimy_or_sticky_at_a/" target="_blank">/r/askscience</a> Has a good answer, but it's really technical. Let me try and break it down for a 5yr old ;-).</p>
<p>Slippery things (oil etc.) is non-polar, meaning just like the magnets on your fridge it doesn't want to stick to itself. (There isn't a positive or a negative side to the molecule.) Sticky stuff is the exact opposite, allowing magnetic attractions that are hard to break between molecules.</p>
<p>Imagine setting a bunch of steel marbles on a table spaced out from each other, and then trying to run a magnet through them. That's sticky stuff like honey. </p>
<p>Now same experiment but instead of a magnets this second time lets roll another steel ball across the table. This time the ball has no difficulting moving between the other object and can likely make it to the end of the table without picking up any of the other steel balls on the way. This is greasy stuff like oil.</p>
<p>Please somebody with an actual degree jump in and correct me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have noticed a lot of people talking about polarity of molecules and they have all given excellent answers, but I used to struggle personally with what that really means.  A polar molecule is one that has regions that are partially positively charged and regions that are partially negatively charged.  It tends to act like a magnet for other polar molecules.</p>
<p>Water is the best example to explain this concept.  Water is composed of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms connected by covalent bonds.  A covalent bond is one where atoms share electrons to complete their outermost layer.  The two hydrogens and the oxygen bond with each other to complete their outer layer, but this sharing is not even.  The oxygen atom tends to hog all of the shared electrons including the hyrogens own electrons it brings to the table.  This causes the electrons to spend less time with the hydrogen atoms.  The hydrogen atoms become partially positive due to the presence of their positively charged protons, and the reduced presence of the negatively charged electrons.  The Oxygen has electrons in it's outermost shell that are not tied up in any sharing with the hydrogen atoms.  This causes it to have a partial negative charge due to it's excess electrons.  We now have a molecule with a partially positive region and a partially negative region.  This allows it to interact with other molecules that have positive or negative charges including other water molecules.  This is what it means to be polar.  </p>
<p>A non-polar molecule tends to have relatively even sharing of electrons.  An example of a mostly non polar substance would be oil.  A greasy substance such as oil consists largely of chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms bonded together.  Carbon does not hog electrons like oxygen and forms bonds without having any excess electrons.  This causes the bonds it makes to be mostly neutral without any positive or negative charge.  A substance that is non-polar  will have minimal interaction with polar substances due to it's lack of positive or negative charge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well generally greasy things, like oil, butter and lubricants in general, are basically substances made of long CH2 chains (one carbon atom connected to 2 hydrogens repeating all over again). These CH2 chains form very weak, omnidirectional interactions with most substances (the more apolar the substances they touch are, the better they stick (that's why you can't wash oil with water)) The greasiness is due to the fact that this molecules have strong enough interactions to stick to things, to &quot;wet&quot; them, but low enough so that they spread and slide onto each other giving this slimy feature.</p>
<p>Sticky is more or less the same but you just increase the strength of these interactions but I'm not an expert in neither of these fields TBH.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it has high levels of fat, it'll be greasy, because fat has no electric charge, it's non-polar/hydrophobic, if it encounters a substance with electrical charges or ''watery'', it'll ''slide'' away, because it has no ''interest'' in having contact with that substance, it's already neutral (at equilibrium). If it has sugar or proteins, it'll stick, because sugar and most proteins are polar and hydrophilic (either positively or negatively charged), so when they encounter something with an electric charge (such as the palm of your hands/feet), they'll stick together to have a neutral charge.</p>
<p>Btw, polar means that one region of the molecule has more positive/negative charges than the other region. The best example is water. The oxygen atom is bigger and exerces a stronger pull on the electrons, which means that they spend more time orbiting around the oxygen than around the hydrogen atoms, the oxygen is then partially negatively charged and vice-versa for the hydrogen. That's why you can dissolve sugar or whey protein into water, but not oil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
