		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: When you mail a letter some place, you usually put a return address on it. However there is nobody that actually checks to verify the letter came from where you say it did. You could live in California and pretend to be from Washington, and if you use a re-mailer service the post marks will even show it's from Washington. </p>
<p>It is the same with telephone numbers in the digital age due to the ability of many voice over IP customers to change the phone number displayed when they call someone, much like setting a fake return address above. This allows scammers, robodialers, telemarketers, even bill collectors, to call a person without revealing their real phone number, or even pretending to be somebody else like the IRS, a neighbor, the police department, or a business.</p>
<p>Detailed explanation: Telephone systems used to work using a protocol called SS7 or signalling system 7 which uses point codes instead of ip addresses. SS7 packets contain information about the source point code, the destination, and information on who placed the call, and where the call is destined. Because the telephone company had exclusive access to this network, it was not possible to fake a telephone number. </p>
<p>Then came voice over IP which uses TCP/IP networking to send telephone calls over a data network using things like SIGTRAN or SIP (thanks for the correction Databeast) which helps establish calls over IP networks. </p>
<p>SIP information can be sent by the telephone company, but if you have access to a SIP provider, then it is possible to change the displayed number and make a telephone call appear to come from any phone number you wish, the same way changing the return to address on a letter can. </p>
<p>This allows spammers and scammers to hide their real telephone number, and make the call appear to come from any phone number they wanted. For instance the IRS 800 number, your local police department phone number, friends or family, or even your own local area code and prefix so they could pretend to be a local call. </p>
<p>This makes it very easy to abuse the telephone system in a hard to trace manner while remaining anonymous so your victims have little information to find or incriminate you. </p>
<p>This is why telephone abuse is becoming more prevalent even on national call blocked numbers. Some people have asked why the phone companies don't block them and the answer is it was against the law and they could incur FCC fines for disrupting telephone calls. The FCC is working on new rules that would allow a user to give their phone provider permission to block these type of calls without incurring fines. </p>
<p>It is a good policy to set your phones default ring tone to silence or 24 hour &quot;do not disturb&quot;, and specifically add phone numbers of friends and family to the exclusion list so the phone will still ring when they call. </p>
<p>And if you see a phone call placed from the first 6 digits of your real phone number, it is guaranteed to be a scam. If your phone number is 210 855 4444 and you see a phone call from 210 855 1234 it's a scam. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll tell you what I do about it that seems to help tremendously. I do this for the Microsoft style scam calls and the ones asking things like if I had a bladder mesh surgery and want to join a class action suit. </p>
<p>As others have mentioned, the cost is so minimal nowadays that for all practical purposes, it costs them nothing. But, the one thing they don't have is unlimited time. Therefore, I drag it out so long that it makes it very inconvenient for them to call me. First, I play along and play dumb for as long as possible. They ask if I'm a homeowner, yes. They ask if I'm a renter, yes. They ask if I have been exposed to asbestos, yes. You get the picture. </p>
<p>Then they finally catch on that I'm wasting their time. Many of the outright scam artists come from countries where family is very important. I start telling them how they embarrass their families by being dishonest people. If this doesn't bother them, I move on to how their parents must be so embarrassed that they are such failures that being a scam artist is the only type of job they are capable of because they are such pathetic people. I'll tell them they are dumb, pathetic losers who aren't capable  of legit jobs. Their parents must be so embarrassed by what failures they are. While everyone else brags what their kids do, their parents have to stay silent to their friends because they are such losers that they shame their family. I'm not going to lie, I get downright vicious. </p>
<p>They will most likely become hostile at this point. Then I move on to insulting their penis. If they say anything back, I flat out taunt them. They work as scam artists in 3rd world countries, it's not like they have the means to get on a plane. I insult their dignity and their manhood. Eventually they get do pissed they hang up on me. I do this all over a good 10-30 minutes. I make it so hostile, uncomfortable, and time consuming that it no longer makes sense for them to contact me. Whatever scam  outfit that person is from, they typically will not contact me again for a good 6 months to a year.</p>
<p>Sorry this isn't an official this works to report them to authorities who will care and do something about it. However, I've found this to be the most efficient way to get these people to stop bothering me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why, exactly, but it has to do with how gullible people, in general, are. Working in law enforcement, I encounter calls from citizens being scammed like this, about a dozen everyday. The most recent one I remember was a man in his 20s or 30s and transient; he got a call from the IRS on the day after Tax Day. The person on the other line said he owed money to the IRS and if he didn't pay, there will be a warrant out for his arrest and local PD will be out to get him (nevermind that he's transient and doesn't have a stable address for them to come get him, but I digress). He believes this and agrees to pay. They tell him to pay with $400 worth of iTunes cards and send the numbers or whatever to a particular account or number, and he does so. He realizes several hours later that he might have been scammed.</p>
<p>He asks me, with hope in his voice, &quot;ma'am, is this true? Does the IRS typically accept that form of payment?&quot; Because in spite of everything, he honestly believed them. It was kind of sad.  </p>
<p>Instead of saying what I really wanted to say, I just posed a question: &quot;what is the IRS going to do with an iTunes gift card?&quot;</p>
<p>Then it struck home. </p>
<p>Remember folks, if the IRS needs to get in touch with you, they will contact you through mail. And they will definitely find better ways to fuck you out of your hard-earned money than to demand iTunes cards!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My job at work is to caption phone calls for the deaf and hard of hearing. About 30-40% of calls that we connect to are either telemarketers, cardholder services, pre-recorded charity drives, warranty chasers, and PC scams. Occasionally we do get dangerous calls like the ones that call and pretend the person's grandson is in jail in Mexico or that they won something and they're demanding $250 bucks through Western Union before they can get their millions. </p>
<p>There is nothing we, the interpreters, can do about that. FCC regulations clearly defines that we have no business intentionally altering the conversation to alert the poor old biddy that gets drawn in to these kinds of things. We can only caption verbatim. I know a lot of colleagues who become distressed after certain calls because they have to just sit there and listen to someone get scammed out of their money.</p>
<p>However, if you do have a relative that has a captioning phone, interpreters are allowed to collect the call IDs that we suspect as scams and patch it through to operations. This is a relatively recent addition and our marketing team sends out newsletters to customers just to at least warn them of such calls. Personally, I've told my parents and my grandparents to always come to us should they get any calls that demand money from them and stay clear away from those Microsoft scam fuckers because they are literally the worst. Top shit tier scum buckets along with the Western Union guys.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's what you can do:<br />
Waste their time.    </p>
<p>The scam only works because it's fast to sort the rubes from the non-rubes, even though the probability of finding a rube is very low.     Change this balance even slightly, and the scam becomes unprofitable.   </p>
<p>You can't lower the percentage of rubes in the population, but you can increase the time it takes to find them: by keeping the scammer on the line even though you know it's a scam.    </p>
<p>The scammers hate this. They're trying to make a fast buck, and you're slowing them down.  As a result, they furiously scrub their lists for time-wasters.<br />
Nothing else works.  Hanging up doesn't work - that costs them nothing. Being rude doesn't work, that just means they hang up and cut their losses - they'll still call again.   </p>
<p>The only thing that works is to be nice, string them along, keep them on the line as long as possible.        </p>
<p><strong>Waste.  Their.  Time.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
