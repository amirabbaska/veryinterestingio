		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not to be rude, but it pains me to see how uninformed some of these responses are.  Hopefully I can remedy this.  Although it is not entirely known why we even sleep and/or dream in the first place, there are a few rather well accepted theories.  First, theories on why we even sleep:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The restorative theory:  Being awake and active takes a lot of energy.  Aside from eating, one of the ways that our bodies conserves and restores energy and rejuvenates our body is simply by sleeping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The evolutionary theory:  This is slightly linked to the restorative theory in that it revolves around survival and efficiency.  When we sleep, we're not expending much energy, and we don't require much energy.  Thus, by sleeping, we conserve resources to help reduce the amount of food we need to eat.  Additionally, it is thought that early humans and our ancestors  benefited by sleeping at night because it allowed them to rest while also remaining motionless so that predators couldn't find them.</p>
</li>
<li>Memory consolidation theory:  In short, sleep functions as a way for us to take our memories from throughout the day and sort and consolidate them so that we can remember them better.  This has a rather large degree of support because some studies show that napping after studying can help increase information retention.</li>
</ol>
<p>Onto dreams now; first, the nature of dreams.  Dreams tend to be (as many I'm sure can agree with) rather emotional, not very logical, and full of sensory stimuli.  These seemingly intrinsic properties can be explained with a variety of other theories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The problem solving theory:  Dreams are a way that our minds take unsolved problems from throughout the day and attempt to unconsciously sort through them and look for answers.  One reason this has some support is because since dreams aren't very logical, the abstract approach dreaming can lend to problem solving can sometimes provide unexplored answers by letting you think about something in a way you would've never tried otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wish fulfillment:  Our dreams manifest latent desires.  (Good) Dreams are a place where you can do anything, be anything, and potentially be better (in your own eyes) than the real you is.  A professor once told me that &quot;everyone is great in their dreams&quot;.  Dreams can be a way for your mind to reassure itself and fulfill unlikely or impossible desires (which explains why many people fly in their dreams.</p>
</li>
<li>Activation-synthesis theory:  This is the most scientific theory that attempts to explain dreams.  Essentially, it states that while you sleep and as your brain recuperates, it does whatever work it needs to do along with a little &quot;exercising&quot; so that your mind stays active despite your being unconscious in the form of randomly stimulating neurons.  As a side effect of the random neuron firing, your cortex receives random nonsensical &quot;messages&quot; (for lack of a better work), and tries to make sense of the nonsense and in the process produces what we experience as dreams.</li>
</ol>
<p>Onto the real topic of nightmares.  It's a fact that people have bad dreams, but there's (are you sensing a theme here) multiple explanations for why.  The strongest explanation has to do with the parts of the brain that are most active during dreams, and partially links back to some of the theories mentioned earlier.  Note that all of the brain is active while we sleep, some parts are simply more or less active than others.  First, recall that it is the cortex that generates the content of our dreams (that is, the cortex is what interprets the signals it's getting and turns it into something it/we can make sense of).  Another part of the brain especially active while we sleep is the amygdala, which is (ding ding ding) the part of our brain most active when we are in a state of fear.  This explains why nightmares are possible, because the part of our brain that responds to fear is essentially on overdrive for one reason or another.  Lastly (though there is much more that can be said, I'm simply covering the most important parts of the brain in sleep), the least active portion of the brain during sleep is the frontal lobes, whose job it is to enable critical thinking - this explains why dreams are nonsensical and why we don't often realize it was a dream until we wake up because the frontal lobes aren't active and assessing the situation.  All of these physiological processes combined are not only what allow dreams in general, but what give us a predisposition for bad dreams purely from the parts of the brain that contribute to dreaming in the first place.  Another consideration to take is that, returning to the evolutionary theory and the problem solving theory, dreams can be considered a way for our brain to play out and determine how to react in crazy, dangerous situations without actually being in that crazy, dangerous situation, so that if it ever does occur, your brain knows how to react without thinking much.  Additionally nightmares can simply be caused by stress, due to the stress temporarily wearing out the part of your brain that manages and regulates emotions, allowing your dreams (that are already emotional and nonsensical) to be a lot more spooky.</p>
<p>Lastly (for real this time), a brief note about why we are sometimes afraid of our thoughts, not only when looking back at a dream, but when conscious as well.  All people have weird, scary thoughts sometimes.  Not only about absurd dangerous hypothetical situations, our mortality, etc., but also things just like &quot;If I did this this and this, I could rob this bank and get out totally safe and sound&quot; for one example.  It seems silly to say, but our brain essentially thinks things like this so that it has time to consider it and realize that it's what you SHOULDN'T do, and to prevent you from actually doing it.  Another example is that just because sometimes you think about hitting someone that's annoying you or really want to, that doesn't mean you have anger problems, it's just your brain acknowledging something that it knows it shouldn't do but would really like to do, and making you aware of how it would play out so you realize the absurdity of the action(s) so that you DON'T do it.  </p>
<p>Hopefully I addressed everything satisfactorily, feel free to respond with more questions that I'll do my best to answer, and if you actually read everything I said, thank you for your time.  Have a nice day everyone.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  Sleep happens, dreams happen, we have a few ideas why, no one is entirely sure, and though your brain just really likes to watch you suffer, it also is doing its best to help you survive.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Obligatory &quot;wow, thanks for the Gold, stranger!&quot;  But seriously, never thought I would get Gold, and I'm really glad so many people have found my answer helpful.  Feel free to keep asking questions, I'll keep doing my best to answer what I can :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a cognitive scientist but I'm interested in the field and my understanding is that there are a couple of currently prevalent evidence based explanations, of which I favor one in particular. I say evidence based meaning that I'm discounting anything Freudian that says nightmares are some form of expression of maternal angst or some such.</p>
<p>The explanations are that during sleep, the deeper parts of your brain, in particular the hippocampus go into overdrive. It is known that a <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?ie=UTF-8#q=damaged%20hippocampus%20symptoms" target="_blank">damaged hippocampus</a> disables or affects our ability to form memories. It's also known that it is part of the center from which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus#Anatomy" target="_blank">emotions are &quot;emanate&quot;</a>. This, to me, is a very plausible and good explanation: during sleep, your hippocampus does something akin to &quot;committing to memory&quot; your day's experiences. This also jives well with our subjective experience of very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashbulb_memory" target="_blank">vivid memories</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_perception#Effects_of_emotional_states" target="_blank">&quot;slow motion time&quot;</a> during events of high emotional intensity. It also concurs with research that shows that our ability to form memories goes down with <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?q=sleep%20deprivation%20memory%20consolidation" target="_blank">sleep depravation</a>. So the entire thing seems to be self consistent.</p>
<p>Now, as for the dreams: the theory I like is that your cortex and all higher functioning parts of your brain are essentially devoid of all external stimuli during sleep, but they continues to &quot;work&quot;. Their function is specifically to &quot;make sense&quot; of stimuli, meaning to interpret and decode.</p>
<p>So essentially, this is what's happening: sleep shuts your sensory and motor activity down so that the hippocampus can consolidate memories, meanwhile the electrical signals it is outputting are not magically cut out from the rest of your brain but simply &quot;radiate outwards&quot;, and your higher brain just tries to make sense of it all, which is why you get this semi-narrative story going on: because that's what your higher brain does, it tries to make a consistent world view.</p>
<p>This is also why your dreams seem to randomly and very fluidly change settings and locations. Because there is no outside stimuli, there is no coherent objective narrative that your brain can follow - as opposed to say real life where putting your hand in front of your eyes doesn't suddenly make the entire world go away, it's still there when you take your hand away. So it makes a best fit as it goes along, even if that best fit has nothing to do with 5 seconds ago.</p>
<p>Finally, in this entire model: nightmares are no different than any other dream expect that they have strong negative emotional overtones associated (like dread or sadness or whatever).</p>
<p>But next time you have a nightmare, try this out: replay the dream you were having in your head. Maybe even write it down. You'll notice it isn't actually that scary at all. In fact, when people recount their nightmares to others, it often falls flat on the listener's ears because while it might be mildly worrying, it'll never compare to the overwhelming sense of dread that was present during the nightmare. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dreams are pretty random. There is not a truly agreed upon mode of action where dreams are concerned. Some say they are your subconscious trying to workout issues, some say it is your mind processing, storing information. Some say they mean absolutely nothing. All in all, they tend to be chaotic and nonsensical, at least in how they are actually perceived-i.e. no rhyme, or reason to the images you see</p>
<p>It's a nightmare if you find the content to be unpleasant. I don't have nightmares because I have come to know that it is just a dream. </p>
<p>I call those dystopian, and find they are the most interesting, detailed, and life like. </p>
<p>Tl;dr- there is no universally accepted theory as to why we dream, or to what content will be contained in your dreams</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm annoyed by the speculation, so here's your answer from a psychologist, in eli5:</p>
<p>Scientists are still trying to figure out what a dream is and why we have them. Until we do that, we will have a hard time understanding the difference between a dream and a nightmare. Until we do that, we can't explain why people have nightmares. </p>
