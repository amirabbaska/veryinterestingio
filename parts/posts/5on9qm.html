As sleep approaches and starts melotonin is released to induce sleep and cause drowsiness. As morning approaches levels of serotonin increase. This causes feelings of well being and increases pleasure associated with tactile sensation. (Bed feels better)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you go to bed at night, you've been moving around all day and your muscles are still prepped and active for movement, and weaker as you've been using them all day. As you're laying in bed, unless you're utterly exhausted, you have to find a position where your muscles can relax best. Once you fall asleep, you stop moving completely for a few hours on end which causes your muscles to stiffen. When you wake up in the morning, you generally feel amazing as you've begun moving again and stretching. Stretching makes your muscles relax and stiffness of sleep go away, which is why it feels so awesome to lay in bed after waking up and moving a bit. Your muscles are so relaxed after a morning stretch that any position is comfortable.</p>
<p>This is also why it's so much easier to fall asleep at night if you do proper stretches throughout the day.</p>
<p>It could also be a psychological thing either caused by the warmness of the blanket vs coldness of the morning, or having to do with getting up and going to work</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm a doc and there's no scientifically proven answer to this question.</p>
<p>Edit: Some people seem to take offense to the fact that I stated that I'm a physician as evidence of credibility. No, I'm not going to post my name and medical license to prove it. Yes, it does lend some credibility beyond a random person making up theories, given that I have studied human anatomy and physiology. </p>
<p>As for my statement that there is no scientific evidence to back up anybody else's claim on this thread, go ahead and run a pubmed search and see for yourself. I can't provide you evidence showing that there is no evidence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anyone truly knows.</p>
<p>My guess is that it's because you relax while sleeping and settle into more natural body positions that you can readily fall back into. I also feel like muscles need some time to &quot;wind down&quot; and feel comfortable not moving.</p>
<p>Just a wild stab, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
