<p>So does this mean 14 billion light years away we can look at the big bang itself? Do we somehow see the same singularity everywhere in the edge of the observable universe in any direction?

<p>I'm struggling to see how all of this actually works.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h2>What is the Big Bang?</h2>
<p>The origin of your confusion seems to be the very common misconception that the big bang originated from one point in space. That is not true. </p>
<p>But let's back up a little:The observable universe is the sum of all points in space that are causally connected to earth. That means, it is a sphere around earth encompassing all the space from which photons have had the time to reach earth since the big bang ~13 billion years ago. </p>
<p>This observable universe was indeed compressed into a tiny portion of space shortly after the big bang. However, the observable universe is by far not all there is. Current data shows, that the universe is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe" target="_blank">probably at least 3*10^(23) times bigger</a> than the observable universe. And many cosmologists believe that the universe is infinitely big. </p>
<p>Hence, the big bang did not occur at one point in space, but everywhere at one. Which is why the name big bang is horrible. Henry Reich from MinutePhysics argues that the Big Bang should be renamed into Everywhere Stretch in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3MWRvLndzs" target="_blank">this</a> video. (You should definitely check this video out, it does a good job explaining your very question.)</p>
<p>The Cosmic Background Radiation is the residual radiation from a time shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe cooled down enough to become transparent to photons. And the photons we detect on earth have traveled since that moment and are reaching us just now. </p>
<h2>Can we see Background Radiation from everywhere in the universe, or is earth somehow special?</h2>
<p>One of the most fundamental assumptions of cosmology is that the universe is isotropic and homogeneous - which is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle" target="_blank">cosmological principle</a>. That means by and large the universe looks the same in all directions and at all points. This suggests, that earth is <em>not</em> special in being able to see Cosmic Background Radiation. Indeed, every observer, anywhere in the universe is in the center of their own observable universe and will receive CMB (cosmic microwave background) from the edge of <em>their</em> observable universe. Thus, the question what it looks like to stand at the edge of the observable universe cannot be answered in any meaningful way. An observer is <em>always</em> at the center of their own observable universe, so - by definition - there cannot be an observer at the edge of an observable universe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>So does this mean 14 billion light years away we can look at the big bang itself?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! Although, due to the expansion of spacetime it is actually more like 46.6 billion light years away, and what we can actually see is the time when the universe was full of a hot, glowing plasma. That plasma was opaque (can't see much through glowing clouds) so we can't actually observe even more into the past because light from then ran into the glowing clouds at the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do we somehow see the same singularity everywhere in the edge of the observable universe in any direction? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not quite, but sort of in the sense that everywhere was the singularity at one point. What we see is the period where the universe was close and very hot, but not when it was a singularity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And this is visible anywhere in the universe for the boundary of the snapshot particular to that point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by this, but any other point in the universe would be able to see the same thing as we do relative to their location. Their visible universe would be centered on their location.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The farthest back that we can see is the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. For the first 300,000 years or so, the universe was so hot and dense that light could not travel freely because it existed in a plasma together with electrons, protons and neutrons. When the universe cooled enough, the photons could separate from the plasma, and we see the light from the so called &quot;last scattering surface&quot; as a very uniform emission of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The furthest, oldest light that can be seen by any of our telescopes is the cosmic microwave background.  This is light that was emitted 360,000 years or so after the Big Bang, when the Universe cooled enough to form neutral atoms and photons could move freely without being absorbed by charged particles.  Today, that light has been redshifted to microwave wavelengths by the expansion of the Universe.  </p>
<p>We can see no further back into the past than this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
