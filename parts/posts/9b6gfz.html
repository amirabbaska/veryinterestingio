		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. </p>
<p>Counting the year based on Jesus's birth started in 525 by Dionysius Exiguus, but was not widely used until after 800. Prior to this the Regnal year was used, which was the number of years the current king had been in power.</p>
<p>Using the Hebrew calendar it is currently year 5778, as it apparently that many years since the world was created. This calendar has been in use since the 12th century. </p>
<p>It's year 4716 in the Chinese calendar, which is believed to be in use since the 14th century.</p>
<p>You can find a list of calendars here and when they were introduced: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_calendars#List_of_calendars" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_calendars#List_of_calendars</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Even today Judaism and Islam have their own year numbers: it's currently year 5778 in Judaism and year 1439 in Islam.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>About five thousand years ago, when writing began. It probably began either in Ancient Egypt or Ancient Sumeria, as those were the first two places to develop writing systems, but it is hard to tell which did so first.</p>
<p>However, most early dates were regnal years rather than absolute dates - for instance, the Xth year of some king's rule. Other systems actually named each particular year.</p>
<p>An absolute dating system - where numerical years were used independent of regnal years, but in an absolute counting sense - came along later. The Olympiad calendar used in Ancient Greece may have been the earliest such example - it was used by all the city states to determine when the Olympics were, and its use started in the 8th century BCE.</p>
<p>The Ancient Romans used a calendar that dated from the supposed date of the founding of the city of Rome, while the Mayans and their successor civilizations used a &quot;long count&quot; calendar for absolute dating for astronomical observations and predictions, among other things.</p>
<p>The Romans later used the Julian Calendar, which served as the basis for the Gregorian Calendar, which is used by pretty much everyone nowadays.</p>
<p>The actual numbering system came along later; the Romans used the date from the founding of Rome. The modern BC/AD system started in the 6th century. The date &quot;1&quot; was never used contemporaneously, obviously; the present numbering system dates from centuries after the death of Jesus, and actually gets its starting date wrong by 4-6 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recorded history is young by comparison to the age of our species, beginning only about 5000 to 6000 years ago with the Sumerian civilization. The Georgian calendar, which is the calendar we are most familiar with, actually began in the year Christ was allegedly born, not when he allegedly died. But according to most scholars, Christ was actually born sometime before year 1 on the Georgian calendar, approximately 4 to 6 BCE and died sometime between 28 - 33 CE. So the calendar doesn't really have it right at all.  But it's all symbolic anyhow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
