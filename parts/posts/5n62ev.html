		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I found this website that has a good explaination (<a href="http://www.just-eat.co.uk/blog/why-does-alcohol-make-you-hungry/" target="_blank">http://www.just-eat.co.uk/blog/why-does-alcohol-make-you-hungry/</a>). I'll paste the explanation below to save a click.</p>
<p>Inhibitions</p>
<p>It’s one of the first reasons people drink alcohol – to relax. But that means that you haven’t got the same inhibitions as usual – stress and anxiety is reduced. But that also means you don’t feel anywhere near as guilty for having an extra-large pizza when you could’ve just shared a medium. Think we’ve all been there.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<p>Next, alcohol stimulates the hypothalamus – the bit in your brain that deals with things like body temperature, sleep rhythm, and HUNGER.</p>
<p>When the hypothalamus is triggered, we get hungry when we usually wouldn’t be – in particular, for unhealthy foods…</p>
<p>Blood pressure</p>
<p>Because alcohol is technically a poison, your body starts working to get it out of your system. The effort our body makes to process alcohol reduces its ability to keep your body’s sugar levels balanced. This drop in blood pressure may result in a sudden and strong carb craving – which explains why we not only get hungry when we drink, but why we crave carb-heavy food.</p>
<p>Alcohol contains a lot of calories, but like other liquid calories, it doesn’t fill you up the way food does. This isn’t unreasonable – if you’re relaxed, your healthy eating intentions will go out the window.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38562048" target="_blank">Alcohol flips brain into hungry mode</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It would explain why many people say they eat more when they have had a few drinks. Rather than loss of restraint, it is a neuronal response, the Francis Crick Institute team says.</p>
<p>...The mice were given generous doses of alcohol for three days - a dose being equivalent to around 18 units or a bottle-and-a-half of wine for a person.
The alcohol caused increased activity in neurons called AGRP. These are the neurons that are fired when the body experiences starvation.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shucks I am late to the party...  Ok well one of the biggest things is that alcohol as a fuel source is broken down to produce energy, however parts of your body (specifically the brain) require glucose.  When ethanol is broken down it leads to the changing of an electron carrier (read energy carrier) NAD+ to NADH.  With all the substrate of NAD+ being converted to NADH the accumulation actually acts in a feed back loop stopping gluconeogenesis (the process your body uses to make glucose when you are actively not eating, like when asleep).  So while the explanation about everyone saying the psychological component is technically right, one of the big factors is that your brain is tell your body &quot;hey fucker, I'm starving here&quot; since it prefers to use glucose as a fuel source.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is a calorie? It's a measure of energy in the form of heat and it's determined by burning a measured amount of something, and seeing how much it can raise the temperature of a fixed amount of water. </p>
<p>Not everything that burns is edible and not everything that is edible gets digested or converted into energy. A classic example is insoluble fiber. We lack the stomach to digest it, it has a calorie value, but since we can't make use of it, it doesn't really count. </p>
<p>In the case of alcohol it is broken down by the liver, which takes time, and eventually we get some carbohydrate from it hours later. The fact that alcohols take so long to break down, is useful for delivering carbohydrates in a slow and steady manner to prevent spikes in blood sugar. For instance many diabetic candies use alcohols for sweetener because the body absorbs them so slowly. </p>
<p>It's also important to realize that unless you're drinking a distilled spirit like vodka, you are not drinking pure alcohol (and water in the case of vodka). A beer has calories, but much of that comes from the starches and carbohydrates in the beer that didn't get converted to alcohols. The same for wine and other fermented beverages. So they have calories, but it's not all from alcohol. </p>
<p>In the case of carbohydrates they trigger an insulin reaction, which gives you a quick boost of energy, but then your blood sugar plummets which triggers hunger. It's the same reason drinking a soda might make you hungry. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
