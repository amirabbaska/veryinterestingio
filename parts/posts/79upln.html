		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most self-destructive behaviors evolved, as bmingo stated, as ill-adaptive coping mechanisms; i.e, as something meant to help the user deal with stress or other unpleasant feelings and was only minutely harmful, but shows true destructive consequences due to repetitious behavior. These coping mechanisms may have benefits that outweigh the risks to the user at first- for instance, perceived stress reduction. However, due to the side effects of the behavior (hangovers from drinking, scars from self-harm, weight gain from junk food binges), the user may use the behavior more often to compensate for the added stress of these problems, in addition to their original stress which never went away, but was merely pushed into the background. Most behaviors of this sort rely on some brain region (“pleasure center” or “pain relief center”, etc) to exert an effect on the body at large - ex: ecstasy tabs allow serotonin, a happy chemical, to flood the brain and keep it there for longer. These feelings are felt as good by the user, who knows feeling this way is preferable to feeling bad. The user experiences life events that favor continuing this behavior the cycle perpetuates. </p>
<p>TL;DR: behavior makes you feel good when feeling bad, brain cares less and less about harm done so it can get its next sweet hit of chemicals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it comes down to learned behaviour. Either your parents ingrained it into you during your developing years, or you somehow conditioned the response in yourself through the years. Generally self destruction doesn't just come out of the blue, it's almost always got a sometimes unnoticeable trail to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I honestly feel like this is way beyond an ELI5 situation. As there is a very wide range of disorders and causes. Both from a physiological and psychological standpoint. It can be a genetic problem, developmental problem, brain damage or from abuse. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&lt;== actually a psychologist. There are multiple theories out there that seek to explain it as well as suggest ways to change them, so a single unifying explanation isn’t always available. For example, a therapist trained in Dialectical Behavior Therapy would say it’s a combination of environmental factors (chronically emotionally invalidating environment, experiences of trauma) plus biological predispositions (genetics via history of mental disorders in the family and/or higher emotional reactivity). That’s the biopsychosocial model. Then there may be a therapist trained in interpersonal process theory, who focuses on how early attachment affects your relationships now to influence your behavior as well as maintains certain behaviors. And there are also theories based on Buddhist ideals, which is that the mind is built to be anxious and to create suffering by misinterpreting the world, and being too caught up in those misinterpretations leads to more suffering. For some of those theories, developing mindfulness and compassion is the way to freedom from self destructive behavior. And then of course there are cultural factors that lead to more diversity and differences.</p>
<p>The key is helping a person figure out what best organizes and explains their experience and fits their worldview, because that leads to the best interventions for that particular individual. It’s also why “fit” is so important in therapy - my style may not always fit everyone so there are some people that I might refer to another therapist who connects better with the client’s experience and worldview.</p>
<p>In essence, we’re all different so the answer is different for everyone. Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>my therapist told me a few months back that destructive behaviours are caused due to a person being unable to express their anxiety and/or stress. someone that's undergoing overwhelming amounts of anxiety and stress will find other methods to help them cope with these symptoms, making them act in a self-destructive way. </p>
<p>since this practice helped them release their feelings, the person will repeat the behaviour until it causes a strong negative effect in their life. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
