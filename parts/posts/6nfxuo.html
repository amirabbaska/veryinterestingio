		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't really about &quot;what the animal sounds like&quot;, it's just teaching children how to make different sounds and about our culture. As a quick example, in most English speaking countries, the cat goes &quot;meow&quot;, but in Dutch it's &quot;miauw&quot;, and in Greek it's &quot;miaou&quot;, and in Japanese it's &quot;nyan nyan&quot; or &quot;goro goro&quot; (for purring). </p>
<p>Each word and sound are particular to the culture, and learning these differences is key to forming a relationship with your child and your culture; which is always an important step in childhood development.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that it's easier for kids to make an animal sound than it is to form a lot of words so it helps with language development. Plus kids tend to like animals so that may motivate them. Plus it sounds super cute so parents make the kids practice a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not about learning farm animal sounds per se, it's about basic association.  We're trying to get the neurons in their little growing brains to fire using basic logic and recall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They provide an anthropomorphised context to talk in syllables and phonemes.</p>
<p>To put it simply, they're a way where you can teach children sounds like &quot;moo&quot; and &quot;oink&quot; without being completely abstract.</p>
<p>Farm animals are personified and &quot;safe&quot;, so they are sometimes preferred to (say) a tiger in the very young.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's easier for them to pronounce those sounds and encourages them to use various phonemes. Eg cow says moo, goose says hiss/honk. My son learnt animal sounds before anything and I think it enabled him to learn to speak faster (possibly due to confidence too).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
