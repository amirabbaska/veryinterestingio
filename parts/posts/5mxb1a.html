Much more of an enigma is the Dollar sign to me. Nowhere in the word appears an &quot;S&quot;, and even in the original &quot;Taler&quot; there's no &quot;S&quot;. And again the two lines. Can someone enlighten me?</p></div></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Inspiration for the € symbol itself came from the Greek epsilon (ϵ) – a reference to the cradle of European civilization – and the first letter of the word Europe, crossed by two parallel lines to ‘certify’ the stability of the euro.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best documented explanation holds that the sign evolved out of the Spanish and Spanish American scribal abbreviation &quot;pˢ&quot; for pesos. A study of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century manuscripts shows that the s gradually came to be written over the p, developing into a close equivalent to the &quot;$&quot; mark.[3][4][5][6][7] A variation, though less plausible, of this hypothesis derives the sign from a combination of the Greek character &quot;psi&quot; (ψ) and &quot;S&quot;.[8]</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pound sign, £, is a stylized capital letter &quot;L&quot;. It stands for &quot;Libra&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;pound&quot;, in the sense of weight. The British pound [in sense of currency] used to be defined as a pound [in the sense of weight] of sterling silver. Hence why the British currency is often referred to as Sterling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The dollar sign has been around so long that it's origin is no longer known with any certainty. Two leading derivations are that it is an overlay of P and S, an abbreviation of the Spanish Peso, eventually losing the loop of the P. Another is that it is an overlay of U and S for United States, with the U becoming narrow and eventually losing the loop at the bottom.</p>
<p>The first uses of what is now the 'dollar sign' cleraly referred to the Spanish Peso, lending credence to the first derivation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>On 5 March 2009, the Indian government announced a contest to create a sign for the Indian rupee.During the 2010 Union Budget, then Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said that the proposed sign should reflect and capture the Indian ethos and culture.From around 3,331 responses received, five symbols were shortlisted.These were the entries from Nondita Correa-Mehrotra, Hitesh Padmashali, Shibin KK, Shahrukh J. Irani, and D. Udaya Kumar and one of them was due to be selected at the Union Council of Ministers of India meeting held on 24 June 2010. However, the decision was deferred at the request of the Finance Minister,and the final decision was made when that met again on 15 July 2010,when they chose the symbol created by Udaya Kumar, Associate Professor IIT Guwahati.</p>
