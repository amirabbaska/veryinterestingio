Why does alcohol consumption cause violent behaviour? When wasps eat fermented fruit and become drunk, they will sometimes chase you (as good as their drunken flying allows them) and fight you, for no apparent reason, as will some drunk people try to pick a fight with you merely just for existing. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wasps are just dicks to start with.</p>
<p>In humans, alcohol serves to essentially lower the impulse control people have, so the behavior they might otherwise restrain rises to the surface. So someone who is naturally belligerent will see that amplified. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most animals, humans included, are naturally defensive and violent. It's an evolutionary advantage to fight for your own safety.</p>
<p>Sense and reason prevents them from fighting everything they see. Even at the top of the food chain, they know there's still a risk. A lion knows a gazelle can impale them. A dog knows that kitten can scratch the hell out of it's eyes. They avoid the conflict because the risk of personal injury outweighs the gain.</p>
<p>Add some alcohol into the mix, and natural inhibitions are lowered (less concern for personal safety/consequences) while decision making is impaired (overestimate personal ability, underestimate theirs, disregard risks). Between the two, animals are just plain more likely to respond with violence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m saying there are two different things happening. The aggression is separate to inhibition. That’s why not everyone gets aggressive on alcohol. Alcohol doesn’t cause aggression, that is there in the person existing as insecurity, fear, emotional anguish. People who are feeling bullied or who have been badly bullied may see an action that reminds them of feeling squashed and lash out at the new cause of those same feelings. This is how the violence gets so extreme over a game of pool or whatever, because it’s not the game of pool that the guy is feeding from it’s the giant with the belt that is supposed to be his father and protector and he’s tiny and has no escape and aged six KNOWS that this is it for YEARS to come and now, years, decades after the horror that little kid has a chance to not just say NO but to get revenge and that adult is literally...championing that child inside and BAM! We must start to be honest about these truths in the way we see crime, punishment, prevention and recovery, including forgiveness. These are not excuses they are scientific reasons and if they are fit to be taught to psychology students they are fit to be how we judge. The short word is love.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol lowers your inhibitions.  Meaning people and animals are more likely to do things that they normally would not, such as risk their health to attack something that could hurt them.  You end up doing things like eating food, buying things, hooking up with people you normally would have decided against all thanks to those lowered inhibitions.  Note that alcohol does not cause aggression, it simply lowers inhibitions.  If an aggressive angry person drinks alcohol they may become far more angry and aggressive as reason and logic have taken a back seat to instant gratification.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
