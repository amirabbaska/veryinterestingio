		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually an awesome history of cracking groups. We won't go into it, but one of the most valued positions within a cracker group was often the person who could get access to games. In the early 2000s cracking groups would have people lift games from deliveries to their gamestop store. In fact, if you pirate on console you'll find those games are often out before the game itself. That's usually why. Someone works at gamestop and literally took a disc. </p>
<p>For PC it gets more complicated. Whereas consoles tend to try and lock their console and leave their games unprotected, for PCs its often the other way around. And then you have Steam and online and blah blah. </p>
<p>What PC games, especially on steam will do is either a) not ship the CD physically. The gamestop employee can just get the download code - not useful and very easy to trace that its been stolen. The game itself is often downloadable. or b) when they do have the files on the disc or predownloaded, they often are missing a key to unlock the files. </p>
<p>This means day 0 on PC is pretty rare now. Not unheard of, FFXV was cracked before release because the demo exe had files they used, but for everything else it is often 3 months. So how do they get the games to crack em? Honestly? Probably just buy them and download them from steam. </p>
<p>Then its something called reverse engineering. It used to be simple, there was a part of the exe file for a game that would check the cd was in the drive. All they'd need to do to crack it was remove the cd check. These were called no cd cracks! These are still invaluable for a lot of older games. </p>
<p>Now though, you have something called Denuvo, and rather than simply putting in one line of code that can then get taken out, they add thousands if not millions of lines of code, woven into the code for the game. That makes untying all that and reverse engineering time consuming. Lots of people have hailed it as the end of piracy, and it has slowed it down. But it hasn't stopped. </p>
<p>The problem with denuvo though is that its a lot of security through obfuscation - that is, it works as long as you hide how it works. This is great - until someone finds out how it works. Then literally all of your security becomes instantly useless. This has happened to Denuvo a few times. Each time it happens, its harder the next time to make your stuff secure. Because the crackers are onto you now.</p>
<p>tl;dr - they used to have someone steal them, either from gamestop, or sometimes by someone within the developers. Less possible for this to happen on PC, but on console they still do it this way. Another way is the use of demo exes. Developers release a demo, and that demos exe contains the code that can be used to convince the program its legal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They typically have a source where the DVDs are pressed or where the first copies are couriered.
These people sometimes get paid money for early copies or access to group servers with free software as a reward for their services. </p>
<p>Next the cracker had to figure out what type of copy protection is being used.
If the game asks for a serial number it's fairly simple.
You'll need a so called debugger which is a program that loads the file and executes line by line so that you can find the exact spot where the game asks for the serial. In that location will be a jump point to calculate if the serial you entered is valid.
This part is an equation somewhere in the program like a + b = c just more complex. </p>
<p>Once that equation is found you can make a key generator.
This is a very simplified explanation. </p>
<p>If the program needs a license like a physical file to be present it can be trickier.
You can sometimes make the game think it's there by removing the parts that check for the file.
Other times it's as simple as setting something from &quot;no&quot; to &quot;yes&quot;.
Then there's the situation where entire parts have to patched with additional code. </p>
<p>There is no one size fits all solution, but the main steps remain:</p>
<p>Identify protection
Locate copy protection
Remove/fix protection. </p>
<p>There's debuggers that show the code as the program is executed, which tell you where to go in.
Hex and other editors to modify the file. They use programs to freeze the game/software in order to locate jump points. And other programs to hide the cracking software being used as some games/software checks to see if certain prisms are running and just shuts down if it detects them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Let's say this particular list of instructions tells him how to let you into a theme park. As he goes through the list of instructions he asks you for your ticket, but you don't have one so you can't get in today. After his shift you know where he keeps his instruction list, but it's in German! And you don't speak German. But you take a copy anyway. Tomorrow you try to get in, and you follow the man along as he's reading the instructions, and when he gets to instruction 52, he asks you for a ticket, and then turns you away for not having one. After his shift, you go to where he keeps his instructions and cross out line 52. The next day you get into the theme park because he didn't check for your ticket.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Indeed they don't have access to the source files. They have to work with the released binary EXE file as it is. To help crack they typically use a debugger application to step through the raw CPU instructions while the program is running, then editing the file once they find the exact location of DRM check.</p>
<p>It could end up as simple as changing just a few bytes which correspond to a single jump instruction. Of course, things can get a lot more complicated with different types of DRM.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You get the program walking (like running, but slower, step by step) until you see it check if it's original. You follow him through all those steps until the check steps are over. You then make a bridge from right before the check to right after the check. The program can now run straight and never hit the check.  </p>
<p>Sometimes programs are designed to mislead you, walk in circles, do many checks in different parts, etc. That is what makes it difficult and challenging.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>Just to give a quick and simple perspective of how slow the program walk: If you have a somewhat common processor (running at let's say 2.5 GHz) that means that when running, a program is taking approx. 2,500,000,000 steps a second.</p>
