		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my university at least, the material is widely complemented with the professor's personal experience in the field. A school like Harvard probably attracts professors with more renown across their field for the things they've done than a local college with professors who might not have experienced as much as the Harvard guy. This doesn't mean that any one school is automatically better than all others, but no school is exactly the same because of this. </p>
<p>You might take a class at one University and the professor has absolutely no idea what they're talking about and just reading off slides that aren't even theirs. You can take the same class at another school, with the same curriculum, but with a professor that shares more insight into how things actually work in the real world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MIT and University of Phoenix students may have access to 99% of the same information, but they are going to be asked to apply it in very different ways. Simply put, MIT students are going to be challenged in a way that University of Phoenix students are not. For that reason the degree confers more value-- it's a signal to employers that the individual could cut their teeth in a demanding, competitive environment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the Quality of professors and human cognitive bias. Harvard is good because someone said it was. Talented professors fight to get tenure there because it's prestigious, giving the faculty more choice to get the best. having the best teachers draw in students. more students wanting to get in give the university the choice to only take the best. the best graduates  and perpetuate the reputation of the university, keeping Harvard a prestigious university.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Networking - I went to top-10 grad school, a lot of people already knew each other or had friends/colleagues in common.  This helps a lot when you're looking for a job.</p>
<p>Brand recognition - I just hired 2 people, first I look at their experience, skills and job history, then education.  For the entry-level position, I checked what school they went to and any volunteering or other stuff to set them apart.  Alma mater means less, the longer you've been in the workforce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
