		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's not how sovereign debt works.</p>
<p>Sovereign debt exists as bonds. A country offers bonds on the market, and other countries buy them as investments. A bond is basically a contract between the bond issuer (usually a government) and the bond holder (whoever buys it) that says &quot;The issuer agrees to pay the holder the value of this bond plus X% interest on [DATE].&quot; US Treasury Bonds are seen as a <strong>very</strong> safe investment because the US <strong>always</strong> pays when and what it says it will pay. This means that the US can offer incredibly low interest rates on its bonds.</p>
<p>A US T-bond is safer than a bank account, safer than gold, hell it's safer than burying your money in the yard. If you have a whole bunch of money and you want to keep it safe for a decade or so, you can't do better than buying US bonds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are really several factors at work which allow for the situation to exist. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>China is a major manufacturing hub, meaning their exports generally far outweigh their imports (positive trade balance). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The US and EU while have more imports coming in then exports going out to china (trade deficit). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When US companies by goods from Chinese companies they use US dollars. This means that there are a lot of US dollars in China which a rent particularly useful to Chinese companies. This is because Chinese companies import goods from Australia and other mineral rich countries and therefore don't use US dollars for these transactions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lower the value of your currency the easier it is to export (you can be more globally competitive). Corollary to that, a higher currency value makes importing easier but exporting harder. As such the Chinese government wants China's currency to remain low in value. However the demand for their currency and hence ist value has been increasing over time as more people seek to do business with them. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to solve both these problems the Chinese government prints money (similar to the US Quantitative Easing). Printing money increases the amount (supply) of money hence decreasing its value (inflation) allowing china to export more competitively. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Chinese government then uses all the money they have printed to buy US dollars back from the Chinese companies. This decreases supply of US dollars globally raising the value of US dollars. This means the US can afford to buy more stuff from China. </p>
</li>
<li>At this point the Chinese government is stuck with billions if not trillions of US dollars. With such large quantities of money, it becomes very difficult to invest in the ways individuals or even companies do. Instead the government looks for a place they can dump their money. Normally this is done by buying US treasury bonds (US debt). While treasury bonds pay out very low interest (far lower than the rate of inflation) meaning china actually loses money, they an considered and incredibly safe investment which is what the Chinese government really cares about. </li>
</ol>
<p>TLDR: Trade between two countries will naturally tend towards an equilibrium by adjusting the value of the two counties currencies. China actively intervene a in this system to keep the able UFO their currency low and yeh value of the US dollar high allowing them to sell more stuff to the US and Europe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the US has a big trade deficit with China, there's a lot more US dollars flowing into China than out. China's central bank buys the excess USD. If they didn't, the value of the dollar relative to the Yuan would drop due to the excess supply making Chinese exports relatively more expensive to the US, while simultaneously making American products cheaper in China. </p>
<p>They want to do something with all those extra dollars, but not put them at significant risk, so they buy US treasury securities, which are sold and traded in USD. </p>
<p>It's not as if China has a big budget surplus every year and is investing the money. China actually has its own debt equivalent to about US$4 trillion, and much more when you consider the corporate debt of state-owned companies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see others answering the direct question, but the title here seems to misunderstand both how national debts and &quot;loans&quot; work. Yes, most countries have a lot of debt. But they also have massive assets, which is why they take on the debt in the first place. </p>
<p>The U.S. and U.K. aren't <em>individuals</em> who have debt like a person does to somebody outside, and China isn't like a bank loaning them money. Most of the U.S. <em>government</em> debt is owned by Americans. </p>
<p>Think of it this way. When you, as an individual, want to increase your earning potential you borrow money to get a better education or training, sometimes taking on massive debt to do so. Why would you do that? Well, because the earning potential out the other side is worth far more than the debt. Your monthly income increase is <em>greater</em> than the monthly cost of the student loan, so it's a net value for you to do so. There is simply a delay between the time you take on the debt and the time you see the increased value. Your breakeven will be years after you graduate, but over the long term it is a good investment for you to make.</p>
<p>Now suppose you live in a house where every year another person starts school in the same way. Every year the <em>household</em> takes on more debt to fund the education of the next person going to school, but the household <em>income</em> continually increases faster than the cost of the debt by the people who have already graduated.</p>
<p>That household debt and income are analogous to the government debt and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). As long as the GDP grows faster than the cost of the debt, it is a net value to go deeper into debt because it also makes you go &quot;deeper&quot; into a net prosperity. Or, mostly simply, if you could borrow money at 1% interest for an investment that pays off 10% interest, you are best to borrow as much money as you can and only ever pay the minimal interest.</p>
<p>The question then is who does the government borrow money from? Well, that's more complicated, but the part that involves China is perhaps best explained by describing bonds.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the household. Instead of going to a bank, imagine that the manager of the household instead puts out an add on Craigslist telling everybody what it's doing as far as educating the household. It might say, &quot;We are investing in our household members' education and they are increasing their incomes on average by 10%. To fund next year's cohort, we'd like to offer everybody a piece of that 10%. If you loan us your money, we'll pay you pay everything you've lent us at 1%. That might seem low, but we have so much income now and are so stable for so long that there is almost zero chance that we'll default on paying you back.&quot;</p>
<p>Somebody reading Craigslist might look at their investment options and see this as a really safe investment. It's low paying, but it's pretty much guaranteed, unlike the stock market which goes up and down a lot.</p>
<p>Many of those people reading Craigslist might actually live in that household, and invest their own money in the household education fund. Some investors won't live in the household. Some of them might even live in China.</p>
<p>That's essentially what the government does; it creates bonds that essentially anybody can buy. Buying a bond is, essentially, loaning the government money. When we talk about government debt, that largely includes debt to ordinary people who bought government bonds. Most of those people live in the U.S. Many of them aren't individuals but are investment organizations like pensions. Some of those are individuals and organizations in other countries, including China. Some of the other buyers are other governments, including departments of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>That's why debt isn't inherently bad (if wisely spent on things that grow the economy), and why most of it is owed to Americans and people and organizations throughout the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's because the money itself is loaned into existence. It's mathematically impossible to pay off the US national debt, there aren't enough dollars in the entire world. I encourage you to look up how the federal reserve creates money on YouTube, it's quite jarring. </p>
<p>Why is this post controversial? It's factual and answers the guys question in a good &quot;5 year old&quot; answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
