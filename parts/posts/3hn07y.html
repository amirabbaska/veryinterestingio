		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with fixation points. When you're following a moving object, your eyes are following one fixation point. When you're just trying to do this without an object to focus on, your eyes are really just jumping from one fixation point to another.</p>
<p>Compare these wikis on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_pursuit" target="_blank">smooth pursuit eye movements</a> and its converse, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade" target="_blank">saccadic eye movements</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: &quot;focal point&quot; -&gt; &quot;fixation point&quot;
<em>probably</em> more accurate. as stated below, I am no expert.</p>
<p>Edit2: For everyone either saying I'm not answering the question or &quot;but that doesn't explain why&quot; or some variation of that sentiment - the <em>why</em> is that <em>that just isn't how your eye works.</em> I can hypothesize a few benefits this might have afforded us from an evolutionary perspective, or at least, it didn't cause enough problems to be evolved out. Ultimately I think knowing the mechanism is a satisfactory explanation. It'd be like asking &quot;why can't I jump 30 feet&quot; and me saying &quot;humans can only jump about this high and also gravity&quot; and you lot being like &quot;<em>but that doesn't really answer the question does it</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Edit3: I answered this when this thread had quite literally 0 comments, my answer was quick and dirty with some thrown in relevant wiki links. Keep scrolling for much better insights!!

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our eyes work really hard to try to focus on an object. So when we tell our minds to focus on something in particular, it just tries to jump to the conclusion and focuses on the area of interest based on previous perception (you map out everything in your brain even when you are not fully focused on it, hence why you can immediately locate a flashing light from the corner of your eyes). This jump is known as a catch up saccade where the muscles abruptly move the eye to focus on where you tell it to. This also extracts a lot more data (this is actually how you are reading this, by saccading from word to word) as opposed to pursuing an object. Think of this as part of the &quot;What&quot; system.
Smooth pursuit on the other hand is a completely different system that requires a ~200 ms delay for your brain to calculate the exact velocity of a target and move your eyes accordingly. When this is done, it is often interrupted by &quot;catch-up saccades&quot; every 500 ms or so since we are not perfect. This is the &quot;Where&quot; system.</p>
<p>In short, you use your saccadic system much more to extract the most information about your environment by jumping around points of interest. When you trace something, you aren't able to extract as much data about what it is  and in fact are just more concerned with where it is going. This is why your brain only uses the smooth pursuit to trace object to see where they are going (and make sure it isn't something dangerous coming straight at you). So if there is no target to trace, there is no reason to smooth pursue anything. </p>
<p>Hopefully this makes sense!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our eyes' movements fall into two classes: slow and fast eye movements. This is somewhat deceptive, because the slow movements sometimes aren't all that slow. What matters is that there are two <em>control systems</em>: the slow movement control system, and the fast movement control system. They take control of the eye muscles alternatively and exclusively. So your eyes can be either moved by the <em>slow system</em>, or the <em>fast system</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>fast system</em> generates <em>only</em> the movements called saccades. They are the &quot;jiggerylike&quot;, as you call them, movements whose sole purpose is to redirect the gaze. The saccadic eye movements aren't actually all that jiggery. Their velocity-over-time is a rather smooth curve that can be well approximated (&lt;2% error) by a 3rd order polynomial.</p>
<p>The &quot;jiggeriness&quot; is the most efficient way of redirecting your gaze. When you wish to look somewhere, your goal is to see it ASAP. You <em>do</em> want your eye to move there as quickly as possible, and that's done by accelerating and decelerating it as fast as your muscles can. Using some smooth motion would be a horribly slow way of shifting our gaze, but that's not the only reason.</p>
<p>This is the basic explanation, but there's a whole lot of underlying &quot;you didn't know that for sure&quot; that I should include, too. The saccades are really special, it turns out, and the fast control system that generates them is critical to our visual perception.</p>
<p>Our visual system consists really of <em>two</em> visual systems: the peripheral vision, that works continuously, and the central vision, that works in a snapshot-taking fashion. The central vision - the one that has high resolution and is the only one in demand by our conscious mind - can take at most about ten (10) snapshots per second, and most of the time it works at a much more leisurely pace of about 3-6 pics per second.</p>
<p>The central vision has two other important qualities that, taken together with its sampling (snapshot) property, make the behavior you describe emerge:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is the only visual system subject to our conscious control. When we wish to look somewhere, the central visual system fulfills the request by redirecting the gaze so that the central vision ends up looking where you wish to look.</p>
</li>
<li>The central vision is blind most of the time. Specifically, it's like a camera that can't take snapshots until a saccade starts, and then can only take a snapshot when the image stops slipping on the retina (usually it happens when a saccade ends, but that's just a lucky coincidence).</li>
</ol>
<p>So, &quot;smooth&quot; motion, called slow eye movements, wouldn't work because as long as the image is slipping on the retina, the central vision can't acquire a high resolution picture. The peripheral vision isn't good enough for even simple things like reading. So you must definitely stop the eye's motion relative to the motion of whatever you try to look at - so that the image becomes stable on the retina and a snapshot can be taken.</p>
<p>If you think that the snapshot behavior is a bunch of gobbledygook, there's a wonderful experiment that will convince you otherwise. Get moving in a car/bus/train such that you look down out the side window, in a direction perpendicular to the motion of the vehicle. Try to sort of stare down so that all you see is the blur of the side of the road/rail track. The image is slipping on your retina and there isn't much to see - just a blur. Now start and keep looking ahead and behind along the side of road/track - remember that you are to look close to the road/track ahead/behind you, not away. Suddenly you will notice that you start seeing perfectly clear images of the side of the track/road, as if they were frozen in time, in spite of you still moving along, clearly too fast to see the details. That happens because, as you redirect your gaze ahead and behind, at some point in time the absolute angular velocity of your eye matches the angular velocity of the road/track side as whizzes by on the retina, and the stable image is instantly acquired and ends the saccadic blanking.</p>
<p>For this to work, you need to be traveling too fast for the slow pursuit eye movement to catch up. The pursuit eye movements are the ones that let you read from a book someone is slowly waving in front of you. If you wave it, you're cheating - your slow eye movement system can generate a motion following your own arms because the information about your arm's motion already exists in your body and can be used for such purpose. You can follow your own waving hand even with your eyes closed :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
