		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Graphics aren't everything in an engine. Keep this in mind, as it'll be important throughout the explanation. </p>
<p>First off there's the licensing and cost of running an engine that isn't yours. In the contracts, some companies can charge a % of what you make past x amount. You can imagine the publishers, shareholders, and other such people won't be too keen on losing money the put in. </p>
<p>The next bit is the physics requirements. Each game has different physics. Granted the projectile motion might WORK the same, but you might not get the same distances and etc.</p>
<p>Another issue is how game mechanics can tie in with the engine. UE might not support levelution on the scale that Frostbite can in Battlefield. UE might have issues working Halo's balance of movement, vehicles, and gunplay. There's also necessity. The engine may have stuff you don't need, which has to be cut out or else it just adds to the end file size.</p>
<p>Now we reach the grapics argument. In a sense, why do you WANT realistic graphics in every game? Look at Team Fortress 2 and Overwatch. Both have this cartoon feel to them. Borderlands focuses on their cell shaded approach to their style. Telltale games also do this too. Minecraft is self-explanatory as to why it's not necessary. Graphics and realism is nice, but the art style is where it's at. I can go and make a copy of real life, but where's the enjoyment to it? Where's the flair that separates it from all the other realistic copies? Now that real life copy I made won't sell as it's basically the same as everything else. Now if I accent something, distort the realism to something aesthetic, and capitalize on it, I can sell my copy. It's no longer copy of real life, but rather a copy of life that I see and enjoy.</p>
<p>Another argument is developer preference. It's similar to cost, but this time focusing in on the actual makers, not the investors. You may have guys that are killers with one language, but less so with another. UE4 can force this to happen, instead of just making an engine with what you need. </p>
<p>The last thing is what others are doing. If you just fall in with all the others, you can't set yourself apart. Setting yourself away from others and innovating with your own engine can boost marketing potential. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unreal_Engine_games" target="_blank">Here's</a> a list of all UE made games. You can see a lot of devs have been using it. You can also see that a lot of popular games don't use it at the same time. DICE has Frostbie, Crytek has Cryengine, 343 has...whatever they call theirs, Bungie has... also whatever they call theirs, Valve has Source, Alien: Isolation was made with a separate engine, Planetside 2 uses Forgelight, CoD games run on the IW Engine, Rainbow Six: Siege runs on the Anvil engine, and there are many other games running other engines.</p>
<p>The reason we hear about UE and its use is that it's publicly marketed to indie developers. You won't get a copy of Forgelight, IW, or Frostbite all that easily like you can with UE or Unity. </p>
<p>Now why did I say to remember that graphics aren't everything? Just look at this mini-essay. The best way to do this is to basically say &quot;Do I REALLY need a superpowered Formula1 engine in my Jeep? It's a great engine, but does it do what I need it to do effectively? Does it fit into my Jeep right? Can it help me with what I do with the Jeep, or is it just for the cool factor? Is this a smart, economically wise, thought out idea?&quot;</p>
<p>TL;DR (Lazy copy/paste of quote above this, but this'll make it easier for y'all)</p>
<p>&quot;Do I REALLY need a superpowered Formula1 engine in my Jeep? It's a great engine, but does it do what I need it to do effectively? Does it fit into my Jeep right? Can it help me with what I do with the Jeep, or is it just for the cool factor? Is this a smart, economically wise, thought out idea?&quot;</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for my first ever gold! I totally will use it for... Idek wtf to use it for. I feel blessed, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a game dev, and though I am not an engineer, I'd generally answer something like this...</p>
<p>A game engine is a lot more than just a way to put graphics on the screen. It is a development environment for artists, level designers, animators, programmers, etc. It also manages all the data structures, netcode, etc. of the game and defines their most basic capabilities and functionality. Unreal is great at a lot of things (it has extremely good art and level design tools), but it has some quirks and weaknesses too that don't necessarily mean everything is a win (you wouldn't say, want to make an MMO with it).</p>
<p>Even if we're talking about sheer graphical capabilities alone, Unreal is starting to get beat out on that front by other engines in the last few years. The new Tomb Raider, Metal Gear Solid, Doom, Dishonored, etc. all look just as good if not better than anything you could do in Unreal, and in large part because the engine developers are working directly in tandem with the game developers rather than doing everything &quot;off the shelf&quot;.</p>
<p>There's quite a few other good reasons Unreal has been feeling the squeeze in recent years, too.</p>
<p>For one, the third party publisher-developer behemoths like EA, Activision, Square Enix, etc., the ones who used to keep Unreal afloat, have started pouring massive resources (hundreds of millions of dollars of development) into their own engine tech. About 5-7 years ago they began to realize it was better to do their own tech and have consistent communications, development and engine support structure across all their games and studios, than to depend on a separate company who would <em>maybe</em> get something they really need in for the next release in 6 months. Unreal is great, but if the engine doesn't do what you need it to, or has a critical bug, it can often cause massive stalls and headaches in development.</p>
<p>Then, the competition available from other third parties has got way better too. Unity, especially, has become extremely popular in recent years. That is not a surprise. It might not have the sheer graphical grunt out of the box as other engines. However, it has a well-designed development environment, its generally rapid release rollout often means faster engine bug fixes, the asset store means you don't have to necessarily hire artists and programmers to make everything in your game (VFX is one place this is extremely useful), and of course, there is a massive developer community to turn to for support, and as it's being taught a lot in schools, there are <em>tons</em> of people familiar with Unity out there to help make your game.</p>
<p>What else explains Unreal's decline and Unity's rise? A big part of it is simply that it's cheap, which helps a <em>lot</em> more than most gamers realize, as often game development is, for most studios, more about budget (time/money) limitations than it is technological ones. Unreal also gained a lot of traction because it was one of the first big engines to make its dev tools available to modders - many got their starts doing maps for Unreal and Unreal Tournament, which informed the tastes and needs of an entire generation of game companies. But, that modding culture has since dried up (or at least moved on), so there's less familiarity with and desire to use Unreal among developers. Last, Unity is also very versatile - everything from first-person games, to simulators, to racing games, to RPGs can run on Unity. It doesn't really excel at one particular genre, which on paper sounds bad, but in actuality means a dev team can hop from game to game much more easily.</p>
<p>On the lower end, Game Maker is actually pretty capable, though I don't have a lot of experience with it. But, if you are an indie dev looking to make a 2D game, it's one of the more appealing options out there, and the games likewise will run on tons of target platforms with few if no modifications. There's just no reason for someone like this to even consider Unreal, yet games like Shovel Knight and Hyper Light Drifter have done <em>very</em> well lately. It turns out that 2D games are still awesome, and you don't need to have cutting-edge tech to be successful.</p>
<p>There's two final things I would keep in mind that inform all this:</p>
<p>1) The goal of most game developers is primarily and above all else <em>to ship a product</em>. Anything not in service of that is very liable to get their business killed. Relentless pursuit of tech that is not in service of that goal is wasted time and money. And...</p>
<p>2) Game development is extremely hard, and takes a long time. You are working for years on projects which you <em>hope</em> on paper are going to be good, yet for about 85% or more of a game's life, it's actually a smoldering wreck. There are a <em>million</em> more variables in creating a game - questions like &quot;does the build even start?&quot; or &quot;did the Perforce server go down for the third time this week?&quot; or &quot;shit, we failed cert because someone forgot to test what happens if we leave the Xbox running for 12 hours straight on the main menu, and we have 6 weeks until our ship date, and Microsoft has no remaining cert slots for the next 4 weeks, we're so fucked&quot;, are usually far more important concerns than &quot;does it do graphics good?&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cost is a big issue. The engine is free to start using, but you have to pay royalties if you make over a certain amount of money. So for big companies that expect to sell a lot of copies, the price may not be worth it. Admittedly big companies might be able to get a better deal, but they might still find other options make more sense financially.</p>
<p>Being dependent on another company's technology also has some risks. What if Epic go out of business? Or they get bought out and stop selling their engine? Or they change the licensing deals? If those things happen you might find your company left without a tech base to make games with. So some companies prefer to invest in making their own engines so they don't have to worry about what might happen to that other company. Also that means their own staff have in depth knowledge of it instead of needing support from a different company. This also has the advantage that you can build the engine to your own specifications, you have complete freedom to optimise it for the games you want to make.</p>
<p>Unreal isn't perfect either. Its very good, but maybe its just not a good fit for what you want to do. Maybe its easier to make your game in Unity or some other engine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many ways to approach your question.</p>
<p>The pedantic answer is that engines can't really &quot;look realistic&quot;, since a game engine doesn't look like anything. They offer features and tools for artists and programmers to realize their vision, but they don't look like anything without the assets the artists create for the game. While games created with the same engine can share some similarities (due to built in assets and effects), most engines are flexible enough to support any kind of art style, realistic or non-realistic. For instance, Dota 2 and Titanfall 2 run on the same engine (Source Engine ^(though heavily modified in both cases)), as do Hearthstone and Cities: Skylines (Unity Engine).</p>
<p>While a good game engine helps with creating believable and realistic-looking environments, it's not the most important factor. The assets (models, textures, animations) are arguably far more important. Creating high quality assets is very time consuming and therefore very expensive. Even though a single developer or a very small team can create a game using Unreal Engine 4 or CryEngine, the game will not look nearly as good (meaning realistic in this context) as one created by an AAA-developer, since they lack the manpower required to create enough high quality assets. The game engine is not the bottleneck, the budget is.</p>
<p>As far as I know for big budget AAA-games Unreal Engine is <em>the</em> most used game engine of all time, and has been extremely popular for the past 15 years. There's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unreal_Engine_games" target="_blank">an incomplete list of games built with UE in Wikipedia</a>, and it's absolutely massive. However, the most popular version of the engine is the 3rd version, which is still used for some recently released and upcoming games. While the 3rd version was very advanced at the time, it's over a decade old at this point. The engine's 4th major version was released in 2014, offering a huge leap in graphical fidelity due to several new advanced features. Quite a lot of games have been released on it already, and more are coming in the near future. Games can take a lot of time to develop; a game started in 2014 might take 4 or 5 years to finish it.</p>
<p>Even though it's pretty popular, why isn't it even more popular? Many AAA publishers have their own internal game engines, which they use for multiple different franchises. For instance, EA uses DICE's Frostbite engine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frostbite_games" target="_blank">for most of their high-profile titles</a>. Additionally, some games wouldn't necessarily work that well on UE4 in terms of technology and design, at least without changing their scope or making large modifications to the engine. </p>
<p>For indie developers, Unity has a larger market share. While UE4 has no upfront licensing costs at the moment, it used to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars just a few years ago. Unity on the other hand has been available for free since 2009. It offers less control for developers compared to UE4, but it's arguably easier to use and has a larger community. Unity also has lower system requirements, which makes it a better platform for mobile games. It's arguably less powerful in terms of sheer performance and graphical features out of the box, but since indies lack the budget to create photorealistic assets anyway, it's not a huge issue. For indies, speed of development, the community and portability are far more important than the maximum attainable graphical quality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For indie dev: Game development is really, really hard already. If you don't need hyperrealistic graphics, why bother spending the extra hundreds of hours making detailed models, rigging them, creating animations, fine-tuning light sources, adjusting shader settings...?</p>
<p>For established studios: Oftentimes, a studio will already have an engine they like to use, which they may have written themselves or bought from someplace else. Why bother learning a new engine and editor when you've already got experience with one that'll do the job fine?</p>
<p>In general: It doesn't really make sense to say that the Unreal Engine, or any particular engine, is &quot;one of the most realistic and better looking&quot;. That judgment is entirely subjective, not to mention massively in the developers' hands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
