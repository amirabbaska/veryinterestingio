		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone else has gotten it wrong. </p>
<p>First you have to understand blocked noses. A nose gets blocked, or congested, when the inside of your nose gets swollen. The more swollen the more blocked your nose. Sometimes this may feel like a big &quot;snot plug&quot;. If it were a snot plug then you should be able to blow really hard and clear it, but you never can. </p>
<p>Smelling those things will irritate thin side of your nostril and cause blood vessels to squeeze and tighten up. This causes the swelling to go down and opening up your nasal passages. </p>
<p>It's similar to having a big swollen bruise and putting an ice back on it to bring down the swelling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The things that do that are irritants.  Basically, when your body comes in contact with them, it reacts- in the case of eyes and nose, your body tries to flush irritants by producing tears/mucous.</p>
<p>Your sinuses are blocked because mucous in them is thickened and staying in place instead of flowing- the natural flushing from the irritants mixes fresh moisture in to the existing blocking mucous, which allows it to flow properly and clear out of your sinuses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So most, if not all, of the wasabi you have eaten isn't really wasabi but is a mixture of horseradish and ingredients. Horseradish contains a compound called allyl isothiocyanate which has antibacterial properties and is a lachrymator. From wikipedia: &quot;Lachrymators are thought to act by attacking sulfhydryl functional groups in enzymes. One of the most probable protein targets is the TRPA1 ion channel that is expressed in sensory nerves (trigeminal nerve) of the eyes, nose, mouth and lungs.&quot; From what I have found high concentrations of this stuff are basically tear gas.</p>
<p>No sources on this part, but if I had to guess when you chew or agitate the horseradish it gives off the allyl isothiocyanate inside your mouth as a gas. Which can then travel into your sinuses and stimulate your TRPA1 ion channels. Because it isn't as highly concentrated we feel this as cold, or a tingling sensation.</p>
<p>I couldn't find if there is any actual sinus inflammation reliefe but it does appear that horseradish root is being used in some sinus relief medicine that has been shown to work as well as other prescription strength medications.</p>
<p>EDIT: My bad guys! I was browsing /all and I really thought this was askscience! Thanks for the generous upvotes anyway :P
Sorry if this wasn't a great answer. I'm no expert but the question interested me so I did a bit of searching!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>don't forget about tear gas too. in basic training, we went through the &quot;gas chamber&quot; which was a room filled with tear gas. the drill sergeants made us sing the army song even though no one knew it. went out with snot and spit running down my nose thinking i was going to suffocate to death. but it cleared up my sinuses when i was able to catch my breath again</p>
<p>edited* i meant cs gas. i thought they were the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Most wasabi is food colored horse radish. Real wasabi is too expensive to just hand out for free to every table at a high volume sushi restaurant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
