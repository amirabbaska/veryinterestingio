I’ve seen when it is extremely cold my phone appears “laggy” is this do to the cold on its processor? And also can extreme temperatures affect power lines and things of that sort? </p>
<p>Edit: Thank you guys for all of the answers! Had no idea how much played into all of this.. woah. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The previous commenters have done a nice job of explaining why your phone is laggy, but I wanted to really address the question of whether temperature can slow down electricity. </p>
<p>The short answer is yes, and electricity will generally be &quot;faster&quot; at lower temperatures.</p>
<p>To understand this, think about DC electricity like bumper cars. You're an electron, in a bumper car, trying to move from point A to point B. But there are other bumper cars, representing the atoms of the material you're traveling in (like copper) not traveling from A to B, but instead staying in one area, moving back and forth. The temperature of a material essentially represents how fast these other cars are moving. You are experiencing a constant acceleration in one direction (coming from the voltage), but you might bounce around off of these cars.</p>
<p>If you are trying to get to point B as fast as possible, you want to bump as few cars as possible. This will be easiest when the cars are moving slowly, so you are less likely to hit them. If you don't hit any cars, that's fastest you can go under that voltage. This is called &quot;ballistic transport&quot; because you are moving like a projectile instead of bouncing around. Thus, at lower temperatures, you get closer to ballistic transport. Additionally, as you increase the voltage, the electrons will travel faster, until you reach the saturation velocity for the material. You can think of speed in terms of the resistance of the material when considering only one electron.</p>
<p>Now, if you get hot enough to form a plasma, the rules change, but that's neither here nor there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most everyone here has taken the notion of &quot;speed&quot; to be the resistivity of a medium, which is a fair interpretation. To change things up a bit, I'll take the notion of speed to mean the physical velocity that electrical signals move down a wire.</p>
<p>The speed of propagation of a electromagnetic wave (which electrical signals are) in a medium is given by the formula 1 / sqrt (mu * epsilon), where mu is the magnetic permeability and epsilon is the electric permittivity. Each of those constants have nonzero values in a vacuum, and if you plug in the values of those constants in a vacuum you'll get the speed of light (it's actually super easy and incredibly insightful to do so)!</p>
<p>Since we have nonzero vacuum values of those constants, we will usually define the permeability and permittivity of a medium relatively, e.g. as a fraction of the vacuum value of its respective constant. For copper, the relative permeability is 1. The relative permittivity of the copper itself is actually mostly irrelevant for the calculation, and instead we must consider the permittivity of the surrounding medium, which is the plastic sheathing. That's about 2.5 on average, which means our average relative speed of propagation is 2/3c (in other words, when you flip on a light switch, the lightbulb will begin to turn on after the amount of time it would take for that wave, traveling two thirds the speed of light, to travel along the wire from the switch to the bulb).</p>
<p>With that out of the way, we can answer your question. Relative permeability of copper is probably not going to vary significantly with temperature. There are materials that exhibit extreme changes to their permeability at super low temperatures (look into superconductors), but those are an edge case. Relative permittivity can actually vary quite a bit with temperature,  but only in materials with permanent dipoles, of which rubber is not. </p>
<p>So, we can say that changing temperature will probably not significantly affect the speed of propagation of an electrical signal. If your signal is propagating in an unusual material, it might, but for electricity moving through a wire, 2/3c is generally a safe bet.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your phone literally ‘appears’ laggy- that is, the display is slow to update or change colors- that would be due to the nature of liquid crystal displays, where crystals suspended in fluid have to physically change orientation to create a change in the color you see. These displays can appear slow to work in extreme cold. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not quite sure about the actual &quot;speed&quot; of the electrons, if that is what is meant by &quot;speed of electricity&quot;, but from a materials perspective, the resistivity (the quantity &quot;slowing down&quot; the electricity) of a conductor is temperature dependent. Generally, for metals, resistivity increases with increasing temperature. Thus, increasing temperature will make it harder for electricity to flow and vice versa, so you would get a lower current for the same applied voltage. However, this also means that when your phone is &quot;laggy&quot; in the cold, the electrical resistance should be decreased and thus have the possibility of a higher electrical flow, so it is unlikely that the cold slowing down the electricity is the cause of the laggy speeds. It is worth noting that general ambient temperature range where you would be using an electronic device is relatively small and probably only going to have a very small effect on the resistivity of the conductors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The cold slows the reaction speed of the battery and you lose power for processing. That's why some people take the battery out of their car overnight when gets too cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
