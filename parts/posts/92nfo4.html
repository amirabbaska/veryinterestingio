		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We've developed greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms for why many of these cancers happen, who is at risk, who should be screened or work up, how to treat them, how to manage side effects of treatment.  A new field is how to manage the long term effects of childhood cancer and treatments, since these kids are surviving into adulthood for the first time.</p>
<p>We've made huge advancements in survival for childhood cancers.  <strong>Take a fucking look at THIS shit:</strong></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have better understanding of how genetic and environmental factors cause cancers e.g. the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes for breast cancer which allows for genetic screening.</p>
<p>We have better understanding of how different cancers spread and how the immune system responds (or doesn't).</p>
<p>We have better understanding of the efficacy of different drugs for targeting different cancers which allows for the development of better drugs. e.g.  Dicycloplatin for prostate cancer and non-small-cell lung carcinoma. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After my second cancer treatment, first one in 1998, second one in 2018, i can definitely say, that the treatments are shorter, have lesser side effects and a higher 5 year probability of survival.</p>
<p>You can't see the progress, you can only believe in the words of the long term survivors and statistics the doctors got.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
