		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am blind and on my second Seeing Eye dog. My current partner, a lovely 23-month-old German shepherd, doesn't know where to go, but she does know how to follow my commands. It's my responsibility in the parntership to translate all routes into a series of commands the dog understands -- right, left, forward. My partner follows these commands to the extent that doing so will not place me in danger. She may deviate from them to go around mobile or stationery obstacles, or refuse to obey them if the route becomes dangerous (car cuts me off in a crosswalk, I get disoriented and tell her to walk off the train platform). We have overlapping responsibilities to know where we're going and get there safely. I memorise the routes, or carry a GPS set to &quot;walking&quot; navigation mode. She knows the commands, recognises obstacles and threats, and points out familiar landmarks such as businesses we've entered before, an office or bathroom along the hallway that we've entered before, et cetera.</p>
<p>Any more questions I can answer for you about living on the dark side?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my limited experience of knowing people with guide dogs, both the dog and the owner needs to be taught and practice the routes they use. They <a href="https://www.guidedogs.org.uk/microsites/guide-dogs-in-school/puppy-resources/how-can-a-guide-dog-change-a-life/how-are-guide-dogs-trained/" target="_blank">train together for 4 weeks</a>.</p>
<p>If they want to go to a new route, e.g. the local post office has closed and they need to go to another one, then someone has to come and help them learn the route.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.guidedogs.com/site/PageServer?pagename=programs_dog_guide" target="_blank">Guide Dogs for the Blind</a> website</p>
<p>Some of the skills Guide Dogs learn include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leading a person in a straight line from point A to point B</li>
<li>Stopping for all changes in elevation, including curbs and stairs</li>
<li>Stopping for overhead obstacles, such as tree limbs</li>
<li>Avoiding obstacles in their path</li>
</ul>
<p>Two things Guide Dogs can't do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the route to a new destination</li>
<li>Read traffic signals</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h3>They can't check the traffic lights!</h3>
<p>It’s a popular misconception that a guide dog will know when to cross the road by waiting for the green light. In reality, it’s a team effort – and not an easy task. On a standard kerb-to-kerb crossing known to the owner, the guide dog is trained to stop at the edge, to indicate it has reached a crossing. The owner will listen for traffic, then, when he or she decides it’s safe, give the command ‘Forward!’ However, the guide dog’s training teaches them NOT to obey the command if a car’s coming.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seeing eye dogs don't actually know where to go or how to get to somewhere.  What they are taught is how to safely follow commands such as &quot;left&quot; &quot;right&quot; and &quot;forward&quot;.  If the handler says to go forward, the dog will only do so if it is safe.  For example at a traffic light, a blind person may command forward based on the sound of traffic being stopped, or the newer talking &quot;walk / don't walk&quot; lights saying to go, but the dog will stop if he sees a car parked in the crosswalk, or senses another unsafe condition. </p>
<p>Blind people generally know their community and are familiar with the areas they live and work, so giving direction to the dog is way for common destinations.  For a new or unfamiliar area, they ask directions like anyone else would, and then issue the same commands to the dog. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Blind people are super good at knowing routes and repeating them, there is this lady I see every day in the underground. The first day I saw her she was walking faster than me without using her cane and I thought &quot;Maybe she still has some vision left and is not entirely blind&quot;, One day I offered her help and talking to her she couldn't see anything and still was able to navigate through the tunnels at such speed. (Watching her walk near the rails at that speed still makes me worry for her every time)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Guide dogs only know that the route is obstacle free. ( open manhole covers, low hanging trees , etc) it's up to the blind person to know &quot;i have to cross three streets and make a left&quot; it's called orientation and mobility skills (o&amp;m)
If a blind person does NOT have good o&amp;m they could be refused a dog, as it would not be safe for either of them.</p>
