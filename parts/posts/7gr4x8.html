		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrical current through a wire creates a magnetic field directed in a circular motion around the circumference of the wire.  So, when you coil the wire into a circle, this creates a magnetic field in the direction perpendicular to the circular cross-section of this coil (think of a donut of wire sitting on a table, the magnetic field would be directed upward or downward through the hole of the donut).</p>
<p>Now, if you take a second coil of wire and place it on top of the first coil, the magnetic field from the first coil will cause a flow of current in the second coil.  This is due to the reverse of how you generated the magnetic field.</p>
<p>The &quot;first coil&quot; is your wireless charger, and the &quot;second coil&quot; is inside your phone, connected to the battery.  The current generated in the second coil charges your phone's battery.</p>
<p>Edit: It should be noted that this was an extremely simplified explanation. An important aspect that I left off was that it is the <em>change</em> in magnetic field, called magnetic flux, through the second coil that induces a current.  This means the coils must use alternating current (the type of power coming out of your wall socket), then the second coil's AC current must be converted to DC current (type of current a battery produces/charges on) in order to charge the battery.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Awesome! I think I can help.
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Wireless_power_system_-_inductive_coupling_de.svg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Wireless_power_system_-_inductive_coupling_de.svg</a></p>
<p>This picture here illustrates well what is happening. The left side is your wireless charging pad, the right side is your phone.</p>
<p>First, we need two coils, then we need alternating current and that's pretty much it. The purpose of the coils is to intensify and guide the magnetic field so we have lower power losses.</p>
<p>In the picture above, &quot;B&quot; is the magnetic field created by the left coil. A magnetic field is created when you send AC through a coil.
As you can see, a lot of the magnetic field is &quot;lost&quot; on the left side of the transmitter coil, that's why magnetic charging is so inefficient and it takes a long time to charge the phone!</p>
<p>On the right side, we have the receiver coil. A &quot;changing&quot; magnetic field induces a Voltage and thus a current flow in the coil, which can then be rectified to charge your battery (since the battery is often charged with 4.2V DC)</p>
<p>And now the even cooler part: Wireless charging isn't scratching the surface of what kind of power we can deliver that way!
If you step up the power a litte bit, you can melt metal with a coil.

<p>In the middle of the coil is a red-hot glowing M20-nut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By an extremely simple concept, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Faraday's Law of Induction</a>, which states that:</p>
<p><em>'The induced electromotive force in any closed circuit is equal to the negative of the time rate of change of the magnetic flux enclosed by the circuit.'</em></p>
<p>Put simply, your wireless charger has a wire coil inside it. An alternating current runs through the coil. This generates a magnetic field with <em>changing strength</em>—this is a key point.</p>
<p>There's <em>another</em> wire coil inside your phone. As the changing magnetic field passes through this coil, an electromotive force, or a voltage, is generated. Since this coil is connected to a closed circuit, we have another AC current in the wire coil in your phone. </p>
<p>This AC current is then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wik
i/Rectifier?wprov=sfla1">fully rectified</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier#Rectifier_output_smoothing" target="_blank">smoothened</a> to a comparatively flat DC current, which charges your battery. </p>
<p><strong><em>This will not work if the magnetic field does not change in strength</em></strong>. So the first coil <em>must</em> either carry an AC current, or a non-uniform DC current, i.e. a rectified AC, pulsed DC, square, or sawtooth.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: the equations explaining the whole idea of electromagnetism and electromagnetic induction may be complex, but the physical idea is simple.</p>
<p>Take a large metallic solenoid—it can be <em>any</em> metal, so long as it <em>is</em> metal. Connect the two ends of the spring to an ammeter or galvanometer. Drop a strong magnet through the solenoid, and see the needle on the galvanometer flick away from the centre line. </p>
<p>The kinetic energy of the falling magnet has been <em>indirectly</em> converted to electrical energy in the circuit. Why? The solenoid experiences a <em>changing</em> magnetic field of sorts. As the magnet enters the coil, the latter experiences an 'increasingly stronger' magnetic field as the magnet gets nearer. Likewise, as the magnet drops out of the other end, the magnetic field becomes increasingly weaker. As the magnet enters, it is repelled by the electric current in the coil, which generates its <em>own</em> magnetic field. Vice versa as the magnet leaves the coil, except that it is now attracted. </p>
<p>The entire concept of electricity and magnetism can be summed up in equations relating force in newtons, electric current in amperes, and magnetic field strength in teslas. It is an interplay of these three quantities that give rise to these phenomena. Actually explaining them on a deeper level requires a strong grasp of quantum mechanics and relativity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are basically a transformer. What is a transformer exactly? It is two wire coil (electromagnet) sharing a common core, which carry the magnetic field.</p>
<p>A classic transformer use a metal core, which help for the efficiency and to make it smaller, but it do not have to be metal, it can, in fact, be air.</p>
<p>The base have the primary winding, that's it, the one with power. The phone also have a winding, which would be called (drum roll) secondary winding. The electricity from the primary winding induce a magnetic field around it, which the secondary catch and convert that magnetic field into electricity. For this to happend it need to vary all the time, hence why they call it &quot;AC&quot;, or alternating current. In the case of those, the frequency, so the number of cycle per second, is relativelly high, but the frequency is not really important, it basically just change the size of the coil and the amount of power that can be transfered, the theory is still the same</p>
<p>So, in the base, you have a circuit that convert the direct current (DC) into AC, this is done by simply having a few transistors (think of switch) that turn on and off in a sequence. Basically you connect the 'left' wire to positive and 'right' to negative    and the current flow in one direction.  Then you reverse the wires, and the current flow in reverse. Think of a water hose and a pump. Connect one end to the in and the other to the out, then reverse, you will cause the water to move one way then the other. Congratulation, you made AC !</p>
<p>The way they do that is with what is called an H bridge, which is basically 4 transistors. By turning two (one per side) you can control which direction the electricity flow...</p>
<p>Once out of the secondary winding (the phone), you now have a small issue: you have AC, you want DC. This is easilly fixed by a diode (actually, most likelly 4, look up diode bridge, the advantage is that it use both the positive and negative portion by inverting the negative portion... look up how the bridge work), then follow that by a capacitor. The output of the diode(s) is pulsed, that pulse get absorbed by the capacitor, which basically act like a battery of low capacity, but can be charged millions of time.</p>
<p>Then you just need a charge controller to charge the battery.</p>
<p>The charge controller will ensure that the current do not excede the limit of the battery, else fire can happend. Also, it control the voltage, because to much voltage and the battery won't be happy (read: can catch fire). It will also stop charging when the battery is full, is too cold or too hot, and also under some other conditions. All of this to ensure a proper charge and to make the battery happy (read: don't catch fire).</p>
<p>tl;dr: the base and the phone both have a wire coil, which make an air core transformer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
