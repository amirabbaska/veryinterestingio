		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Allergies are primarily caused by Mast Cells.  HIV primarily infects Helper T Cells.  So no, HIV should not have an impact on allergies.</p>
<p>Edit:  A cursory search through the literature shows that HIV causes GREATER levels of allergies.  This is possibly because with the destruction of T cells, the immune system relies more on IgE, the antibody responsible for the allergic response.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is not much research on this as far as I am aware, at least partly because doctors would not leave patients alone until the HIV infection progresses to AIDS. Also, antiretroviral therapy tends to cause allergic reactions (directly and indirectly), which complicates the problem even further. You also have to consider that there are many types of &quot;allergy&quot; which have slightly different mechanism of action.</p>
<p>Specifically to Type I (these are the ones most commonly referred to as allergy in laymen's terms), you can have a look at <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10875489" target="_blank">1</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8421162" target="_blank">2</a>. (Access to full articles is paywalled, but you can still read the abstract.) Basically, HIV infection increases the risk of allergy as measured by IgE levels. The mechanism behind this is unknown, but my guess is on the body furiously <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5458331/" target="_blank">trying to make new B-cells in response to the loss of normal ones</a>, making the immune system go haywire in the process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Other cells like eosinophils and basophils are also involved as are chemical messengers (cytokines) produced by these cells. I have an outdated understanding at this point on how these all work together, so I can't really elaborate any further. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your immune system is compromised, everything that the body normally interprets as a threat becomes a bigger threat. The histamine response (swelling) would probably be suppressed, some of the symptoms might diminish but the overall affect on the body would be more harmful. You'd be spending resources fighting imaginary monsters while the real monsters were left untended.
I think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
