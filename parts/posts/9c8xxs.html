		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They chew for the marrow which like all food will produce a dopamine reaction.  The real neat thing about dogs is that they produce the most reward chemicals by completing tasks for humans. The reward is greater than they get from other dogs or play. It's a big reason why dogs are so loyal to their owners and not other dogs. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/canine-corner/201201/do-dogs-love-people-more-they-love-other-dogs%3famp" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/canine-corner/201201/do-dogs-love-people-more-they-love-other-dogs%3famp</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a neuroscientist,  but a veterinarian. Can't speak to the exact neurotransmitter,  but chewing is a normal behavior. I suspect related to hunting instincts.</p>
<p>Please don't let your dog chew antlers. Antlers are harder than their teeth and they can easily break teeth on them. Unfortunately,  pet stores sell things that aren't the best for dogs. Cooked bones are also too hard.  Raw bones carry risk of food borne illness,  so not recommended either. I prefer firm rubber toys, like Kongs. Rawhides are okay with supervision,  but can cause GI upset in some dogs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chewing does release some happiness related neurotransmitters, as it’s the body’s way of self rewarding for maintenance behaviours (eating, but the same are release for chewing without swallowing).
Similar to how chase drive releases it’s own endorphins as it reinforces an aspect of hunting behaviour, even if they don’t catch anything. </p>
<p>I work in rescue, and chewing is a behaviour we encourage quite a lot as it helps keep the dogs calm. Most will have preferences for certain types of materials, we tend to direct them onto rawhides, nylabones and frozen soaked biscuit blocks in the summer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
