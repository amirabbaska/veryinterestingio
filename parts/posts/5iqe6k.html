		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Small blood vessels (capillaries) will be stimulated t grow back into hypoxic tissue by growth factor proteins that the hypoxic cells send out.  This is called angiogenesis, and it happens all the time.  For a skin cut, that's about it.  </p>
<p>Large blood vessels are more complicated.  This is called vasculogenesis, and it takes a long time, and often doesn't happen at all, leaving you with an ischemic (hypoxic) limb that hurts.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both. When you get cut most blood vessels will reattach albeit not always in the exact same location. However there won't be any dead ends for long, because the body will reabsorb the material in the blood vessel to make a new one. Think of a pipe that gets broken, you can use pieces of the broken pipe to build a new one right next to where the old one was.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically there are 4 Stages to the Healing of Tissue. Epithealialization is important is restoring epi cells (skin). Once that is complete, the body will typically suffer from the damage flow, despite what people think. A blood vessel may take months to reconstruct and create an effective pathway for recurrent blood flow. More often than not, the blood vessels will shrink and cease to function. Scar tissue is a good case of tissue damage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
