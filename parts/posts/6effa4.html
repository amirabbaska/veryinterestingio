<p>Basically France produced an agreement which require developed and developing countries alike to limit their emissions to relatively safe levels. Finance will be provided to poor nations to help them cut emissions and cope with the effects of extreme weather. Countries affected by climate-related disasters will gain urgent aid.</p>
<p>The Paris Agreement (French: Accord de Paris) is an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) dealing with greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation and finance starting in the year 2020. </p>
<p>The language of the agreement was negotiated by representatives of 195 countries at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC in Paris and adopted by consensus on 12 December 2015. It was opened for signature on 22 April 2016 (Earth Day) at a ceremony in New York. As of May 2017, 195 UNFCCC members have signed the treaty, 147 of which have ratified it.</p>
<p>After several European Union states ratified the agreement in October 2016, there were enough countries that had ratified the agreement that produce enough of the world's greenhouse gases for the agreement to enter into force.The agreement went into effect on 4 November 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Details -</strong></p>
<p>Paris produced an agreement which require developed and developing countries alike are required to limit their emissions to relatively safe levels, of 2C with an aspiration of 1.5C, with regular reviews to ensure these commitments can be increased in line with scientific advice. </p>
<p>Like any international compromise, it is not perfect: the caps on emissions are still too loose, likely to lead to warming of 2.7 to 3C above pre-industrial levels, breaching the 2C threshold that scientists say is the limit of safety, beyond which the effects – droughts, floods, heatwaves and sea level rises – are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. Poor countries are also concerned that the money provided to them will not be nearly enough to protect them. Not all of the agreement is legally binding, so future governments of the signatory countries could yet renege on their commitments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was an agreement between countries through the UN to reduce their carbon emissions by a certain date. This would include a reduction in coal plants and associated jobs,  increasing green energy resources. Each country determined what they could do, and committed to those numbers.
The goal is to keep the global average temp below a 2 degree c increase.
You should care because if we don't make any change, the earth will keep heating, severe weather may increase, droughts may get worse, arctic ice will continue to melt. These will affect global food and movement.
The us is no longer the number one producer of green house gas(may be wrong last I read it was China), but we are a huge contributor. Mainly it's industry not people, but reducing what you do helps too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So is the Paris Agreement an actual global financial commitment or is it more like everyone agreeing to cut down on greenhouse gases based on some loose terms? Couldn't the US still lower their emissions even without being part of the agreement? I've heard California and New York saying they still plan to uphold the agreement. Any chance the fact that Trump may back out will have no/little effect and states/cities will just enact changes at a more local level? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets say for arguments sake that the current extreme weather we are experiencing here in Florida is due to natural climate change like that that has occurred many times in the past. Its a slow process with a devastating impact that will result in starvation and violence as everyone competes to survive and the cost of food and water will increase the worse things get. Now add in the human impact of the Industrial Revolution with its smelting plants going back as far as the mid 1600s and all the plastic that are now polluting beaches due to the volume of plastic we have thrown in the ocean since the 1950s that will help to speed up the natural climate change. Coal use became abundant in the mid 19th century and only recently looks like it will be extinct. And add in vast world wide human development along the coast line and the deforestation to build homes.</p>
<p>So if we are into the early stages of the next natural climate change, why would you not want to take steps to slow it down? Is it because it will not affect you as much as your grandchildren? Is it not being restricted in whatever you want to do and live for the moment? Is it because it will make you rich? Switching from a fossil fuel based economy to an alternative is no different than switching from an agricultural economy to an industrial one. Jobs will be eliminated and others created.</p>
<p>And yes, it will cost more to implement the change. But it is a matter of what account you want to place your money because the money is going to be spent either way. You either spend it on fixing the problem or spend it on your fading health and damage caused by the worsening weather. The reality is you are going to have to fund both. </p>
<p>As for Trump pulling out of the agreement, fortunately we have states rights that say anything not mentioned in the Constitution are reserved to the states. And among them are the big liberal states that have the most industry, GDP and population that will abide by the Paris Agreement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
