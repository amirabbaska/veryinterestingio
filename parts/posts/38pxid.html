		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A dollar coin has a mass of about 8.1 grams. For simplicity assume it to be all made out of copper (it's really about 90% copper). Copper has an atomic density of 63.55 grams/per mole, giving us 7.68 x 10^22 atoms in a dollar coin. The earth has a surface area of 5.1 x 10^8 km^2, so that if the coin were smashed until it was just a one atom thick layer of material (to maximize how far we can spread it) covering the entire earth, then each atom would occupy an area of about 7000 square microns. If the atoms were arranged in a square lattice, each copper atom would be at least 80 microns away from the next nearest atom. For regular bulk copper, atoms are spaced about 0.4 nm apart. So, the atoms would be about 200,000 times too far away from each other to form stable chemical bonds. Simply put, you no longer have a solid chunk of metal if you want it to cover the earth. You have a very sparse copper gas. </p>
<p>If you subdivide the atoms, you don't have copper anymore. But subdividing won't really help anyways. If you manage to divide each copper atom into 29 hydrogen atoms (ignoring all the messy details of nuclear reactions), then the hydrogen atoms would still be 15 microns away from each other, still several thousands times too far apart to form bonds.</p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://sciencequestionswithsurprisinganswers.org/2015/06/15/if-i-hammered-and-flattened-a-penny-enough-could-i-cover-the-entire-earth-with-it/" target="_blank">Here is an article</a> with more exact calculations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey. Materials scientist here. The short answer is that one silver dollar coin would cover 1.99*10^-9% of Earth's surface. That's roughly 2 billionths of a percent. So let's look at the details.</p>
<p>Assume we're considering a US silver dollar. The US mint website says they're approximately 1 troy ounce of 99.9% pure silver. Let's make that and even troy ounce of 100% silver. One troy ounce is 31.1 grams. Divided by the molar mass of silver (107 g/mole) and multiplied by Avogadro's number (units of atoms/mole), we have 1.736<em>10^23 silver atoms. Now consider the atomic radius of metallic silver, 130 pm (picometers, or 10^-12 meters). One atom would occupy an area of pi</em>(130 pm)^2, therefore giving us a total area of 9217 m^2. But wait there's more. Pure metals tend to crystalize in a hexagonal close packed structure when considered in 2D. The packing efficiency of such a structure is 0.9069 (see Wikipedia's entry on Circle Packing). Thus and therefore, the actual area occupied by a 1 troy ounce silver good ole fashioned American dollar would be 10163 m^2. Considering Earth's surface area of 5.1*10^14 meters, our coin would cover 2 billionths of a percent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ben Franklin did this with a similar amount of oil on water:</p>
<p>'He &quot;fetched out a cruet of oil, and dropt a little of it on the water.&quot;  Ben wrote that &quot;it spread itself with surprising swiftness upon the surface....and there the oil, though not more than <strong>a teaspoonful</strong>, produced and instant calm over a space several yards square, which spread amazingly, and extended itself gradually till it reached the lee side, making all that quarter of the pond, <strong>perhaps half an acre</strong>, as smooth as a looking glass.&quot;</p>
<p>...  Importantly, he wrote about how a given quantity of olive oil would only cover a set amount of pond surface.  <strong>Twice the volume of oil would cover twice the area of pond surface.</strong>  Ben concluded that there was a limit to how thin the oil could be spread.  He carefully recorded the volumes of oil and the surface areas that they covered.  We don't actually know whether he calculated the thickness of the oil layers (it isn't recorded in his notes), but if he did, his measurements would have predicted a thickness of approximately 10 Angstroms (one Angstrom is approximately one ten-billionth of a meter).  This would have been a remarkably close measurement of the thickness of a single-molecule thick layer (called a &quot;monolayer&quot;) of triolein, one of the major lipids in olive oil.  Had he written this down, it would have been the first recorded measurement of the size of a single molecule.  It wasn't until over 100 years later in 1890 that the scientist and eventual Nobel Prize winner John William Strutt, better known as <strong>Lord Rayleigh, repeated these experiments and measured the thickness of the triolein monolayer as 16 Angstroms.</strong>'</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is my approximation, which is a bit simpler that some of the top answers here. Multiply the surface area of the earth by the thickness of a copper atom. Divide that by the volume of a copper coin: <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28surface%20area%20of%20the%20earth%20*%20radius%20of%20copper%20atom%20*%202%29%20%2F%20%28volume%20of%201%20dollar%20coin%29&amp;dataset=" target="_blank">wolfram alpha link</a></p>
<p>You need approximately 120 billion coins to do this, which seems to be in line with the other answers here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some very good answers here, but I've got another twist for you: The surface of the earth is approximately fractal at most scales until you reach the molecular level (where the term &quot;surface&quot; stops making sense). This means that the surface area of the earth, as &quot;seen&quot; by copper atoms is a lot larger than the 10^14 m^2 which is assumed in the other replies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
