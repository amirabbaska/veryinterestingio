		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of interesting reasons listed in these comments... One that is mentioned a lot is because it is divisible by a lot of different factors. But what is missing is <em>why</em> it used to be important for a scale to be divisible by a lot of factors. </p>
<p>Back in the day, to make instrumentation, one had to score the increments by hand. Try this. On a sheet of paper, try marking one edge with exactly 100 marks. You can get the &quot;50&quot; and &quot;25&quot; marks easy enough by dividing in half then in half again. After that, you have to start dividing by five, which is more difficult to do accurately. Now try with 360 marks. Half and half again is 180 then 90. Half again gives you 45. A third of this gives you 15 and a third again gives you 5. Thirds gives you 240, 120. Half these gives you 60, 30, 15, thirds again gives you five before you have to start dividing by five. 5/360 is almost 1/100th of a circumference (.01389 of a circumference). To get similar resolution using base 10 and dividing by only 2s and 3s, you'd need a scale to 1600, with the smallest increment being 25. </p>
<p>So using 360, you can get to a resolution of nearly 1/100th of a circle just by dividing by 2s and 3s and you have easy access to 90 (1/4 circumference), 45 (1/8 circumference), 120 (1/3 circumference), 60 (1/6 circumference) and 30 (1/12 circumference), 15 (1/24 circumference) and 5 (1/72 circumference). Whereas with 100 units, you can get only to quarter circles before you have to figure out how to divide a line into five parts. </p>
<p>This is extremely convenient. In drafting, for instance, you can draw any 15 degree increment just using 30/60/90 and 45/45/90 triangles in combination. And in math/engineering, 30, 45, 90 have convenient degrees to radian conversions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's arbitrary. But very convenient since 360 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 (prime factorization) so that it's divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180 and 360 (yes, that's 24 divisors!). That is, if you divide a circular disc into 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 90, 120, 180, 360 equally large sectors all of them will have an integer angle measured in degrees: 360, 180, 120, 90, ..., 4, 3, 2, 1 degree(s), respectively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>3x4=12</p>
<p>Each time you count all the lines, put up one finger on your other hand.   5 fingers, 12 lines,   5x12=60.   </p>
<p>This is the 60 base counting system, and it was used by the babylonians/sumerian civilizations, and was adopted by a lot of math 'cults' from a long time ago.   </p>

<p>ELI5: Ancient math wasnt based on 100, we did that because modern civilzations connect to it better because we count like barbarians using one finger per count and top out at 10.   If you counted using a 12/60/144 based systems, we would be asking why metric is 10 based.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and there have been other divisions.</p>
<p>Some engineers use grads, which divide a right angle into 100,  and maths often uses radians, of which there are 2Pi in a circle.</p>
<p>EDIT: Many people have rightly pointed out that suggesting radians are arbitrary is wrong. Yes - you're right - it's part of fundamentals of the universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
