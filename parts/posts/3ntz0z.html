			<a href="/posts/3ntz0z" onclick="return false">Why are lions/tigers/Jaguars/etc so powerful and muscular, yet all they do is mostly sleep all day and hunt once every few days? How have they evolved to be this powerful with that lack of exercise and sleep patterns?</a>

I was also thinking that millions of years ago, their ancestors were tiny, but still hunted prey relative to their size, however as their prey started growing, they to, will grow over time as only stronger cats would be able to bring down the prey and therefore pass on the genetics. However with the case of the gorillas as some people mentioned, how did they evolve to be strong, with really no motive to be as powerful as they are?</p></div></div>
