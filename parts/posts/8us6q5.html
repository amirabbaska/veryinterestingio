		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body cools down as it prepares for sleep, which is naturally in the evening (due to circadian rhythm). Being too warm interrupts the neurotransmitters that assist in falling and staying asleep. This is also why a warm bath or shower before bed isn’t recommended if you already have trouble sleeping. It raises your body temp unnaturally and against what it’s trying to do.</p>
<p>My body warms up after I fall asleep (I’ve been compared to a furnace or space heater while I’m sleeping, haha!) and if I happen to wake up shortly after falling asleep I’m uncomfortably hot and getting back to sleep is impossible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just for the sake of information, here’s another trick to help yourself fall asleep that works with neurotransmitters:</p>
<p>When you’re in bed with your eyes closed, roll them back as far as you can (it’s kind of a weird feeling to me). Hold them like that for several seconds, relax, repeat. The reason something so simple works is because your eyes roll back naturally when you’re really asleep in this fashion. Doing it deliberately signals the brain to release melatonin, which is one of our “sleep hormones” (and popular as a supplement to take at bedtime to help sleep). So there you have it. I just saved you 12 bucks. :D</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why is it that I sleep better in the heat both during the day and at night?  I find is easier to sleep if the room is warm than cool.  My wife prefers a cool room and I find it crazy.  She even opens the window in the winter.    Also, when I become sleepy I heat up like a furnace, almost akin to getting a fever.  Probably unrelated, but I'm also a very deep sleeper.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We like being warm in general, but during the day we don't usually wear blankets that insulate heat. Having it colder means you can snuggle up in a blanket or sheet without having to be too hot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm kinda late on this but I'm kinda the opposite. Warm rooms always make me uncomfortable but the cold makes me super tired. It makes me think about laying in bed under the covers. People always say that it's good to keep a low temp to stay awake but it's the opposite!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
