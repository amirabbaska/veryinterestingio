		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know they have the best security around them, but I am still kind of surprised there aren't at least <em>attempts</em>.   There is no way security can be everywhere, watch everyone, and consider every possible plot. </p>
<p>This is domestic, not foreign, but I remember when Barack Obama was elected, tensions were really high among his opponents.  There were a lot of people that were absolutely convinced that he was going to destroy the country and that he was &quot;an enemy among us&quot;. </p>
<p>I remember watching him on TV on inauguration day.  He and Michelle got into the heavily armored Cadillac that the president travels in and was slowly moving down the streets that were lined with people.  2 or 3 story buildings lined both sides of the streets and there were a lot of people in the buildings with Windows open watching the parade. </p>
<p>At one point, they stopped the car and he and Michelle both got out and walked down the middle of the street for quite a long time.  He was walking along and waving to the crowd, and a I couldn't help but be concerned for his safety.  I thought, yeah, I know there are probably snipers around, and plenty of security, but shit...  You can't watch everyone.  If someone had a gun in one of those windows and was standing back in the room (away from the window) you wouldn't be able to see them unless you had the perfect vantage point. </p>
<p>So I think the biggest factor that leads to a leader's safety is that the vast majority of people are civil enough to not consider something like this.  If <em>everyone</em> wanted to do harm to him, there would be little that anyone could do.  The crowd could just rush him.  But the vast majority of people are not psychos.  And the minority psychos know this.  So they realize that not only is there a lot of security looking for them, but they are also kind of being watched by all of the regular people.  As long as the &quot;good guys&quot;  far outnumber the &quot;bad guys&quot;, it makes it much much harder to pull something like this off. </p>
<p>But with that said, I am still surprised that there aren't at least <em>attempts</em>, even if they are failed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sovereign states don't go about openly assassinating other heads of state. The mutual guarantees of safety are one of the reasons why diplomatic traffic works at all. If these guarantees are withdrawn, then all diplomatic traffic between states grind to a halt, which is in no state's interest. </p>
<p>As for non-state actors (terrorrists, criminals, freedom fighters): they pose a real risk, but it's in the host nation's best interests to keep their guests safe. If something bad happens, it means loss of reputation, deterioration of relations, potential withdrawing of other states because the area is deemed unsafe. </p>
<p>Security detail is strong enough that attempts on the life of a head of state are complex to plan and exceedingly unlikely to succeed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To expound on the security systems /u/amonoxia mentioned: One of the ways I've witnessed heads of state securing the skies is by having decoy aircraft flying the same flight path, but staggered by a couple miles. Say there are 5 helicopters with one containing the president. Even if terrorists or someone managed to get hold of some weapon to attack the helicopters, unless they attacked all 5 at once the odds of hitting the one containing the president on the first try is only 20%, and you can bet once one chopper is down the rest will scatter, land, and secure everything ASAP. Once the element of surprise is gone, you've already lost. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like most of the top answers got bogged down in technicalities or tangents, so I'm going to try and provide a more pragmatic answer. </p>
<p>I live in Seattle, where the Chinese president is visiting. I also own guns, but I have no particular desire to spend the rest of my life in jail or die in order to kill the Chinese president. Let's say I did. I'm so angry about China that I'm willing to do that in order to kill an immediately replaceable figurehead. </p>
<p>Parts of his itinerary are public. So I go to the Starbucks he's visiting and look around. There's really no place nearby with an obvious field of fire for a long range shot. So I go in to the Starbucks. Problem - security personnel have been on site for hours, poking their noses in things, so everyone with a reason to be there is established and searched, anyone who doesn't has been moved along or checked. By the time the president arrives, I've been patted down and arrested or moved along.</p>
<p>But I realized that was going to happen, because I'm a thoughtful psychopath. So I go somewhere else where he's going to go where there's an apartment building, or a clock tower. Well, problem, the doors locked. Or someone notices the stranger walking in with a suspiciously rifle-shaped bag. Ok, that didn't happen. Instead, the security detail, not being complete idiots, sweep the building because they noticed it too. I'm caught. </p>
<p>No, that didn't happen, because the security detail is made up of complete idiots. Ok, so the Chinese president arrives, and I have a clear shot of the parking lot. Problem - the car parks right in front of the door and he's hustled in while surrounded by armored security. I don't have a shot. </p>
<p>Ok, I do have a shot, but I miss because I only had a split second and my adrenaline is off the charts. But it isn't fatal, he's rushed away. Ok, I do have a shot, and it's fatal because I'm a trained sniper. Except I was brought in for questioning 3 days ago because I'm a trained sniper who's part of a radical anti-china organization,so I didn't get that chance. Or the security detail, having extensively studied every assassination attempt in history, catches me or shapes circumstances to their control. </p>
<p>Let's say the perfect storm of incompetence on everyone else's part, and I got the fatal shot. Problem, I was firing an un-suppressed 7.62x54r firearm, so I was easily located, and surrounded and captured or killed. </p>
<p>But I got the Chinese president. Within hours, his largely ceremonial functions have been distributed to the next level of functionaries, or his second in command is promoted to his place. Everything about China stays exactly the same, because the president was just a role, not a person, and i'm in jail or dead. Yay. I win. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take what just happened in my town yesterday for example. The president of China flew in and landed at the airport right next to where I work. Everyone here was forced to remain inside with windows blacked out. All roads, highways, and even the interstate were blocked off while he transited.</p>
<p>There is something important to remember, if someone from our country were to assassinate a foreign diplomat, that could easily be considered an act of war</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
