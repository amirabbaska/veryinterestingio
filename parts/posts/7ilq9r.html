		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read in New Scientist, many years ago now, that one theory may be due to trace alcohols. The measured alcohol indicated on the label refers to ethanol. For example, a bottle of vodka labeled as 40% vol means that 40% of that bottle is ethanol. The brewing process that creates the ethanol will usually create other trace alcohols also; such as methanol. These other alcohols can be much more harmful to you, especially in larger quantities. In the case of a brewed beverage, the effect of these trace alcohols will likely manifest itself in an unpleasant feeling; a raging hangover. This is why, in many countries, distillation of alcohol is regulated. Once distilled, these trace alcohols can be much more potent and cause much more damage and even death.</p>
<p>I remember that the article also suggested that these alcohols may be the reason why people sometimes react differently to different types of drink.</p>
<p>The article did not suggest this was a definitive answer but the theory seems very reasonable to me.</p>
<p>Edit: Oh, and to answer the question, poorly made, cheap booze will likely have more of these trace alcohols, both a larger variation of, and volume of.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cheaper the alcohol, the less it was filtered, and can have more impurities than just the alcohol, flavorings, and water. So the liver and kidneys have to filter out more than just alcohol.</p>
<p>But this is mainly with Vodka and grain alcohol. Alcohol with higher sugar content typically also gives a feeling of a greater hangover, as the body has a harder time filtering out the alcohol when it is mixed with sugars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's the actual answer:</p>
<p>Cheap liquor producers are less aggressive when it comes to the &quot;cut&quot;. When you fire up the still the first stuff that comes out may have methanol in it, but any producer, even the cheap guys, will throw that away because even trace amounts can be dangerous. Don't listen to anyone who says cheap vodka has methanol in it. They also throw away the tail end of the run because of the presence of unpleasant stuff. These are called the &quot;heads&quot; and the &quot;tails&quot;.</p>
<p>Now the difference between your fancy top shelf and your well is how much they throw away of the heads and tails. If you're making a high end product you're going to use only the best stuff that comes out in the middle, the so called &quot;heart&quot; of the distillate. While if you're cranking out plastic jugs of hooch for as cheap as possible you're going to cut as little as possible.</p>
<p>TLDR: Because of the presence of congeners, rather, oils, and other nasty stuff (but not methanol) that better producers screen out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's partly because we don't have the enzymes to oxidise the longer chain alcohols in poorly distilled spirits from aldehydes to acids.  They linger as harmful aldehydes, whereas the much less harmful acids enter other processes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
