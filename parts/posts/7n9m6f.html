		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Foreign Aid is to a large part a geopolitical tool. It also has a humanitarian aspect, but mostly it is political. This is not only about America (USA), but an answer in general. </p>
<p>You are making sure countries are pro-you and stabilised (edit: regarding the <em>government</em>), people from there do not move (for example as refugees to &quot;you&quot;), countries are influenced culturally as you want, you ensure economic access, ensure the geopolitical grasp in that area (which explains when the aid is taking the form of military items or money for military). All those things are &quot;pro you&quot;, but you also want them to be &quot;contra other geopolitical and local players&quot;. </p>
<p>Furthermore, a lot of that money goes  back into your own companies. Especially regarding infrastructure (and military) projects which are usually done by large companies - and those are not from the place you're giving the money to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Such an amount would not begin to address the issues we have domestically that you name, but it does generate goodwill with other nations while doing a not more to help that nation than it will do here so it is considered a good thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>It doesn't. The amount of foreign aid the US gives is not impressive. It's around 1% of the country's GDP, below the UN's guideline and less in absolute amounts than some other, smaller countries. (Last I checked some years ago, Japan gave more aid than the US did, despite having smaller population and economy) And of the aid America <em>does</em> give, a huge chunk goes to comparatively wealthy countries like Israel, which isn't really humanitarian aid at all.</li>
<li>It's not one or the other. If this aid wasn't sent out, I can guarantee you that it wouldn't be spent fixing America's health care or homelessness problems. And likewise, if there was any political will towards solving these problems they could be solved without cannibalizing foreign aid. It's not like America has a fixed budget for humanitarian purposes. The budget for foreign aid is very much separate from that for domestic health care or infrastructure.</li>
<li>the money quite simply goes farther when you help developing countries. For not a lot of money, you can feed <em>a lot</em> of people in countries with famine. Helping Americans is comparatively more expensive.</li>
<li>it is something of an investment as well as aid. If other countries are more stable and prosperous, they can buy more American goods, for example. And with luck, they might even be grateful and become an ally of America's. And, of course, stable countries aren't a threat to world security. Imagine, for example, if a saner, more humanitarian policy towards Korea back in the day, could have prevented North Korea from becoming the problem that it is today. (Of course we don't know what would have happened then but broadly speaking, helping other countries become more stable, safe and prosperous <em>often</em> means they won't end up run by maniacal dictators)</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So first, America doesn't actually send a bunch of aid around the world.  We spend about 1% of our federal budget on foreign aid.  For America, that's almost a rounding error.</p>
<p>Second, it engenders good will in other nations and is just the right thing to do.  If you have that much wealth that you can afford it, it's the right thing to contribute and get other countries to like you.</p>
<p>Lastly, and probably most importantly, it's a national security priority.  People turn to things like drugs, crime, revolution, and even terrorism when they are poor and feel like they have no other alternatives.  So, every dollar America sends to other countries helps to stabilize those countries.  By fighting poverty, disease, and starvation overseas, we help stop people from feeling desperate enough to turn to violence and harm America and her allies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your first assumption is that money will solve the homeless, drug, or any problem. That has not been proven and  there is a mountain of evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Your second assumption is that 'lesser'  problems shouldn't be addressed until 'greater' problems are fully solved. By this logic, police shouldn't investigate theft until all rapes and murders are solved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
