		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a more fleshed-out version of the question:</p>
<p>Let's say you're on a wagon-wheel-like spaceship that's spinning such that the (sorry) centrifugal force inside the 'wheel' (where the crew would be) is equivalent to 1G. Now let's say you're climbing around the outside of the wheel, using handholds that you're tethered to with a metal cable. If you fell off, you'd be hanging off the wheel by the cable, spinning 'below' the wheel relative to the center of the wheel. In this circumstance, would you still be able to climb back up the cable, or is there some weird interaction with vacuum or spinning reference frames or some other weird space thing that would prevent this? Thanks!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't see why not. The rope would be a little J shaped due to Coriolis effect, but you could climb it just fine.</p>
<p>As far as reference, if you're holding onto the rope it would just look like the spaceship weren't spinning the the universe around you was, just like on a merry-go-round.</p>
<p>The only real strange thing is the spaceship would need an equal counterbalance exactly your weight+the rope's weight or it would have a funky rotation as it spins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, one thing to think about would be, how long is the cable? The gravity on one of those theoretical space stations is simulated by centrifugal force, and that force increases as the distance from the centre of the wheel increases; in the centre, there would be no force, and presumably on the outside, 1G. Now, if you move away from the outside, getting further away, your rotational path is longer, and so you must move faster to cover it in the same time period; this means that you would experience more than 1G. If the tether was quite long compared to the radius of the ship, you might begin to experience quite a lot more than 1G, and you might not have the strength to pull yourself in.  I don't have the physics skills to calculate the actual numbers, tho, just the knowledge of the basic principles.</p>
<p>In addition to all of that, I really wonder how easy it would be to pull yourself up a steel cable even at 1G, especially wearing a space suit; it would have significant extra weight, and presumably it would also hinder your grip in the same way that other bulky gloves do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The center will be 0G's and as you move toward the outer edges it will increase to 1G then, exceed that as you continue. </p>
<p>So you could conceivably climb to the center, granted your pulling power exceeded the force on your body pulling you towards the outside of the circle. </p>
<p>(I am a laymen, this is simplified, feel free to correct me) </p>
<p>For example. I weight 170lbs. In the center, the force needed might be 5 lbs of force to propel yourself through 0G space. At 1G 170lbs of force or more is needed. (If you're pulling yourself up a rope) Anything beyond that is just going to multiply your body weight against the gravity amount. So 2G x 170lbs = 340lbs of weight to pull. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Let's say I am going 10,000kph in a space ship. A fire breaks out in the ship. I understand the effects the smoke would have staying at that speed. However if I were to suddenly speed the ship up to 15,000kph what effect would the smoke have within the ship?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not only should you be able to climb the rope, but when you first grab the rope, you also encounter a startling consequence of relativity. </p>
<p>Let's say that one day, you wake up in a room with no windows where I've taken you prisoner. There's a small hole in the top of the ceiling and a rope hanging down from it. I tell you to take hold of it, and you oblige. Everything feels normal. As you're just starting up, I ask you:</p>
<p>&quot;Hey /u/spark2 : are we in a gym on Earth where I've put up a few walls around a climbing rope, which is attached to a ceiling and held taut by gravity? Or are we in a spoke of my sinister wheeled spaceship, which is spinning in the void with this rope running out from the center, held taut by centrifugal force / centripetal acceleration?&quot;</p>
<p>One key early insight underpinning relativity is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_centrifugal_and_centripetal_forces#Role_in_developing_the_idea_of_inertial_frames_and_relativity" target="_blank">you absolutely cannot tell the difference</a>.</p>
<p>You know that when you're in a car making a sharp turn, your body tries to keep going straight, but your restraints bind you too the car, pressing on you and forcing you to accelerate in the new direction. On the rope, you're using your hands and muscles to stay bound to the rope, which takes prayer because you're trying to move in different directions, just like in the car. Yet the question I was really asking you as you climbed was this: does holding onto the rope require force because you're in flat space in the middle of nowhere, wanting to go in a straight line, and staying on the rope means being forced to follow an ever-curving path through that flat space? Or does staying on the rope require force because you're on Earth, in the curved space of the planet's gravity well, wanting to follow the curve, and staying on the rope means being forced follow an ever-straightening path in that curved space?</p>
<p>One of the core principles of modern physics is that the two possibilities are literally indistinguishable from your perspective, and both interpretations can be equally valid depending on your frame of reference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
