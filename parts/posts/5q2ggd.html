Or can neutrons decay into elementary particles directly in a similar way protons can?
I know that the existance of proton decay is not confirmed, and some scientist may even say its unlikely. But does the hypothesis also include bound neutron decay?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A nucleus containing protons and neutrons fills two sets of quantum states, one for neutrons and one for protons. You then calculate the total energy for that configuration. </p>
<p>Now you check what would happen to the energy if you fill the same quantum states with one more proton and one less neutron, plus an electron and an (anti-) neutrino. If the total energy is less than what you originally had, one neutron will beta decay to a proton. </p>
<p>It is the total energy of the system that decides if the system is stable or not, not the properties of the individual constituent particles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. If free protons decay, then all nucleons will decay, including those bound in nucleons. The energy scale is completely different: a hadron decay (to something without a hadron) releases hundreds of MeV. The binding energy of nuclei is a few MeV: it does not matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physics major here, I hope I did not misunderstood your question (not native speaker). As far as I know, single protons do not decay ( or to be exact what was shown that their average lifetime is pretty big, sources later since I'm from mobile ). Single neutrons do decay into protons, electrons , and anti-neutrinos (this is the most likely case). And to clarify, we call stable atoms stable stable because they are not observed to decay (strictly, there is a low probability because in quantum mechanics nothing is sure, but it is basically zero, like fifty thousand zeros and then a one, since we are talking about really high energies). </p>
<p>Unstable atoms decay through either the weak interaction through beta decay, or through the quantum tunneling of alpha particles. They do decay, because through decay they will be in a lower energy state. Free neutrons are just alike, they do decay because if they decay, the total (rest) energy of the newly create particles will be lower than the total energy of the neutron being alone. </p>
<p>So stable atoms don't decay because they are energetically stable, and neutrons inside them are stable, because decaying would not be energetically efficient, not because they are unstable by default. The between the protons and neutrons, provided by pions, I'd what ensures that they will not decay. It's not that neutrons are by default going to decay, it depend on the given circumstances, whether anything will happen or not. </p>
<p>Example: radioactive atoms are known to alter their half-life time when placed inside carbon nano balls (fulleren balls is the correct name, source later). This I'd because the change in circumstances provide a change of their possible energetical states, thus altering the chance they will decay and therefore altering the half life time of the given material. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to your question is yes.  In unified models and the like in which we speak of &quot;proton decay,&quot; we actually are referring to processes that change the total number of baryons; the stable baryons in the universe are protons and neutrons (stable inside certain nuclei). In these models, there are decays of such protons and neutrons.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, see my comments <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5q2ggd/do_neutrons_bound_to_stable_atoms_decay_the_same/dcw9jov/" target="_blank">elsewhere in this thread</a> about why the nucleus the proton or stable neutron sits in essentially plays no role in questions of proton or stable neutron decay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
