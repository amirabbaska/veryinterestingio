		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people can have experiences growing up that &quot;teach&quot; them to be wary of situations that ohers haven't had a lot of bad experiences with so they don't think twice about it. Stuff as simple as having discussions -- if someone grew up in a place where they'd get treated badly if they said the wrong thing the wrong way then once they're an adult it will be stressful to be presented with situtions where the have to converse, and the stress might even make them say something strangely so even people who aren't trying to be abusive can perpetuate the defense with their normal reactions. And then where one person might see a harmless disagreement that people deal with fine all the time the other person perceives a stressful attack building up that they've been kinda trained to avoid as much as possible.</p>
<p>There's a lot of factors for sure (like just natural genetic or hormonal stuff) but that's just one way I've seen it. People adapt to growing up in certain environments, they have subtle techniques (without even trying) for avoiding situations that caused them pain before, and those adaptations don't always carry over to the larger world where those situations don't lead to the same things they've come to expect. And it can be hard for a person to separate their learned defenses from normal socialization and cues. Plus they can already be preparing defenses subconsciously before they're even aware of it consciously.</p>
<p>I have some mild anxiety that used to be a lot worse because my family moved around a lot and I got picked on pretty bad at one school at the start of freshman year (I had just arrived so I had no friends or anything yet). Eventually I moved from that school too but I had already &quot;learned&quot; to just stay out of peoples' ways and they wouldn't bother me as much. So through the rest of high school, even though I didn't get picked on very much again, I never made any friends or anything. So I didn't date either. Eventually I ended up just thinking I was ugly and weird and deserved to be by myself and the thought of having to have even a passing interaction with another human being made me sweaty and shakey. On top of home issues, I started developing a serious fear of people and having to interact/be judged by them. It wasn't until college, I was 20, that I started getting the sense that maybe I was kind of attractive and maybe I was smart enough to have conversations after all and maybe I shouldn't be so afraid of people. 4 years later and I have some solid friends and an amazing girlfriend (after a couple not so amazing ones lol) and I finally feel like how I think I SHOULD have felt years ago.</p>
<p>Lol I didn't mean to turn this into a life story, but it's a part of my views on anxiety. It also took me meeting people with anxiety worse than me (for way better reasons too...) to start examining my own issues</p>
<p>But also note that people can have anxiety over other things too. Someone can have all sorts of friends but still have massive anxiety about how to behave or what's expected of them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an early childhood teacher (specialise in understanding birth-5 years) and my husband's a clinical psychologist (across the lifespan). We talk a lot about the theory and research behind this and there is considerable overlap in our work. In a nutshell, a lot of stems down to the attachment you formed with your caregivers in early childhood, particularly from the age of 0-2. This is backed up by the work of John Bowlby, [Harry Harlow's experiments] (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O60TYAIgC4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O60TYAIgC4</a>), (very distressing to watch), and the people who have extended and expanded Bowlby's work [Circle of Security] (<a href="https://www.circleofsecurityinternational.com/animations" target="_blank">https://www.circleofsecurityinternational.com/animations</a>), [Strange Situation experiment] (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTsewNrHUHU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTsewNrHUHU</a>), [Still Face experiment] (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apzXGEbZht0&spfreload=10" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apzXGEbZht0&spfreload=10</a>)</p>
<p>Everyone develops an attachment to their caregivers. 1) Secure (60% of people) or one of the three insecure versions (the other 40% of people): 2) Anxious-ambivalent 3) Avoidant-dismissive. 4) Disorganised. </p>
<p>Anxious-ambivalent attachment is what makes you more susceptible to anxiety disorders. It is characterised by a caregiver who is inconsistent in their approach - sometimes they are loving and responsive to your cues, othertimes they are emotionally unavailable (might have PND or are preoccupied with their own problems) and will respond in a harsh, unloving manner to your cues. The child at this young age has not yet developed the understanding of theory of mind, so they are very sensitive to the parent's emotions, they believe that they are the one and the same person as their caregiver. They cannot understand that a caregiver is a separate entity to themselves. If a parent is constantly sad, they will be sad. If a parent is constantly angry, they will be angry. If a parent is constantly anxious, they will be anxious. They internalise the parent's emotional state and it becomes their own. In infancy, they are also developing Mirror Neurons, where they imitate their caregivers behaviours. So if a parent has an anxious face, the child will mirror it (and feel that way). The Still Face experiment is a good one to watch on youtube to see this in action.  </p>
<p>Good news, is that attachment can change when you're an adult. It's called an earned secure attachment. Adult attachment styles in romantic relationships correspond with the one you developed with your caregiver (hence why you might always go for a certain type of person). You can change this by becoming aware of your own mental health and changing that by doing therapy to change these patterns of interaction. Medication will help with stabilising mood, but it's a bandaid, it won't fix the underlying wound.</p>
<p>TLDR; If your parent is/was anxious in your infancy, you probably developed it too. You can undo it and develop an earned secure attachment as an adult to prevent the cycle reoccuring. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of psychological disorders like anxiety on a sliding scale from 1-10. With 10 being unable to do anything because of a psychological disorder and 1 being that a person may occasionally feel a certain way. </p>
<p>&quot;Normal&quot; people still experience many of the same symptoms as people with psychological disorders just not the the extent that it interferes with our day to day lives. The only time something becomes a disorder is when it begins to interfere with a persons ability to lead a productive happy life. </p>
<p>There are many reasons for humans to feel anxious, however under the right circumstances these feelings may develop into a more chronic feeling of which may limit the person from doing things they normally would. At this point it can be considered a disorder. </p>
<p>IT IS PERFECTLY NORMAL TO FEEL ANXIOUS. If you don't feel even a little bit anxious when doing things that are out of your comfort zone you should probably go seek professional help because you may be a psycho. That being said just remember that it is perfectly human to experience extreme feelings, just not all the time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people are tall, some people are short.  Some people are nearsighted, some people have good eyesight.  I personally have one calf slightly longer than the other, and one thighbone slightly longer than the other, so that it causes my back to twist ever so slightly, and gives me some trouble running, but you can't easily notice it. </p>
<p>Our brains deal with things in various different ways.  Anxiety is a stress response.  The way we feel is mostly moderated by regions in our midbrain. As animals and the structure of the brain evolved, the more developed parts kind of grew on top of what was already successful.  The hindbrain is one of those early more successful bits, and its role is to coordinate some of the more complicated systems like motor control, our breathing, our sleep, autonomic behaviors.  Having this lets you be a more complex organism that can do things like breathe instead of needing a way to passively absorb oxygen.</p>
<p>Past that, one of the simpler successful structures that evolved was the Amygdala.  This is in the midbrain, so after the hindbrain, as part of the system that influences your behavior. The midbrain does some more sensory processing, so it handles things like vision and hearing, alertness, motivation, sensitivity to temperature.   The amygdala works in conjunction with your sensory perception does some processing and based on that processing, makes your body spit out hormones like adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol.  These go to other parts of your midbrain and which activate parts that tell you to be alert, to be motivated, to be careful and to be distrustful (more or less). </p>
<p>So when you see something that the brain has evolved to treat as bad (like the color of blood, or something very large), or more advanced, if you see something that causes you to recall something that has caused you stress (like a clown after seeing IT), it responds by spitting out these hormones and making you feel stress, anxiety, motivation, anger.</p>
<p>Next there's other parts of your midbrain that are a bit more advanced that have more to do with advanced planning in your limbic system, and they deal with hormones that moderate your feelings of satisfaction and drive to accomplish long-term goals, like seratonin and dopamine, or your feelings of attachment and family like oxytocin. These are less important for some animals, if an animal has to eat when it's hungry, run when it's hurt or being chased, mate when it's near a suitable mate, and ignore its babies, then you can get by without the energetically expensive parts of the brain.</p>
<p>But we're very social, and very smart, so we have the extended version.  And they conflict, sometimes long term planning means needing to override a stress response, so they interact, one suppresses the other. </p>
<p>Next there's the forebrain and this is where it gets really messy.  This is the part where we think, and plan.  While the midbrain gives us the motivation to go after longer-term goals, that's more in the Pavlovian sort of &quot;if I hit this button now, I'll get a treat soon&quot;.  The forebrain is what tells us &quot;If I take these seeds that I can eat and plant them, then in 6 months I can collect more seeds, and have a bunch of food to eat.&quot; and it needs to override the other parts of the brain that are saying that those seeds look good to eat right now.</p>
<p>So back to anxiety.  Everyone's different. And just like some people have longer legs, some people have more or less receptors for some hormones, or more or less sensitivity to them, or they make them at different levels. Not too wildly different, but a little bit.  I mean that's how we evolved to this point at all, our ancestors were a little bit different than them, and over millions of years, we're able to use our thinking to suppress our fear better than our ancestors of a million years ago could because that has been generally advantageous to our population.</p>
<p>So now fast forward to now, we're smart, we can think about a lot of things, understand things that are going on, we're asking questions about why people have anxiety disorders and others don't.  We can recognize that there's a difference.  At the same time, we have systems that allow different signals from different parts of the brain overriding eachother, but these systems are more or less sensitive from person to person because of just how they get put together.  So for some people, it takes a lot more contribution from the anticipation of good results from whatever it is you're trying to do to override the fear of something bad happening while you do it than it does for other people. </p>
<p>Most people are within a certain range. Not too anxious, and not too tolerant of risk. Some people fall a little further out so that it's noticable, and some people are so far out that it becomes obvious that it affects their ability to function. </p>
<p>Then you have the fact that our forebrain still goes and messes things up.  A big part of how we handle fear, stress, anxiety is based on how we recall memories. When we associate something with a stressful memory or conceptualization, it triggers that stress response, which then becomes a memory itself.  You can start to become anxious about becoming anxious essentially. So not only do we have the &quot;how your brain happened to grow?&quot; part of the equation, we have the &quot;what have you learned?&quot; part of the equation as well, and I think the majority of people can develop anxiety issues through experience.  Those that can't would be the ones whose brains are the most resilient to that, and who might start to have problems with ignoring risks.</p>
<p>But essentially, some people are going to have anxiety disorders no matter what they do because that's the way they're wired.  Many more people will have anxiety disorders through a combination of experience that triggers a sort of self-perpetuating effect and possibly a minor predisposition to it based on their neurology.  Many people will have no anxiety disorder because they've not been exposed to that sort of experience that triggers them, but could develop it under other circumstances, and few others might be very unlikely to experience anxiety, even under circumstances where it would be expected or beneficial. </p>
<p>If you do suffer from anxiety disorders, you can manage it with drugs that affect the way your brain handles those hormones in your brain, or you can learn how to break that self-feeding cycle and learn how to avoid triggering it.  However, depending on what's the cause, one or the other might be a better or worse choice.  If your issue is primarily related to an issue with neurotransmitters or receptors, it might be not enough to just learn to avoid triggers.  </p>
<p>But despite all of this, we're still really not very good at understanding or manipulating our brains.  It's hard to tell whether it's one thing or another that's causing it in any person, and treatment is often a bit of trial and error and going with the least worst solution. </p>
<p>But when we label something as &quot;anxiety disorder&quot; it sounds like it's some kind of problem like chicken pox with an obvious cause.  But in reality it's more like asking why some people have height deficiency disorder and others don't, where you define &quot;height deficiency disorder&quot; as when a man is shorter than 5'8&quot;. The reality is that everyone's just a different height, some people are 5'6&quot;, some are 5'7&quot;, some are 5'8&quot;, some are 5'9&quot;.  Some people are 4 feet tall, and some people are 7.  Some people are short because of malnutrition, and some people are very tall because of a hormonal problem. Sometimes it's genetics. Some are tall with long legs, some are tall with a long back.  But in the end, regardless of the cause, some people hit their heads on door frames.  </p>
<p>People have an anxiety disorder for different reasons. Unreasonable anxiety comes from the interplay of numerous systems, including your experiences. It's really hard to tell specifically why in any individual.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have severe ptsd and anxiety disorder. and this is how my psycgologist explained anxiety disorder to me (to pursuade me to do physical therapy):
&quot;People have a fright and fight mode, and a usual relaxed mode. In fright and fight mode you are alert and ready for a bad situation to occur any moment, where as when you feel safe, you usually are in the relaxed mode. </p>
<p>They trigger different areas of the brain. Most people can switch modes according to situation. Some people though, have trouble switching. They are always on a fright and fight mode and it becomes a disorder as you lost functionality to switch back according to situation. This can be hormonal, or in your (my) case, habitual.</p>
<p>Medication is less effective on you (knocks me out 20 hours a day without an effect that worths it) as it is not hormonal. Physical therapy would help better as it is an exercise to train your body to find ways to control the modes. It helps you to actually re-evaluate the situation instead of straight up panicking, so you can recognize that you are safe and helps you to have better access to your relax-mode self.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
