		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  The ringing is actually coming from your brain and not your ear.</p>
<p>When hair cells in the inner ear get damaged, the brain creates an annoying &quot;eeee&quot; sound becausd it's missing that proper connection.</p>
<p>There have been people who had severe tinnitus and got their auditory nerve, from their hearing organ to their brain, cut hoping itâ€™ll make the ringing go away.  And they still had tinnitus, if not worse. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some earlier attempts at curing tinnitus involved severing the auditory nerve completely, essentially causing the person to go deaf if they weren't already, and this only cured tinnitus about half the time.</p>
<p>So yes, not only is it possible for deaf people to have tinnitus, it is possible for someone with tinnitus to become deaf and still retain the tinnitus.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is absolutely possible for an individual with severe or complete hearing loss to also have tinnitus. It is true that this ringing or extra noise that you hear in your ear comes from the brain. You see, the brain is lacking the stimuli of sound in some way, depending on what part of your ear is damaged. A person could be deaf since birth meaning it's probably a conductive hearing loss (there's an issue with the anatomy of the ear). Or a person could go deaf or lose hearing at any point in their life, this could be due to conductive hearing loss, explained above, or sensorineural hearing loss (which is usually caused my some sort of noise trauma). </p>
<p>Either way, the brain is not getting any noise stimuli or not getting certain frequencies of noise stimuli. Because of this, the brain creates a noise to fill that &quot;gap&quot; of missing stimuli. This noise can take many forms and is only &quot;heard&quot; by the individual. The noise can be present in both ears, in one ear or the other, or in both ears with one worse than the other (the latter sometimes calls for an MRI). </p>
<p>Is there a solution?
Yes. For those who have hearing loss, often times just a hearing aid alone can resolve the issue. If that does not work, a hearing aid with a tinnitus masker may be implemented.
There are also supplements and &quot;tinnitus formulas&quot; which work for some but not all. One is Arches Tinnitus Formula.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is.  Keep in mind that all of the explanations of tinnitus are merely theories, though the prevailing one seems to be the idea that the brain compensates/produces the lack of input from the cochlea.  People with high frequency hearing loss tend to hear high pitched tinnitus, and those with low frequency experience lower frequency sounds.  Masking techniques can be helpful, such as white noise machines when it's quiet or  amplification (usually with hearing aids) if the hearing loss if significant enough to warrant it.  Tinnitus retraining therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy are specialized techniques that can help reduce the amount of distress/bother that it causes an individual, as can treating underlying anxiety or depression.  There is absolutely no convincing evidence that any over-the-counter &quot;tinnitus remedies&quot; make any significant difference.  I believe most, if not all, of them are just a money grab.</p>
<p>For clarity, I am referring to constant tinnitus.  Pulsatile tinnitus, which can sound like a heartbeat, occurs for a large variety of reasons that are sometimes treatable and sometimes signs of other disease or pathology.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, deaf people can have tinnitus.  People that lose hearing due to a variety of insults will often have tinnitus.  Tinnitus can be so loud for some individuals that it makes it so that they can't sleep and want to die.  For some of these patients (historically), they were deafened in an attempt to help with the tinnitus.  This actually was found to be more likely to make the tinnitus louder!<br />
Hearing restoration will often decrease tinnitus whether through a hearing aid or cochlear implant.  Some cochlear implants are now performed for tinnitus rather than hearing loss, particularly for single-sided hearing loss.<br />
The more complicated question, is whether a person born deaf can have tinnitus.  The answer to this question is yes as well!  Most individuals that are congenitally deaf have some degree of residual hearing.  However, identifying tinnitus is typically difficult to obtain in children.  I do not know what the experience of tinnitus is like for individuals born completely without hearing, but it is presumably similar.
The current theory of tinnitus is that it originates, often in the brainstem, due to the loss of inhibition typically from the cochlea.  The brainstem upregulates, firing off signals that correspond to sound, i.e. tinnitus.  The specifics are much more complicated. </p>
<p>There are many types of tinnitus, for example tinnitus where the volume is affected by biting, or objective tinnitus that can be heard with a stethoscope and may be associated with a carotid aneurysm, for example.  </p>
