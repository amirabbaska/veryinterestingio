		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really cool question.</p>
<p>There seems to be an absence of research supporting the idea that these animals experience recognizable dementia; for example, this Society for Neuroscience conference abstract seems to suggest that new neurons continue to be born in turtle brains throughout the entire lifespan (<a href="http://eurekamag.com/research/035/470/035470297.php#close" target="_blank">http://eurekamag.com/research/035/470/035470297.php#close</a>) and dolphins, another large-brained and long-lived animal, retain social memories for decades, or up to 75-100% of their average lifespan (<a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1768/20131726?utm_source=HEADS-UP+9+-+15+AUG+2013&utm_campaign=SMC+Heads-Up&utm_medium=socialshare" target="_blank">http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1768/20131726?utm_source=HEADS-UP+9+-+15+AUG+2013&utm_campaign=SMC+Heads-Up&utm_medium=socialshare</a>).  Both of these are measures that are associated with cognitive and neuronal health.</p>
<p>However, these results don't definitively say that dementia never occurs in these or similar species, and neither one examines dementia directly.</p>
<p>One thing that future research in this area might help clarify, is what are the evolutionary factors that promote dementia and disorders that involve dementia.  I would expect dementia to be like cancer; risk does go up with age, but there are also selection pressures and the physiological mechanisms they act upon that can change that level of risk.  One reason I think bees are so interesting, for example, is that they actually show better learning and memory and more brain growth late in their lifespans, because that's when they perform the most learning-intensive behaviors, like foraging for food.  Studying those organisms that are long-lived but don't experience dementia, if they are out there, could help us find ways to preserve brain health in older humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To tack on to this fantastic question; how would one determine that an animal such as a turtle or whale was suffering from dementia though? Is it safe to assume that any animal would be affected by dementia in the same way that a human would? Is it possible that they do suffer from forms of dementia but it is more sudden and leads to death quicker than in humans?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(Herpetologist here) - This is a fascinating question! In terms of turtles, anything to do with age is ridiculously difficult to study, given that most turtles will outlive the researchers studying them (twice over, in some cases), and turtles do not show obvious signs of age like people, dogs, or cats. A shell worn smooth is often the only indication that a turtle is &quot;old&quot; and depending on the individual and the species, that could be anywhere from 30 to 100+ years. </p>
<p>It may come as a surprise, but some tortoises actually have very well developed social activities (see C.Guyer's work on <em>G.polyphemus</em> [<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=CKr6AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA108&lpg=PA108&dq=guyer+social+networks+tortoises&source=bl&ots=EbjrtRy05F&sig=KO6keMu__8HXSay6GvuN7EyuMIc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAGoVChMIntqWnL6HyQIVgiomCh0efgf_#v=onepage&q=guyer%20social%20networks%20tortoises&f=false" target="_blank">https://books.google.com/books?id=CKr6AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA108&lpg=PA108&dq=guyer+social+networks+tortoises&source=bl&ots=EbjrtRy05F&sig=KO6keMu__8HXSay6GvuN7EyuMIc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAGoVChMIntqWnL6HyQIVgiomCh0efgf_#v=onepage&q=guyer%20social%20networks%20tortoises&f=false</a> )]. To really get at the question of dementia, we would have to keep tabs on individual tortoises (with known ages) and their social lives for a very long period of time to see if any of this sociality begins to degrade as they age. If we observed animals that we know to be 'old' exhibiting altered or strange behavior, it could be an indication that something dementia-like might be occurring. </p>
<p>Other people have pointed out that turtles generally do not exhibit what's called 'reproductive senescence' (becoming less able to reproduce with age), which means they have the ability to reproduce until they die. This is an adaptation to deal with really high juvenile mortality - their eggs/young have such a low chance of surviving that to keep their species alive, they've adapted to live a long time and keep reproducing for a long time to offset the fact that most baby turtles do not survive. It may be that, as far as we can tell (again, the research to prove/disprove it doesn't really exist) because turtles still have to be healthy enough to continue reproducing even in old age that there would be no evolutionary pressure to get something like dementia. </p>
<p>They've made it this far (157 million years!)([<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle</a>]) so you'd think they've got to be doing something right. </p>
<p>Edit: added the &quot;do not&quot; before reproductive senescence. Big difference! Also, clarified definition of reproductive senescence. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
