But if you turn on a second, identical light, the difference in brightness is almost indiscernible. Why? Is it just because of our pupils constricting more, or is something else happening?</p></div></div>

<p>This is why sound volume is measured in decibels. I am not sure if luminosity has a logarithmic unit, though.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your eyes and brain together perceive differences in light logarithmically, not linearly. This is also true for many other things, like sound intensity. Every time you double the amount of light, it feels like you're adding the same amount of light.</p>
<p>This means that going from 2 light bulbs to 4 feels like the same difference as going from 100 light bulbs to 200. So if you start with 100 light bulbs lit, you wouldn't even notice if you lit 1 more, or even 10 more. But if you only started with 1, you'd definitely notice an additional one. And going from total darkness to 1 light bulb is a huge difference, that can't be matched by anything else (infinite difference).</p>
<p>For this reason, in photography, light is measured in &quot;stops&quot; to make it easy to talk about and measure relative quantities of light. Gaining 1 extra stop of light means you have doubled the amount of light. To us, adding 1 stop of light always feels like adding the same amount of light, regardless of how bright the original scene is.</p>
<p>On a mildly cloudy day, when the sun comes out just a little bit, you could be roughly gaining 1 stop. In a room lit by 1 light bulb, adding a second identical bulb also gets you 1 extra stop. To get another stop, you'd now need 4 bulbs. And for yet another stop, 8, etc...</p>
