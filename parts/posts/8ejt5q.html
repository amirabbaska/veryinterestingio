		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of our late infancy/teenager years development happen on inhibitors: toddlers learn they have to inhibit the defecation reflex for instance. As we grow up, many of these reflexes are inhibited, such as crying when hurt or sad, laughing (eg. when wanting to laugh at an inconvenient time), sexuality, speech (some children just can't shut up :)) etc.</p>
<p>That's why we can see grown men crying, become violent or simply obnoxious when drinking alcohol. It's a disinhibitor.</p>
<p>I can already see it with my 5yo boy: when he hurts himself he tries to hold it until he determines if his booboo really hurts or if it's gonna pass. He learned this himself because we never asked him to stop crying after a booboo. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I saw a documentary, possibly bbc, that was suggested that some childrens' response to minor injury and pain (crying/screaming/dealing with it eg) could be a learned response. I think the point was that if a parent continually reacted over protectively when their child was superficially hurt the child would be conditioned to react in a similar way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crying is a distress sound we make, as social animals it's used to alert other members of our pack to the fact that we are in distress/danger ect. Children do it more often because they need to inform their parents when they are in distress because they have no way to dictate themselves weather or not something is a small or huge injury/danger, so it's just safer to inform the pack at every little thing. </p>
<p>As we grow older we gain the knowledge to dictate weather or not we would need help from our pack members, so crying (ie, distress calls) are only used when we've become overwhelmed to the point that we cannot handle the situation ourselves, which is why it is usually involuntary. </p>
<p>So if you were to get a stubbed toe or scraped knee, you probably wouldn't cry, shouting and cursing is cathartic and known to help relieve pain, but it isn't necessarily a distress call, though people nearby will certainly know something is up. Though if you were to mangle your arm, or get trapped in a burning building, you'd probably be screaming and loudly sobbing because at that point even your subconscious is aware that you cannot possibly handle that situation on your own, and that your life is probably in serious danger. </p>
<p>TL;DR: it's an evolutionary advantage, baby humans are very weak</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A adult doesnâ€™t cry because no help will come. We curse and yell and fix it ourselves. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My kid has 3 moods.</p>
<p>Happy, obviously my favorite.</p>
<p>'Normal', just chilling, doing his thing.</p>
<p>'everything makes me cry', he's not hurt, or frightened. Just literally everything makes him cry. There is also a difference when they get hurt, I think it's more between pain and shock.  You can tell when something might have hurt a little bit, but was more surprising than anything.  </p>
<p>Then there is the cry/screech of when they are in real pain. The poor little guy can't walk yet, but pulls himself up onto everything.  We have those Ikea shelves in his play room, and he discovered he can reach the third shelf... So naturally everything must go on, and subsequently come off that row.</p>
<p>He slipped, and bonked his cheek into the second shelf.  His worst accident yet, he had a little line bruise on his cheek for 3 days.</p>
<p>His face though... It couldn't have contorted  less in slow motion for me.  I knew that HAD to hurt.  It went from shock/awe, into this little scrunched-up-super-pissed-baby .... Wait for it .... BAM.  Screeches from the bottomless depths of hell.  I couldn't help but laugh as i picked him up.  There was zero comfort for about 3 minutes.  Just a pissed baby who didn't understand this new pain.</p>
<p>So, in my experience, it's just one of their major emotions.  Basically, if it's negative in almost any way... They'll cry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
