		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real answer is: we don't know, but it's likely heavily influences differences in hormones and differences in how disease presents itself.   </p>
<p>But the more illustrating answer is that (as a population) that in many respects per-menopausal women (i.e. menstruating women) often not only get different diseases/issues at different rates, but they also present with different symptoms when they do get them. From insomnia, to heart disease, to pain experience/tolerance. When women enter into menopause their symptoms and experience for many disease start to resemble those of men (as a population). ^(1)</p>
<p>This isn't just true for actual disease, but symptoms as well. Since women are different, then their symptoms are likely different as well (difference in hormones leads to difference in how the CVD forms)^(2). We can see this by the fact that even after menopause it takes decades for women to &quot;catch&quot; men in a lot of these diseases (especially CVD)^(1).  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you get people who have had heart attacks to write down their symptoms, and then annonymize the descriptions, it's usually pretty hard to distinguish between the male and female descriptions.  In an absolute, overall sense, the symptoms are broadly the same.</p>
<p>For men, the most prominent symptoms TEND to be crushing pain in the chest and shortness of breath, whereas for women, the most prominent TEND to be fatigue, a feeling of tightness or binding in the chest, and often moderate pain, like unusually severe heartburn, lower in the chest, closer to the stomach.  All of these are reported in both genders, and usually most of them appear in most cases to one degree or another.  The primary differences are in which ones are perceived as being most prominent.</p>
<p>Exactly WHY this should be really isn't clear.  It used to be that women were thought to have a higher threshold of pain than men, and that was the basis of the difference, but recent studies have demonstrated that, if anything, men have the higher pain threshold.  Even if we dismiss that because of potential bias (&quot;take the pain like a man!&quot;) and say that the pain threshold across genders is essentially equal, we still don't know why men and women should experience heart attacks differently.</p>
<hr />
<p>As a side note, it'd be really interesting to find transgender people who have had heart attacks before and after hormone therapy and see if there's any difference between their experiences of their heart attacks both before and after their transition.</p>
<p>But there are probably like, four such people in the world, so phooey.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
