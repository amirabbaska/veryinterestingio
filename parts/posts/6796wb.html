		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pills get lodged in valleculae of the throat, people aren't imagining it at all. For example here - <a href="http://www.healthcaremagic.com/search/pill-stuck-in-valleculae" target="_blank">http://www.healthcaremagic.com/search/pill-stuck-in-valleculae</a> </p>
<p>It's a totally different feeling to a pill going down uncomfortably. It doesn't go down. You know it's stuck and you can't dislodge it with water. It's happened to me twice because I'm a lazy bastard and I take pills dry like some kind of pathetic hard man who thinks he knows better than everyone else.</p>
<p>Anyway it's not nice, and depending on what's in the tablet you might not want it anywhere near your throat. I've managed to dislodge them with food before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a nurse practitioner: due the way the nerves of your throats are placed, sometimes when something is stuck low in your esophagus, just above your stomach, it will feel like it is actually stuck much higher in your throat.</p>
<p>She told this to a patient as we went through a procedure that involved swallowing barium, a thick, pasty substance.  the patient kept saying was getting caught in their throat. Since it was a fluorography exam (x-ray), we could actually see it was not in the throat at all.</p>
<p>I never followed up on the research, but it has always made sense to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! So im a PA working in interventiona' radiology and fluoroscopy. I do barium swallow studies on people with this complaint everyday! More often than not the pill is actually delayed or stuck in the lower esophagus and the sensation is referred upwards from there! rarely is it ever actually caught in the upper portion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few possibilities. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The pill actually is lodged. Fairly uncommon but some people have difficulties swallowing pills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pill rubbed/scratched against the back of your throat and you're feeling that, not the pill.</p>
</li>
<li>Psychosomatic. There's no pill but the thought/idea/fear of the pill getting lodged is causing the sensation.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes psychosomatic, sometimes the pill is actually stuck - especially if you dry swallow pills. I'll go ahead and second u/zimtamslam and say ALWAYS take pills with water. We have a family friend who dry swallowed a pill, which proceeded to burn a hole completely through her esophagus :(</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
