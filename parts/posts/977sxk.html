		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vast majority of transactions don't involve the security code. The magnetic strip of the card doesn't have it and if you imprint the card you won't get a copy of it</p>
<p>This makes the security code actually somewhat secure since it's less likely to get picked up during everyday transactions. It's only used in transactions where the card isn't present</p>
<p>It's not great but it's good enough. No point trying to make a perfect security system, none exist</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There actually at least two verification codes. There's the one you see, for phone/online orders (CVV2). The magnetic stripe contains another one for swipe purchases (CVV1].</p>
<p>Merchants aren't supposed to store these numbers. So if their db gets hacked, the credit card numbers wouldn't necessarily be usable.</p>
<p>But it's a pretty weak security system, which is why there's a push to switch to chip cards. But that only protects card present purchases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the verification code is only printed on the card nowhere else, so the assumption is that if you have the code it because you have the card</p>
<p>a security tip is to memorize the code and put a sticker over the verification code on the card so someone handling you card can't see it</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If someone managed to get your entire CC number, they'd be able to make all kinds of online purchases.</p>
<p>With the current system, even if they knew your CC number, they wouldn't be able to make purchases without the CVV as well.</p>
<p>It's like a very light form of 2 step verification.</p>
<p>Also online vendors cannot save any data about the CVV, so it prevents like an employee of Amazon from looking at your card info and making fraudulent purchases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most effective anti-fraud systems now are more about monitoring someone's spending habits than using complex systems to safeguard them. The little code as others have said is not passed along when scanning the card, and is only used online. That means that say, if you are a victim of a scam where they steal credit card numbers, they cannot use those numbers. It means each card must be targeted specifically in most cases, with some kind of physical access to the card.</p>
<p>Most financial crimes are cyber now, so making something need physical access is a big deal. </p>
<p>But even then, the biggest protection is computer programs that note when you spend money in a way that doesn't seem like you, which is most credit card fraud. So you don't need to go too crazy, you can just have some fairly simple protection on the card. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
