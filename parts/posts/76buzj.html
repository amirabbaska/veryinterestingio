		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two somewhat related properties of the plastic that affect its ability to evaporate water - its specific heat capacity and its thermal conductivity.</p>
<p>With specific heat capacity, that is the amount of energy it takes to heat an object up to a particular temperature.  Plastic has a higher heat capacity (1.67 KJ/Kg K) vs clay (0.92, or 1 for bricks (<a href="https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/specific-heat-solids-d_154.html" target="_blank">https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/specific-heat-solids-d_154.html</a>).  This means that if the dishwasher doesn't heat long enough, it is possible for the plastic to actually have a lower temperature than the ceramic.</p>
<p>Second, and more importantly, is the thermal conductivity.  This is the ability of an object to conduct heat through itself.  This means that even though one side of an object is 100Â°C, the other side could be room temperature if conductivity is poor (think of home insulation).  Plastics generally have really bad conductivity.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html" target="_blank">https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html</a> shows HDPE has a thermal conductivity of 0.42-0.51 W/mK .  Ceramics are difficult to pin down...there are a lot of variations on what type of ceramic plate you have, but the value for slate is 2.01, sandstone is 1.7, and even Pyrex is 1.005 - all higher than HDPE.  </p>
<p>This means that there is more energy moving THROUGH the material and that the time it takes to heat up is less as conductivity is higher.  There is less resistance to getting warm and absorbing all the energy its specific heat capacity wants.  It takes energy to evaporate water, and higher thermal conductivity allows the container/plate to recover that lost energy faster.</p>
<p>A great example of how conductivity can really matter is if you put a stainless steel pot and a vacuum insulated container in the dishwasher.  They are made of the same material (same specific heat), but the container is insulated solely because of its shape, which helps prevent heat getting to the inside and reduces conductivity.  The vacuum insulated container may come out wet on the inside (depending on how you placed it in there).</p>
<p>Edit - okay, I realize I was kind of high level, sorry.</p>
<p>The point is that some things move heat faster than others, and water evaporating takes heat away from the dish. Ceramic replaces the lost heat faster, so it can evaporate the next drop of water faster. </p>
<p>Edit 2 - thank you /u/unclefishbits for the gold! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know others are talking about heat capacity and stuff, but in my dishwasher everything that's flat gets dry; everything that's curved somehow does not. For example, I put my ceramic coffee mugs into the rack upside down, and the bottoms, which are slightly concave, are still wet when I pull them out. My ceramic plates I put it on edge and are dry. My tubberware, like my coffee mugs, aren't edge down, and the water catches in the nooks and crannies in the same way.</p>
<p>The shape of an edge-down dish or flat surface allows the water to spread out, which gives it more surface area to evaporate or plain drip off. When there's a curve to catch water, like the lip under a tubberware edge, the water can &quot;pile up&quot; on top of itself, so it takes many times longer to evaporate. At least in my dishwasher, those are the areas where water accumulates for me, regardless of the dish's material.</p>
<p>Edit: If we're going to talk heat capacities, water has the highest heat capacity of any of these materials by a considerable margin, so merely the surface-to-surface contact of water with a dish, whether plastic or glass or ceramic, isn't going to mean as much if the water is stacked up in a groove insulating itself. The surface area:volume should be the greatest factor, imo. The small difference in time the water's contact layer is exposed to a glass's higher temperature before plastic reaches about the same temperature will play a minimal role in comparison. But that's just my speculation. It'd be interesting to put a plastic plate into a dishwasher, with the same shape as a ceramic/glass plate, and see. My speculation is all 3 would be dry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good answers already.</p>
<p>Stainless steel tub dishwashers don't generally use a heating element to dry.  The steel walls cool faster than ceramics, pots and glass and the water is naturally condensed on the walls and drained.  </p>
<p>Because it has a lower heat conductivity the plastic loses heat faster than the walls of the tub and doesn't allow for the convection drying to happen.</p>
<p>Also don't buy a dishwasher that pops it's own door open when finished unless it's installed directly under stone.  It will ruin your cabinets.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ceramic plates and glasses have a higher heat capacity - they can &quot;hold&quot; more heat, which is why they are hot when you take them straight out of the washer.  Because they're hotter, they cause the water on their surface to evaporate.</p>
<p>Plastic is less dense and has a lower heat capacity, so the water that collects on them doesn't evaporate as easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Specific heat isn't going to do anything noticeable about evaporating water out of the dishwasher like most people are commenting. Everything gets to be the same temp so specific heat and heat capacity won't really matter. </p>
<p>Plastic is hydrophobic so water beads on the surface, while glass and ceramics are hydrophilic so water beads much smaller. Water evaporates faster when in smaller beads because it has more surface area. </p>
<p>Next time you do dishes don't have the dry cycle on and look at the dishes right away. The plates and glasses are covered in a thin sheet of water while plastics are covered in large beads. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
