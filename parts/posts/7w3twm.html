		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They use potassium chloride.   </p>
<p>I also believe there are some sodium chloride based salts that are very coarse so there will be less sodium per tablespoon or whatever.  It’ll still be the same amount per weight.  It’s just that less will fit in a tablespoon due to its coarseness. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt substitutes are usually a combination predominated by KCl and a smaller amount of NaCl with a few extra things thrown in to normalize the flavor a bit.</p>
<p>You can actually directly use KCl if you'd like (please be careful; the majority sold wholesale is &quot;stump killer&quot; grade and not suitable for consumption), but the flavor is significantly more bitter.</p>
<p>I personally like to use a split that's around 40% KCl, 40% NaCl, 15% MSG and 5% potassium tartarate (&quot;cream of tartar&quot;). It's not the same flavor, but I've actually grown to like it better.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that absolute sodium intake has been repeatedly debunked by contemporary studies as a universal problem. Recommendations you see should really only be considered relevant if you're already hypertensive and sensitive to the transient increase from plasma sodium--which gets down to a small portion of the population.</p>
<p>Electrolyte balance (particularly K/Na ratio, which boils down to K intake) appears to be much more relevant to general populations. That's best addressed by including a lot of high potassium foods in your diet--shocking, more &quot;eat your vegetables&quot; advice--but subverting the impact of added stuff is always a bonus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In chemical terms, a salt is &quot;any ionic compound that can be formed by the neutralization reaction between an acid and a base&quot;. This is a <em>very</em> broad definition and includes organic and inorganic chemicals, metals and nonmetals, etc. Many (but certainly not all) acids are of the form HA, which dissociates into H^(+) and A^(-) when dissolved in water; similarly, many (but again, not all) bases are of the form BOH, which dissociates into B^(+) and OH^(-). In a neutralization reaction, the H^(+) and OH^(-) bind to each other to make water (H2O), and A^(-) and B^(+) combine to make a salt, AB. (You can also get salts from many other types of reactions, but this is the definition.)</p>
<p>When people talk about &quot;salt&quot; they typically mean &quot;table salt&quot;, which is the common name for sodium chloride (NaCl, which can be produced by neutralizing hydrochloric acid (HCl) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)), but some other salts can be used instead for people who want to reduce their sodium intake. The most common alternative salt is potassium chloride (KCl) because it has a very similar taste and is safe to consume. Many other salts are toxic, however.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So they are saying low &quot;this kind of salt&quot; salt. There are many kinda of salt that we eat. Any time you see electrolytes advertised they 99% of the time mean salt. Take Gatorade/Powerade, it's just table salt like you mentioned, and mostly potassium in some form and some other minor salts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
