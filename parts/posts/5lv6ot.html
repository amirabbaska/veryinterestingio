What gives? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cost of crude is only about 65-75% of what goes into the cost of gasoline (in the US).  The rest is from refining, transporting, marketing and taxes.  Since the rests of those costs haven't changed (much), just decreasing the cost of crude will only decrease the price of gas by about 2/3rd that amount.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cost of oil is but one cost of producing gas. The price you pay for gas also covers labor, electricity, distribution, transportation, real estate, marketing, taxes, etc. Even though the cost of oil is a significant portion of the price of gas, it's not the only expense. A percentage reduction in the cost of oil will not produce an equal percentage reduction in the price of gas. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three mostly fixed costs with regard to gasoline:</p>
<ul>
<li>refining, about 60 cents a gallon</li>
<li>marketing and distribution, about 20 cents a gallon</li>
<li>taxes, up to 50 cents a gallon in the US</li>
</ul>
<p>That gives you floor of about $1.30 a gallon.  That means when the price at the pump falls from $3 to $2,  the part depending on oil prices is falling from $1.70 to $0.70 in the states with the highest tax rates, more than a 50% reduction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gasoline is a bit scarcer than wholesale crude oil, because it has to go through refineries, and then get distributed, and then get sold at retail outlets.</p>
<p>Even if crude oil is plentiful, any bottleneck in the refining or distribution system can drive up the price of gasoline.</p>
<p>And when the price of crude oil falls, it takes some time for competition to force the price of retail gasoline down. Generally no one wants to be the first to slash prices, when everyone's making a nice profit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the costs of producing gasoline are separate from the price of crude oil, which is the price you are thinking of.  Crude oil is what comes out of the ground.  To get at it, you have to drill.  Drilling costs money.  That cost doesn't really drop based on the value of the crude oil; it is dependent on the costs of labor, machinery, bits, etc...  Once out of the ground, the crude oil has to be transported to a refinery.  Getting it there costs money, either paying trucks or ships or paying for access to pipelines (usually a combination of the two).  The cost of transportation does depend a little on the price of gas, but also depends on the costs of labor/equipment/pipeline access, etc....  Once the crude oil is at the refinery, it gets refined into the various oil products, including gasoline.  That costs money.  That cost doesn't totally depend on the value of crude oil, but rather on the capacity of refining and the supply of oil.  Once it is refined into gasoline, it need to be transported to various gas stations around the world.  That cost depends a little on the price of gas, but also on the cost of labor/equipment.  Finally, governments tax gas like crazy.  Those taxes don't go down when the price of crude oil goes down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
