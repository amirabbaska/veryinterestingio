		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking you have two main areas they can differ in. </p>
<p>The first relates to sativa / indica. Sativa has more of a &quot;high&quot;, a buzzy, slightly awake feeling. More like coffee than alcohol. Indicas have a much heavier high, with more body effects, more of a sedating effect, and are a lot more like alcohol than coffee. This is the vast majority of the important difference between strains. Most people favour a hybrid, which just means a semi balanced mix of the two strains.</p>
<p>In terms of what those strains mean at the level of the weed itself, they relate to the levels of delta-9 THC (the principal psychoactive component of weed), and the levels of CBD's (less psychoactive, maybe more medicinally useful, probably more of an impact on body processes). THC is a psychedelic of sorts, CBD's tend to function as a depressant. </p>
<p>The other major thing they vary on is smell / flavour / appearance. Some people prefer super sticky moist buds, others prefer very dry buds (yes this is predominantly due to treatment of the buds post harvest, but the location and structure of THC crystrals on the plant plays a role). They can also smell like nice things - many of the names relate to what they smell like (supposedly). Frankly this whole variance point is close to irrelevant. They all smell predominantly like weed, and post harvest treatment carries more of an effect on the visual + tactile + smell aspects of the weed than the strain itself. The variance in CBD/THC ratios is the critical aspect</p>
<p>EDIT : made it clear post harvest treatment refers primarily to feel + smell aspects of weed</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 3 main factors. THC level, the level of non-THC cannabinoids, and terpene content. THC is the most important cannabinoid, and responsible for the &quot;head high.&quot; CBD is the most oft-cited cannabinoid other than THC and is good for pain relief. One aspect that people rarely mention is that we know that THC and other cannabinoids <em>interact</em> in addition to having their own effects by themselves. CBD makes the high from THC last longer, for instance.</p>
<p>Nobody even seems to know what CBC, CBDv or CBGa do, so we have a lot more science-ing left to do. Most strains have almost 0 CBGa, for instance, but every strain I've ever tested that had more than 0.1% CBGa was <em>dank.</em> Even danker than some strains that tested several points higher in THC. And literally nobody is even talking about CBGa; CBD has only recently gotten mainstream and scientists are just starting to realize terpenes are probably responsible for more than just the taste, too.</p>
<p>In practice, though, cannabinoid levels <em>don't vary that much.</em> I've paid to have over 100 samples lab-tested in my past few years of smoking, and almost all of them have mostly THCa with trace amounts of everything else. 95% of strains are pretty damn similar, and that's because almost all modern weed was descended from a few strains bred in the 80's. You can only mix around Northern Lights/Jack Herer/Kush genetics in so many different goddamn ways.</p>
<p>So how are they grown/modified to be different? Selective breeding; that's it. The whole &quot;indica/sativa&quot; thing is something that shouldn't even be paid attention to. It's not complete nonsense; indicas are clearly a different plant and the nugs are obviously visually different than pure sativas. A pound of indica might have no shake at all, while a pound of sativa could easily have an ounce of shake. Indicas have more red hairs, shorter wider nugs, and tend to be stickier...but the lab results of the cannabinoid profiles just don't back up any huge difference in high. FYI all marijuana in the entire world was originally sativa, except in Northern India/Afghanistan (hence the name &quot;indica&quot;). Afghan weed has been crossbred so much we think of &quot;indica&quot; as an equally common type, but really it's an oddity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to throw some confusion on the fire, there's also Cannabis Ruderalis. It's native to eastern Europe and central Asia. Because of the low THC content though, it's not really consumed recreationally. I have read that it has been gaining popularity as a hybrid with outdoor growers for it's pine like taste and the natural ability to withstand frost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>strains are caused by the dioecious nature of cannabis.  dioecious means that each plant has its own sex.  Male and female plants have to exist for seeds to be made where in monoecious plants, both sexes are present on the plant and can self fertilize.  </p>
<p>because of the sexual reproduction aspect, as well as what the environment does, we are left with individuals better suited for certain environments.  BUT they also can hold genetics locked in (like you or me). Each seed isn't an exact copy of the parents, but merely combination.  </p>
<p>furthermore there are three &quot;species&quot; of cannabis.   That would be cannabis sativa - which is found around the equator naturally,  Cannabis indica - which is found in more temperate but harsh climates
and  the last one is cannabis Ruderalis - which is the &quot;auto flower&quot; variety.  Doesn't grow huge, flowers based on plant age, not photoperiod like sativa and indica.  </p>
<p>SO </p>
<p>you take the sexual nature of cannabis reproduction, you take the significantly different landraces, you take the environment in which its found, and finally you account for human breeding.     </p>
<p>Boom.   Strains.   Just like with dogs, people  travel to find unique genetics, and breed them into our strains.  These genetics can be vigor of the plant, color, terpenes, or cannibinoid content.  Because of how it is, cannabis can be as variable as wine. </p>
<p>if you're super curious, strain hunters is a fucking wicked show.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally, something I know haha. Okay, so, you have to main types sativas and indicas. Sativas have a mental high, while indicas have body highs. Most strains ate hybrids made by selective breeding to different proportions of these highs. The highs compliment each other too so the hybrids do usually have a stronger effect on people. Now, like someone else was saying, harvesting will also effect the type of high (there are 3 main stages in flowering) as well as how the plant was grow (hydro, soil, etc.) but these usually affect potentency  more than anything else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
