		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Home canner here. Yes, there is a chemical reason we don't make all that much banana jam/jelly. Not by itself, anyway. Without getting into too much detail, there are two basic canning methods: water baths and pressure canning. Water baths basically just immerse jars in boiling water for a while, long enough so that the entire contents of the jar reach the boiling point. Pressure canning actually gets the temperature <em>much</em> higher, which you can accomplish with pressure vessels but not with regular pots. </p>
<p>Problem: water bath canning doesn't work for all kinds of food. It only works with foods that have at least a certain level of acidity. Many fruits (including tomatoes) are high-acid, and so can be canned using a water bath. But pretty much all vegetables, not to mention meat, fish, and poultry, are all low acid. To safely can low-acid foods, you either need to use pressure canning or add something to the food to raise the acidity. </p>
<p>Example: the recipe linked by /u/onions_can_be_sweet includes lemon or lime juice. The citric acid in the juice should be enough to do the trick and permit water bath canning. But now it's arguably not just &quot;banana jam&quot;. It's &quot;banana-lime jam&quot; or &quot;banana-lemon jam&quot; or whatever. </p>
<p>So, why not just pressure can it? Well, two reasons. First, it is highly inadvisable to can <em>anything</em> that hasn't been scientifically tested to be safe. And nobody has done the testing to figure out whether and if so under what conditions bananas are safe to pressure can. But second--and I'm going out on a limb a little on this one--it may simply be that bananas don't take to the high temperatures of pressure canning all that well. Not everything does. The trick about the scientific testing is to find a minimum set of standard conditions that produce safe canned food <em>that people still want to eat</em>. Stick anything in a pressure canner for two hours and yeah, I can pretty much guarantee it'll be safe to eat. But that doesn't mean it'd be tasty. I have a sneaking suspicion that running bananas through a pressure canner long enough to ensure food safety would simultaneously render them highly distasteful, if not outright inedible. </p>
<p>For what it's worth, this is why you don't see much in the way of canned pumpkin or squash. It's possible to do this commercially, but for the home canner, there's no safe way of canning those foods that results in something anyone would want to eat. For those foods it has to do with how thick they are when you mash them. Proper canning depends upon liquid circulating throughout the jar to ensure uniform temperature and eliminating pockets where bacteria might hide. Squash puree is so thick (and squash lumps so solid) that that doesn't happen. But unlike meats, which are perfectly edible even after extended periods of pressure canning (though they do take on a distinct &quot;canned&quot; flavor due to basically overcooking them), pumpkin/squash isn't. No one has found any safe and reliable way to can them at home with an acceptable level of quality.</p>
<p>Much the same goes for dairy products. Just. Doesn't. Work. </p>
<p>All of the above aside, there's probably a more basic, historical reason we don't see more canned bananas: they're a relatively recent grocery item. Until the invention of refrigeration, it wasn't really possible to export bananas from the Caribbean to the US. Not on any kind of commercial scale, anyway. So by the time bananas became staples in American grocery stores, refrigeration technology rendered home canning largely obsolete. It's still done by a relatively small number of people as a hobby, but you don't see large numbers of people depending on home canning as a major food source the way you did a century ago. So the period of time in which home canning was a widespread phenomenon (something like 1830 to 1950) and the period of time in which bananas were readily available in the US (maybe 1930 onward) don't really overlap all that much. Certainly not long enough for a culture to have developed around canned bananas. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if it is a chemical or culinary reason, but my mom makes strawberry banana jam and we have to eat it before the others because it gets a weird consistency after about a year. It turns a darker color and gets watery. It still tastes the same though, its just the texture that changes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it also has something to do with not being able to juice bananas easily. And since there's little to no juice in bananas, you can't really make a jam or jelly with them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
