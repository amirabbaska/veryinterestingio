I know from my stage crew days that blue is very hard to produce well, and that the human eye is most adept to see green, and when I did my scuba class they had a chart showing the depths that colors start to fade. This got me thinking however, why does blue light penetrate further than red light in water, shouldn't the same properties of Rayleigh scattering apply?</p></div></div>
