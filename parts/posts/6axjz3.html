The reason why this question was asked was the fact that in various aspects of our culture highly intelligent people are portrayed as emotionless or in a way which implies that they do not know how to deal with emotion. Again, i am not &quot;claiming&quot; anything. As this is a very difficult question with numerous factors at play, i thank everyone for their answers - whether they are right or wrong.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Emotion is nature's decision-making tool.  We try to do things that make us feel positive emotions and we avoid things that make us feel negative emotions.  That's not even just a human thing; animals have emotions and use them to make decisions too!  The problem is that emotion isn't necessarily a <em>good</em> way to make decisions.  If you're smart, you can think of a better way.  For example, I don't feel like waking up early Monday morning and jumping in a metal container with dozens of other tightly-packed people in order to go sit in a chair somewhere downtown and do things other people want me to do, but as an intelligent organism, I know how to plan for the future: I know that if I stop doing this, I will no longer be able to live comfortably, eat what I want, etc.  While I'm still ultimately guided by emotion -- I know what will make me feel positive in the future -- I'm doing things that make me feel less positive <em>now</em>.  Less intelligent organisms don't have that particular capability for reasoning about their actions, but we humans do.</p>
<p>The thing is, the more intelligent we are, the more we can reason about our actions, and therefore, the less we need to rely on simple emotion to make our choices.  If we're intelligent, we understand consequences better, too.  For example, a 3-year-old will suffer negative emotion when his ice cream falls to the floor and will begin to cry.  A more intelligent adult, on the other hand, will only be mildly annoyed at this, because he understands that there will be more ice cream in the future, that he's fortunate to have been able to get ice cream in the first place, that the ice cream just doesn't matter that much compared to other aspects of his life like the fact that he has a loving family and steady income, etc.  (How do you make a 3-year-old cry?  Throw his ice cream on the ground.  How do you make an adult cry?  Kill his family.  Don't try this at home!)  Intelligence gives us a larger set of concerns to worry about, and this makes emotion less important.</p>
<p>Intelligent people still <em>have</em> emotion.  They just have enough perspective to be affected by it less.</p>
<p>That said, there are some people who are just not good at <em>understanding</em> emotion but are often good at certain other things: people with Asperger's.  There are a lot of factors here.  Being not so great at understanding emotion in others means that it's tougher to relate to people, so instead of relating to people, a person with Asperger's might spend time alone.  And what does one do alone that's actually worthwhile?  Learning, of course!  A person with Asperger's may notice that it feels bad to be rejected by peers but it feels good to learn new things in whatever subject, so he'll use his emotions -- which he <em>feels</em>, even if maybe he can't tell what other people are feeling -- and do the thing that gives him pleasure: learning.  As a result, everyone knows that one dude from grade school who's very smart but has no friends, and the stereotype spreads.  By the way, you don't need to have Asperger's to have trouble relating with peers; intelligent people often have trouble as well simply because their interests are different.  An especially intelligent person may be excited by learning new things in math, for example, while a more typical person may just not care about that.  That can make it hard to interact.</p>
<p>Finally, the idea that intelligent people are bad at emotional things also has roots in less intelligent people wanting to feel better about themselves by just making stuff up that sounds like it could be true.  &quot;I may not be as smart as Alice and Bob over there, but I'm obviously much better at emotion than they are, so SUCK IT, Alice and Bob!  YOU SUCK at emotion!  HA HA HA!  I'm better than you at something!  HA HA HA!&quot;  I'm only kind of exaggerating.  If you've been to high school, you probably know people who actually think like this, instinctively trying to find flaws in people who they see as &quot;better&quot; than them somehow, whether in terms of intelligence, athletic skill, appearance, social status, whatever.  (Hopefully they'll have grown out of that kind of pettiness by the time they're adults.)</p>
<p>In any case, very few people -- sociopaths, specifically -- actually have no emotion.  More intelligent people can be just as emotional as less intelligent people; they just don't make decisions on that basis as much because they have better ways to make those decisions!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This perception likely derives from the fact that when you consider a person 'emotional', it's almost certainly because they have poor impulse control.</p>
<p>If someone is constantly flying off the handle, weeping over trivial slights, etc., then they're probably not able to maintain the kind of focus necessary to educate themselves and make decent life decisions.</p>
<p>It's not that intelligent people don't have emotions.  It's just that they don't let those emotions interfere with their lives in a negative way.</p>
<p>Note also that the opposite - true lack of emotions - can be a significant hindrance as well.  People who lack certain emotional responses can be socially isolated because the presumption 'everyone feels like X' simply don't apply to them - and this makes their actions seem curious or even insulting to others.  Emotions also drive us, so a lack of certain emotions can steal motivation.  You may hate the anxiety you feel, but you've probably never considered how much it drives you to succeed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I had to guess, it's because most of the displays of intelligence we see in our society are in professional, academic, or other formal settings. These situations tend to be fairly sterile in terms of emotion. For example, we all grew up in contact with teachers during our schooling. This might be one of the first situations we run across in our lives where we have a non-family interaction with someone who clearly has more knowledge and intelligence. A good teacher isn't going to be emotional most of the time; it just isn't part of the job. Emotions aren't part of the job for other interactions we might have with people who hold specialized knowledge. It's out of character to have a visit with an emotional doctor, or a consultation with an emotional lawyer, or get technical support from an emotional specialist, and so forth. Even a therapist - someone that works with emotions all day - isn't supposed to become emotional during his or her work. To do so would be considered unprofessional.</p>
<p>Emotions are only truly appropriate when you're with friends and family, and here intelligence really isn't so important - at least in my experience. Here, someone being very smart is something akin to someone being very strong. It's a characteristic, something to consider about a person when thinking about him or her as a whole. It's not their most important trait, just a quirk they have. The displays of intelligence you might see in these relationships aren't really clear to the observers because relationships are so subjective.</p>
<p>And so, maybe intelligence is associated with lack of emotion because roles where intelligence are needed also restrict emotions and relationships where emotions are free don't have much need for intelligence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why not bring science into this question? (science has a lot of answers you know) </p>
<p>The ability to regulate, manage, fake, and display emotions appropriate for a situation is known scientifically as [Emotional Intelligence (EI)]( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence</a>).</p>
<p>Now, you're positing that there is a relationship between emotional intelligence and IQ, and so far, scientific studies have found <a href="https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/1647/is-there-a-correlation-between-eq-ei-and-iq" target="_blank">only low correlation</a>.</p>
<p>So it means that for now, emotional intelligence and IQ are unrelated, it doesn't mean having one leads to an inverse of the other or vice versa. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question as I believe this is the exact opposite. And one should not mistake the fact of being able to control how emotions are shown and the fact of feeling those emotions inside.</p>
<p>Working with children with high IQ (to very high IQ) seems to show that they are overloaded with emotions.
See for instance <a href="http://sengifted.org/emotional-intensity-in-gifted-children/" target="_blank">this post</a> on gifted children. So how comes that intelligents children have high level of emotions and lost them when they becomes adults? </p>
<p>When growing up, they learn about controlling, detecting, using emotions. Which may seems as a lack of emotions. But the emotions are not lost.</p>
<p>To take a counter example, many artist (Leonardo da Vinci, Picasso for
Instance) are recognized as being very intelligents and able to express emotions in an incredible levels in their paintings. Many extremely intelligent songwriters are also able to express emotions in the song they write touching millions of people. Poet like Rimbaud are known to be extremely clever and has produced poetry with emotions that have marked many generations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
