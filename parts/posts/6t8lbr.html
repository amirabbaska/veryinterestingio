		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A logarithm is just the inverse of an exponent. Aside from solving equations with exponents in them ( like parabolic trajectories in ballistics for example) they show up in nature a lot). </p>
<p>The natural log, which is the inverse of e, I was able to use to model human vision. Ever try dimming your light bulbs (especially smart bulbs)? Go to 50% brightness. It sure doesn't look 50% as bright. Human light sensitivity is 5logN. If a product design engineer knew what I know and modeled the brightness of a bulb as a logarithmic function, he could make a lightbulb that dimmed by what a person would precieve as 50% halfway through a dimmer knob. </p>
<p>Human hearing is logarithmic too. This is why decibels are 10x higher each time you increase 1 decibel. Sound seems to be twice as loud when you actually 10x the pressure behind it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One cool feature of logarithm is that they can tell you how many digits are in a number. E.x. log base 10 of 6,453 is 3.80976166511, which rounded up is 4. If you use log base 2, you get the number of bits needed to store that number on a computer (because computer data is stored as numbers in a counting system with only two digits -- 0 and 1).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several measurement scales which are logarithmic in nature. The two most popular ones are the Richter scale and decibels.</p>
<p>Each step in the Richter scale represents a 10x increase in power of the earthquake. So a 6.0 is ten times more powerful than a 5.0 which is ten times more powerful than a 4.0 (which means a 6.0 is one hundred times more powerful than a 4.0).</p>
<p>Decibels are similar but the 10x happens every 10 steps. So 30 decibels is ten times more powerful than 20 which is ten times more powerful than 10.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As one example, logs are used in a lot of finance, data, and statistical analysis... which then translate to real world stuff. Let's say you're walking down the street to get a coke at 7/11. The street lights may be placed and time based off this analysis. The 7/11 may have been placed in that spot due to it, the can of coke you pull out's aluminum was mined and manufactured based off analysis of a mountains materials, the line the coke was filled on was based off those.  Then you pay with your credit card, the security and processing of that may be based on logs... and so on</p>
<p>Logs are actually really important in the natural world as well, I hope someone can give a good ELI5 on that, but I tried to do a practical example above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Multiplication is accomplished by adding the logarithms of numbers.  LOG(A)+LOG(B)=LOG(AxB).  So, if you take a stick and mark it with numbers spaced on a logarithmic scale, and take another stick, also marked with numbers on a logarithmic scale, you can multiply (and divide) numbers by measuring lengths with the sticks.  This device is known as a <a href="http://www.ies-math.com/math/java/misc/slide_rule/slide_rule.html" target="_blank">slide rule</a>.  They were all the rage before the invention of the integrated circuit.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, not all computers are digital.  There are analog computers which compute not in bits, but in voltages or hydraulic fluid pressures.  These devices do multiplication, division, etc in a similar way, by adding logarithms.  They are used, for example, on battleship gun controllers,bomber gunsights, guidance systems and the like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
