		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that sunlight causes irreversible changes in the compounds and molecules that gave a material its color in the first place, in a process we call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodegradation" target="_blank">photodegradation</a>. As a result of these changes, the material gradually loses the ability to specifically absorb (and reflect) different parts of the visible spectrum, creating a faded appearance. </p>
<p>To look at things a bit more closely, the color of the dyes used in clothing, colored paper, etc., depends on the detailed arrangement of atoms (and their bonds). For example, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/2-naphthol_orange.svg/2000px-2-naphthol_orange.svg.png" target="_blank">take a look at the structure of this common dye called Orange II</a>. Notice how there are two rings with alternating double bonds (we call these aromatic rings), linked by a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond. This extended ring structure is what allows this compound to strongly absorb blue and green light and to reflect the yellow-red part of the spectrum. Now as you might expect this compound will initially have a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/JeKcT8i.jpg" target="_blank">vivid orange color</a>. However, if you expose this dye it to light, over time this color will go away and you will be left with a product that is mostly clear, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/oKJYzGZ.jpg" target="_blank">as shown here</a>.</p>
<p>So what exactly happened that made the color go away? Well, in one word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochemistry" target="_blank">photochemistry</a> happened, namely light promoted chemical reactions. Now these reactions can be very messy, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/7WbXcNf.jpg" target="_blank">for example here are some of the pathways you may see</a>, and in fact multiple reactions often play out at once. However, what is important is that these reactions destroy the initial chemical structure of the dye and break it up into smaller bits. As a result, a layer of this material will <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ESqtzrY.gif" target="_blank">slowly lose its ability to strongly absorb visible light</a>. </p>
<p>Now this was just one specific example, of course in other cases dyes will have completely different structures and will be destroyed by different mechanisms. However, quite often the net effect of these changes is that they will reduce the ability of molecules and compounds to absorb in the visible part of the spectrum. As a result, as you allow colored materials to be exposed to light (and air), often you will find that over time they will lose their vivid color and will take on a dull off-white appearance. This effect is very similar to old-fashioned chemical bleaching.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photochemist here. </p>
<p>Light is made up of electromagnetic radiation with an energy which DECREASES with INCREASING wavelength. Generally ultraviolet light is higher energy, shorter wavelength light which we can't see and which we are protected from by the ozone layer. Some UV gets through which is UVB and UVA. UVB is the one which causes sunburn and which has enough energy to cause the bonds to break in the synthetic dyes which we use to give things colour (i.e. dyes being the chemicals we use to colour the ink we print things with). This process is photolysis and is usually the first stage in a whole series of chemical reactions which breaks down the highly coloured dyes on the CD covers and effectively <em>bleaches</em> them. Because the CD labels are screened by the glass window and the polystyrene case I would guess that a lot of the UVB would not be getting through to cause this type of photo-fading.</p>
<p>However, another process which is very common (and the primary cause of photofading) is called photo-oxidation and as you might expect it is mostly the result of a reaction of the dyes with oxygen in the air. This reaction is <em>sensitized</em> (made worse by) UVA and visible light absorption by the dye (or pigment) molecules in the printed ink. Now, the reason dyes are so coloured is because their chemical structure allows them to selectively absorb certain colours of visible light, what remains un-absorbed is the colour of the dye as you see it. The example used elsewhere was the orange azo dye which absorbs mostly blue and green light to leave yellow and red (orange) light - the &quot;colour&quot; of the dye as you see it. </p>
<p>Before a dye absorbs light it is said to be in the ground state. When it absorbs light, the electrons in the bonds holding the atoms together gain energy and move from one part of the molecule to another (HOMO to LUMO for the scientists). Once the dye has absorbed the light it is in an &quot;excited state&quot; (teehee!). How long this lasts is called the <em>excited state lifetime</em> and can be relatively long (nanoseconds), especially in the case of fluorescent and phosphorescent dyes. Fluorescent and phosphorescent dyes are the types of dyes used to give that Day-glo effect, for example in high-vis safety vests and signs. An important feature of this <em>excited state</em> is whether it is a <em>triplet</em> or <em>singlet</em> which is a term describing the spin of the excited electron in the molecule. In some dyes (e.g. Rose Bengal) a lot of the excited dyes are in the triplet state - the majority of other dye types are mostly singlet though with a tiny proportion of triplet.</p>
<p>Now, molecular oxygen (O2) is very unusual in that in the ground state it exists as a <em>triplet</em> and in the excited state as a <em>singlet</em>. As this is known as a spin forbidden process it almost <em>never happens by the absorption of light alone</em>. However, if a ground state <em>triplet</em> oxygen molecule were to collide with a dye with an excited <em>triplet</em> state then energy can be transferred to oxygen and the transition from ground state <em>triplet</em> oxygen to excited state <em>singlet</em> oxygen can happen.</p>
<p>Excited state <em>singlet</em> oxygen is a psycho and can be likened to the hulk in the Avengers movie; being very reactive towards anything close by. This can be a dye molecule or it can be water - water can be transformed into peroxide which oxidises and breaks down the nearby dyes. Note also that singlet oxygen in the gas phase has a much longer lifetime (an hour or more) and so even if the process of creating it is very slow or inefficient it can still hang around long enough to react with something.</p>
<p><strong>TL:DR The dyes themselves aggravate oxidative bleaching when they absorb light.</strong></p>
<p>Oh yes, forgot to make the point that the red may seem to have faded more than the others because the blue dye used (or Cyan, from CMYK printing) is almost certainly copper phthalocyanine based which has phenomenal light fastness. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>But not all things fade, and things don't fade at the same rate. The answers I see below talk about dyes. What about pigments? Especially pigments made from gems and crushed stones? If everything fades with light, some of our mountains would be white because the rocks got bleached out, but that's clearly not the case. </p>
<p>So why is it that some things fade and some don't? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
