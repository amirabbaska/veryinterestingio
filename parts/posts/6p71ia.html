		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems unlikely. Pigeons (and chickens) move that way to stabilize their vision. It's really only useful for creatures with a small head-and-neck mass capable of movement fast enough to blur vision otherwise; most other animals use other compensatory systems. (Humans, for example, have auto-tracking eyeballs.)</p>
<p>Dinosaurs, with more body (and head) mass, and thus somewhat smoother movements, would be more likely to use vision stabilization systems common to larger animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Related note: There was actually a study on how dinosaurs walked. It won the Ig Nobel Prize. They glued a stick to a chicken's butt to transform it into a T-Rex and compared the walk of the chicken with and without the stick.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to note a really cool thing that chickens do when they walk.  They keep their head at the same level, more or less.  If a chicken is walking somewhere, and now she has to step up onto a fallen branch or something just a few inches off the ground, she will shorten her neck at the exact instance she steps up, and then lengthens it as soon as she steps off.  So if you observed this chicken only from the top part of her - you would see her head always remains an equal distance from the ground even though her body went up and down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's unlikely, since most larger birds don't seem to do this...ostriches, emus, turkeys, geese, even ducks.  None of those bob their heads consistently while walking.    Chickens do, crows do, pigeons do, but I suspect dinosaurs would be more similar to the larger birds and head bobbing is a specialized thing for small, modern birds.</p>
<p>A counterpoint is that storks and herons seem to sometimes do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnd4V8Gfq4" target="_blank">Not all birds walk with the back and forth motion of their head,</a> but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3cTSlzyzic" target="_blank">it does show up in the most distantly related clade of birds,</a> (as pigeons are neoaves, and ostriches are ratites, which are on opposite branches of Aves), thus seems likely to be ancestral - it is more likely that it evolved once and then was lost in some species rather than it arising multiple times independently. An even better example is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9hqgm1RhPQ" target="_blank">Tinamou,</a> which is also as far away from neoaves as possible and shows head movements followed by freezing.</p>
<p>So yeah, probably at least some species of dinosaurs likely did the head freezing thing.</p>
<p>It is likely that most species did not, though. Velociraptors might have, but Triceratops probably didn't - their heads just weren't built for it.</p>
<p>Things with relatively long necks and small heads would be more likely to do so, so it is likely that at least some theropods did it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
