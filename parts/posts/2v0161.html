		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a physicist, this thread is immensely frustrating. I'm rephrasing a comment i made from the other thread: Everyone else is taking about the amount of kinetic and potential energy. That is NOT temperature, if we're being technical. </p>
<p><strong>THERE IS NO MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE</strong></p>
<p>For a lot of things we experience, temperature can be considered pretty much the same as the amount of kinetic and potential energy. But this breaks down at very low and very high temperatures. And certainly wouldn't make sense with negative temperatures, which I've seen mentioned a few times. </p>
<p>Temperature is thermodynamically define as the inverse of how much the order (entropy) of a system increased with energy, proportional to the energy you put it (T=-dE/dS). Usually, when you add energy to a system, disorder increases. And this makes sense, because things have more energy, and bounce around and make things all disorganized.</p>
<p>At small temperatures, it doesn't take much energy to make things get a lot more disordered. So, the rate of change of disorder relative to the energy is really high, and the inverse of that (the temperature) is really low. </p>
<p>As things get really really hot, adding some energy won't really change much, since it's already really disordered. So this is the opposite of the above example, and temperature is high. </p>
<p>In negative temperature systems, like a laser gain medium, you end up creating systems where things get MORE ordered with the more energy you put in. So with more energy, disorder decreases. However, to get to this point, you first have to cross over the boundary from getting more disorder with more energy to getting less disorder with more energy. Somewhere in between, there is a point where if you add a tiny bit of energy, the disorder doesn't change. Making the ratio of the change in energy to change in disorder (aka the temperature) approach infinity, before becoming negative. </p>
<p>So that means that all the talk of a maximum temperature being about energy density or short wavelengths or Planck is based on speculative misunderstanding of the science. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
