		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Five years ago, I had orbital decompressions for Graves Eye Disease, which causes eyes to swell and be pushed out of their sockets. The surgery allows them to resume a normal position.</p>
<p><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/878672-overview" target="_blank">http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/878672-overview</a></p>
<p>Obviously, my eyes were taken out of my eye sockets and replaced gently and carefully by an expert team of surgeons with assistance from amazing anesthesiologists.</p>
<p>The visual side effects of this surgery took about four months to go away, but it was well worth the hassle, because my vision is now perfect, and the only maintenance I need is a few eye drops morning and night.</p>
<p>Among the side effects that came and went and were most disconcerting--double vision, which was most difficult when I was lap-swimming, because it was hard to tell where I was in relation to other swimmers and the lane markers; driving was impossible, because the road would randomly rise to the sky or the lanes would split apart so that a two lane road would look like it was taking five or six lanes. There is technical terminology for these effects, but the main point I am trying to make here is that even in the best of conditions, with the best medical care on the planet, this was not something anyone would willingly do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just the eye being out of the socket won't stop you seeing, assuming the optic nerve is attached and the eye is relatively undamaged from whatever removed it. The field of view won't really be that much expanded by being outside the socket, but the lack of muscles and support may allow the eye to deform enough that focus could be thrown off. Stretching the optic nerve is also likely to result in visual disturbance (and emotional).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>Would you be able to see: technically if your optic nerve remains intact, yes you could still &quot;see&quot;. The issue would be related to how your brain processes the new visual inputs that don't have a common bearing and are not focused together. Currently, assuming both your eyes are in their respective sockets your brain can piece together all the &quot;images&quot; coming in from the eyes as they are focused on the same thing at any given time. </li>
<li>How would it affect your vision: I'm not sure. Sorry. But my assumption is that since one eye can't focus (lack of muscle control once the eye pops out) you lose depth perception at the minimum. </li>
<li>How would it affect your vision field: you would not be able to see a majority of things on the side of your popped out eye. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your eye pops out of the socket, you've got much bigger problems than wondering if you'll see from the eye when it pops out. There are a crazy amount of connective tissues around the eye holding it in.</p>
<p>However, I can attest to how delicate the optic nerve is. Any damage to it and the vision in that eye is gone. Unless it's like the delicate surgery others have mentioned for Graves disease, if your eye comes out, it's done for. </p>
<p>Source: was shot in the eye with a bb gun. No actual damage to the nerve from the bb but the impact in the tissue behind my eye put some pressure on the nerve for a split second and it was gone forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As long as optical nerves are still intact, yes. Obviously you'll want to get it back in your head but like a lazy eye, your dominant eye will take over. You can't just have your brain looking every which way possible. Dominance is why we exist. You currently have a dominant hand, leg, eye and more. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
