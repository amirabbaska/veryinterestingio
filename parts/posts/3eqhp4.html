		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>American living in Finland with a few observations, probably most of which have been highlighted already.</p>
<p>For me at least whether is a big big  deal for me, once you go 3 months without seeing the sun during the fall/winter, just a peak of it on a clear day makes you feel like smiling the whole day. I remember last winter in Helsinki there was 4 hours of sunlight during the month of Nov. yuck. I'm used to it being cold but still sunny, and I really undervalued that a lot since I've been here. I feel like trapped the whole time and don't feel like doing anything although I am a pretty outgoing person normally. It is the most odd feeling ever. If you can get used to the grayness, then its a great place.</p>
<p>Really hard to learn the language because people just want to speak English, end up having to just be a dick and tell them to speak Finnish, but people respect that. </p>
<p>Have to wait in some outrageous queues sometimes, well, because that's just how things work. Went to the poliisi to get my res. permit one day and waited all day basically just to pick it up. If you are OK with queues then life is good here. </p>
<p>Don't expect to get rich, but don't expect to be left on the side of the road. Its so much more liberating to know you cant just lose your job at the drop of a hat everything is contractual because of the labor unions, so you know that you are safe and it sort of lifts a weight off your shoulders. Con is that as an employer, its really hard to fire someone, and sometimes people can free load their position and just do the minimum because they know the union has their back/ really hard to fire someone.</p>
<p>Been here almost 2 years and don't really have someone I would consider as a good friend. People just keep to themselves and their ways and can be hard to find a circle to belong too, esp without the language skills. Feel a bit lonely a good amount of time. </p>
<p>People follow every single rule which can be annoying sometimes but nice as well. Coming home from a bar you will see people waiting at a crosswalk that is red because they cant go. Even if its 3 am and not a car on the road. :D</p>
<p>These are just a couple of observations. I could go on and on about the differences in lifestyle and systems, but overall I like it here </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Im from Norway and now live in Australia.
First off, the climate is 90% of why I originally wanted to leave but now that ive been properly introduced to another way of living there are a few things that stand out.</p>
<p>For one its refreshing to be able to be more free as a consumer. Scandinavia and scandinavians are just as consumer oriented as the more capitalistic counterparts (for better and for worse, of course) but in Norway you are more restricted by both legislation and a smaller market when choosing where to spend your money.
Many sectors of the market are very closed and rely on the same massive companies that have run the gambit for decades, with no room for up and coming companies with new ideas. This is particularly true for the power and communications sector. Less importantly but still a practical pain, you cant buy a bottle of wine outside the crazy opening hours of spesific government run stores who`s selection is already very limited. </p>
<p>There is also alot of unnecessary babysitting by the government in place in form of unpratical laws and bureaucratic nonsense , on top of crazy prices on things the everyman needs, and has to get through state operated sectors (drivers licences for example). Many times its great that the state is in control of so many aspect of your practical life, but sometimes its a pain in the ass :P </p>
<p>Lastly there is the thing we call &quot;Janteloven&quot;.
Simply summarized, some people tend to stick to their societal &quot;roles&quot; and can be judgemental against people who stick out of the pack and try to do something different. This phenomenon is present everywhere though, im sure. </p>
<p>EDIT: I love how many people have come to Vinmonopolet`s (The state-run alcohol vendor) defence about selection. Ive learned that in fact its quite good. I guess I just felt that with absolutely no competitors in the market there couldn't have been much room for up and coming producers or low budget alternatives, things that the market over here is saturated with. In any case, I was not to sure to mention anything about alcohol at all. Mention that stuff once and suddenly its a &quot;hurr durr&quot; about cheap booze and liquor laws...</p>
<p>Also, this is my first and only comment on reddit, im pretty sure :p</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What comes to Finland: ITT many good points about certain level of xenophobia, exceedingly difficult language (but you'll do fine with english), deadly bureaucracy (do it right or get rekt) and very strict regulations to many other things. Micromanagement at its best.</p>
<p>However one other major issue is the weather and dullness that can follow if you don't have a strong network of friends ready.</p>
<p>If you end up living in some bleak grey apartment building in the middle of nowhere and you are a social person, it can get very boring very fast. First of all the whole winter is dark, very dark. I don't mean like a bit greyish but even in the southern parts the sun goes down at three in the afternoon, and rises up late in the morning. Last winter we had a period of three months of exactly zero sunshine. No, really. The cloud cover didn't give up for three fucking months, so it was either pitch black or grey 24/7. In the northern parts the sun doesn't even come up midwinter. It's night, day and night.</p>
<p>The summers are (mostly) fabulous, and as a contrast to winter it really never gets dark. However the summer can be a total catastrophe, like this one. Only a few days of warmth throughout the whole summer, and mostly rain and cold gusts of wind.</p>
<p>In short: The weather can be pretty much anything at any point of the year, so don't rely on it being your entertainment.</p>
<p>There's a truckload of nature to explore, and there are really no hazards there. One venomous snake that only bites if you practically step on it and call its mother a bitch. Otherwise the wolves, bears and other bitey things are a no-show.</p>
<p>Also no natural disasters except sometimes strong winds and heavy rainfall. No noticeable earthquakes, hurricanes or such.</p>
<p>Anyhow, back to the social life: There's not much happening during winter unless you're at the dead center of the biggest cities in the southern parts, and making friends is not too easy. You'll be amazed how small of a population can be marked as a town on the map. majority of the towns in the north are literally one road with a few shops and a traffic light. Remember, this country is bigger by size compared to many continental European countries, but only around 5 million in population.</p>
<p>If you come here, select a good socially active location to live and make sure you've got people near by you can make friends with. Otherwise you'll end up sitting at home alone, staring at whatever you dislike staring the least.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off - we're not socialists. The model is called social democracy. Basically means that the government seeks to promote social and economic equality within a capitalistic framework.</p>
<p>As for catches..</p>
<p>Many social services, such as healthcare and education, are &quot;free&quot; (subsidized by various taxes). However, the quality of services offered, especially in terms of healthcare, vary greatly. There are long waiting times for a number of treatments, and particularly services offered for the elderly have come under heavy criticism. Still, they're free, which is something we largely take for granted.</p>
<p>Taxes aren't that high (as mentioned elsewhere). Income tax is actually quite low compared to many other countries. There are however <em>a lot</em> of different smaller taxes, and some feel that the government gets a cut from pretty much anything you do or purchase.</p>
<p>Xenophobia is widespread, but very few are open about it. Expect to hear many sentences start with the words &quot;I'm not a racist, but...&quot;. In Sweden, the rather openly immigrant-hostile party &quot;Sverigedemokratarna&quot; is the second largest party.</p>
<p>We're not very open or including. We take a long time to warm up to someone, and overly extrovert people like Americans (extreme generalization, yes) are seen as shallow and fake.</p>
<p>Norway has an archaic policy on alcohol, which in turn contributes to the phenomenon &quot;weekend binging&quot;. Stores are only allowed to sell alcohol until 8 pm on weekdays and 6 pm on Saturdays, and are limited to beer only (or equivalent ABV). Anything stronger can only be sold in government-run outlets called &quot;Vinmonopol&quot; (literally &quot;wine monopoly&quot;). Essentially, this leads to a very unnatural relationship to alcohol, and people get overly shitfaced on weekends, with a lot of alcohol-related violence as a result.</p>
<p>As social democracy greatly emphasizes equality, some feel the principle is taken too far at times. For example, promoting young talents in sports or studies by segmenting teams by skill or offering advanced classes is highly frowned upon. Everyone shall have the right to compete and develop on equal terms.</p>
<p>But all in all, there aren't many catches. We just take shitloads for granted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an American that was an exchange student in Finland for a year, I thought I would weigh in on how I viewed their system. Finland's culture was .... almost too good. People were incredibly content with their way of life. Everyone worked, and there was no defining class system. In school, students were incredibly smart. Even the 'rebels' had a level of intelligence I didn't see in American schools. They were trilingual by 15! </p>
<p>They gave students a choice for high school. They could go to a regular lukio (like a regular high school) or go to a trade school for a specialized skill, like engineering or cooking, etc. I went to the lukio. The schedules were blocked like college, so it gave people the leverage to choose what they wanted to learn, and when. I took a level 1 spanish class thinking my 2 years of spanish in American Highschool would be a benefit. They learned what I had learned in those 2 years in just 3 months! Beyond that I was more than lost. (The class was taught in finnish anyway.. language overload.) Beyond that, they had the opportunity to go to college for free! Even I, as a non citizen, could go if I wanted. </p>
<p>Briefly on healthcare, that is free as well. I only got sick once, and was taken care of immediately, and only paid for my meds. </p>
<p>The winters AREN'T that cold. It is a warm winter caused by the winds of the Baltic Sea. I currently live in Chicago, and the winter I put up with here is far worse than I ever experienced in Finland. I even traveled to Lapland (the upper half of Finland, also known as the arctic circle!) and the weather was quite tolerable. The DOWNSIDE being that in the winter, there is no sun. With no sun, there is depression. And for that, it is a dark time overall. There are a lot of suicides. </p>
<p>Back to an overall generalization from my experience, people are happy. They are content. They rarely get sick, because they go to the sauna 2-3 times a week, and eat home cooked meals daily. (I had pretty much the same meal EVERY day. Boiled potatoes, bread, fish or meat, salad)  Students break bread and drink cider in parks, instead of go to the movies or go shopping. I fondly remember catching hedge hogs in the park with my friends. A DOWNSIDE is that people are generally very shy. It took me months to make friends, because they knew I was foreign. There aren't a lot of tourists there. I was asked often, &quot;Why did you come to Finland?&quot; It wasn't rude, but a lot of them had never even met an American! I found overtime the easiest way to make friends was to buy them a beer. For that, they are content within their own culture, but aren't affected by other cultures around them.</p>
<p>This system WORKS. But why it works, is because of the size. They maybe have 5-6 million people in their country. I don't think this system could work for a size like America. On top of the fact that we are one big melting pot of cultures. I truly love finland and their culture, way of life, etc., and since moving back 7 years ago, have always considered moving there as an adult. The system works! But it is definitely not for everyone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
