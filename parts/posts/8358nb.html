		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's two types. The old style is positional; the new style is electronic.</p>
<p>The positional ones came first and have been around for decades. These type of car mirrors are actually two main parts - a true reflective &quot;mirror&quot; and a plain piece of transparent glass, mounted at a different angle, that's just in front of it.  It relies on how transparent glass still reflects some light, and you can see this when looking up from the base of a skyscraper to see the reflection of the sky's clouds in all of its windows.</p>
<p>During the day, the mirror's in the &quot;NORMAL&quot; position, and you're seeing the reflection of things behind you by looking at the mirror through the glass. It reflects almost all of the light, so you see pretty much 100% of the light that gets to it, which is great during the day. However, at night, you don't want 100% of that light because of the glare that comes with it... so you flip the tab to the &quot;NIGHT&quot; position. This moves the mirror out of alignment with your eyes, but {edit for accuracy} moves the different-angled transparent glass into it so it - and the partial reflection it gives you - stays lined up with your eyes. So the mirror's true reflection points elsewhere now and you only get a fraction of the light that bounces off that different-angled transparent window... and that lower volume of light is much easier to see with now.</p>
<p>The electronic version replaces it with an actual dimming process. The switch in this case causes an electric current to pass through a very thin special film on the mirror that causes it to darken. Think of it like one of those cheap solar-powered calculators where the number 8 has seven segments. To get the number 1, electric power flows to the two rightmost segment, turning them black; the other five are &quot;off&quot; and thus transparent.  In the mirror, applying current to the film just turns the whole surface slightly gray and stops some fraction of the light from being reflected, not turning it outright black but still blocking a lot of the glare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mirror has 2 layers. part of the light reflects off the top layer, the rest off the 2nd layer.</p>
<p>flip the switch and the back layer reflects a bright part of the light upwards, while the front layer stays and reflects a dim reflection in your eyes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 types: prism and electric. The prism mirrors work by reflecting either off a mirror (in the daytime position) or a piece of glass at a different angle (night time). </p>
<p>The electric can work in a number of ways. The one I am most familiar is the &quot;electrochromic fluid&quot;. It's actually 2 pieces of glass with a very thin layer of liquid between the 2 layers of glass. The liquid is held in by epoxy of some kind. There is an electric current that causes the liquid to darken. This is usually automatic based on light sensors picking up the light of the headlights from the car behind you and comparing it to the ambient light. Gentex Corporation makes a version of these that also features a Homelink module to open garage doors and turn on lights and whatnot since the mirror is already wired. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
