		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Considering that both ASA (aspirin) and Ibuprofen both inhibit COX-1 and COX-2, why does chronic use of Ibuprofen increase risk of heart disease whereas ASA is given to patients having a heart attack? I know that ASA is derived from salycilic acid and Ibuprofen is derived from propionic acid. Otherwise, I cannot find a distinctive difference between the two. I've already found information regarding the increased risk of hypertension and peripheral edema with chronic use of ibuprofen. I am specifically looking for what causes the difference between the anti-coagulant effects of ASA and the increased risk for heart disease from Ibuprofen. </p>

<p>Rephrasing of the question 1:</p>
<p>Why is Aspirin more notably considered a &quot;blood thinner&quot; and Ibuprofen an anti-inflammatory even though they inhibit the same enzymes, therefor being capable of completing the same function, but chronic Ibuprofen use has a side effect of increased risk for heart disease?</p>
<p>Rephrasing of the question 2:</p>
<p>What is the difference between aspirin and ibuprofen that causes them to specialize in different treatments? Anti-platelet therapy and pain relief respectively, even though they follow the same biochemical pathway, but both have slightly different adverse effects?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actual ELI5: aspirin loves to hug a platelet and won't let go! So until a new platelet is made, aspirin will continue to help your blood thin, because the way the platelets are hugged by aspirin keeps the blood thin. But ibuprofen likes to only hug until something better comes along, so it won't keep the blood thin for a long time. So you have to keep taking ibuprofen to keep your blood thin. Plus, taking lotsa ibuprofen makes your tummy hurt and your heart tired :C</p>
<p>That's what I gathered from the top comments anyway</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both aspirin and ibuprofen inhibit COX1 &amp; COX2 yes but the degree and mechanism for each is different. </p>
<p>Ibuprofen is a reversible inhibitor of COX2 so you only get the anti-platelet effects when you’re taking it. You have to keep taking high doses to get those anti-platelet benefits but you risk GI ulcers from constantly inhibiting COX1 and heart failure from your kidneys having to continually clear the large amount of drug. </p>
<p>Aspirin is a irreversible inhibitor of COX2 so a little bit goes a long way. Once aspirin inhibits COX2 it is inhibited for the life of the platelet, about 8-9 days, so you don’t need to continually take high doses to reach therapeutic levels like you do with ibuprofen. </p>
<p>EDIT: Aspirin is an irreversible COX 1 inhibitor, and that’s where platelet inhibition/antiplatelet works. My bad!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: Imagine you are having guests over and there is a room that you don't want anyone to go into. If you simply close the door that's ibuprofen. If you lock the door and throw away the key that's asprin.</p>
<p>More details: </p>
<p>Both asprin and ibuprofen affect the production of compounds that contribute to platelet aggregation (clotting). The difference is that asprin is an irreversable inhibitor (locked door, no passsage because people can't open door) while ibuprofen is a reversible inhibitor (closed door, some passage if people choose to open door).</p>
<p>Answers to your specific questions:</p>
<p>1) Both drugs act on COX enzymes (COX-1 AND COX-2) non-selectively. This just means that they affect both COX enzymes <strong>not</strong> that they affect them equally - that's the key point. COX-1 and COX-2 work together to regulate blood clotting. COX-1 promotes clotting (platelet aggregation) COX-2 inhibits it. Main side effects of COX-1 inhibition tend to be gastrointestinal. Main side effects of COX-2 inhibition tend to be cardiovascular. I feel like that answers your questions but I'm going to ramble.</p>
<p>Asprin acts significantly more on COX-1 (anti-clotting effect), and does so irreversably.  Ibuprofen acts on both to similar degrees, or at least not nearly as different as asprin, but reversibly. Inhibition of COX-2 is what is associated with cardivascular risk because you are removing the inhibition of platelet aggregation (basically making platelets more sticky so they clot). That's why COX-2 selective NSAIDs like Vioxx were pulled.</p>
<p>2) It is the difference between irreversible and reversible inhibition as well as the difference in affinity for each COX enzyme. Since asprin acts more on COX-1 its effect is primarily anti-clotting. Ibuprofen acts on COX-1 and COX-2 but because it's inhibition is reversible the anti-clotting effect is lower than asprin but the pain killing effect greater since it acts on COX-2 more than asprin. </p>
<p>The main adverse effects of both asprin and ibuprofen are gastrointestinal like ulcers, stomach bleeding, stomach discomfort and upset. These are caused by inhibiting COX-1. The cardiovascular side effects of ibuprofen are related to COX-2, which asprin acts less on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
