		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the keys to ventriloquism is speaking without moving the lips (the others being movement of the puppet and the puppet's mouth at the right time).</p>
<p>The tricky parts in ventriloquism are labial consonants, or consonants that involve the lips. These include </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>bilabial stops (both lips pressed together) such as &quot;b&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;p&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>labiodental fricatives (blowing air between the upper teeth against the lower lip) such as &quot;f&quot; and &quot;v&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bilabial fricatives (blowing air between the lips) such as &quot;b&quot; and &quot;v&quot; in some Spanish words (non-existent in English)</p>
</li>
<li>linguolabial stops (pressing the tongue against the upper lip) and linguolabial fricatives (blowing air between the tongue and upper lip) - non-existent in most languages</li>
</ul>
<p>So I guess ventriloquism is difficult in languages with a lot of labial consonants and easy in languages with few or no labial consonants. I don't have a full answer but [Wikipedia] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labial_consonant" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labial_consonant</a>) lists the following languages that have no labial consonants: Tlingit, Eyak (both Na-Den√©), Wichita (Caddoan), and the Iroquoian languages except Cherokee.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't really have a full answer, but even in English, certain sounds are modified in ventriloquism to allow them to be pronounced without moving the lips. That's part of why the dummy always speaks in such funny voices (the other part is, well, funny voices). Like apparently, the &quot;m&quot; is really pronounced more like an &quot;n&quot; (because you don't have to close your lips to do an &quot;n&quot;), but if you say it in the right way and it's obvious from context, the listener doesn't notice.</p>
<p>I'd imagine as long as you come up with good techniques for the difficult sounds, almost any language can be spoken without visibly moving your mouth. Perhaps some languages have more frequent lip-sounds, like &quot;b&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;m&quot; etc., so I suppose they'd be harder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I imagine sign languages are not very conducive to ventriloquism.</p>
<p>Languages that involve a lot more use of lip movement would probably be less friendly as well. However, ones that use more tongue movement and other internal anatomy might be easier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
