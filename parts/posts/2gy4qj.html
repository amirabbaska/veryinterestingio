<p>EDIT: Thank you for all the great replies. I would have not imagined this question to become so popular. It's still the top question on the front page of /r/explainlikeimfive. Yesterday, it was on the front page of reddit. I'd like you guys to check out other questions and answer them too. I feel bad for other simpletons like me that have their questions gone unanswered because of the popularity of this question. Please check them out :)</p>
<p>Thank you so much for contributing my to my learning experience! I hope that everyone that participated in this thread learned something. Let's do the same for other questions.</p></div></div>
