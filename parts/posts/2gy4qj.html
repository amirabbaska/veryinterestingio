<p>EDIT: Thank you for all the great replies. I would have not imagined this question to become so popular. It's still the top question on the front page of /r/explainlikeimfive. Yesterday, it was on the front page of reddit. I'd like you guys to check out other questions and answer them too. I feel bad for other simpletons like me that have their questions gone unanswered because of the popularity of this question. Please check them out :)</p>
<p>Thank you so much for contributing my to my learning experience! I hope that everyone that participated in this thread learned something. Let's do the same for other questions.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EOD Tech here. I wanted to chime in because the top replies are mostly wrong.</p>
<p>First of all, to answer your question simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some &quot;firing circuits&quot;, that is, the circuit in an electrically initiated explosive device(i.e., it contains a battery and electric detonator) <strong>can be interrupted in literally any fashion to &quot;render safe&quot; the device.</strong> Firing circuits can be as complex or as simple as <strong>any other type of circuit</strong>. Think of a detonator as a lightbulb, and the device &quot;initiator&quot; as a switch(this can be anything, a cellphone, a pressure plate, a suicide switch, whatever). The only other thing you need to complete the circuit is a power source(a battery, for example) In this type of circuit, <strong>you can cut any wire</strong> and the device <strong>cannot work</strong>. There's still explosives present, and there's still measures that need to be taken for that, and you still have to get rid of it, but <strong>the device will no longer function as designed</strong>. It's simple electronics. For the record, this type of device is very common.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, obviously, someone with a lot of electrical know how can design a much better firing circuit. This is where the skill set of the EOD tech comes into play. It's important to diagnose a circuit completely before taking any action. The most straight forward type of circuit <strong>that cannot simply be interrupted at any point in the circuit</strong> is called a <strong>collapsing circuit</strong>. There are several ways to build a collapsing circuit, including using relays, semi-conductors, and various other electrical engineering techniques. I won't explain this further. Suffice to say it's possible to booby trap a circuit so that if a wire is cut, the device will function. This is a much rarer type of device, but one that EOD tech's still train to handle</p>
</li>
<li>Then, as another commenter has mentioned, there are lots and lots of types of explosive devices that don't use electronics of any kind, and therefore there are no wires to cut and other steps have to be taken depending on the type of device.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: There is a lot more than one type of explosive device. Sometimes, any wire can be cut. Sometimes it can't. Sometimes there are no wires.</p>
<p><strong>addendum</strong>: Generally speaking, an EOD tech will exhaust all other possible measures before physically interacting with a device in any way. We have a lot of tools and techniques at our disposal, and if possible, we won't go anywhere near a device until it's as safe as we can possibly make it remotely. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Terrorist 101: Explosives</p>
<p>Basic explosives - there are explosives and there are blasting caps. Most explosives are made to be relatively safe and inert, so that they don't go BOOM accidentally. Some explosives are sensitive, whereas things like C4 (like clay or play-dough) and diesel-fertilizer mixes are relatively inert, you can hammer them and they won't go off.  To go off they need a sever shock like a blasting cap.</p>
<p>(IIRC Nobel earned his money inventing dynamite, where nitroglycerine was soaked into sawdust or something - nitro will go boom at the least provocation, as dynamite it was relatively safe. Major advance, much money, he eventually felt guilty about the war-like uses and set up the Nobel prizes.)</p>
<p>Blasting caps - the ones I worked with look like the cartridge end of a rifle bullet, with two wires (or a thin plastic tube) coming out one end. The ones with wires are fired by a current running through the wires.  I actually saw people using those plunger-type boxes you see in cartoons. You run the wires far enough away, or around the corner of a cliff, etc - push on the plunger, that spins a magnet which generates a jolt of current - more reliable, no battery needed. Replaced often now by battery and switch. </p>
<p>The other type of blasting cap is explosion-activated. We had stuff called B-line, a long string of explosive with blast speed measured in thousands of feet a second.  Hook this to the second type of blasting cap - tube not wires, and the blast shock from the B-line travels down the thin plastic pipe (about as thick as a pen refill) and sets off the cap.  Not terribly relevant for bombs. </p>
<p>So real simple bomb - stick the blasting cap into the lump of C4.  If you're the moron wearing the suicide vest, you have several bricks flattened around your body with a blasting cap in each. Al Queda liked to add nails, ball bearings, etc. around the C$ for maximum damage... sick fuckers. Create some sort of trigger - as simple as a mechanical alarm clock that closes a switch when it goes off, as complex as a fancy timer that can run for months, or something that sets off based on a cellphone ring, etc. </p>
<p>So real simple - cut the wires to the blasting cap, and while you're at it - yank the cap out of the C4, then if it goes off after that you'll at least only lose a had, maybe an eye or two. </p>
<p>Now I'm Abdul or Liam or Mr. Meinhoff or the Weathermen and my job is to make that more difficult. What do I do? </p>
<p>First trick is &quot;do not disturb&quot;. Something as simple as a pool of mercury in a vial as a switch - if the vial is disturbed, the mercury sloshes, the circuit is closed, Boom! Of course, the stupid thing is the screenwriters for movies like <em>Speed</em> think you can put this do-not-disturb on a bus travelling 60mph over California streets.  It will take the potholes but it knows if you pick it up...</p>
<p>One trick was to build a dam around the bomb, pour liquid nitrogen - freeze any mercury switches, as a bonus, kill any battery with extreme cold. So put a thermocouple in the electronics to alert the trigger to any attempt to freeze it.</p>
<p>Maybe put a switch like the one on a refrigerator door, if you open the bomb box or lift the bomb off the ground, switch goes off -deadman switch idea. But if your bomb disposal expert can't even look inside the box, where's the fun?</p>
<p>To stop the blasting caps being pulled out-  maybe have multiple wires going into the bomb - one set is attached to a deadman switch - pull on the wires, closes the circuit, boom. Maybe have the wires with another deadman switch too - shave the C4 off and uncover the switch, it goes off.  Have electronics that detect the wire being cut (or short-circuited - another trick, shave off the insulation, short the wires together, no current through the cap). There are two or 3 &quot;caps&quot; buried in the C4 - which are real, which are decoy trigger switches? There might even be wires buried in the explosive lump to detect it being manipulated - if you change the shape, the wires touch and boom!</p>
<p>So the problem is - every bomber has their own tricks - is that the cap or a decoy trigger? Looks like the cap wires, but maybe the bomber cup them off a cap to fool you. Maybe the real cap has red and green wires twisted onto it an inch from the cap inside the C4. And so on...</p>
<p>It's a war of escalating tricks. What has the bomber done to prevent disarming? As every programmer will tell you about computer programming, or every engineer about devices - too fancy and it will screw up. Just do what's needed - if they won't find it, don't add too many tricks.  Plus, as mentioned by others - you need practice to be sure it works - so odds are not every bomb will be a one off; the bomber will learn some stuff and repeat it over and over.</p>
<p>There have been spectacular screw-ups. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhrWbvT4UHU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhrWbvT4UHU</a>
But of course, anyone setting a bomb needs to be sure it does not go off when you turn it on - how do you know your deadman switches are not on, from transporting the bomb to its location?  In 1970 the Weathermen were making bombs and blew up a Greenwich village townhouse. The second round of London Tube bombings fizzled, apparently the home-made detonators did not work and the backpacks just went pop. The shoe-bomber failed because his feet sweated too much and his fuse in his shoe would not light. He went through a whole book of matches. According to one news report, the FBI has a perfect imprint of the bombmaker's thumb in the explosive. The underwear bomber simply set fire to his crotch (!!) another fizzle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest type of bomb, like a grenade or a Molotov cocktail, has no wires - you light the fuse and throw it. </p>
<p>A less primitive bomb has a timing device attached to a triggering device that sets off the explosive charge and this one can be defused simply by cutting the wires.</p>
<p>A more sophisticated bomb will use a series of relays to connect the timer to the triggering device, one of which will be a *normally-<strong>closed</strong> relay, one that requires power to keep the circuit open rather than closed. Cutting the wires to this particular relay will cause the relay to close and allow power to go directly to the triggering device. (As bigblueoni pointed out, that's how fail-safe air brakes on big trucks work - the air pressure is not what makes the brakes go on, it's what keeps the brakes from being applied. If the brake system &quot;fails&quot;, it fails to keep the brakes from being applied.)</p>
<p>If you know a little bit about electrical circuits it's easy enough to identify which wires are the ones going to the triggering device and cut those wires. </p>
<p>But if you're the bomb-maker and have gone to the trouble of making a bomb designed to go off if it's tampered with it's easy enough to install multiple circuits, dummy circuits, hidden circuits, motion-triggered circuits connected to flaps or boxes within the bomb package, etc., which makes it impossible to tell which wires do what. It's hard to tell if you're actually cutting all the wires or the important wires or the wires that are keeping the bomb from exploding.</p>
<p>Fortunately, most of these complicated sorts of bombs only exist in the movies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an EOD tech and a perpetual lurker.  I was so taken back by how incorrect the top comment was that I created an account to respond.   Bigblueoni's explanation is completely wrong when applied to the majority of IEDs.  I'm not going to explain how &quot;bombs&quot; work, but to respond to OP, there are very complex electrical circuits out there.  There are also very simple ones.  A smart bomb maker can make an IED that goes &quot;boom&quot; when you cut/touch/move/etc. certain components or wires.  That's the ELI5 explanation.  </p>
<p>To be absolutely clear, bigblueoni is completely wrong.  Whoever gave him gold should ask for a fucking refund.  Bombs are NOT always trying to explode, that is not a typical design.  I don't feel comfortable saying anything more, but I don't want everyone to have this ludicrous idea about how basic electrical circuits work.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Currently cunducting route clearance in Afghanistan and we have come across many IED's since we've been here. Most of the bombs we come across are simple one switch circuits which usually consist of one pressure plate. You step on or drive over one of these and it completes the circuit between the power source and the blasting cap. Once one of these potential threats are found, usually with ground penetrating radar, we do the ol &quot;I hope this shit don't explode&quot; dig untill we find all the components and identify their purpose. If it's the usual simple switch initiated IED, simply cut any of the wires and it will render the bomb inoperable. Then WE blow it up with C4. If the device is more technically advanced with  possible anti tamper components and we are not confident on exactly how it works, we send the robot up with some C4, identify the main charge, and blow it up. </p>
<p>If a bomb was somewhere where you couldn't just blow it up with C4 say an airport, i'd say cut the det cord leading to the blasting cap. Or if it's an electrical system, cut the two wires leading to the blasting cap. This should rule out any anti tamper circuits. Some people here like to think there's some hidden power source waiting to close a circuit once a wire is cut and will cause it to detonate. Well guess where the power from that second battery is going? Cut the wires closest to the blasting cap and only if you can visually see the wires directly connected to it. This is all assuming the bomb is detonated by a blasting/firing cap, which most explosives are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
