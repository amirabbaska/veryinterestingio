		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coming from an aquarist who works with sharks- Great White Sharks are what are called ram ventilators. This means they constantly have to keep swimming to keep water passing over their gills. Sharks have what is called a glide pattern- they have a burst of swimming, then having a gliding portion. When kept in human care, sharks need many things, including a certain shaped tank to allow for this glide pattern. If they do not have enough space or the habitat is the wrong shape, they cannot fully use their glide pattern to the greatest efficiency. If they have to cut their glide short, they use more calories swimming, and this imbalance makes them very hard to keep. Great whites have a huge special need for their glide pattern, so they are very hard to keep in human care. No one has ever kept an adult great white, but Monterey bay aquarium will collect and hold juvenile great white sharks for a few months before releasing them back. They never keep them longer than 6 months and there are a lot of rules about when  they can have them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For one, it takes a massive amount of resources to be able to house a Great White. They are open ocean creatures who don't stay in the same place for very long, and need lots of room to swim.  They travel long distances throughout the open water, rarely changing directions unless necessary, so the ones in captivity have been observed continuously running into walls at relatively fast speeds, causing visible damage. </p>
<p>Even more so, while many fish can get water/oxygen to pass through their gills simply by opening and closing their mouths, Great Whites need to physically move forward with their mouth open. This makes transportation difficult because even a short period without this type of movement can have a lasting negative effect on the shark's well being. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMbHLF_zwjs" target="_blank">Here's a pretty interesting video about the Monterey Bay Aquarium's attempts at housing Great Whites.</a> They've been the most successful, having built special transportation equipment and a 1 million gallon tank, but of the 6 Great Whites they've housed, all were released in less than 6 months from being aggressive / not adapting to the tank. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Watched a short video about this a little while back. I think it was in a nat geo youtube video. Most of the sharks that do well in captivity spend most of their time closer to the shore. Great whites spend more time in open water. The smaller sharks are used to having solid ground around them, so a tank with solid glass is a fairly easy transition. Whereas deep ocean sharks have trouble with swimming into the glass. They get a lot of wounds and scars on their face from collisions. The tanks we build now just arent big enough for them to last more than a few months. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have made more eloquent posts, but:</p>
<p>A shark is a very pointy, slightly stupid meat torpedo that must keep moving at all time or it will suffocate and die. The Great White is a meat torpedo that can grow to be 20 feet long and move faster than some recreational watercraft as its cruising speed.</p>
<p>Imagine trying to fund and build an enclosure for a boat-sized cruise missile that literally must move quickly at all times and eats whales.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're large(r than most of those other sharks and large fish). They're supremely adapted free-roaming fish that dive to great depths. They tend to hit the glass, and the bottom, in an attempt to behave like they naturally would. </p>
<p>Sharks are genetically &quot;programmed.&quot; They don't think &quot;well, it's Tuesday, time to go down to 500 feet.&quot; If you take a robot that is designed to jump 20 feet in the air, and you put it in a 15-foot enclosure, it's going to smash itself against the ceiling until it stops working. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
