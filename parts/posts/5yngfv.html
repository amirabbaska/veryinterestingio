		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is probably an instinctive reaction that developed to share humour with others around us, exactly like laughter.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/105/50/20044.2.full" target="_blank">fascinating study</a> looking at the gestures made by athletes blind from birth compared to blinded later in life compared to sighted people when they win or lose. They found that the V gesture of arms held up, chest puffed out, head back is really strongly preserved across cultures and even in people blind from birth/very early in life. It looks like it's a built-in movement, kind of like smiling, grimacing, laughing, etc. </p>
<p>The most popular theories for these are to do with the evolutionary benefits of being able to communicate feelings to each other. For example, sharing humour might be a bonding experience bringing a social group closer. Additionally, it might disarm potential angry responses, by showing, &quot;No! Haha! That pie in the face was totally hilarious and <em>not</em> me starting a fight with you!&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to think this was something instinctive, like how blind people (who have been blind with birth) smile when they're happy, even though they've never seen someone smile. </p>
<p>In college, I developed a keen interest in psychology and sociology, and started looking into stuff like this, just to better understand the human mind. We learn a lot of 'social conventions' just by seeing other people do them. We grew up, as young children watching cartoons, where people slapped their knee, or stomped their feet while laughing. Fun fact, I interviewed an animator from disney for a college project, he said that they tend to overtly exaggerate actions, to get the point across better. Some of us also saw parents gently slap other people on the back while laughing. This turns out that it's a way (subconsciously) of sharing the moment with someone else. </p>
<p>Basically, you 'feel' like the slap / hit something response, because you learned that it's a part of laughter, from your observing of subliminal stimuli.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's probably because we use our energy when dealing with heavy emotions. If someone's very angry, you let it out by yelling and also by hitting something like the table or a wall or whatever. When laughing heavily it's the same thing, just the other side of the spectrum.  </p>
<p>Why we wanna let this energy out is less clear to me. Maybe because tiring ourselves will help us get back into our normal, rational self if that makes sense. It's some kind of psychological homeostasis then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
