		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, they don't. In fact, it is notoriously difficult to get female mosquitoes to feed on a hemotek in the lab; this is a system, with a membrane, in which the blood is heated to body temperature and left on mosquito cages in the dark. Field populations have to be 'weaned' onto this system to become lab colonies, initially they will only arm feed. Mosquitoes in the wild require host cues to take a blood meal, little is known about these other than carbon dioxide, heat and a volatile called octan-3-ol are attractants. People have a very complex array of volatile chemicals on the skin, and different combinations of these make people more or less likely to be bitten. As mentioned above, mosquitoes can be completely sustained by sugar, and feed on nectar in the wild, a blood meal is necessary so the mosquito can become gravid and lay eggs. It may be worth mentioning that most mosquitoes do not preferentially feed on humans, live stock, dogs, birds etc. are bitten a lot, the preference for humans leads to some species' extreme competence in transmitting disease.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mosquitos don't scavenge or share blood from experience from working with colonies of several species in a lab environment. Mosquitos don't use blood for sustenance but to gather the material necessary to reproduce. So likely it would be less than useful to them with many of the nutrients already absorbed by the previous holder. Mosquitos don't work cooperatively or share anything to my knowledge instead focusing like most creatures on their own reproduction. Mosquitos use sugar for true nutrition and to maintain themselves rather than using blood for it. Usually a blood meal is followed by reproduction and then death fairly quickly seemingly between 24-48hrs in my experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>This is called &quot;hyperparasitism,&quot; and may be more important with species that feed for long durations and digest for long periods of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No they do not steal blood from one another. Mosquitoes hone in on hosts by chemo receptors (for carbon dioxide) or motion ( big dark mammal).
Some species of mosquitoes are also very restricted to hosts -- some are just bird biters, some mammals, some even amphibians or reptiles. Others are more generalist. None, that I am aware of (in North America) are interested in other arthropods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
