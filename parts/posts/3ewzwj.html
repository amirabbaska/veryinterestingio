Now, could a modern day human survive in Earth's environment that existed 65 million years ago?  Would the air be breathable?  How about temperature?  Water drinkable?  How about food?  Plants/meat edible?
I presume diseases would be an non issue since most of us have evolved our immune system based off past infections.  However, how about parasites?</p>
<p>Obligatory:
&quot;Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 91 Ocean View, WA 99393. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for the Gold.</p></div></div>
