<p>Firstly, sometimes baby teeth come in crooked and sometimes adult teeth come in perfectly aligned, but it's true that there is a tendency towards what you described. </p>
<p>It's really down to space. Baby teeth are fewer in number (20 for your typical full compliment of baby teeth and 32 for adult teeth) and significantly smaller. Kids usually have all their baby teeth by around 2 and are meant for small mouths. Adult teeth start coming in around 6 when the mouths are still small and meant for adult sized jaws which will not be complete till about 18 or older. Picture the difference in size of the jaws of a 10 year old (when many of the front adult teeth have pushed in looking crooked) and that of an adult. You have adult sized teeth meant for a fully grown adult in a child's jaw and often there just isn't room until the jaws have grown a bit more. So when teeth are pushed teeth into jaws without enough space, they will go to where there is space, which may be outside the normal alignment of teeth and appear crooked. </p>
<p>There is also the matter of teeth being pushed around by other teeth coming through. This can lead to a stage dentist refer to as &quot;the ugly duckling&quot; stage where the teeth can look very wonky and alarming to parents, but is in reality just a normal stage of development and will get better if left to fix itself. This short video demonstrates <a href="https://youtu.be/HrXH-RfBPQ4" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/HrXH-RfBPQ4</a></p>
<p>There is a theory that we have more adult teeth than we currently need for our size of jaws and the modern diet. Over the evolution of our species, our jaws have got smaller but the number and size of our teeth are still catching up so with more teeth than our jaws can fit, teeth become crooked. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Adults may have more issues with crooked teeth in part due to overcrowding. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not a dentist.  That said, it's probably because baby teeth (also called milk teeth in other countries) are not usually full sized, and the mouth/jaw/bone structure is still growing, so they fit.  The adult teeth are a full size and come in after the face/bone structures are basically grown.  Due to genetics, sometimes people get larger teeth than their mouths can accommodate.  </p>
<p>Apparently there are places in the world with rather undiluted populations (I hate to use this term, but &quot;pure&quot; racial lines) in which there has been no mixing of different ethnic groups.  This particular study I saw indicated that among Eskimos, Aborigines, certain African tribes, people in Appalachia, etc. where physical boundaries or distances prevent them mixing with other ethnic groups, they do not have a need for orthodontics and their teeth are generally straight.</p>
<p>So we have people with typically larger heads and mouths, and then they migrate and mix with people who are generally smaller with smaller mouths.  Their genes aren't sure which direction to go; they get teeth too large for the space and they're crooked.  Or you have a large mouth and smaller teeth, and they're spread out.  Either way, the person may want braces.</p>
<p>My friend had teeth so large and a mouth so small she actually had to have 4 teeth removed.  So this might explain it.  My chiropractor friend wondered if that might be why people get screwed-up spines as well.  Big tall people intermarrying with little short people (like my grandparents), and you get back trouble where no injury has taken place.</p>
<p>That's just a theory, for whatever it's worth.  </p>
<p>TL;DR  Intermixing of genes can result in teeth too big for a smaller mouth, teeth don't have enough room, hello braces!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Baby teeth come in straight because their jaws are empty, their jaws are growing, and the baby teeth themselves are small, so there is no crowding. Adult teeth don't come in until the child's mouth is already full of teeth that could get in the way. Crowded teeth is a big reason for crooked teeth. There are, of course, exceptions to each of my statements.</p>
<p>Source: I am not an orthodontist, but I have twin six year olds, and I've watched their full set of baby teeth come in, and now they've each got  two or three permanent teeth. I also personally went through five hellish years of braces and orthodontist visits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
