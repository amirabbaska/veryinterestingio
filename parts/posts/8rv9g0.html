Inside carbon dioxide builds up, carpet and vinyl leech chemicals, mold spores are released, trash releases smells, and other chemicals and smells build up.  Your ducts are probably filthy too.  Air conditioners don't do anything but catch some dust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Air conditioning doesn’t really do much to remove pollutants afaik. The filter will remove dust, and the removal of humidity may make it feel less “stuffy”, however I would imagine many smaller particles will go right through the filter, so it’s mostly just a comfort thing.</p>
<p>I recall reading that Britain added a rule to their building code recently to require that houses exchange their air with the outside every so often. It used to not be a problem, but as houses started being better sealed to save energy, it was also trapping pollutants inside and causing other issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
