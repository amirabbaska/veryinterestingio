		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One I can answer! Horses and donkeys have different numbers of chromosomes. These come together to make the baby mule, but when the mule grows up, its chromosomes can’t divide into even numbers (it ends up with an uneven number of chromosomes). This means all the sex cells aren’t considered as good cells, and they can’t come together to make another baby mule because the chromosomes would be really crazy then. As for other hybrid species, it gets really complicated. Some hybrid species have no problems with reproduction and can even regularly occur in nature. Other hybrids, such as rice, will take a few generations before they die out. But ultimately it comes down to amounts of chromosomes and whether they can divide evenly in the hybrid generation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a primer, youve probably heard that humans have 23 pairs chromosomes, of which we get 1 from each of our parents, for a total of 46 chromosomes. 23 is our haploid number (i.e the number of chromosomes in a sex cell) whereas our diploid number is 46 (the number in a somatic or body cell)</p>
<p>A horse has a haploid number of 32 while a donkey has a haploid number of 31. This means a mule has 63 chromosomes as its diploid number when a horse and donkey combine their egg and sperm. The mule cannot really undergo its own meiosis because meisosis's main goal is to create a haploid cell, but 63 doesnt divide evenly in two and so problems result in them being unable to create viable sex cells or they wont be viable when mixed with another mule</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, just to clear things up, donkeys can absolutely have offspring. When a male donkey and a female horse are crossed you get a mule which is cannot reproduce (except in extremely rare circumstances as outlined in other posts). When a male horse and female donkey are bred you get a hinny which, again, can't reproduce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5:  A mule has a donkey half and a horse half, just like you look like a mix of your mommy and daddy.  When the mule goes to make its own babies the donkey half and the horse half each try to match up to make a whole donkey or horse but there’s not enough to make a whole one of either so it can’t make babies</p>
<p>Basically what others have said, the chromosomes don’t pair up properly during meiosis and don’t produce viable gametes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
