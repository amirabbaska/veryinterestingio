<p>A lot of Soviet and American warheads dismantled due to treaties ended up as fuel in Canadian nuclear reactors as the two powers didn't trust each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nukes are essentially just uranium or plutonium  surrounded in metal, and that metal is surrounded with TNT (depending on which material you picked earlier). So its very possible to simply disassemble them. You could salvage the materials for other things. I am pretty sure you can still use them for nuclear fission. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, you would remove the payload and then repurpose the material inside because it’s still nuclear material. If it’s waste, than the gold standard these days is to encase it in glass and then stainless steel and then bury it, however depending on the government getting rid of it the disposal method could go anywhere from putting it in a holding tank to dropping it in the middle of the ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a pretty straightforward process. The warhead is dismantled and anything reusable is recycled. The non-nuclear components (the casing, electronics...etc) can be recycled. The actual core of uranium and/or plutonium is diluted and can be used as fuel in nuclear reactors. The fusion fuel (in the case of boosted fission or thermonuclear warheads) is disposed of as hazardous waste. Anything that's been irradiated can be stored as nuclear waste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The really explodey bits inside can be separated from the less explodey bits that are needed to make the warhead super explodey in the first place.</p>
<p>The really explodey bits can then be used in other safer ways, like to charge your iPad! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
