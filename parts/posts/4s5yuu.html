		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thank you all for amazing answers and some of you commented that most answers are not for ELI5. Actually I did ask this in /r/askscience but it is not visible or something. So from what I get from the answers, it is about evaporation rate and bacterial membrane structure. Further explanations may go beyond layman's understanding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short and skinny:  IPA (isopropyl alcohol) effectively dissolves the lipid membrane of a bacteria.  100% IPA is great at dissolving fatty acids but some bacteria have more than just lipids in their membranes, there are a lot of proteins present as well which the IPA can't effectively penetrate.  The water helps the IPA denature these proteins.  Some bacteria, called spore formers will form a very protein rich shell which even 70% IPA can't denature so H2O2 is a great alternative (6% hydrogen peroxide).  H2O2 is effective against most bacteria other than the species that are rather well suited to break down H2O2 (Catalase rich species) .  Nature truly is metal and always finds a way to survive harsh conditions/environments.</p>
<p>This is a very brief answer as this question can have a rather in depth answer.  </p>
<p>Edit: changed bacterium to bacteria x2</p>
<p>Edit: yea, this is about as ELI5 as it gets from me.  Sorry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most cells have something called &quot;Aquaporins&quot; which are highly specialized transmembrane proteins that act as special Toll Road lanes for water to easily get into and out of the cell. These are extremely important, because a cell regulates it's water content by ion pumps, and let's the water freely flow via diffusion in response.</p>
<p>Having ~70% allows the antiseptic alcohol to hitch a ride in the &quot;toll lane&quot; of water (via intermolecular hydrogen bonding) and act on the intracellular contents of the cell. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, it is composed of 30% water which helps it penetrate the membrane. When you have 100% alcohol, it is very difficult to get the alcohol into the cell. Even then, 100% evaporates quite fast which makes it not as useful.</p>
<p>edit: changed dissolved to evaporate which is the correct term</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am an industrial engineer who works in the medical field, and just had this conversation with our materials specialty group.In 70/30 IPA/DI water solution the rate the the alcohol and water evaporates is almost identical. This in effect allows the alcohol do to a better job of removing &quot;bugs&quot; (his term) from surfaces and product before evaporating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
