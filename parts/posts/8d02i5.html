		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know this only only derivative of English, but I'm curious if there's a reason in particular why certain countries have the suffixes they do to signify that someone or something derives from that particular region. For example:</p>
<p>Why China is Chinese and not Chinish or Chinean</p>
<p>or </p>
<p>Congo is Congolese and not Congish or Congolean</p>
<p>or </p>
<p>France is French and not Francish or Francilean</p>
<p>I know this may better be suited for someone that studies etymology, but figured I'd ask anyways in the event there really is some type of formula that I'm missing.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference between -ese and -ish in English comes from whether we get the word from French (compare to Modern French: chinoise, japonaise, hollandaise, mayonnaise, etc.) or from its Germanic roots (compare to Modern German: Englisch, Chinesisch, Japanisch, Französisch, etc.). Old French -eis became -ese, while the Old English -isc became -ish.</p>
<p>As to why we decided to borrow the French word for Chinese instead of use a more native Germanic word, that I don’t have the answer to. Languages are complicated and change occurs often and without much reason.</p>
<p>For why some things are -ese and others are -ian, you’ll have to ask the Ancient Romans. My guess would be that something similar happened a long time ago where one people used one ending, and another people used another ending, and after one people conquered the other and the languages blended, they ended up with two different ways to form demonyms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is only a partial answer, but you're actually correct about “French.” Around the time of the Holy Roman Empire, there was a group of people in France called the Franks, or <em>Frankish</em>, and in the year 800 AD the Pope crowned their king Charlemagne the first Holy Roman Emperor. Even in modern German the word for the country France is <em>Frankreich</em>, literally “Land of Franks”. Over decades and centuries “Frankish” was corrupted into “French,” like in the telephone game where people in a line repeat a message and it usually is different at the end from how it started.</p>
<p>Also, it's possible that <em>-ese</em> as in “Chinese” and “Japanese” derives from the Latin <strong>-ensis</strong>, which is used to indicate place of origin.</p>
<p>The word for this is “demonym.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly if you are from New Zealand (as I am) there is no proper demonym like English, Italian, etc. New Zealanders are not New Zealandish or New Zealandian. The closest adjectives are the somewhat informal “Kiwi” or the clunky sounding “New Zealander” (which is fine as a noun but weird as an adjective). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it ends with &quot;ish&quot;, it very possibly comes from Old English. Places relevant to Germans will feature this commonly, such as &quot;English&quot;, &quot;Danish&quot;, &quot;Swedish&quot;, &quot;Polish&quot;, &quot;Frankish&quot;, with &quot;Scottish&quot;, &quot;Spanish&quot; also, and by extension &quot;French&quot;, &quot;Dutch&quot;. These are usually from before 1740 or so when &quot;ish&quot; was basically just the default. </p>
<p>If it ends with &quot;ian/an&quot; it's from Latin probably via Normans. These are usually Roman concepts, like a unified &quot;Germania&quot; filled with &quot;Germani&quot;, or a land of &quot;Italia&quot; filled with &quot;Italiani&quot;. Medieval/modern Latin still applies and this becomes the default demonym ending in English after 1470 or so when Modern English, influenced by French-speaking Normans, takes root in recognizable form.</p>
<p>If it ends with &quot;ese&quot; you can blame Marco Polo, but also something about the Italians dominating things for a bit. &quot;Cinese&quot; to &quot;Chinese&quot;, &quot;Giapponese&quot; to &quot;Japanese&quot;, &quot;Milanese&quot;, &quot;Bolognese&quot;, &quot;Parmese&quot;, and I'd blame &quot;Viennese&quot; on Italy too, but really it's a weird rule about the way words end. The French are to blame for this too, with &quot;Congolese&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;i&quot; as an ending is from Persian and that's because Persia basically dominated the Middle Eastern cultural sphere for the past 2000 years.</p>
<p>After a while, English stopped taking from German, or French, or Italian, or Persian, and just started taking whatever they called themselves. That's why subsaharan African names are so weird- it reached that stage of &quot;yeah whatever&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
