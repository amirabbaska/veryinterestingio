Is there any species that do the opposite of this?</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, thanks for so many responses! I think the best scientific answer is &quot;The Bachelor&quot; though...</p></div></div>

<p>In species where both parents need to work together to raise offspring females may compete to partner desirable males, this happens in <a href="https://youtu.be/WdTr8kjdNuI?t=96" target="_blank">kingfishers</a> and of course in humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
