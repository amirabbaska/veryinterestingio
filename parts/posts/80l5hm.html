		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lactose is sugar. Sugar completely dissolves in the liquid. Cream is an emulsion (homogeneous mix of fat and liquid). </p>
<p>Churning won't extract the sugar that has dissolved in the liquid, it will only separate the fat (butter) from the liquid (buttermilk).</p>
<p>In the end, almost all the sugar will be still dissolved in the buttermilk and almost none in the butter (only a bit remains, because not all moisture will be extracted). That's why the percentage of lactose in butter is so low, and the percentage of lactose in buttermilk is higher than in cream (same amount of sugar concentrated in less mass because all the fat is gone).</p>
<p>Edit: removed the practical example, it was too silly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is another explanation. Milk is an emulsion of fats and water with stuff dissolved in both. Making butter is just separating the fat and water from each other. Lactose is not very fat soluble so it stays mostly in the water part. The seperation isn't complete in the case of butter so some water with lactose dissolved into it remains in the final product. Something like ghee or clarified butter where the separation is more complete will have almost no lactose in it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
