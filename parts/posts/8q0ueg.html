<p>Raw pork products are usually sweet in flavor like other white meats. Sometimes they are injected with a brine, but not enough to make them inherently salty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Specifically, The Porks have either been soaked in a salty liquid for a while (brined), or packed in salt, so that some of the original moisture is pulled out. This is called curing, and preserves and flavors the meat. A similar process is done with bacon (which you'll also note is salty).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I make my living curing pork. Other meats can be cured (and some sometimes are), but the reason we cure pork so much more often is just because it's better. Pork fat especially works great. That's mostly due to just happenstance, as pork fat happens to have just the right qualities for curing and aging. The efficiency of raising and processing hogs is also a factor, especially in terms of establishing cuisines*, but a big part of it is just because it makes such tasty things.</p>
<p>*By which I mean that America, and other places with a tradition of curing pork, was built on the backs of pigs. Cattle were a rarity, in large part because they were more difficult and costly to raise and process. So pork was by default our main meat, just for economic reasons. Salted beef was very much a thing, but just far less common than salted pork, just because there was so much more pork. Plus, again, salted pork just works so much better than salted beef, especially if your goal is to preserve a whole carcass (salted and cured ribeye is just sad).</p>
<p>As others have pointed out though, fresh pork isn't any more salty than other meats. Indeed, if I remember correctly (and this is outside my realm, so I may be mistaken), beef and lamb have higher salt contents to start with. We just normally sell those fresh (or frozen, depending on what your concept of &quot;fresh&quot; is). Some pork is sold fresh too (and if you look hard enough, all pork is sold fresh somewhere), but you normally just see a few cuts. The hams, bellies, trim, and whatnots become processed products, which is the reason people like me have careers. You can find fresh pork belly, but the fast majority of pork belly bought in the USA is sold as bacon, because damned do people love bacon. Ham and sausage are pretty popular too. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Because salted pork is delicious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pork was and is cheaper than other meats, so when preserving meat (which doesn't always work, especially historically) you used pork more often than other meats, and curing requires a lot of salt. So really its just that the traditions for using pork are saltier and more presevation-oriented while the traditions for using beef and chicken are more freshness-oriented and thus not salted except for the sake of flavor</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
