<p>They talk about having very high precision retro-reflectors at 3 locations on the moon's surface.  They also mentioned that it was roughly 1.28 light seconds to the moon.  Does that mean that when we send a laser burst to test distance, that we need to actively 'lead the target' reflector?  Since lasers aren't perfect, are they simply 'wide' enough at that distance that it is a non-issue?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do because the beam is roughly 4 miles or km wide (I know they're different,  but the size is highly variable). The beam is strongest at its center, and accurate tracking is essential because so few photons are returned. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment#Principle" target="_blank">Out of 10^17 photons aimed at the reflector, only one is received back on Earth every few seconds, even under good conditions. </a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the time between firing and arriving the moon has moved on the order of a few arc seconds. Even in good 'Still&quot; air that about the size of atmospheric effects on the beam. Given all this the odds are better you win the power ball than a given photon makes the round trip. But hey we got quitillions of photons</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
