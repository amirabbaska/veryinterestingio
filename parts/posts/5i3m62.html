		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The money supply represents all the available 'working value' in an economy. By increasing the money supply, you can't change the 'real' value of the work, but now that you have more tokens representing the same economy, each token is worth less. </p>
<p>Let's look at an economy of 10 people, and a money supply of 1000. If you increase the money supply to 2000, then you have inflated the money by 100%. There are still only 10 people, though, and there is still only so much work those 10 people can do. Because of this fact, and because of the eventual distribution of the extra money, the money can only possibly be worth half as much as it was before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inflation is basically shifting prices, from the public's point of view. From an economic point of view, what happens when the prices go up is that the currency has been devalued.</p>
<p>Let's say you used to buy apples by the gram. I don't know what 200g of apples cost, but let's say it used to cost 10 dollars. Six months later, you go buy the same apples at the same place, and now 200g of apples cost 12.50. Well, the reason that happens is because the dollar has been devalued and the inflation is up by 25% in (which is already a crazy number, most countries get like 5% a year), so 10 dollars now won't buy you 200g of apples anymore.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons as to why this happens; prices may change because of how well or how poorly stocked the shops are, there may have been some sort of drop in demand (for instance, it may be december and not a lot of people want to buy ice cream), or maybe your currency got devalued. </p>
<p>I'm not an economist by any stretch, but I think I can explain in simple terms how that happens. You see, money is backed by something. Your country's wealth is not measured by how many bills it prints, but by what backs them. A currency whose value is backed by some sort of &quot;physical wealth&quot; is called a &quot;commodity currency&quot; or it can be backed by the &quot;strength&quot; of the government that printed it, in which case it's called a &quot;fiat currency&quot;, and the US Dollar is one of those. That means the money you have only has value as long as the US can back it.</p>
<p>It's the reason why printing extra money doesn't help anyone. If you print tons of currency, all you're doing is devaluing it because the country's wealth hasn't changed, and now the wealth is being divided by a much larger amount of bills, so they now have less value than they did before.</p>
<p>Germany went through a process much like that after WW1, where they printed a lot of money in order to pay what they owed other countries, but what ended up happening is that their economy broke, and people ended up using money to make wallpaper and all sorts of crazy things.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe also went through something similar, and there's even a picture of a one billion Zimbabwean dollar bill that was basically worthless.</p>
<p>And now recently Venezuela is doing the same thing, and their economy is crashing much in the same way.</p>
<p>Edit: small corrections</p>
<p>Edit2: I was very wrong about the definition of &quot;fiat currency&quot;, but it's been corrected as far as my knowledge can tell, and the point still stands</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like hockey cards. Rare cards are worth more. If there was a Wayne gretzky card for every human on earth they wouldnt be worth much.
If there is a large supply of something it is worth less than if there was a small supply of the same thing.
Money works the same way. Governments keep making more and more of the currency, making it worth less and less.
So its not that the candy bar is getting more expensive, the money you are buing it with is worth less.</p>
<p>An aside: its really hard to wage wars when your currency is gold. You have to pay your soldiers and you cant create gold out of thin air.
I think that is why wars were alot quicker back when you had to dig your money out of the ground or trade with someone who has already.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inflation is the long term increase in the prices of things.</p>
<p>High inflation is bad and governments will do all they can to fight this -- even purposely causing a recession -- but zero inflation, or even falling prices (deflation) are not good either.  If prices are falling, that is a sign that the economy is depressed.</p>
<p>What causes inflation?  The same thing that sets prices:  supply and demand.</p>
<p>First is demand.  This is &quot;demand pull&quot; inflation.  This means the economy is doing too well.  Unemployment is very low and there are labor shortages and this causes wages to rise.  When people have extra money, they can afford more and will bid up the prices of goods.  </p>
<p>Second is supply.  This is &quot;cost push&quot; inflation.  This is caused by a shock in the price of labor or more usually some raw material.  An oil shock is the most common example.  Some event overseas may cause oil prices to double overnight.  This increases the costs that companies have to do business forcing them to raise prices to make ends meet.  A shift in currency values is another example.  If you rely on foreign goods but foreign currency is now higher then that increases the prices of those foreign goods.</p>
<p>So governments usually try to balance things.  They usually aim for between 2% and 4% inflation.  See <a href="http://www.economicshelp.org/macroeconomics/inflation/causes-inflation/" target="_blank">here</a> for more examples.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
