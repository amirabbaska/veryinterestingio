		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because emotional regulation is a very high level cognitive ability, and those are the first to go. If you stayed up longer and longer more and more basic functions of your body begin to mess up and eventually just shut down. It’s like after an all-nighter, you can’t focus to save your life. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, think of emotional stability as if it's like standing up. When you wake up, you're feeling good (or after you down a few cups of coffee) and are ready to start the day (usually). You feel like standing takes NOTHING, and you can do it for a long time. Heck, you can even hold something heavy and it's not that stressful or tiring.</p>
<p>Standing in one place is easy, and you don't need to pay attention or expend any effort, even if people are bumping into you. You can adjust and keep doing what you're doing.</p>
<p>But as the day drags on, it takes more and more effort to stand up, remain in place, and not sit down or lean on anything. You expend your energy by doing your day to day activities, and that means simple things like standing is also going to take more effort.</p>
<p>By the time 5:30 rolls around, you're tired, and you know it. Standing takes more effort. If someone comes along and bumps into you, you'll move or fall because you're tired! </p>
<p>If you've done physical labor all day, you don't even feel like your legs can keep you up, and you realize standing takes energy, even though you do it day in and day out. You have to focus more on standing and not falling if someone bumps you. </p>
<p>This is the same thing with emotional stability. It may not feel like it, but it takes work to be polite. It takes work to talk with others, listen to them, and think things through. It takes work to not get upset when something bad happens, or angry when someone says something. Just like standing, you feel like this takes almost no energy, until you've expended most of your energy, then even the basics of emotional stability take more and more work until you simply cannot stay stable. </p>
<p>Like with your muscles, you will need to go, rest, and go to sleep before you feel better and can handle emotional stability like it's nothing! However, the more often you become this tired, eventually the easier emotional stability is to maintain, even as you grow more tired. But this takes a while to do, and there is always a point where you simply cannot stand any longer.</p>
<p>Like your physical muscles, your brain is a muscle too, and energy is required to maintain it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some great answers in here, and I'm probably adding to the discussion too late for anyone to see this, but just wanted to throw in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-regulation_theory" target="_blank">Baumeister's Self-Regulation Theory</a> which argues in part that--generally speaking--behaviors which are for the purposes of self-control/monitoring/regulating are naturally depleting re: cog/mental/psych/physical resources. In a fatigued state, engaging in and managing self-control behaviors becomes more and more difficult, thus the body's engagement in more self-protective or 'primal' behaviors (e.g., microsleeps, lack of impression management, etc.).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the sleep cycle is controlled by your bodies internal clock (circadian rhythm). The longer you stay up, the more this rhythm is thrown out of whack. When your body doesn't know when it should be asleep or awake your hormonal (endocrine) system is disrupted. Most of what happens in your body is controlled by hormones on some level, therefore a lack of sleep will affect not only your emotional state but also how hungry you feel, how tired you feel, and how well you can process information amongst other things.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Hormones control basically everything, no sleep screws with hormones and can cause whackydoo behaviour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
