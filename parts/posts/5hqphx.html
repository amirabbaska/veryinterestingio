		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an exoplanet PhD student who has done a little bit of work with binary stars and how they might affect planet formation.</p>
<p>To start, I don't know the exact answer of the &quot;farthest known distance between two stars in a system&quot;.  (I'm also going to ignore star clusters in this because I feel that that's not what you mean.)  However, it is known that wide binaries can have an orbital radius of several thousand AU (1 AU = distance from Earth to Sun).</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/press-releases/WideBinaryStars/" target="_blank">source</a> says about 1 light-year.  The current distance between Alpha Centauri A and B and Proxima (or Proxima Centauri) is 15000 AU, or about 0.24 light-years (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0607401" target="_blank">source</a>).  However, it's not confirmed that they're gravitationally bound.  It's right on the edge.  </p>
<p>From what I know and from what I've just read up on, I would say that the widest binaries about probably about 0.25 light-years away from one another.  For reference, that's about 400 times the distance from the Sun to Pluto, and the nearest star to the Sun is Proxima Centauri, which is about 4.25 light-years away.</p>
<p>Here's a little <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/news/releases/2012/12-90AR.html" target="_blank">extra reading</a> on wide binary stars that you might find interesting.  The summary is that they probably form in 3-star systems (or higher numbers).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is slightly tangential to your question, and I don't know enough about these systems to tell you their separation, but there are two star systems which might contain 7 stars called AR Cas and Nu Sco (also referred to as Jabbah). Large systems like this tend to have two stars close in a binary and then two separate binaries orbit each other at a much larger distance, but getting all the way to 7 is very complicated. Those systems might be strong candidates for the furthest known distance between orbiting systems.</p>
<p>Another completely different possibility is near Sgr A* which can have stars that orbit it at a really large distance because it's so much more massive than anything else, but in this example, the line between a star system and a galaxy start to blur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh wait you meant stars ! There's a recent paper that showed an orbital movement between Alpha Cen and Proxima Cen, I'll try to find it. There's also some papers by Jos√© Caballero that found some super wide binaries. If I recall well, the star Castor is also weakly bound to another one, but I'll have to check.</p>
<p>Edit1: here's the link to Alpha Cen: <a href="https://astrobites.org/2016/11/16/settling-the-proxima-centauri-question/" target="_blank">https://astrobites.org/2016/11/16/settling-the-proxima-centauri-question/</a></p>
<p>Their separation would be btw 5000 and 13000 AU. I'm kind of amazed that they measured absolute radial velocities to a ~5 m/s precision, I thought that the positions of most stellar atomic lines weren't even known that precisely.</p>
<p>Edit2: Here's one paper by Caballero <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2761" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2761</a></p>
<p>And another search for wide binaries by Niall Deacon <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04712" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04712</a></p>
<p>Also have a look at the Fomalhaut system : 158000 AU ! <a href="http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/fomc/" target="_blank">http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/fomc/</a></p>
<p>Castor has a companion at 1138 AU (YY Geminorium)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A good starting point is to look at the list of directly imaged exoplanets, as only the widest ones can be discovered with this method:</p>
