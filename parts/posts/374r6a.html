		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your cup only had bacteria and no broth, most bacteria would look like slime with a yellowish tinge to it. Some are slightly more granular than others. There's a few types that would be a little red, pink, or a little green, others a stark white. There's a couple of types that would likely look crusty (like those in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex), because of cord factor, they tend to look more chunky and waxy.</p>
<p>No idea what a cup of viruses would look like. That would be SO MANY viruses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But this is a bacterial broth, basically a mix of bacteria in a growth media allowing them to grow to a point.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in a biochem lab in college where I would grow up huge amounts of E-coli (which is a bacteria) that I had genetically engineered to produce a certain protein I was studying. This sounds pretty cool but really all I did was insert a plasmid into them, it was pretty simple.</p>
<p>I grew the bacteria in a growth medium called luria broth which had a yellowish tinge but it would become thick, dark and cloudy when the bacteria had used up all of the nutrients and multiplied sufficiently. I actually added an antibiotic into the broth that the bacteria had resistance to due to the plasmid so it was pretty much all my specific variant of E-coli. </p>
<p>The next step was to take this cloudy broth and spin it down into a &quot;pellet&quot;. Basically a clump of bacteria. I would pour the water off and save these concentrated clumps of bacteria for later. It looked like a greyish slime. It was very slippery and slimy and it had a slightly unpleasant odor to it. </p>
<p>I probably did this would process dozens of times. Anyway I hope that answers your question. I'm not sure that it is even possible to do something like this with viruses because that can't replicate without a host cell. </p>
