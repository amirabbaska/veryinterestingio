<p>If you were to ask someone who has never seen strawberries before, would they still say they look red? (i.e: am I &quot;seeing&quot; red because I know strawberries are red?)</p>
<p>EDIT: take a look at the comment by /u/KingDavid73 and the image: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/y9TGC" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/y9TGC</a> with only blue &amp; grey pixels</p>

If we break the colors into the RGB components, the green will be something like R:0 G:200 B:50, and the grey will be R:100 G:100 G:100, that is, much more red component and much less green component.</p>
<p>The eye/brain's color processing is super complex, but the most simple version is that we take a lot of cues from the <em>differences</em> between shades, and not their absolute values.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain will compensate away the green tint, similar to automatic color balance in a camera, and the gray will then look red in comparison. Knowing anything about strawberries is not necessary.  The brain guesses that the background is meant to be white, which helps this compensation happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually messed around with that picture today. Here's an imgur link to my experiments: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/y9TGC" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/y9TGC</a></p>
<p>I made it an indexed image with 3 colors: black, white, and blue.  Zoomed out, the berries look red (so it wasn't the varied shades of gray causing it).</p>
<p>The more you zoom in, the effect goes away.  I was staring at it up close, then would zoom out slowly and there was like a magic % zoom where the colors would just kind of pop in - really weird. </p>
<p>I have a cousin-in-law that has a degree in art/painting/color theory and said it had to do with the color white, since it's made of all colors.  I tried replacing the white with a ton of different colors, and the illusion immediately goes away.</p>
<p>I then did some color corrections (curves) and re-indexed it with 5 colors: red, green, blue, black, white - and was able to recreate what the original image probably was.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. A person who has never seen a strawberry before, will still see them red.</p>
<p>You can crop a small part of the image (where you see red) with 'paint' for example, and look at it alone, so that it is no longer obvious that you are looking at a strawberry, and you still see that small area red.</p>
<p>However, if you copy that reddish color (use the color picker tool) and paint some lines in other place, over white background, you won't see it red any longer. Now it will be clearly grey.
It becomes reddish when you use that color next to the other greenish color.</p>
