What's its role in transmission networks since reactive power can't do real work? Why is it important for large alternators on the grid? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reactive power is the flow of energy contained in the electric and magnetic fields of capacitors and inductors during AC operation.</p>
<p>For example, the magnetic field around an inductor gets filled up with magnetic field energy as current passes through it, thus part of the energy and power going through the system gets stored in that field, but when the current alternates through this inductor, that energy in the magnetic field moves back towards the source. Thus, effective power is the amount of power that actually gets to your load, while reactive power is the power required to maintain the fields of the transmission lines passive components (capacitors and inductors) and the fields in the transmission line itself.</p>
<p>Now, although the current associated with reactive power does no work at the load, it still must be supplied by the generator, thus reactive power is important to define when designing a circuit so the right power source can be used, or the right capacitive bank can be used to store that reflected energy and resupply it to the inductors. A higher reactive power means more power must be supplied by the generator to dissipate the same power at the load, something power companies do not like :).</p>
<p>Tl;dr: Some of the input energy to a circuit is stored in the electric and magnetic fields, and then returned to the source during the next current cycle. This means not all of your power gets dissipated in the load, which we call effective power, thus we call the power that returns to the source &quot;reactive power&quot;.</p>
<p>Reactive power is the imaginary component. Effective power is the real component. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think seeing reactive power for what it is may help you. There are several ways of thinking about it, but here’s how I like to. </p>
<p>AC current alternates. The electrons are shaking back and forth rather than traveling down the pipe.  The voltage is doing the same - reversing in polarity over and over.  The sinusoidal voltage and current graphs you’re used to are visualizing that. </p>
<p>Now, when things are at unity, it means there’s no reactive power. This happens when the voltage polarity flipping, and the electrons shaking, are timed together perfectly.  When the voltage is fully positive, the electrons are moving one direction full speed. And when it’s fully negative, the other direction.  When the voltage is in between, the electrons are in process of turning around. </p>
<p>BUT!  When it’s not at unity, it means the timing isn’t lined up!  The movement of the electrons is lagging behind of voltage changes.  When the voltage is fully positive, the electrons might still be changing directions, and not at full speed in one direction just yet. </p>
<p>When that happens, this means power is lost, because power is voltage x current, and when those sinusoidal graphs aren’t lined up the multiplication of the two isn’t as big as it could be. </p>
<p>Let’s use an example to demonstrate. If AC power is going through a lightbulb, and the voltage flipping and electron shaking is timed together perfectly, the bulb will be brighter than if they’re not timed perfectly.  We use reactive or “imaginary” power to describe the power that we could be getting, but we’re not getting due to bad timing. </p>
<p>All of this is tricky to describe in mathematics. The imaginary i is used to separate the power that were actually realizing (effective power), and the part that we could be getting, but we’re not, due to bad timing of V and I (imaginary power). </p>
<p>Sometimes we can use the mis-timing of voltage and current to our advantage.  I’m not too educated in how/when/why though which might be the crux of your question. </p>
<p>Also, you may ask, what causes the timing between V and I to be off?  Inductive/capacitive loads cause it.  They will charge and discharge with different timing than the voltage.  Motors, generators, all contribute to the timing in complex ways.   Resistive loads don’t. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reactive power is the natural result of the reactive component of impedance. Reactance being the opposition to a change in current flow. Think about it this way, if you walk in a circle and an above ground pool you push the water along with you. If you change directions after the water started moving it opposes that change in direction. Reactive power is the power you apply to the water before it changes direction. Some of your energy has been stored in the water as momentum. You have to dissipate the stored energy before moving current in a new direction.</p>
<p>Reactive power, measured in VAR is the third leg of the power triangle. This is the Pythagorean relationship between Apparent(VA), Real(W), and Reactive power. VA^2=W^2 + VAR^2. The reactive leg is adjacent to the phase angle. As soon as the load is capacitive or inductive there is a phase angle between the change in current flow and the change in voltage polarity. As soon as there is a phase angle then there is a moment in the oscillation where current is going one direction and voltage is applying pressure in the opposite direction. The power not available in those moments are RMSed and expressed in VAR as reactive power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>0onimusha2  already gave a good explanation.   However you might wonder why there's reactive power at all on the network.<br />
You don't want reactive power on your grid, but some devices must create reactive power in order to run (e. g. induction motors).
You can compensate inductive reactive power using a capacity, or vice versa.<br />
however you'll never compensate to a power factor of 1, because that will create a resonant circuit, which will lead to a hugely increased voltage or current.   so most devices will compendate to around 0.92</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone has good and thorough answers to this question but I think everyone would benefit from a basic description of what &quot;reactive power&quot; actually is.</p>
<p>Reactive power is power that flows in the circuit that is NOT consumed by the load. Different loads have different load profiles, and the utility wants to minimize the amount flowing in the circuit since it's essentially lost transmission capacity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
