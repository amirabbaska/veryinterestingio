		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that the different neurotransmitters serve different &quot;messenger&quot; purposes. Endorphins, for example, are opioids (painkillers) made inside the body, and can help you heal after hard work. Serotonin helps regulate body temperature, mood, appetite and sleep. Dopamine seems to, among other functions, reinforce certain types of behavior with a psychological reward. </p>
<p>All three are <em>related</em> to &quot;happiness,&quot; but none are simply &quot;happy juice.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well first of all, the chemicals you listed are in actuality neurotransmitters. These are specialized molecules that are constantly floating around in the brain. I am by no means an expert, but I hypothesize that many different types of neurotransmitters were created simply as a survival trait. Being able to experience more feelings(such as fears, joy, excitement, etc.,) would result in a smarter, more aware organism with better survival chances/skills. </p>
<p>If we, as humans and even mammals alike, only used 1 single neurotransmitter we would all be about as smart as a rock. Think of it as depth. Only 1 is very shallow and 2 dimensional, but when you expand your capabilities as a thing, everything starts to change and different layers of life start to emerge.</p>
<p>Hope that helps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They all activate different parts of the brain and therefore contribute to the feeling of happiness differently. There are many complex facets to every emotion and sensation. There are equally (if not more) complex facets to the mechanisms that are behind them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a reward system, not a happiness system. The way it works is to reward you for doing the things that will ultimately lead to your survival and procreation. That's why eating, exercising, sex, are all so rewarding, and it's also why those things are less rewarding if you're addicted to something. When you're addicted to drugs they take over those systems so that the things you're supposed feel good about don't, and only the fix feels good. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dopamine reinforces behavior, after your motor system realizes an external goal.  The thrill of success if mediated by dopamine release from the ventral tegmental area and a motor sequence is reinforced by dopamine release from the nucleus accumbens, increasing the chance that it is repeated in the future.  Serotonin mediates overall wakefulness and drive to act towards goals, so works over longer/earlier time scales.  Adrenaline sharpens attention and prepares the body for action by dilating pupils and blood vessels, increasing heart rate, etc., which is the somatic aspect of arousal.  All these facets together underlie the experience of pleasure, motivation and arousal.  Source: I teach at a medical school.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
