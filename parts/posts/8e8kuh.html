		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a handful of mammal species that constantly replace lost teeth, but most don't.  On the flip side, quite a few non-mammals continuously replace lost teeth.  </p>
<p>There's two factors that seem to be at play in mammal tooth growth patterns.  First, early mammals were probably relatively short-lived little shrewlike insect - eating things like<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morganucodonta" target="_blank">this</a>.  You don't need to constantly replace teeth if you aren't wearing them out. </p>
<p>But on the flip side, not constantly replacing teeth allows mammals to do things with their teeth that other groups can't.  Even mammal ancestors like cynodonts were starting to get distinctive canines.  Mammals take this further with an array of highly specialized teeth rather than just one or a few kinds of teeth like you see in other groups.  And those teeth lock together in precise ways allowing mammals to process food effectively.  Our jaws are simpler than the reptilian norm because some of the jawbones have been incorporated into the inner ear, but despite that our precision swiss army teeth let us eat efficiently and effectively.  It's hard to have that kind of interlocking if teeth are constantly being shoved around as they get replaced</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>By William King Gregory</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is known to all students of odontology that, in typical sharks, the skin all over the body is covered with shagreen denticles, and that the primitive dental lamina of sharks is merely a rolled-up fold of skin bearing the dermal denticles, and carried around onto the inner side of the mouth. The whole surface of the throat is also covered with this denticle-bearing skin, and it is for this reason that in later groups of fishes we often find teeth on the pharyngeal parts of the gill arches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To explain: sharks do not have sockets in their jaw bones for teeth. Rather, they grow out of the skin, which is why they are able to have so many cycles of teeth. In most other animals, the teeth are plugged into the jaw bone. This is not the case in sharks. This is probably because shark jaws are not entirely homologous, evolutionary seen, to our jaw bones. The jaws of sharks are developed from the first pharyngeal arch if I remember correctly, which is the same arch that our jaws are developed from. However, cartilaginous fish, also known as chondrichtyes, do not really develop as many bones as we do. Rather, a lot of their skeleton is made of cartilage. The rest of their skull develops very differently from bony fish (osteichtyes) and from tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles (including birds) and mammals). If I'm correct, although evolutionary development is a while ago for me, the feature of having dentition incorporated into the skeleton happened after the evolution of bony fish, which have jaws that are more similar to ours. Since sharks split off from bony fish before this happened, their jaws are different from ours.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: if anyone can correct me, please do so, because I am not 100% sure if what I said is correct</p>
<p>Edit from /u/TheMythof_Feminism: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In humans at least, the teeth are not &quot;plugged into the bone&quot;, there is a significant separation called the periodontal ligament. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but it is; The tooth and the bone are necessarily separated and when this is not the case, that's called anquilosis and a major hassle.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it as just one good set of 32 teeth, where for the first 6 years of life we use a smaller, throwaway 20-piece set (one that can fit in the jaws of a six year old).</p>
<p>As mammals, our teeth are, in comparison with the other clades, pretty advanced. We have evolved differentiated teeth, incisors (front teeth) for cutting, canines for tearing, and molars for chewing/grinding. Because we had gone this route in evolution, multiple types of food were unlocked and that became the advantage which further made differentiated teeth useful for survival. But this type of teeth is expensive to replace. As they all perform a slightly different function, they would also wear at different rates, requiring different replacement cycles. We might have ended up with overcrowding and possibly even wrong teeth being replaced at the wrong time. </p>
<p>At some point in our evolution it was shown to be sufficient and efficient to have just one good and complex set. And by our evolution I mean all mammals, as most of us seem to be duodonts (two sets, one milk teeth and one permanent teeth). To develop a replacement set would be costly and probably not worth the advantage.</p>
<p>I may be biased, but I prefer having one good set of complex and multi-purpose teeth rather than an unlimited source of jagged teeth like sharks do. As is true in the animal world, quality and quantity are mutually exclusive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apparently, some mammals can replace their teeth more than once. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphyodont#Evolution_in_mammals" target="_blank">this</a> manatees, elephants, and kangaroos are Polyphyodonts, and replace their teeth several times.</p>
<p>It says manatees can replace their teeth indefinitely, but doesn't specify for elephants or kangaroos. However, I remember going to a zoo and being told by an &quot;elephant expert&quot; that elephant teeth eventually wear out too badly to chew food and the animal starves, so perhaps the wear and tear eventually outpaces the replacement rate, but I can't verify this information.</p>
<p>The need to replace teeth is related to tooth wear. If an animal doesn't live long enough to wear out their teeth, they don't need to replace them. So from an evolutionary perspective, continuously replacing teeth is a waste of energy if 1 to 2 sets of teeth is &quot;good enough&quot;. </p>
<p>Perhaps early mammals were so short-lived that one set of teeth was good enough and the ability to continuously regenerate teeth was lost and only re-evolved once lifespans were long enough to make tooth wear problematic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to understand that evolution is random mutations that turn out to be non-fatal to the species.  It’s not “oh, it would be great to have this trait.  Let’s evolve, Pikachu!”</p>
<p>Some animals got a mutation for tooth replacement or continuous growth, and it allowed them to survive longer when they did things like chew on trees, or violently tear seals in half.</p>
<p>Some did not get those mutations, but still survived just fine.</p>
<p>Then there’s the dolphin whose teeth mutated to keep growing, spiraling around each other, to come out through their nose.  Narwhals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
