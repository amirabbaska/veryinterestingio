<p>There are only two things (there's more, but that's getting into nitty gritty and this is ELI5) that determine how much money they will loan you, specifically for a mortgage.</p>
<p>1) Debt to Income Ratio. Take all of your monthly obligations THAT ARE REPORTED ON YOUR CREDIT REPORT (no your phone bill doesn't count as a debt. Yes, your car loan does), add them up together, and divide by your GROSS MONTHLY INCOME. That is your debt to income ratio (or DTI). Your DTI needs to stay, generally, under 45% for you to qualify for a Conventional mortgage. There are exceptions though, like if you have large cash reserves then we can increase the DTI threshold for you.</p>
<p>This all went into effect in 2010 through the Dodd-Frank Act and the Ability To Repay Rule (ATR).</p>
<p>2) Appraisal. Lenders will only loan you an amount for either the Appraisal or Sales Price, whichever is lower.</p>
<p>Those are the only two factors that influence the loan amount. Credit score has a role in it, but it's insignificant for ELI5 purposes. Credit score just influences the interest rate and there is a minimum credit score. However, someone with a 600 credit score can qualify for just as much as someone with an 800 credit score as long as they have the income for it.</p>
<p>Of course, there is much more to mortgages than just these three pieces, but this is the answer to your question for United States Mortgages.</p>
<p>Edit: I've been answering questions for a bit now. I need to get back to work. I'll answer more when I get home. In the mean time, I'd like to invite you all to check out /r/mortgages</p>
<p>Edit 2: Alright, I'm back to over 120+ messages and comments. I'll try to answer them all. Just know that I can't answer everything simply because they're too complex and would require me asking you for an entire cabinet of files to prove various things. Common questions I will edit back into this original post.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different countries have very different rules. As a simple overview, the UK <em>generally</em> lends 4.25x your gross income as long as that is no more than 95% of the house value. If you earn £20k, we'll lend about 85k, so you need to put in about £4,500 of your own funds you can buy a house at just under 90k.</p>
<p>Due to new rules (refered to as MMR) we now also check how much money you'd have each month if your mortgage was charged at a high interest rate (normally 7%), after accounting for bills/creditcard/Loans. If it's below a certain amount, we'll decrease your lending amount until it fits the bank's threshold. </p>
<p>The less (as a percentage of the house value) that you put in yourself, the higher the risk to the bank, so the higher the rate you get charged. In the above example you'd likely be around the 5% mark. If we leant you the 85k, and you put in 85k of your own, the bank's risk is seen as much lower, so your rate would likely be around 1.5% instead. </p>
<p>Credit doesn't come in to the amount we'll lend to be honest. It's pretty much a pass/fail test, it doesn't say what we could safely lend you.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the country. </p>
<p>Here in Norway the bank has a pretty easy way: They can only lend maximum 85% of total purchase sum, and no more than 5 annual salaries. And you should also be able to withstand a 5 point increase in interest rates. (i.e if the interest rate goes from say 3% to 8%) </p>
<p>So this means that you need a 15% down-payment, and can't borrow more than 5 times your annual salary. </p>
<p>Before the housing crash, the down-payment was lower. But the gov. figured out that by regulating the down-payment rate, they could save themselves from a disaster, and shield obviously underfunded people from buying property. </p>
<p>Thought I'd give you an perspective of how it works around the world. </p>
<p>edit: Also, you get 27% deduction on all the interest you pay. So that makes the loans a bit cheaper in the long run, and makes ownership even more appealing from the start, than renting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Man, American terminology is weird, &quot;debt to income&quot; ratio doesn't make sense to me the way you guys use it.  In Canada, we have debt service ratios (DSRs), which represents the amount of your gross monthly income that needs to be used to service your debts.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a Canadian perspective...</strong></p>
<p>There's three high-level considerations that need to be made.</p>
<p><strong>1) Will you make your payments?</strong>
We essentially consider income and credit.  If you have good credit (Beacon/FICO of high 600s and up), you will likely qualify for something.  From there, a lot of it comes down to DSRs.  There's a Gross DSR (GDSR) and a Total DSR (TDSR).  Your GDSR is calculated as your monthly housing costs (mortgage(s), property tax, strata fees, hydro) divided by your GROSS income (before tax).  TDSR is similar, but you include all of your debt obligations (housing + car payments + loan payments + CC payments, etc).  Generally, banks want GDSR &lt; 35% and TDSR &lt; 45% (but this can very a little by bank or if you're using an alternative lender).  Obviously your house price will be directly tied to this calculation, so there will be an inherent cap created here.</p>
<p><strong>2) Are we safe if you do not make your payments?</strong>
This comes down to the security, i.e. the value of the house.  On a purchase, typically loan-to-value (LTV) is capped at 95%, i.e. you need to put at least 5% down.  On a refinance or equity take-out (ETO), LTV is frequently capped at 80%.  So if you are purchasing, you will be limited to a mortgage equivalent to 19 (95 divided by 5) times your down payment (i.e. the house price can't exceed 20 times your down payment).</p>
<p><strong>3) Are the regulators okay with it?</strong>
The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) has many different rules, but a common one has to do with LTV ratios.  They are particularly concerned about people with weak credit, self-employed, not citizens, or large home prices (in the millions... so a big deal in Toronto and Vancouver right now).  On those, the bank will generally limit mortgage amounts accordingly to stay compliant with the rules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a banker in the retail and private banking sector for over 3 years in the UK. This is how it works here.</p>
<p>Firstly, you either have a sole or joint income to take into consideration. They will use your gross figure you earn. They will work out your monthly outgoings such as food, council tax, bills, childcare and anything that will remain once you have a mortgage. The bank will give you a decision in principle, a decision in principle is known as what indicative figure the bank will lend you. It can be up to 4.75x your income, it's dependant on lender and what their criteria is. You won't get credit searched for a DIP, it's soft scoring and won't leave a footprint say for a full credit search such as taking out a lending product.</p>
<p>Example: Mr A earns £20,000 per year.  In principle a bank could lend him 20k x 4.75= 95,000. The bank wouldn't normally provide a full 95,000 and you would contribute a deposit towards a property. The larger your deposit, the better for the loan to value ratio. The more deposit, the cheaper your mortgage will be in the long term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
