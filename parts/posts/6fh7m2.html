		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I worked in POS design for a major retailer for many years.</p>
<p>There are a few answers. As others have said, they build them out for peak load. Putting in a bunch of cash registers that get very little use, while not cheap, isn't that big of a number on their bottom line.</p>
<p>Additionally, you have excess capacity for when systems go down. Your store staff isn't going to be able to do more than swap out a few basic plug in components, and in many companies, they won't even go as far as that. You will need to wait a day or two for a tech to show up. Hell, even if your staff could do something like swap in a new scanner, you are still knocking that line out of service for the amount of time it takes someone to go find a spare, unbox it, set it all up, etc.</p>
<p>Also having a bunch of lanes, even though they aren't in use at the MOMENT can simplify bringing added cashiers in or out quickly. You can have someone hop onto a new register and get going without disrupting the existing line for the minute or two it takes to swap someone out.</p>
<p>Also, in a perfect world, stores are rotating their use among the registers. This helps reduce the wear and tear on them making failures like a swipe reader or pin pad wearing out less likely, and discovering that that register you planned on using for the biggest day of the year is dead.</p>
<p>Edit: Quick additional item i thought at. You also have product at the store in those lanes, and want to try and maximize what sells, what the variety is between lines, and collect metrics on it. Did the pogs not sell well because you only put them on every 3rd checkout lane, and the store in question for whatever reason never uses lanes 3 6 and 9?  Lane 2 is heavy on magazines that are all at the end of their run, lets send some extra traffic there and try and move them. Hell, even &quot;the candy they stocked on lane 5 is almost expired, lets work that one extra hard today&quot;.</p>
<p>We played around with all kinds of optimization stuff but found it was pretty much ignored at the local level for various reasons, some valid, so we gave up on it, but I'd be surprised if someone on the scale of a walmart or target wasn't using automation for at least some form of lane selection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They never have more than a few open <strong>on normal business days</strong>.</p>
<p>They open almost all of them during like black Friday and right before Christmas and etc. </p>
<p>They have registers for their maximum amount they'll need at the busiest point in the year.   Not what they think they need on a random Tuesday. They simply open and staff as many as they think they'll need that day.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm more interested in why they never fix the broken price check scanners throughout the store.  Every time I go into a new wal-mart, I dread finding the inevitable product without a price, because I know I'll end up walking around the whole store in order to find the one scanner that isn't broken.</p>
<p>And add to that - why not remove the &quot;Price Check&quot; sign when they remove the scanners?  That's just cruel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All major retailers use software for scheduling that pulls in all the sales data from the last year. If they weren't doing much business at nine in the morning last year then you're only going to get enough cashiers to meet last years sales. Holidays are a different story though most places will have everyone open on those days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day when Walmart was trying to put K-mart out of business, they used to actually have a lot of checkers. It was the reason I switched to Walmart. I hated the ridiculous wait in the K-mart line.</p>
<p>But after Walmart surpassed K-mart and old Man Walton died, they changed and went to minimal checkers. Now the wait in line is Walmart is exactly like it used to be in K-mart, the reason I switched to begin with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
