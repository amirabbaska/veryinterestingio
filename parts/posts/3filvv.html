		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As long as you were moving at a constant velocity, then nothing would appear &quot;strange&quot; to you. A key point of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity" target="_blank">special relativity</a> is that the laws of physics work the same in any (i.e. non-accelerating) inertial frame of reference. So yes, if you have a spaceship that is moving <em>relative</em> to a planet, then the clock on the spaceship would tick more slowly than a clock on the planet due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation" target="_blank">time dilation</a>. But for the people on the spaceship, nothing would change, they would perceive time as passing normally.</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> Even though it's a bit late, I hope this follow-up can clear up some of the questions that have come up since my initial reply:</p>
<p>One of the consequences of the fact that the speed of light must be equal in all frames of reference is that the very notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity" target="_blank">simultaneity is relative</a>. In other words the idea that two distant events happen at the &quot;same time&quot; is not an absolute, but depends on our frame of reference. This is the key to understanding one of the apparent paradoxes of physics, namely the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox" target="_blank">twin paradox</a>. In the most general terms, the &quot;paradox&quot; is that if you have two objects say A and B, which are moving relative to each other, then from the perspective of an observer on A, it is B that is moving, and hence time on B should run slower due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation" target="_blank">time dilation</a>, but by the same token for an observer on B, it is the time on A that is moving more slowly. The fact that both perspectives are equally valid physically goes goes to the heart of special relativity and to the idea that there are no &quot;privileged frames of reference.&quot;</p>
<p>Let's go back to the classical example of a person leaving the Earth on a spaceship and making a roundtrip and to the question of who would be older, a person on the ship or a person left on Earth. If the spacecraft is moving close to the speed of light, for an observer on Earth events on the spaceship would be unfolding in &quot;slow motion&quot; due to time dilation while life on Earth would continue at a normal pace. On the other hand, for a person on the spacecraft, it would appear as though things on on the ship would unravel at a normal pace, while it would be events on Earth that were happening more slowly! The resolution to this apparent contradiction is that once again, simultaneity is relative. It is not until the traveler would switch reference frames first by changing direction to return back to Earth and then again when stopping that a person on the spacecraft and a &quot;stationary&quot; observer on Earth could agree on the time. In that case they would find that it was the person on the spacecraft that would actually be younger than the one on Earth. Switching reference frames effectively creates discrete jumps in the apparent time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A constant and comfortable 1g acceleration will get you to 0.97c in two years. Not only would you continue thinking normally, but you'd find that journey times become drastically shortened. </p>
<p>Accelerating at 1g for half the journey and decelerating at 1g for the rest would get you to the Andromeda galaxy in less than 30 years subjective time - while more than two million years had passed on Earth. </p>
<p>You would certainly notice relativistic effects, and you'd probably get cooked by Unruh radiation. But that aside, as a thought experiment there's no reason why you wouldn't be able to travel across a huge part of the visible universe in a constantly accelerating ship - although it would be ageing visibly around you as travelled.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This happens all the time. You are moving at close to the speed of light relative to neutrinos that constantly pass through the earth. From our point of view it is the neutrinos that travel at near-c, but from their point of view we are the speed demons. There is no privileged frame of reference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two quick questions:</p>
<p>Lets say that you're on a roundtrip journey to Alpha Centauri &amp; back. You are traveling at 99.9% the speed of light and your entire trip takes a little over 8 years.</p>
<p>Question 1:</p>
<p>Since time is going dramatically slower for you, do you need to pack 8+ years of food and water for your trip?</p>
<p>Question two:</p>
<p>Since time is going slower for you on your 8 year journey, how much will you have actually aged when you return to Earth?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
