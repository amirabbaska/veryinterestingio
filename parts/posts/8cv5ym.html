		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think technically a casket is when it isn't that hexagonal shape you are thinking of, but rectangular or pill shaped.
When it is that classic wide at the shoulders hexagonal shape it is called a coffin, and as previously stated it was to save on wood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an awesome question. I've never thought about this, but I'm going to suggest that it's important for many people to be burried the correct way, it might be that this shape is used to show which way to bury the body. It is a very odly specific shape.
Edit- just asked an engineer friend who thinks - the shape is much stronger and could hold 6ft of dirt, the volume of the void is less so there won't be as much of a collapse into the hole in the future. Also tradition. Plus it is lighter to carry. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
