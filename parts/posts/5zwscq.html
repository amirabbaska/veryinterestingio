<p>Interested as to why we don't do it with houses too. For example you will see rows and rows of empty houses in need of tlc and two streets (or blocks for our transatlantic brothers) away there is a development of new builds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a huge believer in neighborhood revitalization and restoration (R/R), and it's become a huge thing in parts of the US and Canada where I've lived. Some of the projects I've seen completed have completely changed that area, and it can be a good thing for property ownership and business. But, this all depends on the area itself.</p>
<p>To start, it's stupidly expensive to restore an old building. As other users have pointed out, you have a lot of codes that are more than likely being violated (building/fire codes, mostly). Additionally, there may be zoning codes in place by the city that you need to adhere to. The cost of renovating these buildings is usually a lot higher than what the property in the area is worth, so it's difficult to find investors willing to spend the money on R/R and fight to bring the buildings up to code and restore them for business. From my experience, investors won't invest in this unless there is significant promise for return - The area is a &quot;cultural zone&quot; (art district, food district, historical areas etc) that already has a lot of interest from the local population. This makes sense to restore the old buildings as the area is popular and will bring in money. Also, you have to look at the ambiance of a restored building - They're suited for that retro/vintage-done-modern look that is becoming incredibly popular, but it's still a small market. Most people still prefer a more modern apartment or business space unless they're trying to fit into that eclectic niche of exposed brick and handmade goods.</p>
<p>There's also the aspect of the building quality. Old buildings that are run down have a high chance of asbestos, mold, lead paint/piping, water/structural damage, animal habitation (and sometimes humans squatting) or other issues. This could make it unsafe to renovate and is a huge risk for investors looking to restore an old building for future risk. It's also a risk for future residents.</p>
<p>There's a socio-economic aspect to this as well. A lot of areas that are run down are run down for a reason - These areas are usually on the borderline of poverty (or are impoverished) with higher rates of crime and violence. It makes no sense for an investor to dump a lot of money on an area that has no money. People that are currently in the area are not going to be able to afford the newly renovated housing that the investor is going to want to charge, and people who CAN afford it are not going to want to move into an area that has a higher crime risk. Even businesses are reluctant to open up shop in a high-risk area. The investor would get next to no returns and lose money on the project. I mean no offense, but look at the types of businesses that are most prominent in low-income areas. You'll see a lot of pawn shops, mechanics and (here in Denver now) weed shops. Higher class areas are full of boutique shops that attract wealthier clients and boost the economic growth of the area and make it more desirable. There are a lot of risks while working in run-down areas - For example, if you were to restore a series of old houses for low income families, you run the risk of those families not taking care of the property and it having to be restored again at a later time - There are a lot of damages that could come out of it based on the generalization and stereotype of the people who frequent these areas.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel that if an area is deemed abandoned and there are homes or buildings that could be restored, the government should step in and assist. In some places, they do this, if the district is desireable. It could be a great opportunity for low-income affordable housing to help in areas that have a housing crisis. &quot;Companies&quot; like Habitat for Humanity could work on these projects and provide more community assistance to those in need. An old motel could be turned into single bedroom apartments for those in times of need (victims of domestic violence, or even student housing).</p>
<p>There's a lot that goes into a decision on whether or not to restore a building for future use. I feel we as a society should look into it more, but the risks generally outweigh the potential profits.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Lots of factors are used to determine if a building is suitable for renovations and repurposing. These factors include the building itself, the community and whether or not a profit could be turned from the renovations for the investor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not a UK only thing. There's a chain of groceries here that has now -on 4 sites that I know of- built a newer, bigger, store directly across the street from an existing one. </p>
<p>Here on the U.S., it at least partly has to do with changing fire codes and building codes. If you renovate that extensively, you have to bring the whole structure up to current code, which can involve additional fire systems, structural shoring, insulation to meet energy efficiency guidelines,etc, which puts the renovation costs well above the cost of new construction. And that is just too get the same size structure... If a larger structure is a business need, then adding onto a building adds a lot if cost </p>
<p>You then have businesses looking at the 10- year costs of operating. A new building with ground-up energy efficiency is going to cost less than an old one that has been retrofitted with energy efficient measures.</p>
<p>All told, new construction for retail is often close to half the 10-year cost of renovation/expansion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general it is much easier, faster, and cheaper to knockdown an abandoned building and rebuild it than it is to refurbish it.</p>
<p>When a building is abandoned, there will usually be a cascade of problems, leaks, water damage, mold, structural weakening, etc. Rather than have to individually repair these costly problems, it's usually much more cost effective to bulldoze and rebuild. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: new buildings can more easily meet the UK governments aims for sustainability/accessibility of our housing stock as they regulate the big house builders. However smaller developers are converting existing office buildings to residential at a high rate.</p>
<p>This isn't the whole picture but I think it will add to what others are saying: With regard to UK housing, we have great swathes being built by social housing providers such as London &amp; Quadrant (in London anyway). </p>
<p>Many of the schemes that these providers are building are grant funded by the Homes and Communities Agency HCA and contain an element of &quot;Affordable housing&quot;, which typically comprise of a mix of Shared Ownership, intermediate rent, and social rent or general needs properties (perhaps the last group is equatable to the old nomenclature 'council housing'). The HCA funding requires these schemes to be scored against a set of performance indicators called Housing Quality Indicators (HQI), which look at room sizes, accessibility and sustainability criteria. </p>
<p>Now many of these social housing providers use these HQI scores as their own key performance indicators and obviously strive for improvements year on year, and aim for the highest possible scores so that they can continue to demonstrate to the funders that they are building houses that will stand the test of time. It is much harder to score highly in these audits if you are converting existing buildings. </p>
<p>To add, there is also a big emphasis on 'Building For Life' at the moment in the UK housing industry (particularly the social/affordable housing side of the industry). Homes should be designed to be adaptable for use for every stage from toddlers to the elderly. This again is difficult to achieve within our existing building stock. </p>
<p>At the smaller developer end however (ie. people building 10-20 flats or less), there is a huge drive of people utilising Permitted Development relaxations in recent years to convert disused or under occupied  office buildings to residential. Due to changes in legislation, these types of refurbishment do not require detailed or onerous planning permissions from local government, so redevelopment of existing offices to housing is up.</p>
