		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assume that we're talking about a body of water where the air temperature is constantly below freezing. The important thing to know is that is that water is MOST dense at about 4 degrees C. The reason for this has to do with the shape of the water molecule, but that's not necessary to answer the question. As water gets colder, approaching this temperature, it tends to sink, so the water at the bottom of, say, a big lake, is going to be that temperature. Once the whole lake is 4 degrees, the top starts to go below 4 C where the density starts to decrease again because of crystallization and becomes less dense than liquid water at any temperature. Hence, it floats. But it also creates a thermal barrier, so it's harder for more ice to form. Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="http://d32ogoqmya1dw8.cloudfront.net/images/research_education/equilibria/h2o_phase_diagram_-_color.v2.jpg" target="_blank">Take a look at this <strong>ILLUSTRATION </strong>and see if you can understand it for yourself</a>.</p>
<p>Well, in most substances a raise of pressure may provoke a passage from the liquid state to the Solid state (Solidification). This happens because the pressure forces the molecules to be closer.</p>
<p>However the Water molecules are further apart when they are in the Solid state compared to the liquid state. It has to do with the geometry of the H2O molecule. That's why at 0ºC Ice as a density of 0.9 (Water is 1).</p>
<p>So when you increase the pressure and force the water / ice molecules to be even closer they pass to a state where they can be even closer: liquid.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I know this is not a proper graphic. It's an illustration. Even if it had a scale it would be useless: engineers use Equations of state because we need to know partial pressure at different points of pressure and temperature (It's like knowing how much of the water goes to moisture / humidity. There is no 100% liquid water with air around it with 0% humidity ). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of factors... But one that is easy to ELI5 is to ask you if you have ever stuck a bottle of pop in the freezer, took it out and it was liquid but when you opened it if froze?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTiC0PZE3sg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTiC0PZE3sg</a></p>
<p>Pressure lowers the freezing point of liquids. The deeper you are in the water, the more pressure there is due to the weight of all the water above it.  Carbonated liquids like coke shown in the video above are under pressure in the bottle due to the carbon dioxide gas that tries to escape the liquid. this lowers the freezing point until you release that pressure with the satisfying &quot;TSHHHHHT&quot; you hear when opening a bottle or can.  This causes the freezing point to raise and it freezes before your eyes. </p>
<p>Fun fact, the reason why ice is more slippery the warmer it is is purely because the pressure of you walking on it melts the ice a little bit. If it is colder out, you don't melt as much ice by stepping on it. </p>
<p>It's also how ice skates work. That blade is pressing down on the ice, melting it ever so slightly and making it slippery. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Ice requires water molecules to move apart in order to assume their crystallized position. Under that sort of pressure of gagillions of tons of water, you simply can't move them apart because the forces involved (particularly hydrogen bonds) are weaker than gravity and its affect on the scenario. Had to add this bit because my first line got deleted by the bot. Elon Musk is right, AI is gonna kill us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
