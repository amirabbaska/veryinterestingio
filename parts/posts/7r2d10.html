But are these rankings always accurate throughout an individual's life? Would, given sufficient repetition, the body adapt to process a certain food (e.g. Pizza) faster?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kind of. I might replace the word ::faster:: for ::more efficient::. The bacteria that thrive in your gut are the ones that eat what you’ve been eating lately.
This is why sometimes we get gassy or weird stools when traveling to foreign countries of different cuisine- your microbiome aren’t optimized for that cuisine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are examples of people living with for very limited, but abundant, nutritional sources, including the native people of Canada in the extreme North surviving off mostly fish and seal, and the Nomadic Bedouin’s living off their camel herds. They did have other plant foods but I believe a majority of their normal daily caloric intake would be similar. These guys aren’t eating pizza though, but natural (not processed) foods so maybe that the s the key?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
