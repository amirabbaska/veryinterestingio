		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So a complete HM(using this abbreviation bc I hate spelling it) is caused by an empty ovum fusing with either 2 different sperm or with 1 sperm that duplicates= 46XX or 46 XY. Basically, only the father's chromosomes are in there. In a complete HM p57 is absent due to the fact that it is maternally transcribed and paternally imprinted. There is NO fetal tissue in a complete HM because the complete HM was caused by abnormal fertilization of an empty ovum. </p>
<p>A partial HM is different. It is 69 XXX or XXY or XYY since it is a normal egg fertilization with 2 sperm. Partial HMs do have fetal tissue (uncleared RBCs for example) because the mother's related genes are allowed to be expressed since the ovum is normal and carries a normal amount of chromosomes. </p>
<p><del>I'll look in my notes for the exact protein names but</del> the way I remember it, there is a protein that must be expressed for fetal tissue to form (p57KIP2 gene), and that protein is expressed only by the mother's gametes. Then there is a protein that is responsible for growth of the placenta(maybe... Some non-fetal tissue but I can't seem to find it in my old notes so far) which is expressed by the fathers gametes.</p>
<p>A normal zygote has a balance between the maternal push for fetal tissue formation and the paternal influence for development of the supporting structures. In a complete HM, there is no fetal tissue formation bc egg is empty and the relevant genes therefore can't be expressed. In a partial mole, the egg is normal so the genes are expressed but the balance is off since there is an entire extra sperm of DNA, so you get some fetal tissue formation but it's all disordered and jacked up. </p>
<p>This is just a medical student's basic understanding of this. I'm sure there is much more below the surface that contributes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you're confusing yourself by focusing on Hox, given that Hox is more important in segmentation than in organ identity. </p>
<p>What's really important is the nature of epithelial-mesenchymal signaling and invasion processes that are associated with placentation. Some of this is probably regulated or mediated by dysfunction in basic cell-cell signaling pathways like Notch-Delta.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cell differentiation has various stages. Before HOX genes, before notch or wingless, before maternal RNA signaling, even before gastrulation and the formation of a trilaminar fetal structure, a fertilized embryo must undergo healthy trophoblastic formation. The trophoblasts form the connection between the uterine villous tissue and the embryoblast. Molar pregnancies are a subset of Gestational Trophoblastic diseases, therein lies the pathophysiology of moles. Normal cell signaling doesn't really kick in until after the morula/implantation phase. </p>
<p>Molar pregnancies result from a single sperm fertilizing an anuclear ovum (80% of cases) or two sperm fertilizing a normal ovum (almost the rest of cases). In the first case, the sperm's haploid genome will duplicate itself before mitosis to result in 46 XX (46 YY is lethal). The second case will result in 69 XXX, XXY, or XYY. Because of the loss of balance and what has to be a very screwed up collection of epigenetics, mitosis becomes severely unbalanced. The conditions required for cell signaling to produce healthy, differentiated tissue never exist in the first place. The &quot;give and take&quot; that needs to occur between uterine decidual tissue and fetal tissue doesn't occur and and the chorionic villi proliferate like crazy in a very cancerous sort of way. </p>
<p>So the ultimate etiology lies mostly in bad eggs that either form without maternal DNA (bad meiosis) or eggs that allow two swimmers in before crystalizing. </p>
<p>(Feel free to clarify parts that I explained poorly or inaccurately. I'm distracted and typing on my phone.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, differentiation of stem cells (like wound healing and cancer) is a chromatin remodeling process at DNA. It's not screwed up and chaotic; it's orchastrated. What happens here is that just after fertilization the recombinant DNA is not viable, so what would normally be a highly specific mechanistic cascade dead ends at abnormal placental growth, sometimes with no fetal development at all (thus, no activated hox) or with just partial fetal development (where inadequate signaling factors don't activate the important fetal development genes like hox). Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
