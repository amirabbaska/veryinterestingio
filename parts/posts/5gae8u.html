		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, it's important to realize that snowflakes come in all shapes and sizes. For example, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/GbkLZKQ.jpg" target="_blank">this chart</a> shows the different kinds of snowflakes that will form under different conditions. You can clearly see many of these shapes in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/CVnnAUU.jpg" target="_blank">this series real images</a> taken at high magnification. Now it is true that most of the flakes on both sets of images consist of flat and highly branched structures. The reason for this typical shape is due to 1) the hexagonal crystal structure of ice and 2) the rate at which different facets grow as the flake is forming. </p>
<p>Let's look at this process in more detail. Snowflake formation begins with the growth of a small hexagonal base, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/dcOAyDs.jpg" target="_blank">as shown here</a>. The reason for this hexagonal shape is due to the crystalline network that ice likes to take under conditions we are used to. What happens next is a mixture of atmospheric conditions and random chance. There are three main processes that will determine the final shape of the flake:^(1)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Faceting:</strong> Different parts of a snowflake will naturally show edges with the same symmetry as the crystal structure of the ice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Branching:</strong> As the crystal grows, some faces can start to grow faster than others. As they grow, each bit of the crystal will develop its own facets. This process can then repeat again and again creating the fractal-like shape we associate with snowflakes.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Sharpening:</strong> As snowflakes grow, their edges tend to become thinner. Again, this has to do with the fact that the edges tend to grow more quickly than the interior so that the flake tends to taper off. </li>
</ol>
<p>As the chart in the first paragraph implies, atmospheric conditions will have a big effect in shaping these processes. As a result, at a given temperature and humidity, certain structures will tend to dominate. However, the exact details of how each flake will form also depends very strongly on the <em>exact</em> conditions it experiences. The problem is that the system is chaotic. In other words, even small differences in the initial shape of the flake or the layers of air it tumbled through can have a big effect on its final shape. No wonder then that it is basically impossible to find two snowflakes that look exactly the same!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I see it may be useful to add a tl;dr here: Ice crystals are like a six-sided prism. This prism grows as more ice molecules stick to its faces. It turns out that under conditions found in common snowstorms, some facets in XY plane tend to grow much faster than the facets along the main axis of the crystal. As a result, snowflakes usually end up looking like flat pancakes with many finger-like branches. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on a little bit to what u/crnaruka said, the growth of snowflakes originally starts with a small hexagonal ice crystal or ice nuclei. </p>
<p>The best ice nuclei (IN) are ones that are in a very similar <a href="http://openscience.org/~chrisfen/Pages/Research/iceImages/ice1h/1h001.png" target="_blank">geometry</a> to of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/725px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png" target="_blank">Ice Ih</a> which forms in our atmosphere. The best IN that we use in cloud seeding is Silver Iodide. Other good IN that are found in the atmosphere are Kaolinite, bacteria, and many others. Ice can grow off of IN in three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deposition onto the IN directly (water vapor freezing onto the crystal)</li>
<li>Condensation on to the IN and then freezing.</li>
<li>Immersion of the IN into a water droplet and then reaching the temperature in which freezing will occur.</li>
<li>Contact of an IN with a supercooled water droplet</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, once this seed crystal is established, an ice crystal can continue to grow through diffusional growth or by riming.
Riming will create <a href="http://www.wmdt.com/image/view/-/39154854/medRes/1/-/maxh/360/maxw/640/-/hdusxfz/-/GraupelvHail-jpg.jpg" target="_blank">graupel (which look like dip n dots) or hail</a> if the collection of supercooled water is high enough.</p>
<p>However we care about growth of ice crystals, which is through diffusional growth. If the seed crystal is in a supersaturated environment the growth will be dominated by deposition. However, as soon as water vapor deposits onto ice, a large amount of latent heat is released due to the phase change. This heat will affect the supersaturation around that area, limiting the growth. So there is a balance between the diffusion of vapor toward the crystal and the diffusion of heat away from the crystal. </p>
<p>The &quot;desired&quot; growth rate depends primarily on the potential gradient around the ice crystal. This potential is not electric, but rather tied to the diffusion. If there is some curvature (which happens at 6 points around the hexagon seed crystal) it will enhance the growth rate locally by curving the potential lines and <a href="http://cdn.iopscience.com/images/0034-4885/68/4/R03/Full/rpp131559fig09.jpg" target="_blank">depositing water vapor there</a> due to the Mullins-Sekerka instability.</p>
<p>Finally, there's still a lot we don't know, but as computing advances are being made, out ability to model this type of behavior is becoming more realistic. <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/static/research/infovault/gravner/Phy_Rev_E-79-2009.pdf" target="_blank">This paper</a> from 2009 had incredible results, given some of the pretty hefty assumptions they made.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It always amaze me when I see such questions asked. I'm all like &quot;how comes was he able to wonder himself such question ? how comes I never wonder about it at all ?&quot; Some stuff just appear to be the way they are, and until someone asks about it, you never realize  that specificity.
Here : I never realized that it was indeed odd snowflakes weren't 3D. Asking that question itself is already a proof of thinking out of the box. Great question !</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I asked a chemical physicist of my acquaintance, who replied:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snow flakes are not strictly planar.  The underlying molecular crystal
structure is not isotropic.  It has the symmetry of a hexagonal prism. </p>
<p>Under crystal (snowflake) growth conditions the lateral sides of such
ice prisms add water molecules from the surrounding water vapor much
more rapidly than do the top and bottom hexagonal faces of the prism
shape.  This is the reason for the final visible flattening.  </p>
<p>The
delicate shapes of ideal snowflakes, with many branchings and vertices
while maintaining close to six-fold rotational symmetry, depends on
details of the motion of the snowflake in the atmosphere as it is growing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
