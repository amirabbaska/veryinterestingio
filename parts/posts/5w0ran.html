		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My wife has been in a coma for 2 years, so I can tell you what I learnt from the experience. It is not medically induced, and her mid brain is damaged. Technically, I am told, it means that she is not conscious, but if we tell her a sad story, she cries almost all the time. Her reflexes are working as spinal cord controls it, so if you pinch her leg or arm, she pulls it. How I understand it, is like it is having a panic attack, where you try to move, and you see the danger in front of you but you are just froze there.
Also, I think of it as an erection, since erection is reflexive and it is almost impossible to have an erection whenever you want without tricking your reflexes. You are trying everything but you just can't make those muscles move. I guess for my wife, it is like that for all parts of her body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Though a coma outwardly resembles sleep, itâ€™s actually extremely different. Coma is when the general state of the brain is submerged into a severe depression level of consciousness. Sleeping has highly organized and complex electrical brain activity. A coma has slow electrical brain activity. Unlike sleep which can easily be reversed, no matter how much the patient is stimulated, he is incapable of becoming fully alert.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what /u/lazyjonesnightmare said, a lot of the time comas aren't natural; they're medically induced to allow the body and brain to recover from an injury or disease.  They can take you out of it at any time but it can be necessary for a complete recovery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coma is generally defined as a loss of consciousness (arousal, attention and awareness) as well as being unable to be aroused out of the unconsciousness. Which is one aspect that separates its from sleep. So in order to be unconscious you have to have loss of coritcal function bilaterally either due to a direct insult like anoxia OR by indirectly damaging parts of the brain stem or mid brain that send &quot;be awake&quot; signals. (One important signals that is released is histamine, and is why anti-histamines make your drowsy). Its important to remember that consciousness is a spectrum as well. So unless the underlying cause is fixed the patient wont awake from the coma
EDIT: TL:DR directly by loss of bilateral cortical function or indirectly by loss of activating systems in the mid or brainstem</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
