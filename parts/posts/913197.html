		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The open window in your car makes your car act as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_resonance" target="_blank">Helmholtz resonator</a>. This is characterised by fluctuating air pressure in the cavity (which you're sitting in).</p>
<p>As to why your ears hurt, that's a medical question that I cannot comment on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Bernoulli principle describes the inverse relationship between pressure and flow speed of a fluid. As air flows past the open window, a low-pressure zone is created outside the window which causes the air inside the car to try to flow out until equilibrium is reached. Because the airflow is not maintaining a constant pressure, however, the point of equilibrium is constantly changing causing the air pressure to oscillate as it chases where it should be. By opening another window, it's no longer a closed system and any vacuum left by air exiting one window is immediately filled by air from the other. You can still detect the oscillating air pressure by the way open car windows sound, but the fluctuations are far smaller.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason for this is the difference of air pressure on the outside of the car and in the cab,  the pressure difference causes your ears to &quot;pop&quot; and can sometimes cause pain, it's the same thing as when you're in an airplane and your ears do this, they also do it when you shut said window.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
