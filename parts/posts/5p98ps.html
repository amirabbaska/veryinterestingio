		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, no.</p>
<p>First of all, there are many things that happen after fertilization that can cause or prevent a birth defect.</p>
<p>Second, for many congenital disorders, it's neither sperm alone nor the egg alone that determines whether the disorder will occur; you have to know both the sperm and the egg to know whether a disorder will occur.</p>
<p>Finally, you don't know which sperm will fertilize an egg, so anything that occurs in a small fraction of sperm can't easily be detected.</p>
<p>That said, there are some cases in which we can conclude from genetics of the parents that the fetus would almost certainly have a genetic disorder. </p>
<p>And there are some other cases where we can conclude from genetics of the parents that the fetus would probably have a genetic disorder, and in some of those cases we can test a fertilized egg to see if it has the disorder. In those cases, we can fertilize multiple eggs in the lab, pick one that doesn't have the disorder, and implant it in the uterus to produce a fetus without the disorder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You theoretically could take and egg and a sperm and read its genetics then figure out if there were any genetic defects in the combination. Sounds awesome considering we could in vitro fertilize right? There's a catch. </p>
<p>MAJOR problem is that each of these items is made up of a single cell and would be destroyed in the process of trying to read its genetic code.</p>
<p>This is why testing for genetic disorders are done after fetus has had a chance to grow and develop. There's more cells.</p>
<p>The other thing is I'm pretty sure we need more than one cell to pull out and map a whole genome anyways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody tests for defects from an egg or sperm. However an embryo as early as 3 days after development (though in practice generally in 5-7 days) can be biopsied and tested for chromosomal abnormalities. After biopsy the embryo is frozen, and once test results are back can be thawed and transferred to mom. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many different type of defects. </p>
<p>Some are present when one single marker is present.
Some need two.
Some need a specific combination of markers.</p>
<p>Some happen during development.</p>
<p>Some genes can be tested for by testing the parents.
Tay-Sachs is a disease that is fatal, and genetic. </p>
<p>It is passed through one mutation in one gene, the HEXA gene. If you have the mutation, and your partner has the mutation, there is a 25% chance the child will have Tay-Sachs. </p>
<p>If you are diabetic, or don't take enough folic acid during pregnancy, chances are higher that your child will develop clefte palate, although it's still rare. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's something that hasn't been mentioned, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_body_biopsy" target="_blank">polar body biopsy</a></p>
<p>Basically, unlike sperm cells, in which meiosis results in 4 sperm haploids cells, oogenesis results in one egg cell containing 2 polar bodies that are basically the residual genetic material from the remaining 3/4 of the original.</p>
<p>People can extract the polar body and sequence that to determine things about the egg's own nuclei without damaging the egg cell, and for now, is sometimes used to detect abnormal genetic copy-numbers. The technique is not entirely reliable, but it might be more related to OP's question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
