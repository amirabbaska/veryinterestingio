		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the printing press.  That's the reason.  I think the printing press is more responsible than any other single cause.  Gutenberg was 1440, but remember it took time for the devices to actually be used for more than religious propaganda.</p>
<p>The printing press allowed for accurate, large scale reproduction of knowledge.  Printed words don't change with people's memories, and with presses, they can be distributed to a large number of people.  This is what allowed knowledge to be distributed and stored past individual people's lifetimes.</p>
<p>In addition, now that there was a large pool of knowledge in many people's hands, it would have been obvious that the knowledge was <em>conflicting</em>.  One person said one thing, another another, about the same physical process.  This is where the scientific method came from - you needed a formal way to determine who was right.  </p>
<p>Once you had the scientific method plus printing press, the current age was more or less inevitable.  Printing press is a method that allows for an ever growing pool of knowledge to be stored.  Scientific method acts like a slow filter, winnowing out bad knowledge in favor of good.  </p>
<p>If you think about it, high density computers are a super-printing press.  All the books ever written will almost fit on your tablet, you can send information around instantly, etc.  And the growing age of artificial intelligence is going to let us fix the other problems - there's too much accurate, scientific information for any one human to know all or even most of it, and we can't store the personalities of our best engineers so their skills are lost when they die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although it is hard to qualify progress, it very well could have been exponential the whole time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+y+%3D++e%5E\(10%5E-2+*+x\)+from+1000+to+2017" target="_blank">This</a> is an exponential function.  You notice the beginning of the curve is pretty flat, not a lot of apparent change until you get towards the end.  </p>
<p>Exponential doesn't just mean fast growth.  It means very fast growth when the values are large, and slower growth when they are small.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short version of the answer is that technological, academic, and economic progress were tepid at best during the dark ages. [Edit: I use the term 'dark ages' here lightly, 400-~1400 AD represented a seismic shift in philosophy that turned toward superstition rather than empirical knowledge. This started changing around perhaps 1000 or 1100 or so; but as with all history, transitions between epochs are generally not neat and tidy. The term is not great, but it's what I've got].  It was not until after the protestant reformation firmly took hold and had a couple generations of history behind it that enough of the percentage of Europe's population felt confident enough being &quot;revolutionary&quot; to seed the mindsets that ultimately led to the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>The Greeks and Romans made good progress in terms of art, mathematics, science, and technology and may have made the jump to an industrial society (or at least birthed a society that did this). By about 300 AD or so they had developed geometery--the same that we learn in high school today, in fact; as well as most trigonometry that we understand today. They had toy steam engines and (analog) vending machines that would do tricks (sort of like those fortune teller boxes from last century). We aren't talking about food dispensing here, more like blessings from the temple god/goddess sort of thing. They had small steam engines, though they never made the leap from &quot;amusing gimmick&quot; to &quot;useful machine&quot;. The machinists and tinkerers were playing around with geared wheels. They were working on problems like surveying, architecture, canals, and what we might loosely call railroads. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria" target="_blank">This guy, Hero, is perhaps the most well known</a> but there were a good many others doing similar things in the region.</p>
<p>The Dark Ages are most often marked as beginning with the abolition of Paganism by the rising Holy Roman Church, most notably with the destruction of the Library of Alexandria under Bishop Cyril. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia" target="_blank">Hypatia</a> is the character to watch there. For various reasons she was seen as a political enemy of Cyril. She was an academic and had a wide following in the area, and was pagan. She was a perfect target for someone with authority who claimed the church as a backer, and who adopted from (other) pagans the idea that the natural world is dirty and dangerous and to be expelled. That mysticism and withdrawal from study of the empirical was the way to salvation.</p>
<p>These ideas were widespread in the church at the time, and with Rome's political power waning it was less and less likely to find practical support for academia, for classical arts, music, math, etc. The church very much accepted the idea that came to signify the middle ages--that the road to holiness involved rejecting empirical study, aesthetic pleasure, fine art, practical trades, and pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. [Edit: yes, the Church did ultimately come to support many academic and art personalities, though those were almost exclusively after the Rennaisance had started. At the onset of the Church's rise to power these factors were heavily discouraged].</p>
<p>There were several times in the ensuing 1200 or so years where it appeared the west was on the cusp of breaking out of this mold, but until the protestant reformation made it possible to foment ideological revolt we lapsed back to the veil of mysticism each time. That is not to say protestant denominations embraced academia or capitalism, indeed many such religious doctrines were just as oppressive of these things as the Catholic Church. But the seeds of freedom of thought had taken root, and the benefits the reformation built into society benefited the intellectuals and the tinkerers just as much as they did the religious. This took off in the late 1400s, and really hit its stride in the early 1600s (Columbus was a 2nd gen product of the initial stages of this process, the American colonies a product of its peaking; 1492-1670ish or roughly the time from the American Civil War to today).</p>
<p>The rise of capitalism as a form of economy allowed ideas and innovations to flourish. If an inventor did not or could not take advantage of something, someone else was sure to see their gadget or discovery and find a way to exploit it. Unintended consequences spilled over into academia, like Galileo using a spyglass to study the heavens instead of terrestrial distances. Even though Italy and the church did not like these discoveries, they were celebrated elsewhere. The fragmentation of political vs. religious power vs. economic power had a significant role in this, though the threads are difficult to separate.</p>
<p>With that fragmentation of political vs. religious power came the capacity for whole societies to evolve with wildly differing variables, some for better, some for worse; most up and down. New economic practices could be tested, new gadgets and philosophies could be fought over without fear of political discipline (at least in some areas). In order to for one power to keep up with another it now became necessary to fund innovation, and not simply wait for someone in their workshop to fiddle around and stumble across something curious--this is where the rise of the great artists and inventors came from. A lord or a state would finance individuals who had a propensity for art or invention (Leonardo de Vinci was one such). This was a distinct break from earlier times in the dark ages where superstition and mysticism and illiteracy combined to keep populations in a quite literal intellectual darkness. Copernicus and da Vinci and others arguably used references from the earlier Classical personalities to jump start their ideas. They picked up where the much earlier generations had left off when Cyril (well, the Church really) had interrupted.</p>
<p>Today, in what we might call 'late stage capitalism', a lot of people are talking about changing economic structures; and that is a conversation worth having. But in its earlier stages capitalism was almost inarguably responsible for the wild success in technologies, philosophies, political, artistic, and intellectual changes that gave rise to the Renaissance (and the subsequent industrial and political revolutions).</p>
<p>One last note--India, China, and many Arab nations did not lose the maths or academics during the Dark Ages. If anything, they gained as many of the individuals fleeing the onset of the Dark Ages in Europe and the near-East ended up in one of these areas; and the early European voyages of discovery brought back to western shores the long-descended notes and knowledge of these people.</p>
<p>These empires did make some use of these discoveries, and indeed introduced many of their own discoveries to the world. Gunpowder, the compass, paper, movable type, and others. For whatever reason, however, they never made the jump to industry. Like the Classical Greeks and Romans, these things remained the purview of the wealthy or the powerful. Or when they were available to the masses, these were simply a garnish on daily life. Why that philosophical shift never occurred I do not know. They certainly had all the materials and knowledge and yet the shift to an industrial approach did not happen until it was instigated by Europeans.</p>
<p>It could be argued that the Chinese, at least, had a mini-dark ages. They set a fleet off to explore the world in the early 1400s (1421, I think); but while they were gone the political powers underwent a seismic shift and upon their return the fleet was mothballed and the empire's interests were turned inward, the outside world was something to be avoided. Would China have made the shift 200 years before the West? <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/china-zhenge-he-treasure-fleet-elite-free-trade-2017-2" target="_blank">A very fluff piece on the topic</a>.</p>
<p>Who knows. What I do know is that as we construct the next evolution of economics and politics in society, we would be wise to consider the long arcs of history and learn from the efforts of those who came before us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion the exponential progress is due to how we value human life and all that it brings. The more we value human life the less we're able to exploit them as a work force. During ancient times we probably could've had some sort of industrialisation but, simply put, there was no need for it. No one needed to invent better agricultural tools or mechanize work because slaves were naturally below their masters. </p>
<p>During the dark ages we had serfs doing work. This also meant that there was no incentive for anyone to invest in tools or mechanization. It wasn't until the enlightenment that we actually started viewing humans as having rights. Rights meant that the serfs wanted to own stuff and maybe even have a coin or two of their own. Thus there was an incentive to invest in inventions. Humans have always invented what they need, and until the enlightenment not much was needed because the elite didn't have to pay for labour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
