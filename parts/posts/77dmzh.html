		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There aren’t really good answers to this question. Therapists have a bunch of different approaches that all would answer the questions in different ways and yet all seem to work just as well. The part of therapy that has been shown to hold a positive correlation with the outcome of therapy is a concept called “therapeutic alliance” which is basically just a metric of the quality of the working relationship between client and counselor. The better their alliance, the better the outcome. This is true regardless of the therapists theoretical orientation which itself has a huge impact on the content of the treatment. Beyond that bit, therapy is consistently shown to be effective, so that’s not in doubt, but it’s hard to show good data about why it works. </p>
<p>From my orientation, I see therapy as effective because it allows people to organize their thoughts and feeling so that they are comprehensible rather than nebulous and scary. But I also work really hard to maintain a good relationship where people feel safe to say whatever they want and feel anything they want. And honestly, I feel like if I can do that then the people will just heal by themselves, just by virtue of having someone they feel safe with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Talking about ones problems can help fix them.  In programming circles this is called rubber duck debugging, where by going over the smaller details of a problem helps one notice details in more depth.</p>
<p>However, this is not what therapy is about.  After all, if talking about your problems was enough, you could just start a journal and write about your problems to yourself, and that would have nearly, if not all, of the benefit of rubber duck debugging.</p>
<p>A lot of therapy comes down to tools, either external or internal.  Externally a therapist might guide a conversation in the right direction to uncover something that would never naturally be noticed, by moving the conversation in a direction that is beneficial.</p>
<p>Internal tools in psychology are somewhat new, and most of the research is shown to be incredibly promising.  The most common of these tools are meditation (which increases awareness of the thing being looked at, just like journaling), a combination of meditation and then journaling right after, and CBT.</p>
<p>CBT takes thoughts about the present and the future that are pessimistic or neutral and then replaces these thoughts with their opposite.  This seems like a sort of 'fake it till you make it' process, but in actuality, most thoughts that seem founded like, &quot;I hate my life.&quot; are not, so thinking, &quot;I like my life.&quot; is a valid replacement and not any less false than its negative counterpart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>See u/rocket_monkey's answer. None of the other answers are satisfying. It's not about understanding your problems. It's not about the tools you use. Its not about replacing bad thoughts with good thoughts (my depression says hi, no it doesn't work). It's the relationship you have with your therapist that's fundamental. I'll expand greatly here. It's necessary to understand how we learn first before we move on to therapy. </p>
<p>Think about how you learnt how to ride your bike, for a moment. No doubt through trial and error, and a little help from a parent or guardian. You repeatedly exposed yourself to being on a bike, learning how to maintain your balance as you went. Your parent coached you through the process. That's basically what therapists do. They coach and help you deal with whatever you're struggling with. They're not advice givers, that's a common misconception. </p>
<p>The brain creates pathways for learning anything through exposure. The more often you repeat something, the deeper that pathway becomes, the better you'll remember. </p>
<p>People are social animals. We are a product of exposure. What we think, and how we feel, today, is largely dependent on whatever it is you were exposed to as a child. That means that if something went awry while growing up because you were exposed to awful parenting, horrible trauma, a combination of both, or whatever else, then you'll grow up maladjusted and possibly with (severe) mental illness. </p>
<p>Relationships are at the core of a person's dysfunction. Either the relationship with the self, others, or both. It's thus the relationship you have with your therapist that's ultimately most transformative. Methodology is of little concern. It's a complicated mess and a difficult process. You can only develop a healthy relationship by talking to that person, hence the necessity for talk therapy. </p>
<p>Exposure to a particular way of thinking and being shapes how you think and feel. That's why every new behavior requires consistent repetition. Talk therapy is one way to help with staying consistent. Your therapist coaches you through the process and helps you when you inevitably get stuck. </p>
<p>You're exposed to a lot of things as a child over which you have no control. The relationship you have with your parents determines much of how you feel about yourself, your place in the world, the quality of your relationships, how well you deal with stress, how safe you feel and basically how you talk to yourself.
If those foundational relationships were lacking in some way as a child, you'll end up maladjusted as an adult and you'd need a replacement to fix those issues. That's what therapists are for. </p>
<p>Who you think you are, what you think, how you think, how you feel, all of that is under your parents' control, well technically anyone you spend considerable time with, until you hit puberty at age 11-13. You're meant to rebel against your parents. You're meant to reject their notion of who you are. You become an individual during the rebellious phase. So if you skipped puberty due to trauma, like I have, because you were forced to grow up fast to survive, you'll have difficulty functioning in every area of your life. You can safely go through puberty in a therapeutic setting. My therapist currently functions as a replacement for the mother I never had. My therapist will never leave me, no matter how awful I think I'm being, as someone with severe abandonment issues, this is a crucial matter. It would be too much for a spouse to handle that kind of pressure. My behavior would just look weird to them. Most would bail. Long-term therapy is a necessity for everyone who struggled with trauma and/or bad parenting.</p>
<p>My number one recommendation to anyone seeking help is that if you don't vibe with your therapist, get another, no matter how difficult. I'm on my fourth and she's a gem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that talking about your problems helps someone fix them-- at least not from a therapy sense (though obviously some people do benefit from &quot;venting&quot; or whatnot, and there are cases where someone refusing to admit a problem can be alleviated by admitting it/talking about it)</p>
<p>but more importantly, therapists help people <em>understand</em> their feelings and give them the tools to cope with them. It's not like a medical doctor where you go in for surgery and they fix you up and you're cured when you go leave. It's more like... a school where you go and the therapist helps you understand why you're feeling what you're feeling and how to handle it, but you still have to <em>use</em> that knowledge to better yourself even when you're not in the therapist's office.</p>
<p>The most obvious example is the &quot;count to ten and take a deep breath&quot; for anger issues or if you have marital problems learning that it's more effective to say &quot;I am feeling ignored by you and that hurts me&quot; rather than saying &quot;IT'S FINE I'M FINE EVERYTHING IS FINE&quot; and then storming off, but those are extremely simplified answers. Therapy may be understanding grief or trauma, and that they shouldn't blame themselves for something, or learning how to handle grief in a healthy way (eg accepting it appropriately rather than ignoring it)</p>
<p>A lot of times people may not even understand <em>why</em> they're feeling the way they're feeling or even what they're feeling. They may just go in to a therapist and say &quot;I had a breakdown at work and I have no idea why.&quot; Then, with the help of the therapist over many sessions, they'll try to learn what's been going on in their life, and potentially root problems and other factors that may have contributed to it (the stereotypical mommy/daddy issues that a patient may have never even realized they had would be one example). <em>Then</em> once they've uncovered why they might be having these feelings they can start learning healthy ways to handle them.</p>
<p>honestly it's all very complicated because there are <em>so</em> many different problems and potential solutions-- there's a reason people have to go to school for a long time to learn about it.</p>
<p>But yeah I guess to sum it up I'd reiterate that it's not that just talking about your problems helps solve them (again, from a therapy standpoint), it's that people need to learn how to identify and handle their emotions and problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>A therapist doesn't just talk, they teach patients techniques to better deal with their problems, techniques they then go and practice in real life.  If you have an anxiety or anger management problem, learning a relaxation technique to get yourself under control can make a big difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
