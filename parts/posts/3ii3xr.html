<p>Doesn't quite make sense to me. How is one of those outcomes guaranteed? I would think it would be possible for you to be an ancestor to less than all but more than zero humans for an infinite amount of time.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's basically a real-life version of the Kevin Bacon game.  If we all start tracing our family trees back, we will eventually get to a point in time where literally everyone all connects together and our trees all come from the same roots.  Those people are like the Kevin Bacons of genealogy.</p>
<p>The reason for this is a little confusing.  If you think about it, your ancestors would seem to multiply in powers of two.  I have 2 parents, 4 grandparents, 8 great-grandparents, 16 great-great grandparents, and so on.  But we know if we keep going the numbers get crazy in a hurry: 32, 64, 128, 256, 1024, 2048.... and at forty generations back you hit over a trillion ancestors that you supposedly would have.  The problem is, that's more people than have ever lived in the entire history of earth.  So it's bad math.  </p>
<p>So the reality is, if you did your whole family tree, you would see that it starts branching back in on itself the further back in time you go.  This makes sense because the population of the Earth was lower in the past.  So as you go back, the pool of available ancestors for everyone shrinks.  At some point, we hit the Kevin Bacon generation - literally everyone alive at that point in time that has a living descendant is your ancestor.  Because every single branch of the tree has crossed every other branch.  Mathematically, it is a certainty at some point that all the lines will cross.*</p>
<p>So what about the other part - the &quot;to none of them.&quot;  Well, if someone has no kids, they fall off the list immediately.  Or maybe they have grandkids but they all die in the plague.  Or maybe they go on for generations but the last heir finally dies off.  Those are the dead ends.  They never reach the point of becoming a Kevin Bacon.</p>
<p>So TLDR if your family tree goes on long enough, it either dies or you become a Kevin Bacon - ancestor to all of humanity.</p>
<p>Edit - the Kevin Bacon Game: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon</a>
The joke is that Kevin Bacon is the center of the acting universe and that you can connect him through his movies to any actor.  For example, Bill Murray was in Ghostbusters with Dan Aykroyd, who was in The Blues Brothers with John Belushi, who was in Animal House with Kevin Bacon.  In reality you can connect pretty much any two actors to each other this way.</p>
<p>*Footnote for math professors: this is ELI5.  It's probably really an asymptotic curve or some shit like that.  Read this guy's paper: <a href="http://www.stat.yale.edu/~jtc5/papers/Ancestors.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.stat.yale.edu/~jtc5/papers/Ancestors.pdf</a>   You all talk like fags and your shit's all retarded.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRQijskAMp4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRQijskAMp4</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a an example of the mathematical process known as a Markov Chain.  The key is the unspoken part of the quote: [Given an infinite amount of time] there will come a day...&quot;</p>
<p>A Markov chain is a sequence of events that are probabilistic in nature.  An easier example is a series of coin flips. Given 10 coin flips, what is the probability that I will have a sequence of exactly 5 heads followed by exactly 5 tails?  No, I don't know the answer off the top of my head*, but the probability is pretty small.  Now given 100 coins flips, what about a sequence of 5 heads followed by 5 tails? Much more likely.  Now given infinity coins flips?  The probability will be 100%.</p>
<p>The birth and death chain is another type of Markov chain. You (and all your descendents) have a probability of having <zero> or <more than zero> descendents. If you have zero dependents, stop.  You're done.  If you have more than zero, you continue to the next generation.</p>
<p>At some point, the number of your descendents will be either equal zero to or will be the population of the Earth.  If it's not (remember, we have infinity time), just keep going.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, you don't need infinity time. You can calculate the probability that in (for example) 1000 years there is a 90% probability that you are either &quot;all or none.&quot;  As for isolated pockets - just wait, they will either integrate or die out (or become a separate species).  Remember, we have infinite time to wait.</p>
<p>TLDR: Statistics, man.  Give a statistician infinite chances and everything is possible.</p>
<p>*(1/2)^10.  Use a calculator, I don't have time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I don't think people answered this quite well enough because they didn't touch on Y-Adam, Mitochondrial Eve and the actual MRCA. </p>
<p>Basically we have two known theoretical ancestors of the human race. Y chromosomal Adam is the dude whose Y chromosome can now be found (mutated of course) in every human male. His contemporary males definitely reproduced, but over time Adam's male offspring had enough more male offspring that only his Y survived. Mitchondrial Eve is exactly the inverse, where everyone alive today has mtDNA that can be traced back to her. This is all theoretically supported by molecular dating (measuring rates of mutations, and then counting backwards from a sample of the diversity of current mtDNA or Y chromsomes). Both of these theoretical people lived over a hundred thousand years ago. </p>
<p>In reality, our most recent common ancestor would have lived much more recently. If you try to calculate how many ancestors you have, you'll quickly run into a problem. 30 Generations ago you would have 1 billion ancestors. That's only ~900 years ago and greater than the population of the entire planet. 31 generations ago you would have 2 billion ancestors. 32 = 4 billion, 33, 8 billion, etc. etc. </p>
<p>Obviously, most of those ancestors must be duplicates, and generations are going to overlap. If there's even the slightest intermixing between human populations, then if someone is an ancestor of anyone then they will be an ancestor of everyone. If you go back, say, 20k years, any individual alive at that time will almost certainly be an ancestor of either everyone or nobody. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
