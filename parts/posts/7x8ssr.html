		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed on both men and women that the muscles that show through your abdomen are sometimes not symmetrical. In my mind that would cause one side to be weaker or have a different range of motion than the other. Am I wrong in thinking that? Why do they have a different pattern? Why are they not mirror images of one another every time?</p>
<p>Any help or explanation would be appreciated.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>None of these answers are quite correct. Assymetrical abs are generally genetic and have nothing to do with working out one side over the other. You're either born symmetrical or aren't. Aside from that, the way you exercise and natural things like one shoulder higher then the other can contribute to how much the assymetry appears but it is at its core a genetic issue (edit: pun intended)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some points to understand first. Complicated topic and my first ELI5 so bear with me. </p>
<p>1) Muscles create movement but also allow movement. </p>
<p>2) Using a muscle is what builds muscle. </p>
<p>3) There are two different types of use: moving and not allowing the move. We will stay with the latter for the abdominals sake.  Think of the abdominals as the foundation of the house. Extremely strong and never moves. Doesn’t mean it isn’t working extremely hard to not allow things to move. (Also for those with any type of pain, a cracked foundation typically doesn’t mean the foundation shows wear, but other parts of the house break down first) </p>
<p>4) less/more movement at an area means it is being restricted via other muscle pathways above or below it (why do a lot of people look like penguins when they walk? back moving too much (flexible foundation), hips not moving enough. Stiff hips, flexible back. The back craves stability/stiffness.  </p>
<p>5) our body is a reciprocal machine, walking, prime example. R leg forward, L arm forward. Repeat. </p>
<p>6) our body has three planes of movement: forward, side, rotate. (Abdominals used for all three)</p>
<p>7) Newton’s 3rd law: equal and opposite reaction. </p>
<p>How we use our body throughout the day defines our posture (read: muscle stiffness). How you sit at the desk will create short/stiff (weak) hip flexors, hamstrings (this takes along time, but we do sit poorly a lot!) (many many other muscles affected as well, just those for this example) This shortness/stiffness means the muscle requires a lot more energy to move. The body is inherently lazy or smart however you want to think about it. I think smart. It’s job is to do what it has to do to get through the day. So if it takes more energy to move something stiff, it will then take another pathway to do the job, all in the pursuit of saving energy.  This typically means walking duck foot, walking like a penguin, etc. So we’ve established how muscle stiffness affects muscle use. Now...</p>
<p>How you stand does the same thing. You’ll notice people have a bias towards standing on one foot. Remember Newton’s 3rd. Weight shifts left (left because 90% of you bias towards left). Trunk shifts right, L shoulder rotates L, head tilts R, R foot rotates out. Now that’s the posture we’re (body) is trying to stabilize to use properly. This inherently creates asymmetry. Asymmetry means different patterns of use. Which means different definition. And it’s all affected by muscle stiffness and thereby strength. (PSA: stretching is not the answer (stretch relieves pain), strengthening prevents pain from coming back. Things that are tight are actually very weak (remember no use means no muscle). Learn how to dissociate hip movement from back/core movement and you will be healthy for long time) </p>
<p>There are several things I didn’t cover but thumbs are tired (on mobile) and I already went deeper than the question required :) </p>
<p>TL;DR: asymmetrical definition means asymmetrical use. Less definition means less use. In this case means the abdominal that is less defined is being asked to move too much and abdominals strengthen by preventing movement (usually in the rotational plane of movement) (2nd PSA: stop training abdominals through crunches, again train in preventing movement capacities: search anti-rotation exercises.  you’ll notice a weakness/lack of rotational movement to one side and that’s typically the side of pain/dysfunction)</p>
<p>EDIT: I should add I’m talking about all 6 abdominals (six pack, obliques (4), transverse) But if your speaking about the “six pack” and the symmetry of the “packs,” the answer above about ligament placement is correct. It is one unit of muscle and you cant contract different “packs” independently. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
