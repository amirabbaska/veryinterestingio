It's easier to imagine if you think of them like buffalo, and then remember what we did to the buffalo here in America. They're actually in the same family (bovinae) as bison, water buffalo, and yaks.</p>
<p>They looked kindof like modern cows, but with longer legs and gigantic horns. They actually looked a lot like modern day Spanish fighting bulls.</p>
<p>People actually domesticated aurochs twice, in two completely separate events, once in India and once in Europe. Today's modern cows</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Very similar. Cows are basically aurochs with the traits we preferred, bred over centuries.
You should be able to imagine cows in the wild.
