		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wood will pyrolyse or thermally decompose into simpler organic (carbon based) molecules. These are given off predominantly as gases. As this happens you gradually get a more carbon rich solid; charcoal. So no it doesn't melt. Even further and you'd end up with something you could probably call carbon which would then melt at 3550 degrees C. </p>
<p>The point is, wood is a complicated material both structurally and compositionally. So trying to apply to it an understanding of the effects temperature has on materials that is normally used for simpler materials (such as the elements) doesn't work. Wood is not made up of lots of indistinguishable hard spheres and so it won't have a simple phase diagram that nicely transitions to solid, liquid or gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wood's main component is cellulose, a sugar polymer that holds itself together so firmly because of a dense hydrogen-bonding network.  </p>
<p>Under normal pressure and under an air atmosphere, you really can't melt wood.  However, if you put wood in supercritical water as a solvent, you can dissolve the cellulose into the water, a similar process to melting.</p>
<p>The key is finding a way to disrupt the hydrogen bonding without damaging the backbone of the cellulose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/marc.201400211/abstract" target="_blank">article</a> may be of interest. Here's the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Acetone containing tetraalkylammonium chloride is found to be an efficient solvent for cellulose. The addition of an amount of 10 mol% (based on acetone) of well-soluble salt triethyloctylammonium chloride (Et3OctN Cl) adjusts the solvent's properties (increases the polarity) to promote cellulose dissolution. Cellulose solutions in acetone/Et3OctN Cl have the lowest viscosity reported for comparable aprotic solutions making it a promising system for shaping processes and homogeneous chemical modification of the biopolymer. Recovery of the polymer and recycling of the solvent components can be easily achieved. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this doesn't focus directly on the idea of &quot;melting&quot;, the mention of applicability to shaping processes sounds about like what you're interested in. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oooh! This is exactly my area of expertise! First, some key terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pyrolysis: Literally, from the Greek, &quot;breaking with/by heat&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bio-oil: A soup of lots of different organic (carbon-containing) compounds which is the primary liquid result of heating up plant matter.</p>
</li>
<li>Cell wall biopolymer: The three main polymeric components of plant cell walls; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose" target="_blank">cellulose</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemicellulose" target="_blank">hemicellulose</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignin" target="_blank">lignin</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, it's important to note that wood isn't a single compound, really. It's more of a mixture of cell wall biopolymers with some additional water and alkali/alkali earth metal content. The important thing about polymers is that when heated, many of them will actually break down before they melt. Cell wall biopolymers do exactly that. This process is called pyrolysis. It's typically carried out at temperatures in the range of 180 - 550 C (350 - 1000 F). Too much higher and everything is gas, which is sometimes desirable but not always.</p>
<p>So what do you get when you do pyrolysis? Great question. It turns out that what you get depends heavily on what you started with. </p>
<p>Did your plant matter have mostly cellulose, and not much lignin? You'll get a mostly-gaseous mixture of water, small hydrocarbons, aromatics, and light oxygenates; and a sweet-smelling, clear-gold-to-opaque-black, viscous liquid with heavier oxygenates, anhydrosugars, water, and aromatics. At higher temperatures more of the aromatics and water, and some of the anhydrosugars and heavy oxygenates, will escape with the light gases. As a result you'll get less bio-oil, but it will be clearer, lighter, and less viscous.</p>
<p>Did your plant matter have more lignin and not as much cellulose? You'll get the same gaseous mixture of small hydrocarbons and light oxygenates, but less of it. The bio-oil will still smell strongly, but not quite as sweetly; it will be more viscous; and it will tend closer to opaque black than clear gold. It will contain more aromatics, and fewer anhydrosugars and oxygenates.</p>
<p>By now you may have guessed that the real answer here is that lignin breaks down into aromatics, while hemicellulose and cellulose break down into oxygenates, anhydrosugars, and light hydrocarbons. <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d5f1/16d8fbd4fd7bd04e03fa2c6f6ca92c61a8c1.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a>'s a good paper illustrating this point. It gets more complicated than that, but that's the basic gist of it. To more directly answer your question, the closest you can really get to &quot;melting&quot; wood is to pyrolyse it at a very low temperature. This will ensure that the fewest products escape as gases, and give you a thick, dark brown to black bio-oil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best I can do I think it extract liquid hydrocarbons from wood gas by heating wood up in an oxygenless/deficient chamber and running it through still(s) and heat cracking units. You will still end up with a bit of potash at the end but the majority of the wood would end up as hydrocarbons both liquid and gas, hydrogen, and water.</p>
<p>Not sure I would consider that melting though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
