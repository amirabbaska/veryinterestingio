		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that, regardless of what language something is programmed in, a compiler ultimately reduces everything down to assembly, which is the barest and lowest level &quot;programming language&quot; that exists. My computer, through some form of sorcery that I don't understand, further reduces the assembly into machine code, which is the actual string of ones and zeroes that the computer uses to do math, compare values, and otherwise make the magic happen.</p>
<p>As sparse as assembly is, the instructions appear comprehensible to me; I mean each line of text is something like &quot;mov ax,data&quot; or &quot;int 21h&quot; 94 whatever. I don't know the significance of any of that, but if I look at a simple assembly program on the internet it just looks like a list of instructions -- I can dig that; conceptually it makes sense.</p>
<p>When I open an .exe file in Notepad, though, it's like the character map puked all over my screen; it's just a random hodgepodge of letters and numbers and ASCII characters and whatnot. What's the actual data I'm looking at? Is this assembly (or machine code)? If not, how does my computer make sense of it? If so, why does it look the way it does as opposed to a list of assembly instructions?</p></div></div>
