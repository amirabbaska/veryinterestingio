Take a thick piece of paper, ideally black paper and cut a 1&quot;x1&quot; square in the middle. Then during the next clear sky sunset hold the sheet of paper two to three feet away from your face and look through the hole. Position it so the hole is over the &quot;border&quot; of where the sky turns from yellow to blue. You should see the green easier then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Optical engineer here:  It is because the atmosphere &quot;scatters&quot; blue light - and is the same reason the sky is blue, <em>and</em> is also the reason you rarely see green. Let's dig into that a little:  Think of &quot;scattering&quot; as when a light ray hits something (usually a particle) it bounces in another direction. The color that is scattered depends on the size of the particle. Since the air is mostly nitrogen and oxygen - which are very tiny particles - the scattered color is blue. That's why the sky is blue (if there were no scattering, the sky would be black and you'd see the sun <em>and</em>  stars...). Now think of a cloud - clouds are made of tiny water droplets, but these are still much, much larger than Nitrogen or Oxygen, so they scatter many more colors -- all of them in fact, which is why clouds are white. (If you want to dig more deeply: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering</a>)</p>
<p>Now back to &quot;why not green?&quot; Since air scatters the blue light the more air light goes through the more blue that will be scattered away - some leaking into space (that's why we are the &quot;blue planet&quot;), some hitting the ground (why it is blue when you look up). So on a clear day the sun may appear a tiny bit yellow because a little of the blue is being scattered elsewhere. At sunset, the sun rays have to travel through much more air as the sun rays are almost parallel to the ground. That means a <em>lot</em> more of the blue is scattered off. And what color do you get when this happens? <em>All colors minus the blues</em>, which means the reds, oranges, yellows, and greens are still there, which all mixed together looks like an orange sunset. As the sun sets more, it slices through more air, and loses even more blues and looks even redder - &quot;blood red sunset&quot;. If you took this sunset light an split it up with a prism you'd see the all the red spectrum is there, most of the orange, less of the yellow, even less of the green....and so on. So the reason you rarely see green skies is because air &quot;filters out&quot; the blues, a there aren't a lot of mechanisms in the sky to filter out red, so the green that is there is always mixed with dominate reds.</p>
<p>Green skies and green flashes come from other causes. If you want to read about that (and see a photo of a green flash) see:
