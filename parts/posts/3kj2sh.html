		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 3 factors that plays a role, when it comes to getting up in the morning:</p>
<ol>
<li>The amount of sunlight:</li>
</ol>
<p>When it's light out, your &quot;inner clock&quot; knows that it's time to wake up, hence naturally making it feel easier.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your sleep cycle.</li>
</ol>
<p>Something tells me, that when you wake up at 7, it's due to an alarm clock next to your bed. When we sleep, we follow sleep cycles. This is a huge subject, and you can do some reading on it if you're interrested. To make it short; there are usually a timespan of 30 minutes in the morning, where it's much easier for you to leave your sleep than others. When you wake up at 9, it's ikely that you just came naturally out of your sleep.</p>
<ol>
<li>The mere phsycological effect of having to get up early. </li>
</ol>
<p>For many people, it's hard to get up early, for the simple fact that it's just early. Nothing to do about this, unless you can learn how to be excited to wake up early. :)</p>
<p>TLDR: Sun, sleepcycle, &quot;OMG it's early&quot;.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question for me for once! So basically, you can think of sleep in terms of three processes, S, C, and Z. Process S is your tiredness based on how long it's been since you last slept or had a full night's sleep. Process C is your Circadian Rhythm. Process Z is sleep inertia (the period of time, usually two hours following waking up, that you are groggy from sleeping). What's going on here is that even though your process S is well adjusted since you got enough sleep last night, your process C is still a bit off since your 23:30-24:30ish internal clock is used to still being asleep at 7. I hope that answer helps, I'm writing this from mobile.</p>
<p>I'm currently a first year graduate student in Experimental Psychology and my mentor's specialty is all things sleep science related.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is due to your circadian rhythm. It isn't feasible to adjust your circadian rhythm by more than an hour a day. So if your sleep schedule has a sudden change your circadian rhythm won't be able to catch up. This is primary factor in jet lag as well.</p>
<p>Interesting note- Some people are more controlled by their circadian rhythm than others. The sleep schedule of night owls is almost entirely dictated by their circadian rhythms. The opposite is true of morning people, who tend to not have their sleep cycles controlled by their circadian rhythm. They instead, and much to their benefit in society, get tired when they are low on sleep (ie the end of the day).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could just be waking up during a rem cycle versus after one. If you go to bed at say, 815, and sleep for 8 hours, or go to bed at 915 and sleep for 7, you'd feel just as well rested because of the rem cycle. However if you went to bed at 845, and still woke up the same time 7 hours or so later, you'd feel more tired than you would just going to bed at 915. Even if you slept an extra 15-20 mins, you wake up in the middle of a rem cycle, which makes you feel tired. Often it's better to go to bed at specific times than guaranteeing a number of hours of sleep, depending when you need to wake, because of rem cycles. There's a calculator for it, not always very accurate, but gives you an idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A little context would help. Were you waking up for something in particular. </p>
<p>On weekdays, no matter how much sleep I get, I wake up knowing I have to go to work, and so staying in bed seems super appealing.</p>
<p>On the weekend however, especially if im excited to do something, ill maybe even wake up earlier than I do on a weekday and be ready to jump out of bed.</p>
<p>Basically, it could be mentally you don't want to do what it is you are having to get up early to do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
