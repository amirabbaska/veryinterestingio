		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept behind dark circles under your eyes relates to fluid retention.  The skin under your eyes is extremely thin, and therefore, more transparent. When you've neglected sleeping one of the responses the body has is in the increase in the amount of the hormone Cortisol. Cortisol, which is sometimes referred to as the stress hormone, will increase blood flow (vasodilation). This is subsequently seen in the skin under your eyes!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bags appear because the skin tone changes and becomes puffy. </p>
<p>Sleep deprivation makes the skin paler and thinner, allowing the blood vessels to show more (hence the dark appearance). This is due to a number of hormones like cortisol altering blood flow. </p>
<p>Once you're well rested the hormones return to normal, and the bags go away. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't 100% but it it's because when you're awake more often, you; 1. Don't receive the proper amount of oxygen your body needs, and blood flow begins to thin out. This thinning out will shrink your blood vessels at and near your eye or possibly bleed, causing the black tint. 2. Your eyes move around a lot, so the longer you're awake and use your eyes, the more tired the muscles in your arm gets, let's excess blood or fluid in the tissue around your eye, giving you the black tint.</p>
<p>TL;DR: blood around your eyes from lack of oxygen and muscle tiredness in eyes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
