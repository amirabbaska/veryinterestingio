		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The evidence appears to be contradicting each other, <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1046496408328821" target="_blank">but a recent meta-analysis from 2009</a> (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Deborah_Diazgranados2/publication/220030881_Does_Team_Building_Work/links/542ebb840cf277d58e8eda89.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>) suggests that there is a significant positive effect in team building interventions with regards to performance. The authors say that the effect of interventions depend on group size, because large groups (without team building) are in a worse starting position than small- and medium-sized groups. Therefore, larger groups seem to get a larger beneficial effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a book I'm reading at the moment called &quot;The Rocket Model&quot; written by Industrial/Organizational Psychology Gordon Curphy. This book presents a model for team building, specifically high performing teams.  His model is based on sound research, and the model is meant to be used to measure and sustain the high performance of teams.</p>
<p>One of his motivations for creating the Rocket Model was sparked precisely by the answer to your question. There is no evidence that leadership courses or team building courses work and that's a big problem. There's not really a follow up process or disciplined process for measuring the outcomes of these courses. So without reliable data why should we expect them to work?</p>
<p>If you are interested, there's a great podcast &quot;The Team Coaching Zone&quot; with Dr. Curphy and it's a good overview of his background, the Rocket Model and the current state of the leadership training industry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
