		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During morning hours your body goes through a number of processes to wake you up and get itself ready for daily activities. If you normally spend all your day sitting and not doing much (as old people and terminal patients tend to), then this is normally the most straining activity your body does all day. Therefore it has a higher probability of straining to breaking point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hospice nurse for my grandfather also said that there's often a lot going on during the day and it quiets down at night, so their brains stop processing outside information, like noise and such. My grandpa was in a coma for a few days and the nurse came over and said to expect to go to bed and wake up and he would probably be gone. Aunt went to bed at 10pm, woke up at midnight and he was gone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I cannot comment from a medical standpoint, but from a law enforcement standpoint more deaths are reported.   This is because the majority of elderly people that die in their sleep are reported when they are found in the morning.  The elderly often go
to bed early in the evening compared to others.  This on top of the people that actually do die in the morning skews the statistics.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
