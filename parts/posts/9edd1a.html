<p>What you see in the movies with massive decompression due to a small, even moderately sized hole, are pretty much fiction.</p>
<p>Fill a balloon with water and poke a hole in it with a needle and you'll get a sense for why it took so long for the air to escape from the ISS.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mass flow rate is related to the differential pressure and the geometry of the opening. In this case the differential pressure is low (14.7 psi) and the opening was fairly small. </p>
<p>Catastrophic failure can occur if the jet velocity has enough energy to make the opening larger by wearing away or deflecting the material.  In that case you have a chain reaction. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pressure difference is 1 only atmosphere, which is about 15 psi. Not much less of a difference than your average car tire to the air around it. Coupled with the hole being very small compared to the volume of air in the station, it's going to to take a long time to pull it all out.</p>
<p>Edit: Reminded by another poster that I was being silly about gauges, a 30 psi tire is actually 30 psi difference with the atmosphere, making the pressure difference of the ISS to space about half the difference of a car tire relative to air, even less if you run a higher pressure than 30.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other responses here are good for a general understanding, but I believe that the question really boils down to the idea of choked flow which you can read more about at this page <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/mflchk.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/mflchk.html" target="_blank">https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/mflchk.html</a></a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>To give you a general idea, you can think of the air far away from the hole in the station as having zero velocity. As the air gets near the hole in the station, it speeds up until it is going at a very high velocity as it moves through the hole. If the hole is small enough, and the pressure differential between the station and space large enough, the flow eventually approaches supersonic speeds. Since the fluid is air, it can be compressed. But as the flow speeds up, the density decreases. When you get to supersonic speed in the hole, the density changes so drastically that an increase in velocity is completely canceled out to the point that the mass flow rate can no longer increase.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So as the equation that I linked shows in the case of a hole in the space station, the only way to increase the mass flow rate is to increase the pressure in the station, decrease the temperature, or make the hole bigger. Otherwise, the mass flow rate is fixed at the choked flow mass flow rate. Since the hole was very small, the mass flow rate was tiny in comparison to the station. If you want to get even more into the subject, look up supersonic converging/diverging nozzles. Fluid flow gets really weird when you get at and above the speed of sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
