		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way.  </p>
<p>Let's say that you're a company that receives a lot of postal mail.  You could have the mailroom receive that mail, then take it directly to the recipient.  That's your computer without antivirus.</p>
<p>Alternatively, your company could have a room directly next to the mail room.  The mail room receives a letter and gives it to the people working in that room.  They open each and every letter and look for the contents of that letter in an old-fashioned 30-volume encyclopedia.  If they find it in the encyclopedia, they throw it away.  If they don't, then they put it back in the envelope, send it back to the mailroom and the mailroom then takes it to the recipient.  That's your computer with antivirus.</p>
<p>Antivirus slows your computer down because that's what it's doing constantly poking at what's going on inside your computer and asking &quot;is that a virus?  No.  Ok go ahead.&quot;  Now, it's a computer program, so it's pretty fast at the encyclopedia search, and it has ways to speed it up.  But, still that takes time.  And, that's why your computer is slow.</p>
<p>For that reason, it's still true that if you want to download and install a large software package (especially an uncommon package), turning off the antivirus can speed up that process dramatically because it removes the &quot;let's check the encyclopedia&quot; check.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cybersecurity Engineer here.</p>
<p>The best ELI5 answer I can provide to you is this:</p>
<p>There's a thing inside your computer called a hard disk drive, and it's where all the stuff that you have on your computer is stored. Getting stuff in and out of the hard drive is a bit like turning on a tap of water in your house - the water can only come out as fast as the tap will let it.</p>
<p>Now, the antivirus software is looking for bad software on your computer, and now and then it starts something called a scan, which is where it looks through all the stuff on your hard disk drive and checks whether or not it is bad or good.</p>
<p>The trouble is, the people who make the antivirus software aren't as smart as they think they are, and after lots of years they still haven't figured out how to do one of these scans without using up all the room on the tap.</p>
<p>TL/DR - antivirus software consumes too much disk I/O on your computer because AV software engineers don't seem to realise that you're trying to use your computer while they scan for malware.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP is asking why <em>some</em> antivirus software makes your computer run worse (compared to others). He even mentions a few notorious brands. </p>
<p>He isn't asking how an antivirus works, or the general performance impact. He is asking about the difference between average and bad. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>the job of antivirus software is to detect viruses. it is not to make your computer run faster. So they don't care about how much they slow down your computer. And in order to detect viruses, the AV software has to do a lot of work. Everything you send and receive over the network has to be scanned. Every byte you read or write  to or from your harddrive must be scanned. It installs special drivers which get a sneak peek at <em>everything</em> your computer does, and that adds up to a lot of overhead.</li>
<li>Antivirus software is generally crap. Don't use it. Serious security experts generally recommend using no antivirus, or using the one  that comes with Windows (Microsoft Security Essentials), which is basically the only one that won't actively endanger you.</li>
</ol>
<p>#2 might be surprising, but the thing is that because AV software tries to be everywhere and see everything that goes on, and has full rights to mess with anything, that also makes it an attack vector: if you can hack the AV software, you've got  control of a tool that already has access to <em>everything</em> that goes on on the computer. That means it can make you <em>more</em> vulnerable. And most antivirus software is shockingly insecure, so using it will typically leave you with a slower computer <em>and</em> make you more vulnerable to attacks than you were otherwise.</p>
<p>Install updates frequently, use a firewall, don't click on suspicious links, and delete your antivirus software. That's how you keep your PC safe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
