Is it my muscles, my brain or something else that won't let me change the direction of movement any faster?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So let's just say that whatever physical limit exists, we haven't found it yet. Here's an example of someone playing a rhythm game at absolutely mind blowing speeds: <a href="https://youtu.be/Sjl19cuzbK4" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Sjl19cuzbK4</a></p>
<p>On the bottom left you'll see a handcam and on the right side of that you'll see a number that shows the keys per second as he's playing.</p>
<p>He uses 4 fingers, but even if you limit it to 2 fingers there are sections where he would be hitting over 15 times per second on 2 fingers.</p>
<p>Now, this is not even the fastest that is humanly possible.</p>
<p>So whatever is keeping you from getting any faster is not a physical limit.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part neurological, part physiological.</p>
<p>Consider this:
Attach your finger to an extremely high rpm machine and force it to tap at 2000 RPM.  Your finger would likely experience extraordinary pain, but would probably survive the experience.  So, it's not a physics question that limits your tapping speed.  What is?</p>
<p>It's partly the speed of your nervous system.  Hussain Bolt has been measured to have a reaction time greatly exceeding the average human, and this is almost certainly due to practice.  He has simply developed extremely quick responses to certain stimuli by repetition, such that the neural paths he uses are robust and conducive to sending signals quickly and efficiently.  </p>
<p>The next limiting factor are your muscles themselves.  Muscles are interesting little machines, they create motion by contracting at the cellular level.  This means that millions, perhaps billions of tiny contractions are responsible for our large muscle movements.  This is, itself, a limitation.  It takes time for the muscles to contract, relax, and contract again.  Furthermore, with this, practice also can increase speed and efficiency.  Muscles, through training, can become not only stronger, but faster.</p>
<p>Lastly, the part -between- taps is a limiting factor for you.  You have to realize there are two ways to get your finger to &quot;return&quot; from the table.  If you simply relax your hand and let it return naturally, this will take longer than actively using your muscles to again pull it back up.  But using your muscles to pull it up doubles the complications from all of the above factors.  </p>
<p>So there you go.  Hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>8-10 per second sound very doable. When will were kids a long time ago, bunch of us in class have calculators equipped with a timer button. It was a time before mobile games. We entertain ourselves with the start/stop race. Most kids start with records of over .1s. by the end, the records were something under .05s for two button attacks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
