		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without going too far into details about the notes, it was essentially a chord people couldnâ€™t figure out for a little while. No instrument or 12 string guitar could recreate that same sounding chord. Later they found out that the frequencies of the chord were so unique because each member played a chord or a note from that chord at the same time, but the piano included an f note that could not be played on the guitar when holding that specific chord. </p>
<p>tl;dr - the beatles threw in a rogue f note during that chord that made it sound so unique.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of like that terrible Facebook meme where two guys look at the same number from different sides and have different ideas over what it is.</p>
<p>The people who listen to it and try to examine the chord and pin down a name for it couldn't reconcile all of the sounds being produced because they used several different instruments, and most people were attempting to reproduce it on a single instrument, or couldn't nail down a few of the notes accurately.</p>
<p>The main members of the band remembered what they each played, but it took some audio detective work and several interviews before a definitive answer was found, mainly because the guy playing piano played a note or two outside of the expected range of the guitars and bass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of really good explanations, but I also wanted to add that one of the issues is that chords have a particular role in chord progressions based on what they are. The V chord, which is based on the 5th note of the scale (D major in the case of Hard Day's Night) has a kind of &quot;finality&quot; to it that makes you &quot;want&quot; to go back to the key center (called the I chord). The part where they sing &quot;cuz when I get you alone&quot; is on the V chord, and it really feels like you're going home when you move onto the I in the next bar.</p>
<p>The Hard Day's Night chord is particularly wonky, since it's sort of like 3 half-chords all layered on top of eachother--it's made of 5 notes (basic chords are 3), and the notes don't really align with any commonly-used pattern to make up a chord, so it doesn't really sit in the ear clearly as having a clear role. It's also the first chord in the whole song (and album/movie!) so it has an extra layer of &quot;suspense,&quot; since you don't know what's coming next. Combined with the way it actually sounds (the bright, clanging tonality), the effect is almost like you have a flashbulb going off in your face--it's disorienting and kind of exciting, and when the afterglow of it fades the band is there and playing loud.</p>
<p>The Beatles weren't the first or the only musicians to ever do something like this by far, but the album is and was hugely popular, and so it reached a lot of people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
