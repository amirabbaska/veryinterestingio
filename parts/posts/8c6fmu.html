<p>Whistler waves are distinctive radio frequency noise produced by lightning, and seem more or less the same wherever you go. This makes it easy to find lightning. Voyager One heard them on Jupiter and Saturn which feature perpetual storms, and Venera heard them on Venus. Later probes showed that on Venus this was <a href="http://esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Venus_Express/Acid_clouds_and_lightning" target="_blank">definitely lightning</a> and also more or less perpetual on the night side. Fairly recently it was also shown that <a href="https://www.space.com/7102-lightning-detected-mars.html" target="_blank">dust storms on Mars</a> can produce powerful lightning.</p>
<p>On Earth most lightning is cloud to cloud and is not a threat to things on the ground. Nobody has photographed cloud to ground lightning on another planet yet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>to ask a different question ( thank you to OP and people responding-- very insightful!)</p>
<p>do we know much about the different layers of other planets atmosphere? do they each have a troposphere and stratosphere magnetosphere etc etc and do they more or less behave in the same way as on earth?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Is there lightning in gas clouds or elsewhere in space? How is it different from lightning in an atmosphere? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
