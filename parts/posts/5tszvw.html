<p>This is mostly for incandescent light bulbs. Changing the temperature of materials causes them to expand and contract. Generally making them colder causes them to contract and heating them cause expansion. A prime example is a hot air balloon where heating air causes it to expand and become less dense. (An example of a rare exception is water ice expanding compared to liquid water.)</p>
<p>Incandescent lights work by heating a very thin wire until it glows brightly. This causes it to expand slightly and when power is removed it will contract again as it cools. When these cycles happen it causes fatigue in the material and it is much more likely to break at this point. Turning a bulb on or off is the most stressful part of its operation.</p>
<p>So switching a light rapidly on and off is basically the worst thing you can do to an incandescent light bulb. On the other hand an LED bulb wouldn't care in the slightest, so it really depends on the technology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably.  Sending pulses of power into things causes a lot of stress on them.  This is particularly a problem with delicate things like light bulb filaments.  Plus it annoys the other people in the room and if someone throws a shoe at the lamp that could also damage it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever you actuate a mechanical switch, you'll create a bit of a spark that can scorch the material.  Over time, this can theoretically damage the switch.  However, for the power levels you use in your house and the materials you're using for the switch, you're unlikely to cause much harm.  This effect is more of a concern for your power company.</p>
<p>In terms of what that switch is powering, there is a potential for harm but usually not much.  For electronics, you'll normally have a great deal of capacitance involved in transforming the AC from your wall socket into the DC used by the electronics.  For motors, you'll need a control board that likewise insulates them from direct connection to the power.</p>
<p>A purely resistive circuit - such as an incandescent bulb - is already dealing just fine with voltage fluctuating back and forth.  However, the mechanical nature of the switch does allow for the possibility of a spike in voltage beyond the normal limitations.  This will probably only happen if you've worn down the mechanical switch (see above).  More modern bulbs tend not to have this sort of problem due to the more complex circuitry.</p>
<p>So the problem you're describing does exist, but it's a bit obsolete with modern equipment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Automation engineer here:</p>
<p>Put your head up close to your light switch and look through the crack, make sure the room is completely dark, slowly turn it on and off, you might (depending on your countries voltage etc) see small sparks in the crack (it works a lot better with something that pulls a lot of power, like a heater, or a kettle). </p>
<p>Sparks damage contacts, over time the contact in the switch can become pitted and will either just break off or possibly weld itself shut, that'll take a <strong>lot</strong> of on/off cycles. </p>
<p>An example I can give you are the contactors at work which we use to switch conveyoring on and off (contactors use 24v to turn on a magnet, which moves bigger contactors together completing a circuit - a contactor is basically using low voltage to turn on higher voltage - in our case it's 415vac 3phase - but it's just a switch). One of those contactors failed the other day and welded two phases together leaving a piece of machinery turned on permanently (phasing). That contactor has been in that cabinet switching on and off day and night for 20 years. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Bulb: only incandescent. Even then, they are good for thousand on/off cycles. Your finger will wear faster.
Switch: Your finger will wear faster. </p>
<p>Bottom line: technically yes, practically not of any significance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
