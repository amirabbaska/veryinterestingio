		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water vapor does, but only slightly so to be unnoticeable.  Water vapor (i.e., humidity) absorbs microwaves in the 3-5 GHz range only on the order of 0.001 dB per km.  For a typical cell tower with 100 km range, this means humidity is only changing this range on the order of 1 to 10 meters or so.  </p>
<p>Rain or hail, on the other hand, can have huge effect, this is actually how our weather radar systems work.  The US National Weather Service's 88Ds are 3 GHz radars, in the same frequency bands as wifi.  The rain and hail won't appreciably absorb as much as it reflects the signal (this reflection is what shows up on the weather radar images).  When you go to 5 GHz signal like wifi, hail cores in very strong thunderstorms can reflect all the signal over very short distances.</p>
<p>Temperature gradients also affect the way directed microwaves travel.  This can result in pulses from say, a radar, being bent back to the ground.  </p>
<p>If you want to experiment water's effect on microwaves you can place your phone in a water proof bag and submerge it in water and see your wifi signal drop. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a radio amateur who is active on microwave bands I can say that the answer is a big yes! What you need to read up is Tropospheric Ducting:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropospheric_propagation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropospheric_propagation</a></p>
<p>Zones of temperature inversion in high pressure areas can offer propagation losses that are extremely small. The most pronounced effect is when the ducting occurs just above the surface of the sea or a lake. For example I once contacted Holland from the UK with only 1mW of power on 2,3 GHz ie about 100x less than WiFi.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Moved 4+ hrs away for my first job and obviously could never get that station anymore, sucked. But once in a great while on super foggy mornings it would come in pretty clear and could jam on my way to work. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I no longer have exact measurements as this was nearly 10 years ago, but we deployed an RFID system using non-standard UHF-RFID chips and high gain antennas (A sector antenna and two high gain directionals per reader) so that users could walk past and be read without interaction. In the winter when the air was dry I had to adjust the power levels as it started reading people up to 20 <em>feet</em> away. </p>
<p>For comparison the location was on the Gulf of Mexico, physically next to the water, so summer humidity could be quite high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on your service, heat/temperature can affect the signal coming to your modem via the coaxial cable providing said signal, which in turn would affect the signal coming from your modem to the router. The signal coming from the coax cable is affected by the diameter of the cable, heat will make the cable expand whereas cold will make the cable contract much like how they affect molecules, the expansion and contraction affect the diameter(ever so slightly but still causing fluctuations in signal strength). </p>
