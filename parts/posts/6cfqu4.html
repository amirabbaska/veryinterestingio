		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, first of all we don't.  Many sports only honor the top finisher.  Examples are NFL (football), MLB (baseball), and NBA (basketball).  </p>
<p>In other examples, where the top three are honored, there a couple of reasons I can think of.  The nature of some tournaments mean that the not every team or competitor had a chance to go head-to-head against every other entrant.  By recognizing the top three, you are honoring a team/individual who may have lost an early round but is otherwise would have been competitive with the top performer.</p>
<p>Also, there is a tradition in horseracing of betting to win (1st place), place (2nd place) or show (3rd) place.  If you only bet to win, only the favorites would garner any attention from bettors.  By having three slots, it makes the race much more interesting and allows for many different betting scenarios and strategies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I tried researching this and found no real definitive answers, but I think it's just traditional for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I think is due to wanting to encourage a large pool of competitors. For example county fairs have traditionally given out grand prize, first runner up, and second runner up, for each category with each one getting a smaller slice of a prize pool or a lesser value item. One prize might encourage only high level competitors, but lesser prizes might encourage lesser talented ones. Same reason many competitions will have performance tiers so more people will compete.</p>
<p>Another might be because many sports actually keep track of standings from competition to competition so the governing body notes competitors standings for that reason. In fact the olympics which I think you're really asking about awards the top 8 competitors. It's just that the top three (again like fairs) are honored in a medal ceremony, the other 5 get an official Olympic diploma with their standing, and all competitors get a participation medal and diploma.</p>
<p>When you consider that the very act of reaching that high a level requires a lot of dedication again it really attracts more competitors if you try to honor and celebrate as many competitor's accomplishments as you can. While the Olympics definitely have an element of national pride to them, the main aim is to promote friendship and good sportsmanship between countries.</p>
<p>You'll find that the three or more levels is much more common in amature compations as well. Most likely to again promote good sportsmanship and celebrate everyone's accomplishments. At the professional level it's much less common, with a winner take all approach being more the norm. Most likely due to how it fuels team rivalries and fan feuds, encouraging more paying fans to attend games, which after all is the real aim of all pro level sports.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't.  Typically we do so in individual sports as recognition of achievement since there can only be one winner.  In team sports, we generally only recognize the best team.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
