<p>More in detail:</p>
<p>1) as a theory of quantum gravity: it is the only known one that works, and has been for a few decades. Since the last 20 years, we also now understand much more about how quantum gravity works in string theory.</p>
<p>2) as a phenomenological model (i.e. theory of everything): string theory by itself is only a framework, or an area of theoretical physics. It is not a unique theory about our Universe, though it allows you to build countless such theories by a variety of mechanisms. Most of these (not all) however do not make sufficiently precise and distinguishable predictions unless you reach up to very high energies near roughly the Planck scale. This is due to a series of factors: first of all the complexity of the problem itself - anything can happen in such a wide range of energies and you should be able to account for all of that while moving in the blind. Another is that there is still a massive number of viable ways to get phenomenological theories from string theory and many of them are difficult to treat mathematically and still have poorly-understood features.</p>
<p>There's been recent discussion that failure to find supersymmetry at the LHC &quot;killed&quot; string theory. String theory needs supersymmetry, but at the string scale, not down here. Low-energy supersymmetry, which is what there is no evidence for, is cool, but it is not necessary for string theory. It's just that it is such a good thing that everyone assumed it had to be true.</p>
<p>3) as an area of research in theoretical physics: it's doing really great. It's grown a lot, and it's gotten wide and deep. There has been a great deal of development in AdS/CFT in the last 10 yrs for example. Most recent string theory discoveries however are too specialized and technical to be explained to the general public (most of the time, even to the average physicist) and so you don't hear about it and it looks like it's dead. It's far from it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I found a similar question asked on Quora phrased as <em>&quot;What is the current state of research in string theory?&quot;</em>, so the answer there might help you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although a great deal of recent work has focused on using string theory to construct realistic models of particle physics, several major difficulties complicate efforts to test models based on string theory.  . .The most significant is the extremely small size of the Planck length, which is expected to be close to the string length (the characteristic size of a string, where strings become easily distinguishable from particles).   </p>
<p>Another issue is the huge number of metastable vacua of string theory, which might be sufficiently diverse to accommodate almost any phenomena we might observe at lower energies.String harmonicsOne unique prediction of string theory is the existence of string harmonics.  . .At sufficiently high energies, the string-like nature of particles would become obvious.  .  </p>
<p>There should be heavier copies of all particles, corresponding to higher vibrational harmonics of the string.   </p>
<p>.It is not clear how high these energies are.  .  </p>
<p>In most conventional string models, they would be close to the Planck energy, which is 1014 times higher than the energies accessible in the newest particle accelerator, the LHC, making this prediction impossible to test with any particle accelerator in the near future.  . .However, in models with large extra dimensions they could potentially be produced at the LHC, or at energies not far above its reach.CosmologyString theory as currently understood makes a series of predictions for the structure of the universe at the largest scales.   </p>
<p>Many phases in string theory have very large, positive vacuum energy.  . .Regions of the universe that are in such a phase will inflate exponentially rapidly in a process known as eternal inflation.  . .As such, the theory predicts that most of the universe is very rapidly expanding.   </p>
<p>However, these expanding phases are not stable, and can decay via the nucleation of bubbles of lower vacuum energy.  . .Since our local region of the universe is not very rapidly expanding, string theory predicts we are inside such a bubble.   </p>
<p>.The spatial curvature of the &quot;universe&quot; inside the bubbles that form by this process is negative, a testable prediction.  .  </p>
<p>Moreover, other bubbles will eventually form in the parent vacuum outside the bubble and collide with it.   </p>
<p>.These collisions lead to potentially observable imprints on cosmology.  . .However, it is possible that neither of these will be observed if the spatial curvature is too small and the collisions are too rare.Under certain circumstances, fundamental strings produced at or near the end of inflation can be &quot;stretched&quot; to astronomical proportions.  .  </p>
<p>These cosmic strings could be observed in various ways, for instance by their gravitational lensing effects.   </p>
<p>.However, certain field theories also predict cosmic strings arising from topological defects in the field configuration.SupersymmetryIf confirmed experimentally, supersymmetry is often considered circumstantial evidence, because most consistent string theories are space-time supersymmetric.  .  </p>
<p>As with other physical theories, the existence of space-time supersymmetry is a desired feature addressing various issues we encounter in non-supersymmetric theories, like in the Standard Model.  . .However, the absence of supersymmetric particles at energies accessible to the LHC will not actually disprove string theory, since the energy scale at which supersymmetry is broken could be well above the accelerator's range.   </p>
<p>This would make supersymmetric particles too heavy to be produced in relatively lower energies.  . .On the other hand, there are fully consistent non-supersymmetric string-theories that can also provide phenomenologically relevant predictions.AdS/CFT correspondenceThe anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence is a relationship which says that string theory is in certain cases equivalent to a quantum field theory.  . .More precisely, one considers string or M-theory on an anti-de Sitter background.   </p>
<p>This means that the geometry of spacetime is obtained by perturbing a certain solution of Einstein's equation in the vacuum.  . .In this setting, it is possible to define a notion of &quot;boundary&quot; of spacetime.  . .The AdS/CFT correspondence states that this boundary can be regarded as the &quot;spacetime&quot; for a quantum field theory, and this field theory is equivalent to the bulk gravitational theory in the sense that there is a &quot;dictionary&quot; for translating calculations in one theory into calculations in the other.Applications to quantum chromodynamicsSince it relates string theory to ordinary quantum field theory, the AdS/CFT correspondence can be used as a theoretical tool for doing calculations in quantum field theory.   </p>
<p>For example, the correspondence has been used to study the quark–gluon plasma, an exotic state of matter produced in particle accelerators.The physics of the quark–gluon plasma is governed by quantum chromodynamics, the fundamental theory of the strong nuclear force, but this theory is mathematically intractable in problems involving the quark–gluon plasma.  . .In order to understand certain properties of the quark–gluon plasma, theorists have therefore made use of the AdS/CFT correspondence.  .  </p>
<p>One version of this correspondence relates string theory to a certain supersymmetric gauge theory called N = 4 super Yang–Mills theory.   </p>
<p>.The latter theory provides a good approximation to quantum chromodynamics.  .  </p>
<p>One can thus translate problems involving the quark–gluon plasma into problems in string theory which are more tractable.   </p>
<p>.Using these methods, theorists have computed the shear viscosity of the quark–gluon plasma.  . .In 2008, these predictions were confirmed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory.Applications to condensed matter physicsIn addition, string theory methods have been applied to problems in condensed matter physics.   </p>
