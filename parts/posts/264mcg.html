<p>We are Denis Malyshev (/u/danmalysh), Kiran Dhami (/u/kdhami), Thomas Lavergne (/u/ThomasLav), Yorke Zhang (/u/yorkezhang), Elie Diner (/u/ediner), Aaron Feldman (/u/AaronFeldman), Brian Lamb (/u/technikat), and Floyd Romesberg (/u/fromesberg), past and present members of the Romesberg Lab that recently published the paper <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v509/n7500/full/nature13314.html" target="_blank">A semi-synthetic organism with an expanded genetic alphabet</a>  </p>
<p>The Romesberg lab at The Scripps Research Institute has had a long standing interest in expanding the alphabet of life.  All natural biological information is encoded within DNA as sequences of the natural letters, G, C, A, and T (also known as nucleotides). These four letters form two “base pairs:” every time there is a G in one strand, it pairs with a C in the other, and every time there is an A in one strand it pairs with a T in the other, and thus two complementary strands of DNA form the famous double stranded helix.  The information encoded in the sequences of the DNA strands is ultimately retrieved as the sequences of amino acids in proteins, which directly or indirectly perform all of a cell’s functions.  This way of storing information is the same in all organisms, in fact, as best we can tell, it has always been this way, all the way back to the last common ancestor of all life on earth.</p>
<p>Adding new letters to DNA has proven to be a challenging task: the machinery that replicates DNA, so that it may be passed on to future generations, evolved over billions of years to only recognize the four natural letters.  However, over the past decade or so, we have worked to create a new pair of letters (we can call them X and Y for simplicity) that are well recognized by the replication machinery, but only in a test tube.  In our recent paper, we figured out how to get X and Y into a bacterial cell, and that once they were in, the cells’ replication machinery recognized them, resulting in the first organism that stably stores increased information in its DNA.</p>
<p>Now that we have cells that store increased information, we are working on getting them to retrieve it in the form of proteins containing unnatural amino acids.  Based on the chemical nature of the unnatural amino acids, these proteins could be tailored to have properties that are far outside the scope of natural proteins, and we hope that they might eventually find uses for society, such as new drugs for different diseases.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the most popular comments this work received was concern about the synthetic bacteria escaping into the natural environment. I think the first thing to keep in mind with this new biotechnology is that they are entirely dependent on X and Y nucleotides being made available to them by our synthetic chemists. There is no replication of X and Y outside of our laboratory setting, especially in the absence of artificial X and Y. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How many H bonds between X and Y? Also do you have an image of their structures? </p>
<p>Do X and Y allow for extremely specific primer bonding, or do they even bind as primers at all? </p>
<p>Have you successfully incorporated these bp's into ss or ds RNA?</p>
<p>Are you able to sequence these new base pairs easily? I assume you had to develop some dideoxynucleotides corresponding to X and Y, no?</p>
<p>Do you have to supply these bacteria with X and Y so they continue to propogate it throughout their genome? If so, what happens to the daughters of the control bacteria which have X and Y in their genomes, but don't receive the X and Y nucleotides and how do their sequences compare to the mother cell?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you could use this for the treatment of chronic genetic mutations? make a virus with the expanded alphabet that get inside our cells repairs enhances etc then it disappears because it could not get its amino acids, naturally so its growth could be controlled by the supply of said amino acids, that would make the virus safe and would not mutate and replicate uncontrollably inside our body, like cancer</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
