		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually the skin used for skin grafts has been meshed---cut into a sort of honeycomb pattern using a machine. This allows a smaller skin graft to cover a large area of skin, and curve to fit the shape of the body. The problem is, that the lines of the mesh will show up in the healed skin.</p>
<p>There are two ways around this. One is not to do the meshing. The problem with this, is that more skin is needed for the graft, leading to more scaring and pain at the donor site. The other is to use a different type of graft: new technology is allowing skin to be &quot;grown&quot; in the lab, using the patient's skin cells. This takes more time, as the cells need to be taken to a lab and grown up, so it's not helpful for emergency surgeries, but is used in other cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>even full grafts do not look the same as the rest of your skin it just doesn't have the fish net pattern. I'm not sure if they will ever be able to perform a flawless graft.
The scar site is active for atleast a year after surgery, pressure garmets are used to help with scarring, but since the human body is always moving, growing, and not perfectly flat it's hard to get a consistent pressure on the area. my daughter burnt  her arm/hand when she was just under 2 years old. It sucks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surgeon here. </p>
<p>There are different forms of skin grafts, but the two most common are split thickness and full thickness. Split thickness is often meshed to allow it to cover more area (and typically takes  better) whereas full thickness typically look better. </p>
<p>The reason that skin is meshed is that you only take a portion of the dermal layer and the donor area will heal on its own. On a full thickness graft, the original donor has to be sutured shut. Meshed grafts look worse.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that a scar takes about 18 months to fully form. It softens and the color matches better with time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm no expert so I don't know how it works for very bad severe 3rd degree burns. Is there a doctor that had experience with this that can answer?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Letâ€™s also remember that due to the nature of deep burn injuries that the underlying fat layers underneath the skin are also damaged and often removed in the debridement. Any grafting of these fascial deep debridements will not look normal in any way shape or form due to missing that fatty layer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
