		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you mean by seeing. Seeing in the visible means picking up the light field of many fundamental emitters. You cannot resolve the structure of an atom with light in the visible wavelength regime as the atom is already the fundamental emitter. But you can still associate emissions to single atoms if you separate them far enough. That's something that for example can be done with optical lattices where you store single atoms in regular grids that are made from laser fields. <a href="https://www.mpg.de/1230541/zoom-1300288025.jpg" target="_blank">These pictures</a> are 'drawn' by altering the state of single atoms in such a grid - each pixel is one atom. You can also distinguish the emissions of single atoms in ion traps, where they usually are spaced even further apart as it is done <a href="http://www.quantumoptics.at/images/lintrap/8ionen.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>. In each case you have to shine light of certain resonant frequency at the atoms so that they are excited again and again and therefore produce sufficiently many photons that you can detect the fluorescence.</p>
<p>Mind that you do not resolve the atoms and that the pictures are blurred out such that the fluorescence looks much larger then the actual atoms. This is not only a purely technical limitation - you can resolve patterns at the order of the wavelength that you are using for imaging and for visible light this wavelength is significantly larger than atoms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have seen gold atoms in a transmission electron microscope in Swansea Universities Engineering building, but it is not possible to see atoms with an optical microscope as light will begin to interfere with itself at high magnifications. The smallest item you can really look at with an optical microscope is around 100nm, the carbon atom in your question is around 70pm, which is around 1000 times smaller than an optical microscope can resolve. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slightly related, but they have managed to visualize the orbital structure of a hydrogen atom. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first direct observation of the orbital structure of an excited hydrogen atom has been made by an international team of researchers. The observation was made using a newly developed &quot;quantum microscope&quot;, which uses photoionization microscopy to visualize the structure directly. The team's demonstration proves that &quot;photoionization microscopy&quot;, which was first proposed more than 30 years ago, can be experimentally realized and can serve as a tool to explore the subtleties of quantum mechanics.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplistic answer is no. An atom is smaller than the wavelength of visible light</p>
<p>But, I once worked in the semiconductor measurement business, where I designed systems that could resolve .006 microns (6 sigma) with visible light, using software and lots of sampled data</p>
<p>In the quantum world, our intuition isn't perfect, and simplistic answers are rarely correct</p>
<p>I suspect the answer is still no, even with brilliant software. AFIK, the state of the art is scanning tunneling microscopy</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>These are atom-sized crystal impurities that fluoresce and for all intends here act atom-like. They are easy to focus with a [confocal microscope] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy</a>) and you can easily collect several hundred thousands of photons per second from a single one.</p>
<p>You could perceive that as a dim speckle of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
