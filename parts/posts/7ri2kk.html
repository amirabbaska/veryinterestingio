		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best explanation right now seems to come down to two main factors.</p>
<p>1) Liver cells (called hepatocytes) have a relatively high rate of division in response to acute injury, which allows them to replace liver cells that have been damaged or are missing. This is similar to skin cells (fibroblasts and keratinocytes), but unlike, for example, heart cells (cardiomyocytes) which have an exceptionally low rate of division.</p>
<p>2) A special type of liver regeneration helper cells called &quot;hybrid hepatocytes&quot; was recently discovered by a group at UCSD, which appear to facilitate regeneration and reduce the risk of tumor formation (which can be an unfortunate side-effect of attempts at regenerative therapies).</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks to /u/Mr_Stitch for clarification on maintenance vs acute injury replacement rates for hepatocytes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to these other answers, it should be stated that the liver DOES NOT regenerate like you're likely imagining.  It's not like a starfish, no complex structure is rebuilt.</p>
<p>A standard liver has two lobes, each with its own major artery.  During a liver transplant, one lobe is removed and transplanted.  In both donor and recipient, the half liver they're left with just swells up to occupy the space given and meet needed capacity rather than regrowing the other lobe. They can't donate again after the first.  </p>
<p>It's very much like donating a kidney.  You're left with half of what you had before, but it amps up to meet the body's needs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you lost, say, half of your heart, and evolution blessed you with the ability to have a regenerating heart, you wouldn’t live anywhere near long enough for it to save your life.  This generally applies to most vital organs, hence, it’s never been a trait that’s been passed down since we’ve only had modern medicine that allows you to survive situations where vital organs are heavily damaged and survive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because that's how the liver evolved to work.</p>
<p>It keeps toxins in cells so they die and removed via lymphatic system.</p>
<p>This process necessitated rapid cellular regeneration in order to replenish lost cells rapidly so the liver can continue to perform its function. A side effect of this is it can regenerate other kinds of damage as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The liver is not very complex, from an anatomical perspective. It’s a bunch of hexagonal cells with blood vessels and bile ducts. Those cells can reproduce and grow back without having to form complex structures, they just go back to the hexagonal pattern. </p>
<p>Think of your skin. If you get a cut, the same skin cells multiply and fill in the cut. The skin is fairly consistent in structure. Compare this to a kidney, which is made up of complex structures like glomerulus, collecting ducts, blood vessels, and juxtaglomerular apparatus. Rebuilding that is complicated, the body can’t grow those structures back easily and may just scar over. The liver is consistently structured like the skin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
