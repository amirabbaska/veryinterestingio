<p>EDIT: I am not only talking about life on earth. I am just wondering that in a scale of 0 Kelvin to infinite Kelvin, why are we alive at around 300 Kelvin? Could there be a planet with a temperature of 5000 Kelvin where there is (concsious) life in theory?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I won't attempt to answer the question, but as a geologist I have to correct your basic assumptions concerning the temperature range of Life As we Know It (LAWKI).</p>
<p>The uppermost temperature we know of for living and active metazoans (complex multicellular life) is at the edge of actively venting black smokers, where worms of the species <em>Alvinella pompejana</em> have been observed &quot;just chilling&quot; at temps of 80째 C (and at a pH of about 3.5). When it comes to an uppermost limit for microbes and extremophiles, it might even be necessary to go even higher. For instance, in Mississippi Valley type Pb-Zn deposits there is ample evidence for the fractionation of sulphur isotopes from biogenically mediated sulphate reduction up to about 120째 C.</p>
<p>So a revised statement would have to be from about -40째 C  up to 120째 C; or a range of 160 degrees if you'd rather see it that way. And I'd check that lower limit as well; there has been a lot of recent work on extremophiles and I'd look into data on cryophiles (with which I am admittedly unfamiliar) just to be on the safe side if I were you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any water based life form would require the temperatures and pressures to be around those required for H2O to be liquid. Other life could theoretically exist at temperatures and pressure outside that range, but would have to be based on a different solvent. For example, ammonia based life would require much colder temperatures.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bond enthalpies for chemical formation probably form the basis for an upper limit.  </p>
<p>As for a lower limit, I would guess that the limit would be the coldest solvent capable of interacting with a large enough set of molecules.  Water is a really awesome solvent for a lot of things, so we have a large number of really interesting life forms.  Maybe on a planet cold enough for a liquid nitrogen environment some crazy thing evolved.  A more educated individual might comment here on which solvents are more likely, as I'm fairly certain liquid nitrogen isn't one of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Life is really just a bunch of atoms held together with chemical bonds. It's very unlikely that life could exist at extremely high temperatures like the 5000 K you mentioned in your post because at these temperatures, the chemical bonds will break and you would just be left with a bunch of atoms floating around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what your definition of life is. If you mean locally entropy-minimizing self-replicating assemblages of baryonic matter that evolved naturally from simple precursors, then water+carbon may be the only game in town.</p>
<p>If your definition includes non-evolved (I.e. designed) systems - aka machines - then it is conceivable that complex self-sustaining and/or self-replicating systems could exist on more exotic substrates (say, in electrical and magnetic structures in liquid helium, or plasma, or perhaps something we're not yet aware of like dark matter or dark energy).</p>
<p>One possible solution to the Fermi paradox (if the universe is so big, where are the aliens?) might be that advanced civilizations inevitably move off of water-carbon substrates onto other more exotic ones as their technology advances, and that they then become unrecognizable/undetectable to us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
