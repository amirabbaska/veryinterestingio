		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat-seeking missiles home in on the heat being generated by the jet's engine. Countermeasure flares are launched out of an aircraft and immediately ignite in a <em>very</em> hot flame. Now instead of seeing only one big hot target the missiles sees a dozen targets, and has to choose one. </p>
<p>There is a constant battle between missile engineers and countermeasure engineers to design better and better systems. Missiles that can more accurately discriminate between an engine and a flare, and flares that can more accurately simulate the heat of an engine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: Flares only work against missiles that are heat-seeking.  The flares burn intensely and create a lot of heat which intends to trick the missile into guiding on the flare itself.  If the missile stops guiding onto the target aircraft and instead guides on the flare, then the target aircraft survives and the flare served its purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radar-guided missiles are not distracted by flares. For radar-guided missiles, the target will deploy <em>chaff</em> - aluminium coated mylar strips which form a cloud that reflects and confuses the radar on the missile so that the missile misses the target.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other replies have already answered the question, but one thing that gets missed by many is that people who design missiles are continuously developing counter-countermeasures. If the bad guys are able to design a flare that actually works, the missile guys are going to work on software that ignores them or defeats the flare in some other way, or develop a new missile that isn't affected by the flare. Many modern IR missles aren't just seeking hot spots like older systems, they have imaging sensors and flare rejection logic - flares just don't look like a plane. On top of that, it's all about probabilities. It's not like a video game where launching flares causes a missile to miss every time, nor is a missile going to hit the target every time even in good circumstances. There's a never ending cycle of weapon and defense development that goes back to antiquity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
