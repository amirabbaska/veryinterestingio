<p>Consider my three dimensional equivalent to this surprising fact:</p>
<p>A sphere of fabric shrouds the earth. How many additional square meters of fabric would allow the fabric to hover 1 meter above the ground?</p>
<p>I suspect the answer will not be as surprising as the two-dimensional situation...Are the two situations even &quot;intrinsically/mathematically&quot; related?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The disconnect and surprise likely comes from thinking that since the radius and circumference of Earth are already large that changes to them must be equally large. Or maybe it's in thinking that the extra 6.3 meters of rope have to somehow be stretched and distributed across the entire world. I don't know. Anyway, that's clearly not the case since you really would only need an extra 6.3 meters.</p>
<p>The circumference <em>C</em> scales <em>linearly</em> with the radius <em>r</em>, to wit, <em>C</em> = 2π<em>r</em>. So if you increase <em>r</em> by 1 unit, you will <em>always</em> get an increase in <em>C</em> of only 2π units, no matter how large the radius is. If the magical rope were around Jupiter or the Sun or the largest known star, you would still need only an extra 2π-meters of rope to get an extra 1-meter of radius.</p>
<p>Surface area <em>A</em>, on the other hand, scales <em>quadratically</em> with the radius, to wit, <em>A</em> = 4π<em>r</em>^(2). So the increase in <em>A</em> achieved by a 1 unit increase in <em>r</em> actually changes with the current value of <em>r</em>. In fact, a fixed increase in radius gives a larger increase in area the larger the radius is already.</p>
<p>Specifically, suppose you want to increase the radius by <em>dr</em> units. Then</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>dA</em> = 4π(<em>r</em> + <em>dr</em>)^(2) - 4π<em>r</em>^(2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <em>dr</em> is the increase in radius. We can rewrite this as</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>dA</em> = 4π( <em>r</em> + <em>r</em> + <em>dr</em>)<em>dr</em> = 8π<em>R</em> <em>dr</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <em>R</em> is the average of the old and new radius. If <em>dr</em> is small compared to <em>r</em>, then <em>R</em>, <em>r</em>, and <em>r</em>+<em>dr</em> are all approximately equal. Note that for fixed <em>dr</em>, <em>dA</em> scales linearly with <em>R</em>. So the larger the radius already is, the bigger the resulting increase in area for a fixed increase in radius.</p>
<p>Putting <em>dr</em> = 1 meter, we find that for the fabric to hover above the surface by 1 meter, we would need <a href="http://tinyurl.com/jfmckjw" target="_blank">about an extra 160 km^(2) or 62 mi^(2)</a> of fabric.</p>
<hr />
<p>In fact, all we are really doing is computing the <em>derivative</em> of the circumference and surface area with respect to the radius, a concept familiar to calculus students. The derivative of <em>C</em> with respect to <em>r</em> is just 2π, which is constant. This means that any increase in <em>r</em> gives a proportional increase in <em>C</em>, and that proportion is the same no matter how larger <em>r</em> already is. The derivative of <em>A</em> with respect to <em>r</em> is 8π<em>r</em>, and we actually write this as</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>dA</em>/<em>dr</em> = 8π<em>r</em>  ===&gt;  <em>dA</em> = 8π<em>r</em> <em>dr</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we wanted to examine an analogous problem for volume, we would note that <em>V</em> = (4π/3)<em>r</em>^(3), so that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>dV</em>/<em>dr</em> = 4π<em>r</em>^(2) ===&gt; <em>dV</em> = 4π<em>r</em>^(2) <em>dr</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that for volume, for a fixed increase in radius, the resulting increase in volume grows much faster than for surface area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Going from a 10&quot; to 14&quot; pizza is super cost efficient. Typically restaurants will scale their prices linearly, but the area scales <del>exponentially</del> quadratically  (A=PI*R^2)</p>
<p>A 10&quot; pizza is roughly half the size of a 14&quot; pizza, but rarely half the cost. So if you're out with friends, don't buy multiple small pizzas. Buy one Jumbo, you'll save a bunch of money and probably have leftovers!</p>
<p>MMMMMMM.... Pizza Pi ;)</p>
<p>EDIT: TIL I'm not a <strong>true</strong> mathematician. Just a guy that likes pizza.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There's no weird gravity trick going on, OP just phrased it weirdly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well the 6.3 is just from 2π (6.2831), as you're looking to increase the radius of a circle (call this r) by 1, your extra circumference is simply 2π(r+1) or 2π*r + 2π.</p>
<p>For an area, you can do the exact same. To have it hovering 1m above the ground, increase the radius by 1. The formula for surface area, A = 4πr^2, so in this case, you want 4π(r+1)^2, which using high school quadratic expansion gives you:</p>
<p>A_new   =   4π(r^2 + 2r + 1)   =   4πr^2 + 8π r + 4π. </p>
<p>So, interestingly in this case, the amount of extra fabric needed is proportional to how big it is already. Which intuitively makes sense: if you think about adding 1m to a rope, you just get an extra meter of rope. For a large square of fabric, you need to know how long and wide it is before you know how much fabric to add. </p>
<p>So, given a radius of 6 371 000m for the earth (and you already have 4πr^2 of fabric), the math is: </p>
<p>A_diff = A_new - A = 8πr + 4π = 4π<em> (2r+1) = 12.566 </em> (2* 6 371 000 + 1) m^2</p>
<p>That's 160 116 000 m^2 or =roughly a 12.6 x 12.6 km (8 x 8 mile) patch of fabric to add! That's 47 central parks (or 116 Hyde Parks if you're British).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
