		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: I've tried to answer the question from the perspective of immediate changes to microbial activity when eating a variety of foods during the day. I haven't considered changes in gut microbe populations in response in longer term dietary change (e.g. moving to a keto-diet). Such changes can be profound and micorbial populations do-rearrange to reflect the make up of your diet; <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v505/n7484/full/nature12820.html" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v505/n7484/full/nature12820.html</a></p>
<p>In the human gut there aren't really many microbes specialised to eat things that you <del>can not</del> don't consume. For instance, we are not a ruminant (i.e. cows) so we lack bacteria specialised to digest cellulose (one component of dietary fibre). EDIT: For a treatment on the things your gut microbes digest but you do not please read /u/Serbish's excellent treatment of this at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5888p7/when_you_eat_various_foods_fruits_meats/d8zlegf" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5888p7/when_you_eat_various_foods_fruits_meats/d8zlegf</a></p>
<p>But one general principle that microbes follow is that when food is plentiful they will become more active and multiply more rapidly. When food is not so plentiful they will be less active and replicate less. Some microbes are even able to enter a form of stasis/suspension and some can form &quot;inactive&quot; spores for situations where there is absolutely no food stuff available and they need to survive until food re-appears.</p>
<p>In general though, the bacteria in your gut eat the same things you do and in a very real sense are in direct competition with you to extract the nutrient value of anything in your gut. </p>
<p>It's worth considering what your gut microbes and your gut actually &quot;sees&quot; when food reaches you digestive system:</p>
<p>Things start in your mouth, you chew food breaking it up through mechanical action and this will let your saliva and digestive juices get in amongst the food throughout the digestive process. Incidentally this is why it is good to chew thoroughly. In this first step the digestive enzymes in your saliva start to breakdown the food at the molecular level, famously amylase begins the breakdown of starches in to simple sugars. Next in the stomach, gastric acid begins the breakdown of proteins, it has a strong denaturing effect and causes proteins in your food to &quot;unravel&quot; and this makes them easier to digest. Once unravelled a different suite of enzymes can begin to break the proteins up in to single amino acids or short poly-peptides (short strings of two to twelve amino acids).</p>
<p>At this point the chewed, semi-digested food in your stomach is called Chyme. In the next step the chyme passes out of your stomach and in to your small intestine, in to a portion called the Duodenum. This is the first point in digestion that your gut microbe population can really compete with you for the partially digested food. However the initial portions of the small intestine are quite inhospitable to bacteria and the bacterial population rises only as you get further from the stomach and travel down the small intestine. In the duodenum your body secretes bile and pancreatic juice, these are critical for the next steps in digestion. Bile acts as a surfactant (think of soap) to breakdown fats and allow them to dissolve readily for digestion, this additionally helps destroy cell <del>walls</del>membranes (which are made from fats) and this in turn releases the cell contents in to the intestine (e.g. more digestible proteins, DNA, vitamins, etc...). Pancreatic juice contains many more enzymes specialised to break up DNA, proteins and fats into their component molecules. The aim of all this is to break up your food into the component molecules so that they are tiny enough to be absorbed by the rest of your intestine. In doing so your gut is also creating a nutrient rich soup of simple sugars, amino acids and simple lipids, this is also the ideal food stuff for your gut microbes and they are highly adapted to eat (absorb and utilise) all the products of your digestion. Every time your eat you provide and huge surge of useful food stuff to your gut microbes and you're doing much of the digestion for them. So after eating, when the chyme gets to them, there will be surge of activity and multiplication of your gut microbes.</p>
<p>Between meals as the chyme passes further along your gut it gets less and less nutritious. Your small intestine absorbs what you need into your blood steam and the microbes consume much of the rest. Once the chyme arrives at the large intestine if it is very poor in nutrients but there is still enough to support a great deal of microbial activity. This is where your gut microbe population begins to peak. Much of the role of your large intestine is to compact the remaining nutrient-poor solids in to faeces and to recover any useful water. In the meantime the microbial population makes use of anything your were unable to absorb. Eventually the bulk of the solid matter of your faeces is the undigestable fibre in your diet and trillions of dead bacteria. The lifespan of any individual microbe in your gut is not long (hence why they are continually rapidly replicating). Interestingly somewhere between 40 and 60% of your stool/faeces is composed of dead bacteria.</p>
<p>Of course there are some things that people eat which we are often not well adapted to digest, inulin (found in artichokes) and lactose (found in milk and dairy). Your gut microbes are more than capable of breaking these down (in to simple sugars) and using these as food for themselves. This type of microbial digestion is frequently the cause of the wind we associate with beans and artichokes and is a possible cause of the digestive discomfort lactose-intolerant people report.</p>
<p>Edit: To clarify there aren't bacteria adapted to process fruits, meats and vegetables because they aren't exposed to these items, they are exposed to chyme (in its increasingly digested state. All bacteria in your gut are competent to absorb lipids, amino acids and DNA (as nucleotides) and almost all bacteria in your gut can take up and utilise most mono- and di- saccharides (the simplest sugars). Different bacteria will be adapted to living in different portions of your gut (the duodenum, the illeum, the colon etc...) and the chyme at those differing locations will have a different nutrition profile so bacteria in differing locations can be optimised to extract whatever is left as the chyme passes.</p>
<p>Edit: Additionally different bacteria are adapted to absorbing different nutrients and when the chyme has a certain make up, say high in fats, protein and bile from having eaten meat, then some bacteria populations will be able to grow faster than the others. As they will be better able to absorb and use fats and better at tolerating the increased bile. It's not the case that the other bacterial populations stop and wait their turn, they just aren't as good at eating those nutrients and so their populations don't grow as quickly.</p>
<p>When there isn't chyme in a portion of your gut that portion of your gut is somewhat inactive (there will still be some amount of microbial activity). Most of microbial activity is focussed on where the bolus of chyme is passing and when it passes by the remaining bacteria will down regulate their activity and await the next batch of food.</p>
<p>Edit: Corrected bacterial population distribution in the small intestine</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Also if you move a large distance let's say from the north to the south or to a different country your flora can change drastically as different variations of similar microbes may be present in the soil, water or air. People assume bacteria means bad but your total biomass is as much bacteria as it is your own cells!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand that the illness itself results in increased risk of gut, colon, etc cancer, and the treatment drug they are on also has its own side effects. If that's what keeps them at maximum health then that's the best way forward.
They have been assessed by hospital dieticians and have frequent blood analysis to confirm correct levels of everything. Also the 'balanced diet' consensus doesn't always hold - there are some tribes in remote areas that live solely on fish or other protein who are perfectly healthy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
