		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is chlorophyll and yes chlorophyll in this state is capable of photosynthesis. It may not be a net photosynthetic sugar producer, though. With some fruits the photosynthesis primary plays a role in seed production.</p>
<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00317581" target="_blank">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00317581</a> (this paper discusses some fruits needing 300 uMol/m2/sec of light (this is the unit of light used in photo botany) to be a net sugar producer or about 15% full sunlight intensity)</p>
<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11738-005-0021-7" target="_blank">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11738-005-0021-7</a> (this paper discusses chlorophyll in ripe fruits and how carotenoids are formed in later fruit development. If gets in to the reflective properties as chlorophyll is highly reflective to light with wavelengths longer than about 700nm).</p>

This may have to due with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compensation_point" target="_blank">compensation point?</a>).</p>
<p>Pretty much any part of a plant that is green is capable of photosynthesis. If you google &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=green+fruit+photosynthesis&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" target="_blank">green fruit photosynthesis</a>&quot; you can pull up quite a few papers on this.</p>
<p>edit: clarified uMol/m2/sec unit of light measurement. 1 uMol/m2/sec would be 6.02*10^17 photons hitting one square meter per second of photosynthetically active radiation (generally defined as light with a wavelength of about 400-700nm). <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Quantum+light+meters&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" target="_blank">Quantum light meters</a> are used for this measurement in botany.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
