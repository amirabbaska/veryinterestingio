		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are a carrier of sickle cell, malaria has difficulty properly infecting you, and even when infected you recover quicker and with less symptoms.</p>
<p>You survive a malaria outbreak with others, you all do what survivors do, 9 months later babies born with a pair of the carrier gene express sickle cell and are sick.  </p>
<p>Natural selection selects for sickle cell because sickle cell is a survival trait.  You see similar for Cystic Fibrosis in Caucasian populations where there's a high level of certain toxins which a CF carrier can deal with due to some unique mucosa/gut traits.</p>
<p>Put 2 carriers together, and you have someone with a terrible disorder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in haemoglobin that causes red blood cells to have a sickle shape rather than the very recognisable biconcave disk shape. This faulty haemoglobin doesn't carry oxygen as well and the sickle cells can aggregate and block capillaries. This is obviously bad, but it's rarely life threatening. 90% of affected people live until 20 and around 50% make it past age 50.</p>
<p>This highlights the first reason the sickle cell trait still exists; evolution only &quot;cares&quot; about a trait if it affects whether you can reproduce. You could be the epitome of human health, a theoretical perfect genetic specimen, but you're not influencing the gene pool if you don't have any children in this hypothetical extraordinarily long, healthy life of yours. Similarly, if you die at 30 after having children, you've already passed on your genes. Whatever negative traits you had weren't enough to kill you before reproducing (or stop you from being able to reproduce).</p>
<p>The second main factor is the resistance to malaria that the sickle cell trait confers. Let's go back to genetics 101. In all your cells, you have two copies of each gene, one from each of your parents. Sometimes you need two faulty copies of a gene to get a condition, like with cystic fibrosis. This is called a recessive gene. If you have one working copy, you'll be fine. Some traits are dominant, like dark hair. If you have dark hair, maybe you've received a dark hair gene from both parents, or maybe you've got a fair haired gene that's being overpowered by one dark hair gene. This is how two dark haired people can produce fair-haired offspring.</p>
<p>The sickle cell trait is commonly thought of as recessive because people with one copy of the sickle gene generally live normal lives. However, the trait is actually codominant, which means that in a carrier (a person with one sickle gene and one normal gene), they have equal concentrations of faulty haemoglobin and functional haemoglobin. This functional haemoglobin is generally enough to get the job done, but athletes who are carriers will have decreased performance compared to their potential and there is some evidence it can contribute to negative health if there's other factors.</p>
<p>The sickling of red blood cells happens mostly in low oxygen tension (i.e. in muscle tissue, where respiring muscle cells use up lots of oxygen). This is where the malaria resistance comes in. The exact mechanism isn't known, but it's guessed that a few different factors have effects: because the malaria parasite consumes oxygen from the cells it affects, it increases sickling rates of infected cells. These sickle cells are then more easily eliminated by the immune system. It's like the parasite is waving a flag saying &quot;hey, I'm here!&quot;. Additionally, sickle trait cells produce greater levels of chemicals that are toxic to the parasite. Overall, this leads to lower levels of parasite infected cells.</p>
<p>This mechanism only has a 50% chance of stopping you from getting any malaria, but it has a 90% chance of stopping severe malaria. Given that malaria kills so many people, this is a pretty big deal. Remember from earlier that the important thing in natural selection is whether it actually kills you and prevents reproduction. A fully affected person with sickle cell anemia is very unlikely to die before reaching reproductive age and a carrier is even less affected. Malaria however, can and does kill and prevent many people from reproducing. The sickle cell trait confers a selective advantage in areas where malaria is endemic.</p>
<p>A last bit I want to talk about is the concept of population genetics. When we're talking about natural selection and the prevalence of certain alleles (different versions of the same gene, i.e. faulty vs. working), individual lives don't matter all that much. Even if you have the genes for a long and healthy life, that doesn't account for accidents that could kill or disable you just because of bad luck. Evolution takes a long time, because gene pools matter more than genes. The gene pool is the collection of traits in the population and the &quot;health&quot; of that matters more than any one individual. </p>
<p>Let's consider a mini model. Only a very small proportion of people have Sickle cell disease (SCD), 1% seems like a reasonable ballpark. Let's say someone with SCD has two children with a healthy person. Both these children would be carriers. If these carriers had children with other carriers, then there would be a 25% chance of a child being healthy, 25% chance of having SCD and a 50% chance of being a carrier. In a place where malaria is endemic, carriers are probably in the best situation. Phrased like this, we might actually ask &quot;why is the sickle cell gene not <em>more</em> prevalent in malaria affected areas?&quot; The answer to this is partly because evolution is slow and can only change a population as fast as people are born and die (and we humans are rather good at not dying, all things considered), but also that malaria affected populations intermingle with others. Some isolated African tribes had as much as 40% of the tribe being carriers of the sickle cell trait! Natural selection is ultimately a brutal and lazy master. It doesn't care if one of your four kids has a horrible, crippled life with low life expectancy, or if you die once you've had your kids, only about the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Slightly off topic genetics conjecture now: along these lines, some traits are bad on an individual scale, but helpful not just for the gene pool, but in a community. Humans are social animals, so the well-being of the tribe is very important. Some people theorise that homosexuality is beneficial(the &quot;gay uncle hypothesis&quot;). You can probably guess from the name, but basically if the &quot;gay uncle&quot; doesn't have children himself, then he can help care for his niblings (I so rarely get the chance to use this word and I love it). They do say &quot;it takes a village to raise a child&quot;, after all. Other similar theories exist for autism, ADHD, anxiety disorders, insomnia etc.. Obviously a society entirely of gay/socially awkward scientist types/novelty seekers/jumpy scared people/night owls would be unsustainable, but a few quirky individuals help the community. </p>
<p>This concept of genetic diversity is also one of the few valid points against genetic engineering of crops and animals: it reduces genetic diversity which means the gene pool is overall weaker and less resistant to changes such as disease, environmental changes etc.. One disease could wipe out entire populations of monoculture plants (though this issue isn't exclusive to genetic engineering, as we've been manipulating animals' and plants' traits through artificial selection for millennia).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said here, it's been observed that people with two genes for sickle cell anemia who are born and raised in Africa, tend to be less sick than people in the US with 2 copies of the gene for sickle cell anemia. In other words, people with 2 copies of the gene in the US will tend to get sickle cell anemia, while they have less of a chance of getting it in Africa, even though genetically they're the same. So it appears to both be more advantageous in Africa (in protecting against the ravages of malaria) and less disadvantageous in Africa (in not having the worst symptoms of the disease).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So a common misperception here is that sickle cell is protective for malaria. It isn’t. See <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3499995/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3499995/</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand being heterozygous is protective. The mechanism is still being worked on but the idea is roughly that heterozygous red blood cells are more likely to sickle once infected and be quickly cleared by macrophages. Thus protecting the heterozygous from malaria. </p>
<p>If the heterozygous are being selected for then mathematically homozygous sickle cell disease will be passed on at some rate when heterozygous indivisos mate. Thus keeping the disease around even when it the homozygous sickle trait is being selected against.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
