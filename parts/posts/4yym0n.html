<p>First, keep in mind bacteria are a very diverse branch of life, containing many extremophiles. The low pH in your stomach will kill many bacteria, but plenty of them will get through. Some, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori" target="_blank">H. pylori</a>, actually thrive in your stomach at a low pH. Others, like E. coli, may not be able to grow at low pH values but <a href="http://aem.asm.org/content/65/7/3048.full" target="_blank">enough cells can survive</a> a temporary exposure to low pH conditions that they can pass through your stomach and colonize your lower gut.</p>
<p>Second, it isn't just live bacteria that are a threat in rotten food. Many bacteria that decompose meat, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_botulinum" target="_blank">C. botulinum</a>, also produce toxins to prevent animals from eating the spoiled meat. That is why even cooking rotten meat won't necessarily make it safe to eat. </p>
<p>Now to your main question: When we look at scavengers like vultures they can eat rotten meat that would kill us. I don't think we completely understand how they pull this trick off, but we have some clues. Scavengers and carnivores in general <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134116" target="_blank">have more acidic stomachs</a> than herbivores do. Vultures can have a stomach pH <a href="http://erie.wbu.com/content/show/25899" target="_blank">as low as 0</a>, making their stomachs about 10x as acidic as our own. They also develop immune systems that can deal with these harmful bacteria. Pack animals like lions and hyenas can share small amounts of harmful bacteria to train their immune systems for when they get larger doses from rotten meat.</p>
<p>There was a good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPJBw-TLYZQ" target="_blank">Minute Earth video</a> on this topic a little while ago that covers some of this as well.</p>
<p>edit: clarified that low pH kills many bacteria but plenty can still survive it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are adapted to a certain diet. The adaptation has two major parts: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your digestive system has a certain design, optimized to an omnivore diet. For example, you can't break down cellulose unlike ruminants. </p>
</li>
<li>You have a gut flora of bacteria, further optimizing you for a diet. This is why it is easy to get sick when traveling to a distant country and changing diet.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few reasons you can get sick by food. It may that it contains a large amount of something can't digest, such as plants, it may be that it contains toxins which have an effect on your gut flora (or yourself), or it may be that it contains bacteria which unbalances your gut flora.</p>
<p>When it comes to spoiled food, it depends a lot on how it is spoiled. We eat many types of fermented food (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fermented_foods" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fermented_foods</a>), which in some way are spoiled. However, consuming random decomposing food is likely to contain a mixture of bacteria and toxins which does not play well with your gut flora.</p>
<p>For the second question (how bacteria survive through the stomach), they have different strategies. Some build up cell walls which resists the acid, some produce ammonia to neutralize the acid. And some produce spores which are very resilient to the environment in general. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a sort of follow up question that I've been curious about but never though worth a post in itself. What is it about humans that requires us to have such a varied diet, to the point where lack of variety can kill us (eg scurvy or protein poisoning) while it is very common for other animals to exist entirely on a single source of food. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The largest difference, essentially, is that you are fussy. If you eat spoiled food there is not actually that great a chance of you getting ill. It will probably taste pretty bad though, and certainly not like you were expecting and so, since you can just go and get something else to eat, you don't do it. Visible mould is not necessarily even harmful, but it is indicative that the food has been left in conditions which have allowed for fungal and bacterial growth, so there is a higher (but not 100%) chance that you'd be eating the nasty stuff, too. If you do ingest illness-causing organisms (leaving toxins like botulinum aside and focusing on the beasties) then you might not ingest enough to do any harm. If you do, your stomach acid might kill it off, or your immune system might catch and eliminate it before it takes hold. All of these processes are based partly on chance.</p>
<p>If you had no other option because that food was what your tribe had caught and probably wouldn't have another large catch for several days, you would still eat it if it was a bit rotten. Sometimes you would get ill, occasionally badly, but versus starvation, that would be a risk worth taking.</p>
<p>Similarly, animals like dogs <em>do</em> get ill from eating contaminated or rotten meat, but you don't necessarily hear as much about it because pet food can be very well preserved without the animal complaining about it (imagine if you had to eat just salted beef every day or something) and because we're taught so much about food safety for ourselves, and not much about food safety for pets and wild animals.</p>
<p>There are still differences though: <em>carnivores</em> tend to have shorter digestive tracts that are more hostile to bacteria. An omnivore like a human cannot have such a hostile digestive environment, because we <em>need</em> bacteria to help digest many nutrients. This means that bacteria from food finds actually a quite friendly environment for it to grow if it's not killed by stomach acid or out-competed by the bacteria that's there already. This can make you sick, as other people mentioned, by unbalancing your gut flora and throwing off your digestion, but it could also mean harmful bacteria secreting toxins are proliferating inside you: bad news.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may be a pretty ignorant question but I have always wondered...  </p>
<p>Our ancestors only harnessed fire to cook food at a certain milestone in our history, right? So if we used to eat raw meat at in our ancestral history, how come we get food poisoning from raw meat so easily nowadays?</p>
<p>It's like we always have to have our meat cooked and prepared artificially or we suffer very bad consequences. There is no way this could have been the same when raw meat was our primary diet, so what gives? A disadvantageous evolutionary adaptation?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
