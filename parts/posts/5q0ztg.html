		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your teacher is talking about something called &quot;significant figures&quot;. </p>
<p>Significant figures talk about precision or accuracy in a measurement. Imagine measuring the length of an object with a ruler. This type of measurement isn't necessarily precise, right? You might measure something out to be 4.9 millimeters but your friend might guess it's closer to 5.0</p>
<p>When you say something is &quot;5&quot; centimeters, you're saying it is 5 whole centimeters but aren't talking about how many 10ths of a centimeter it is past those 5. The notation &quot;5.0&quot; says something like, &quot;we're certain it is 5 centimeters and 0 whole tenths of a centimeter&quot;. Carrying it out further, &quot;5.01&quot; would be, &quot;5 whole centimeters, 0 tenths of a centimeter and 1 hundredth of a centimeter&quot;.</p>
<p>Now this is where 5.0x5.0 and 5x5 give different answers. You want to use the <em>least precise</em> number when doing calculations.</p>
<p>The number 5 has one significant figure. When you multiply two numbers with one significant figure together, your result should be written with one significant figure. Basically, if you're doing a calculation, your answer can't suddenly be more precise than the measurements going into that calculation if that makes sense. Therefore, that answer is 30.</p>
<p>There are a lot of rules for when a digit is considered significant or insignificant. You can read a lot more about it <a href="http://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Analytical_Chemistry/Quantifying_Nature/Significant_Digits" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>25 as an answer would say it's &quot;two whole 10 units and 5 whole single units&quot;. The number &quot;30&quot; just says it's &quot;three whole 10 units and we can't be exact about how many single units it is&quot;.</p>
<p>Hopefully that starts to explain it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In empirical sciences, there is the idea of significant figures because you're measuring physical objects. A scale or a ruler only is only so precise.</p>
<p>The rules for sig figs can be found on the wikipedia page:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures</a></p>
<p>5 has 1 sig fig. 25, however, has two sig figs. Since the input only has 1 sig fig, the product can only have 1 sig fig, thus you round it to 30, which has 1 sig fig.</p>
<p>In general, though, you don't worry too much about it in physics classes. It's a much more important concept in, say, chemistry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Significant figures. You may only properly express the result of a calculation to the same precision as the measurements on which that result is based. Physical quantities are different than integers, however. An integer quantity can be treated as though it has an infinite number of significant figures. Thus, if you have five jars of five marbles each, 5x5=25, because each of those 5s is actually a 5.00000000... Conversely, if you apply a load of 5 lbs at a distance of 5 feet, you have a torque of 25 lb-ft, but that result has two significant figures, while the original terms in the equation only have one. The result can only be approximated to 3x10^1 or 30. To get a result of 25, you need to measure to a higher precision so that the original terms are e.g. 5.0 and 5.0.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I imagine it was a comment on significant figures (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures</a>).  How you write a number (5 vs 5.0) has a bearing on how precisely you measured something.  Just writing 5 means you only bother to measure to 5, it could have been 5.01 or 5.999... all you cared about was 5.  As such, when you multiply 5x5 you're not saying exactly 5; thus you have 1 significant figure.  So your result can only have one significant figure.  25 is two significant figures, so you have to round to 30.</p>
<p>5.0x5.0 is saying you've measure to two significant figures, so your answer can have two significant figures.. thus 25.</p>
<p>I'm sure someone else will have a better explanation, but that's the general idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't just Physics. More properly, in experimental sciences or anything that involves the use of statistics, it's important to not create precision that isn't there. So by saying 5 x 5 = 30, what you're really doing is saying there's some statistic (likely an average) that is around 5-ish, and a second one that's also around 5. So I have a single digit of precision, and therefore I can't express the answer as 25 because that is more precise than my inputs.</p>
<p>Notice this applies to cases where your inputs are statistics or estimates. In formal math you aren't estimating anything, the number 5 is <em>exactly</em> 5 (or 5.000000000 if you prefer) so expressing the answer with two digits isn't creating extra precision.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
