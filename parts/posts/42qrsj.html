EDIT: so a few things I've learnt. 1) Everyone would like a quieter blender 2) there are some very expensive blenders 3) the noise appears to be caused by the much higher RPM of around 20,000 compared to comparable much quieter appliances 4) the need for torque also increases the noise 5) manufacturers feel it's safer for their products to be noisy 6) Ice makes a sound when blended EDIT: 7) Cost</p></div></div>
