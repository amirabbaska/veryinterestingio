		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few different explanations for this, depending on what the circle is made of. Ants will get trapped in chalk and baking soda circles, as well. A big contender is that ants travel largely by a scent trail left behind by other ants. If you watch ants coming for pieces of food left on the floor or the sidewalk, you'll see that they take the same route. A circle made of something like ink or sodium bicarbonate or chalk can disrupt this scent trail and cause almost a wall of sorts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ink has a solvent in it and the ant doesn't want to get solvent on itself.  It's feelers detect it is getting close to the solvent, so it turns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ants are not smart. Not even close. Imagine they're like toy robots.</p>
<p>They follow smells. The first workers to find food bring some back to the colony. They lay down a trail of smell. The next workers follow that smell trail and lay down their own. That's how mistakes like this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/N0HoqjxfvJ4" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/N0HoqjxfvJ4</a></p>
<p>A pen's ink is a mixture of chemicals. Some evaporate very quickly and also can dissolve other chemicals. If you were an ant, that line of pen would smell very strongly. Possibly strong enough to hide or break the smell of the correct trail.</p>
<p>By the way, chalk can have a different effect. Diatomaceous powder can kill insects. Chalks are similar. And many 'ant' chalks from China have real insecticides in them. So with chalk, and especially ant chalks, the insects might be avoiding something really noxious. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any brand, the dye used to tint ink red imitates the pheramones. It only works with termites, which are very different from red ants, but you can order them from entomologists/breeders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
