		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From an evolutionary view it is beneficial for us to easily remember bad memories. This helps us avoid repeating mistakes we have witnessed and keep us out of dangers way e.g. My friend was eaten by a bear in that cave, I remember this in great detail and avoid that cave in future so I'm less likely to be eaten by a bear.</p>
<p>I think it might be similar for things we find embarrassing. It's dangerous to do things that alienate you from a group since we are social creatures that rely on acceptance and group work to survive. If we remember things we've done before that threatened our social standing then we aren't likely to repeat the behaviour in future and avoid exclusion. That's just speculation though. </p>
<p>Edit: for people asking for more info on this I highly recommend looking up evolutionary psychology.</p>
<p>'Evolutionary theories of emotion view emotions as adaptive traits - they help the organism to adapt to the demand of the environment and thereby survive' (Izard, 1977; Plutchik, 1984).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an undergraduate currently studying emotion and cognition so I think I may be able to enlighten you a tad. So, current theories of emotion center around two things.  The Internal environment and the external environment. The internal environment being your subjective understanding of the environment and the environment being the physical reality to which you operate. Emotions are placed onto environmental energies (Things that happen in reality) as there is only one cognitive state, known as arousal. Arousal is an on or off function within our brain and can be triggered with pretty much anything, be it a glancing touch or an oncoming car. The cool thing about this is that emotions are supplanted on top of environmental energies. In a way, we actively decide how we feel about certain things. The movie Inside Out is a fantastic example of this process. </p>
<p>When it comes to memory and emotion, our brain (us) is particularly good between confusing our internal and external environment and can supplant emotion over memory. I hope this helps, I could not give you any sources but that is what I was taught. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body remembers events viscerally. A great book about this is The Body Keep the Score by Bessel Van der Kolk. Basically, whatever we experienced in that moment is saved in our brains/bodies and if not processed correctly in the moment it stays with us until it is processed correctly. EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) is a great tool used to help reprocess some of these old feelings/memories. It helps take the &quot;ick&quot; out of memories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Only highly empathic people suffer from cringe when remembering old memories. The scientific explanation for that &quot;cringe&quot; feeling, is that our brains are able to connect with another person so well that we actually &quot;feel&quot; what they're feeling. An evolutionary reason for why we cringe is that people who could feel others' pain were less likely to make the same mistakes. For example, in olden times if you a tribesmen tried to eat a poisonous mushroom and you could empathise, you wouldnt make the same mistakes. Cringe is a human emotion which allows us to learn without having to experience the consequences ourselves. When you remember, your brain identifies the old you as another human being, and so you feel the cringe yourself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we recall a memory your brain is essentially reliving that experience to the extent that it is capable. In most cases it's a crude approximation but some memories leave a more distinct imprint. </p>
<p>This is why sufferers of PTSD have such an extreme reaction when triggered or forced to recall that memory. They are essentially reliving the experience all over again.</p>
<p>Moments that make us feel very awkward or embarrassed are mildly traumatic in the sense that they leave clearer more distinct  impression in our minds. </p>
<p>So when you recall those experiences all of those same emotions are being relived. Thus making you cringe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
