		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://visioneyeinstitute.com.au/eyematters/dangers-rubbing-eyes/" target="_blank">https://visioneyeinstitute.com.au/eyematters/dangers-rubbing-eyes/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rubbing your eyes can also be therapeutic. Pressing down on your eyeball can stimulate the vagus nerve, which slows down your heart rate, relieving stress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That might explain the &quot;feel good&quot;, but read the rest in the article about potential damage to your eyes by rubbing them too much. Your eyes have an inner fluid pressure, and you don't want to continually increase that pressure.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/health/talkinghealth/factbuster/stories/2012/09/18/3592456.htm" target="_blank">http://www.abc.net.au/health/talkinghealth/factbuster/stories/2012/09/18/3592456.htm</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even a light rub doubles [eye pressure]. Removing eye make-up or wiping away tears increases the pressure a little more. But scrunching up your eyes then using your knuckles to gouge really hard shoots up your eye pressure more than 20 times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read the rest, about dangers if you have certain eye conditions.</p>
<p>Also, from the first article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most worryingly, studies have shown that continuous eye rubbing in susceptible individuals can also lead to thinning of the cornea, which is weakened and pushes forward to become more conical. This is known as keratoconus, and is a serious condition that can lead to distorted vision and ultimately the need for a corneal graft.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So basically don't rub too hard or too often. Also if you are rubbing because of an allergy making your eyes itchy, it actually make the itching worse, because rubbing also releases &quot;histamines&quot; (the stuff that makes you itch &amp; sneeze etc. when you have hay fever or other allergies). That's why you might find that if your eyes itch, the more you rub them the more itchy they get! Eyeballs are complicated things.</p>
<p>ed: Bit of trivia: Eyeballs are technically <em>part of your brain</em>! The retina (the light-sensitive bit at the back of the eyeball) is formed from the same tissues as the brain so it's considered part of the brain. Our brains are literally peeping out of our skulls to see things. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
