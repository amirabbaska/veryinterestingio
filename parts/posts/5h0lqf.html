<p>But with the focus on &quot;fake news&quot; these days, I want to make sure I am open-minded and using all available critical thinking tools to make sure I am informed properly. </p>
<p>So explain to me like I'm five - and as a PSA for other people whose BS detectors aren't yet finely tuned - how you can tell that a news source is, in fact, credible.</p></div></div>
