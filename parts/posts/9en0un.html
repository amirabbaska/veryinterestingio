		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Opiate overdoses have already been mentioned as causing respiratory depression. I’m an ER nurse, they way I explain it to people is your body doesn’t know it needs to breathe. </p>
<p>When you hold your breath, you experience the burning lung sensation and eventually, your body will force you to breathe again. (Little kids who say they’re going to hold their breath till they die? Doesn’t work.) </p>
<p>Opiates block that feedback from happening. Your body, overdosed on opiates, does not recognize that it needs to breathe. So it doesn’t. </p>
<p>A normal (adult) respiratory rate is 12-20 breaths per minute. I’ve seen people come in at 3-4. Even if we give Narcan (the opiate reversal drug) depending on how long they’ve been at 4 breaths per minute, we might not get them back. Brain damage from lack of oxygen starts at around 3 minutes. Sometimes people have been down for hours before they’re found. </p>
<p>Cocaine can speed up your heart rate so much that the heart can’t keep up, and will stop. When your heart is between beats, that’s when blood flows to the actual heart itself. The faster your heart rate, the less blood/oxygen is getting to the heart, and eventually the heart can’t go on. (I’ve only seen this happen once, and it was intentional.) </p>
<p>People ask “What’s your poison” regarding alcohol for a reason, it really is. How you die from alcohol depends on how much you had, and if you mixed with something else, usually. Choking on their own vomit is common. Being exceptionally drunk can suppress the gag reflex. All jokes aside, the gag reflex is there to force you to protect your own airway. If someone comes in drunk, unresponsive and doesn’t have a gag reflex, they almost always get intubated. Long term, your body will process alcohol out but there’s a lot of not fun things that can happen, like liver failure. Another one is alcohol related dementia. Slang term is “wet brain”, but those patients are almost always awful. Nothing will test your nursing compassion like a mean ass drunk. Also with alcohol, it might not be an overdose but people do really, really stupid stuff while drunk. Like jumping off roofs and aiming for the tree next to it, and missing. Or less exciting, driving and wrapping their car around a light pole. </p>
<p>Recreational drug use aside, there’s plenty of prescription (and over the counter) medications that can kill you/make you sick. Too much Tylenol can put you in liver failure, too much Advil can cause a stomach/intestinal bleed. Blood pressure medications will drop your blood pressure/heart rate to dangerous levels, blood thinners can cause spontaneous bleeding (and lengthen the amount of time it takes for your blood to clot.) </p>
<p>Wow this got really long. My point is- some things we can save you from. Some things we can’t. Read directions, drink responsibly, if it’s illegal maybe don’t do it. (Except weed, that would get it’s own post, and it’s next to impossible to smoke enough pot to kill yourself.) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the drug abused.   </p>
<p>Opiate painkillers and benzodiazepines, especially when combined with each other and/or alcohol, can induce respiratory depression: aka you stop (or significantly slow down) breathing.   Obviously if you aren't breathing you won't last very long without medical help.   </p>
<p>Many other drugs may have extremely unpleasant side effects in excess (such as psychosis when abusing stimulants), but they might not affect critical body processes enough to be immediately fatal.    </p>
<p>Another common example is acetaminophen (paracetamol).    The metabolism of acetaminophen creates a toxic intermediate that is usually eliminated quickly.  However, excess consumption of acetaminophen, and/or concurrent alcohol consumption, can overwhelm that pathway (depleting Glutathione, which both the metabolism of alcohol and acetaminophen require) , causing a build-up of the toxic intermediate which can cause liver damage/failure.  Not immediately fatal, but a painful way to die.</p>
<p>Cocaine and Tricyclic antidepressants are also known for potentially fatal overdoses, as both alter nerve signaling within the body (both inside and outside the brain), which may cause elecated body temperature, heart rate/blood pressure, and the like which may become fatal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the drug and what biochemical pathways are affected.</p>
<p>Benzodiazepine sleeping pills: people fall asleep and can't wake up, rarely leading to nervous damage when they fall asleep cutting off one and their body can't move/wake up due to the depressed/downed state it's  in. This can typically last from days to many years or be permanent, people might lose a lot or all control over the affected extremity. Regenerating such nerve damage might also take a lot of training and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Antihistamine sleeping pills: you will get a very dry mouth and most likely fall asleep because you're extremely tired, also any itching you might have had is completely gone, if you manage to stay awake you might notice that you lost proper access to memories, almost all ability for logical thought, have become extremely easy to influence/manipulate, lose yourself every few minutes dissociating, you also most likely will have absolutely life like hallucinations which are fudged memories I guess. This can be extremely dangerous, the hallucinations from these dissociatives tend to be absolutely life like and the affected person will not be able to distinguish between reality and them (However they can be easily influenced to realize that they're not actually seeing what they're seeing and that they're actually in some completely different place, just mentioning this questioningly will often snap them out of it)</p>
<p>cocaine overdose: will make people extremely agitated and social, barely capable of stringing thoughts to communication and arguing about things if aquamarine or ultramarine blue is of greater historic significance of art, there is a rare chance to die from heart and blood pressure related issues.</p>
<p>heroine and opiate painkillers: it seriously reduces the activity of certain  muscle groups, especially those around your digestive system and your lungs, so an overdose might lead to (if you survive) literal shitting of brick like material devoid of most fluid and dying from your lungs not capable of breathing on their own, at higher doses people have to breathe consciously or die, if they fall unconscious they will die.</p>
<p>alcohol and GABAerg things like 'liquid XTC'/GHB/GBL
will put you in a delirious state and especially liquid XTC has an extremely high chance to make you puke while you lost your consciousness, if you are laying wrong you will die from asphyxiation. Beside that just massive hammering headaches from your brain having lost extreme amounts of water and in rare cases your liver could give up and you die due to that, but it's less likely and more a long time issue for only very few people.</p>
<p>anaphlogistic painkillers ibuprofen, paracetamol: liver damage and intestinal bleeding</p>
<p>THC without (or little) CBD: extreme blood sugar drop, often leading to base anxiety and panic, coupled with rather high psychedelic action, people might lay around having vivid out of body like experiences, puking a lot and or having extreme anxiety and panic attacks and problems coping with the strongly psychedelic action on perception (especially audio and touch, but not limited to)</p>
<p>THC with lots CBD: Extremely flattened, with little tolerance most likely extreme hunger from the extreme blood sugar drop, lack of energy, feeling wasted, uncomfortable body feeling.
Puking might happen as with the above but chances are people just fall asleep afterwards instead of having 'visions' and 'dreams'.</p>
<p>Amphetamines: Days awake, incapable of stringing thoughts to communication, lack of hunger and at some point fatigue from that, extreme excitability and neurotic behaviorisms, often paranoia and possible kidney damage.
MDA derivative amphetamines (MDMA being XTC): pretty much as above but with strong emotional volatility and a considerably increased chance to get epileptic attacks or similar (compared to other amphetamines)
2cb derivative amphetamines (mescalin is structurally similar to 2cb and hallucinogenic phenthylamines): similar to description under amphetamines just with strong psychedelic effects that when overdosed can either put you into heaven or hell, especially with all the side effects your body is subject to.</p>
<p>So if they are fatal and how fatal they are depends a lot on site of activity, biochemical pathways affected (think of them as information highways and transistors, like in the computer or any other analogue information theory, it's also the reason why hallucinogenic drugs cause certain artifacts well known in analogue videography) in the end it all depends on what kind of cascades of information is 'put lose' pharmaceutical technicians will often know the effects of drugs and medicine they design before they even invent it, because a lot of those pathways are very well known.</p>
<p>If you are interested this is
<a href="http://biochemical-pathways.com/#/map/1" target="_blank">http://biochemical-pathways.com/#/map/1</a>
this is one of the maps created by Roche Pharma, I have it hanging in my appartment and value it as a piece of psychedelic Art.</p>
<p>If you're interested in any other drug and their possible overdose effects (simple version as well as extended) just ask about it, chances are my interest went over them at some point in my life.</p>
<p>Many drugs become considerably more powerful when used in conjunction and can extremely increase certain side effects, this is less based in both drugs exciting those pathways (because basically if one substance has a higher affinity it will mediate most of the information sent) but many of the drugs are reduced over certain enzymes and functions in our body, Cytochrome p450 is the most (in)famous when it comes to cross reactions, the metabolism only works at a certain speed and if it is inhibited by working on substance A there will be less 'metabolism' be done on substance B leading to a far higher blood plasma level of either drug, making an overdose far more likely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the drug. </p>
<p>With opiates, they suppress your breathing, and essentially you end up suffocating. </p>
<p>With benzos/ alcohol, they slow down your heart rate until it stops.  </p>
<p>This is why mixing opiates, alcohol, and benzos is particularly dangerous, because it slows your body down in different ways. </p>
<p>Cocaine, meth, and other stimulants speed up your heart to the point you end up having a heart attack and seizures. </p>
<p>Whether or not they're fatal depends on how much was taken (just enough to render someone unconscious vs enough to take down an elephant) and how quickly after the overdose they can get medical attention. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
