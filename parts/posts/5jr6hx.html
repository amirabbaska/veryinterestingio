		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's true. Let's look at it 2 ways. Firstly, the in-the-moment differences, and secondly the long-term differences.</p>
<p>Terms you need to understand:
Blood pressure is made up of <em>systolic</em> blood pressure; that's the maximum pressure your blood circuit reaches when the left side of your heart is actively pumping, and <em>diastolic</em> pressure, which is the lowest pressure it reaches while the left side of your heart is filling up. When a doctor says your BP is 120/80, 120 is systolic and 80 is diastolic. Mean arterial pressure (the average pressure your arteries are experiencing) is usually an estimated figure calculated by equations, occasionally directly measured, and this is an important number for heart health. If it's high, your heart is having to work harder to pump blood around the body, and that's bad for your heart.</p>
<p>1) In-the-moment</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> During exercise, the heart rate goes up and many blood vessels dilate to increase blood supply to muscles (and, to control your body temperature, to the skin). Your systolic goes up initially, then stabilises or even falls. Diastolic stays steady. That means that your mean arterial pressure only goes up slightly, if at all. <a href="http://jap.physiology.org/content/46/2/302.short" target="_blank">Experimental evidence from rats</a></p>
<p><strong>Psychological:</strong> During psychological stress, the heart rate goes up without any accompanying change in distribution to muscle and skin, because there isn't any physical response required. Even worse, hormones are also released causing constriction of blood vessels. That means that the blood pressure goes up. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karen_Sogaard/publication/7449722_The_Effect_of_Mental_Stress_on_Heart_Rate_Variability_and_Blood_Pressure_During_Computer_Work/links/00b49533940a084363000000.pdf" target="_blank">Evidence from a study looking at stress while using a computer</a></p>
<p>2) The long-term effects</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Exercise that raises your heart rate has many beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system long-term. A few simple ones below, all demonstrated in <a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.ph.39.030177.001253" target="_blank">this beautifully written older paper</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing the resting activity of the &quot;rest and digest&quot; (parasympathetic) nervous system, lowering heart rate and blood pressure</li>
<li>Increasing the effectiveness of your muscles at a given effort level- muscle fibres grow, increases in mitochondria (the little guys that do all the energy conversion with oxygen), improvements in blood supply- meaning that next time you have to do the same hard work, your heart doesn't have to work so hard</li>
<li>Improvements in oxygen transport, again reducing the amount of work your heart has to do</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Psychological stress:</strong> Again, this is not so good, especially when it's long-term or recurrent stress.</p>
<ul>
<li>Increases the activity of your &quot;fight or flight&quot; sympathetic nervous system, increasing heart rate and blood pressure <a href="http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/46/5/1201.short" target="_blank">as discussed in this small study</a></li>
<li>Changes hormone balances, for instance increasing cortisol levels, with negative effects on the immune system and heart health <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2004-15935-004" target="_blank">e.g. shown here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>On the bright side, <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-199111030-00002" target="_blank">exercise probably has beneficial effects on anxiety and stress</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Exercise comes with lots of other changes alongside raised heart rate that mean your heart is working hard under the right conditions to support it doing so, and drives healthy changes to heart health. Stress, not so much.</strong></p>
<p>(Note: all of the above is about cardiovascular exercise like running, as opposed to weight-lifting type exercise. This also has many benefits, but via some slightly different mechanisms.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: During exercise, you're exercising, so you get the benefit of that. During stress, you're not exercising, so you don't get the benefit of that.</p>
<p>An elevated heart rate isn't a good thing on it's own, even during exercise - it's not the increase in your heart rate that makes you healthy. Rather, it's the fact that an elevated HR during exercise is a surrogate marker for actually doing a physical activity that is demanding enough to get some benefit from it.</p>
<p>People who are chronically stressed aren't less healthy because their HR is high, they're less healthy because of the neurohormonal consequences of stress, which have the side effect of increasing your heart rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm only going to address one particular effect I haven't seen mentioned. In at least this respect, the raised heart rate and cardiac workload <em>can</em> lead to a similar change regardless of source.</p>
<p>Exercise can result in hypertrophy (growth of the heart muscle) which increases the risk of potentially fatal arrhythmias comparable to mild hypertrophy from other sources. Note though that this is in animal models, and no solid connection between mild exercise-induced hypertrophy in humans and fatal cardiac events has been established.</p>

Does it differ from stress caused by too much work?
And if so, is there a possibility to cause yourself damage by just having too much fun doing exciting things even with young age?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
