<p>But it confirms I'm not going crazy. As I'm getting into my 30's I distinctly know what a note sounds like in my head from childhood and I know that an instrument playing it is quite a bit higher now in my age. For example, using the western scale an E sounds like it's halfway towards being an F now. </p>
<p>This is actually kind of distressing as a musician as I'm starting to get disoriented (it's almost like colors have shifted and you're being asked to paint a scene for everyone else when red is now blue and green is purple for you). There was a UCSF study that acknowledged this phenomenon but didn't address it any further as far as I could find. </p>
<p>Why would this be? Would there be any hope for a cure? Or is it actually the opposite - my childhood self was hearing things lower than they should be and now that I'm an adult my hearing is now accurate? </p>
<p>Lastly can there an objective test for this? </p></div></div>

<p>as age increases, high tones are supposed to be lost; lower tones are supposed to be lost.</p>
<p>The way you describe this... it almost seems as if you took a hiatus from audio for a few years and recently decided to go back to your passion... only to find your *memory* of the notes don't match the present.</p>
<p>Check what octave the notes are playing in; perhaps you are mentally shifting the octave? I know that some notes sound similar in a different octave, at least to me... I got ear issues, too tho. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>But having perfect pitch in itself is surely a result of training your brain to recognise notes, some people are able to do this better than others. It is certainly influenced by the music that you listen to.
