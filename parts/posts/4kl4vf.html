		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each of the things that you mention are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid" target="_blank">colloids</a>, which are relatively stable mixtures of multiple substances.  Peanut butter is a suspension of peanut solids in oil; jelly is water suspended in either pectin or gelatin (depending on your definition of &quot;jelly&quot;); cream cheese is â€¦ more complex.</p>
<p>Edit: A few people have pointed out that I have failed to classify them as liquids or solids. The point is that they're neither. They are, literally, a combination of both.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's sort of like saying that a jar full of marbles sitting in water is a &quot;solid&quot; or a &quot;liquid,&quot; but at a smaller scale. It's not really either, it's a mixture of the two. In these cases, they are finely distributed enough that it's convenient for us to call them a single substance like &quot;peanut butter&quot; but not so finely distributed as to really make much sense to say it is a single substance at a molecular level. In fact, if you leave lots of peanut butters or similar sitting around for awhile, you can easily see fully macro-level separation of the mixture with your naked eye.</p>
<p>(edit: In the case of very meticulously made uniform jelly unlike typical grocery store brands, there may actually be a molecular level substance that may be called a single substance, I can't speak to that, but not most of the above)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All these materials are now called soft matter (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_matter" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_matter</a>). Their study quickly grew into an entire field of materials science, with dedicated journals such as ... Soft Matter(<a href="http://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/soft-matter/" target="_blank">http://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/soft-matter/</a>). They are both liquid and solid: they behave like a solid if you don't stress them, for instance, but above a certain stress level (your spoon pulling on it), they flow like a liquid. Their properties are actually very complex, which makes them fascinating to study.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
