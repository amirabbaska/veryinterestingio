		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Excellent question, and as it turns out, the answer is maybe more interesting than you'd except.</p>
<p>At the end of the 19th century, people were still coming up with more and more accurate ways to measure the speed of light. At the time, we were already aware that if it wasn't constant, it was at least not varying much, this feeling being reinforced everytime we had a newer, more accurate experimental measurement.</p>
<p>But on the theoretical side of things, we were faced with an paradox : we were using the Galilean composition for speeds, and we also based our understanding of light on Maxwell's equations, where the propagation speed of the Electro-Magnetic field, denoted «c», is assumed constant.</p>
<p>Most theorists were trying to reconcile those theory by assuming the existence of a medium, called the Ether, that light propagated into and that had a relatively slow motion with respect to the Earth, compared with c.</p>
<p>Einstein went the other way and assumed c was indeed a true constant, and would always amount the same no matter the motion of the observer. That's the fundamental assumption that gave birth to Special Relativity.</p>
<p>Experimenters tried to measure the motion of Earth relative to the Ether by measuring the speed of light in the direction of the Earth's rotation twice, with a 6month interval between the two so as them would be able to measure a difference between the two that would amont to twice the relative velocity of Earth in the Ether. They failed to measure anything relevant, giving that much more credit to Einstein's way to solve the problem, no matter how counter intuitive his idea was.</p>
<p>Tldr:
Both. It was up to Einstein first produce  a consistent theory that didn't involve an ad hoc hypothesis that nobody could figure out how to prove or disprove.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Definitely the experiment. Specifically, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment" target="_blank">Michelson-Morley experiment</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to Michelson-Morley, light was assumed to travel in waves similar to sound waves. Sound is vibrations in air, so air is called the &quot;medium&quot; for sound waves. The speed of sound is fixed relative to the air. So if someone is moving relative to the air (such as in a car) the sound waves are compressed, causing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect" target="_blank">Doppler effect</a> for sound.</p>
<p>Furthermore, imagine someone on a train that is open to the atmosphere, so the air on the train is stationary while the train is moving. In effect, the atmosphere is &quot;moving&quot; backwards relative to the person on the train (which they would experience as wind). If that person tried to measure the speed of sound while on this train, they would find it appears faster moving backwards than forwards. This is also why, when it is windy outside, it is easier to hear people who are upwind of you than people who are downwind of you.</p>
<p>If light had a medium, it would also have this direction-dependent speed (attached to a medium then called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether" target="_blank">luminiferous aether</a>). Michelson and Morley tried  to measure the speed of light in different directions. They also tried measuring it at different velocities (by waiting for different portions of earth's orbit, where the motion of the entire planet is in a different direction). They found no change in the speed of light.</p>
<p>This was a very surprising result, and directly inspired Einstein to come up with the theory of special relativity.</p>
<p>Special relativity posited that <em>nothing</em> could travel faster than the speed of light. Thus, the speed of light isn't <strong>just</strong> the speed of light, but the maximum speed that anything can travel at. This was a theoretical prediction that has held true, despite numerous experiments  trying to prove it false(including the well-known <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/06/once-again-physicists-debunk-faster-light-neutrinos" target="_blank">mistake</a> from a few years ago).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were experimental inklings that the motion of light was not consistent with Gallilean relativity dating back to 1851. The Fizeau Water experiment basically showed that the motion of light through oppositely flowing columns of water does not produce as much interference as expected if you just subtracted the velocity of the water from the velocity of light. There were later much more systematic studies showing that light didn't obey Galilean relativity, such as the Michelson-Morley experiments as others have mentioned.</p>
<p>Maxwell's equations were written down in the 1860s which describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated by static and moving charges, and can be used to show that electromagnetic waves have a velocity that does not depend on the reference frame in which they are observed. A lot of people then start to mention stuff about ether, but I would advise against reading too much into that, there is a tendency to simplify the arguments of the physicists of the past to make more recent developments sound smarter.</p>
<p>Einstein wrote down a theory of relativity, drawing on concepts from Lorentz and Poincare, that was consistent both with the Galilean relativity of moving objects and the Maxwellian independence of light. This included an additional stipulation that light is the same speed in all inertial reference frames. From what I've read, this was inspired by the two competing descriptions of motion and not by any particular experimental result.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember is that this second postulate of relativity is not <em>a priori</em> correct, it is treated as correct because it is magnificently consistent with experimental observations of its implications. There is no magic rule that says that light always has to be the same speed in any universe, the rule was formulated to describe our universe and it does that well. Another important thing to remember is that people also didn't just go &quot;Oh, the interference pattern is too small, obviously light must be the same speed in all reference frames.&quot; It took a lot of thought to figure out what was going on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is there a more precise way to say the constant speed of light? I'm asking because we do actually know that light may travel slower in a different medium. </p>
<p>Is it perhaps the maximum speed of light which also happens to be the most commonly observed speed?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
