If the Social Information Processing Model relies on the behaviors of the individual based on past experiences, And the fundamental attribution error stipulates that the persons behavior can mostly be explained via external forces, and social psychologists stress (at least in the courses and material I have read) that people mostly behave certain ways based on external stimuli and not what happens inside of their head by their own. Isn't it possible for them to come to the decision to behave certain ways internally without the environmental forces social psychologists suggest are responsible for a person's behavior?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you're misunderstanding the fundamental attribution error. It is not meant to be an explanatory framework for understanding human action and conduct. The fundamental attribution errror is a bias. It is a concept that describes the tendency among persons to attribute causes for an event to be either external (situational) or internal (dispositional) wrongly.</p>
<p>Imagine that you're part of a sports team. Your team is your in-group and you play against another team, an out-group. Now, it so happens that the other team score the first goal. According to attribution theory, the tendency on your team would be to make external or situational attributions to explain the goal. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The other team got lucky</li>
<li>One of your players slipped</li>
<li>Your goal keeper was distracted</li>
</ul>
<p>However, when your team scores you'd have a tendency to explain that through internal attribution. &quot;We scored because we are better than them, ergo: the goal was fully deserved.&quot; It might actually have been the other way around: your team got lucky and the other team, having better players, possessed advantageous dispositions, but because of the tendency to place attributions erroneously, we cannot see that clearly. It is an important dynamic in understanding in-group/out-group behavior, not a factual description of human behavior. There should be no contradiction between Social information Processing and the fundamental attribution error.</p>
