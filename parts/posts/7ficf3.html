		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take a bubble - soap/water, milk or otherwise - and initiate a &quot;pop&quot; from a single point on the surface. What would be the velocity of the bursting edge, as it propagates away from the initiation point?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blNe2Ae5a2c" target="_blank">Here is a video</a> of some bursting bubbles in slow-motion. Notice that the bursting edge recedes from the initiation point; the intact surface remains unaffected until the bursting edge reaches it.</p>
<p>For simplicity, assume a <em>perfect bubble</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perfectly spherical</li>
<li>Evenly distributed surface</li>
<li>No external forces (i.e. gravity, which would cause deformation and pooling of the medium)</li>
<li>&quot;Pop&quot; or burst initiated from a single point on the surface</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems intuitive that the <em>upper limit</em> would be the <strong>speed of sound</strong> for whatever medium the bubble was made from, because the speed of sound would be the physical limit that the information could be passed along that the bubble was popping. But I'm unsure what role the <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/127695/why-is-the-pressure-inside-a-soap-bubble-higher-than-outside" target="_blank">pressure differential</a> might play - if any at all.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A rough approximation can be calculated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine frame rate of the original video recording</li>
<li>Determine size of bubble in video</li>
<li>Measure time for bubble to pop</li>
<li>Calculate speed: distance divided by time</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at the bubble at 1m43s: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktvZ2Z_s4Bo&t=103s" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktvZ2Z_s4Bo&t=103s</a></p>
<ul>
<li>video is recorded at 18,000 FPS.</li>
<li>bubble size is about 15 cm.</li>
<li>time to pop is about 13 seconds.</li>
<li>13s of video at 18,000 FPS is 0.72ms of real time. 0.15m/0.72ms  = 208 m/s</li>
<li>edit: MorRobots did the speed calculation for a spherical surface: 362.2 m/s</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bubble size and duration of the popping are just rough numbers and can be approximated better but it'll get you in the right ballpark.</p>
<p>For homework, you can do the math for traversing a sphereical surface instead of the simpler calculation I'm using.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The link you provided for pressure differential includes an MS paint free body diagram. From this diagram we see that at any point on the bubbles surface, the forces due to surface tension are actually orthogonal to the forces due to the pressure differential. For this reason, forces due to pressure differential can be ignored in calculating how quickly the break will move along.</p>
<p>Unless there is something else to be considered, I'd say that the upper bound of the material's speed of sound is a very reasonable approximation for the speed of propagation of the surface break.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On mobile, so sorry for the spelling errors and typos. </p>
<p>I imagine that the viscosity of the bubble material and the shear force of the liquid plane traveling through the gas are important factors.</p>
<p>We typically use liquids containing surfactants (such as soap) to achieve a liquid with low surface tension and viscosity. </p>
<p>I also think the upper limit is significantly less than the speed of sound in the material for a couple different reasons. First, when a bubble bursts the matter travels <em>around</em> the surface of the bubble, in a circle. This requires a change of momentum not required if the material is traveling in a straight line. Second, when a bubble bursts, all of the material goes <em>with</em> the “shock wave.” When sound travels through a material, there is just a slight movement of each molecule; the energy from one molecule is passed along to the next (minus some frictional losses). In a popped bubble on the other hand, all of the material “clumps” together moving at the same speed. This means that enough energy is needed to accelerate all of the atoms to some top speed. </p>
<p>The best analogy I can think of is a train accelerating from a stop. In the ”speed of sound” case, the “speed” would be CLUNK CLUNK CLUNK of each train car’s hitch getting pulled taught. This happens really quickly and the CLUNk travels all the way to the last car in almost no time. In the bubble example, we have to accelerate all of the actual train cars to some top speed. </p>
<p>TD;DR I have no idea how to calculate the top speed outside of experimentation, but I am guessing that it is significantly less than the speed of sound in the material. Like 1-3 orders of magnitude less. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
