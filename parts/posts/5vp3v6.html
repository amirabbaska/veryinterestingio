<p>We've got a bottle of Type A Goo.  We've got a bottle of Type B Goo.  We want to make a product that contains A and B because the consumers find it convenient.</p>
<p>Both A and B turn out to be soluble in water.  Unfortunately, when <em>both</em> A and B get into the same water, you end up with two separate layers, and that's bad.  It's because A and B aren't fully compatible.  But the customer still wants the combination - what do you do?  There's a variety of things you can try!</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a surfactant.  Surfactants get between the layers when they try to form and mess with the layer boundaries so that they can't separate.</li>
<li>Use a mutual solvent.  A mutual solvent is attractive to both A and B.  Use enough and they stop fighting over the water.</li>
<li>Reduce the ratios of A or B.  Some of the time, this is really necessary.  Maybe B interferes with A's function even when they are well-mixed.  Maybe a certain level of A just will not work in a B mixture no matter how much mutual solvent or surfactant you use.  Or maybe the higher ratios are just not cost-effective!  Sometimes you need to compromise.</li>
<li>Play with the pH.  There's a decent chance that A or B is an ionic compound, meaning it splits into positive and negative bits in water.  Those bits can be chemically altered due to the pH (acidity or basicity) of the water.  Fine-tuning the pH can allow for better solubility.</li>
<li>Substitute.  Okay, so A and B didn't work together and getting them to play nice is like herding middle schoolers.  Well, if C has many of the same properties as B but likes A better, why not use C?</li>
</ul>
<p>So which strategy would your &quot;2 in 1&quot; use?  Unless you've got a company chemist to ask, you won't know.  But my guess would be at least 2-3 techniques off of the above list, possibly along with some trade secret goodness that I'm not privy to.</p>
<p>Is it possible that your &quot;2 in 1&quot; has the same active components (the ones that do the work) as a separate shampoo and conditioner?  Yes.  Is it also possible that it uses a different active component for compatibility?  Yes again.  It is possible that there is a difference in effectiveness in either/both parts when you make a combination product?  Oh yes.</p>
<p>But the fun part is that hygiene/cosmetic formulation is a <em>huge</em> industry, with lots of different combinations, methods, and trade secrets.  Studying ingredient lists is going to give you a huge headache.  If you're a consumer, my recommendation is... try the different products and see what works for you.  If it works, use it.  If it doesn't, use it for target practice.</p>
<p>As a last note, I will say that all of the formulation techniques I mentioned above have a very strong limitation: toxicity.  Since we're dealing with hygiene products, it has to be very safe for body contact and can't poison you if you accidentally ingest it.  This is why despite the huge variety of things that <em>could</em> go into your product, you will often see similar ingredients or variants of similar ingredients in products from different brands.  Ingredients that aren't health-friendly can be very good surfactants/mutual solvents/additives, and an industrial chemist like myself uses them daily - but a cosmetic chemist has to think about the human first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Chemist here</p>
<p>TL;DR: 2-in-1 contain the same main ingredients as stand alone shampoo and conditioner but 2 in 1 products have to use a trick to get the oil to stick to the hair. </p>
<p>Longer version:</p>
<p>Shampoo cleans away the grease on your hair,  including your natural oils that give it shine and keep it healthy.  If your hair is stripped of its natural oil coating it looks dull and all fluzzy (tech term,  sorry ELI5)
Conditioners contain oils aimed at restoring the shine and condition.  Stand alone conditioners also have a positively charged ingredient that helps the oil drops stick to the negative charges on hair, but we can't use this in a 2 in 1 as the shampoo molecules are negatively charged and you'd get a snotty gloop if you mix them, as the +ve and -ve molecules stick together.  Try it. </p>
<p>2-in-1 products DO contain both the shampoo AND the oil.  They work less well than stand alone conditioners because shampoo is designed to clean away oil,  and yet you are at the same time trying to deposit new oil, but they do work.</p>
<p>So how do you get conditioning oil to stick hair when the product you're using is designed to remove oil? </p>
<p>2-in-1 products achieve this with a trick.  When the product is in the bottle the conditioning oil drops are very small;  too small to stick to the hair efficiently.  The trick is that when the 2 in 1 is diluted in the shower, the small drops stick to each other to make bigger drops.  Bigger drops are much better at sticking to hair.</p>
<p>That's how you get both REMOVAL of oil and DEPOSITION of oil at the same time. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How shampoo and conditioner work (am a hairstylist):</p>
<p>So, think of a strand of hair as a tree. Inside there are all the parts that make it grow. This is the cortex layer. The outside is covered with shingle like bark, this is called the cuticle layer. It lays tight against the cortex for protection from brushing, heat styling, and so on.</p>
<p>In very healthy, non-chemically treated hair, the cuticle makes the hair feel smooth. Chemical processes and other damage cause the cuticle to be ruffled or some of the shingles to break off. This causes dry, frizzy feeling.</p>
<p>Shampoo by itself contains surfactants which are oil/dirt seeking. The molecules open the cuticle layer slightly and surround dirt and oil particles. The other side of the surfactant molecule is attracted to water. When you rise, the cleanser leaves, taking the dirt and oil particles with it. You should rinse completely to get it all out.</p>
<p>Next, conditioner can be applied to smooth and close the cuticle. Some reconstructive conditioners also contain keratin, which will replace the broken protein bonds in the cortex and also build a temporary replacement shingle on the cuticle.</p>
<p>This is why in decades past, women would do a final rinse with vinegar. The ph helps seal the cuticle shut and makes the bark lie tight against the tree.</p>
<p>Conditioner should be applied in a small amount-About the size of a quarter. Start at the end and work to the scalp. By the time you get to the scalp area, the conditioner should be mostly diluted. This provides more help to older, more damaged areas while preventing dull, greasy scalp area.</p>
<p>Shampoo and conditioner in one doesn't do a great job of cleaning or conditioning. It is gentle cleanser with a moisturizing agent and something like panthenol, which leaves a wax like coat on the strand, making the cuticle lie flat for a little while.</p>
<p>Products like V05, leave in conditioners, and smoothing oils work in a similar manner by smoothing the shingles on the cuticle and coating them so they close. Use too much, the hair strand becomes dull, heavy, and greasy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really all you're getting with those is a moisturizing shampoo. It's pretty difficult to find a product marketed as a 2-in-1 in salon quality brands, which says something. (Consider high quality clothing lines that sell both well-made jeans, and also leggings. So a Walmart, or whatever, brand says, &quot;look, jeggings!' It is not really to your benefit to buy those jeggings instead of the separate, better quality items. )</p>
<p>However not everyone needs conditioner, and many/most people use it incorrectly. Hair, skin and nail needs vary by person, and also with time, changes in hormones or environment, etc.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just woke up, I'm sorry for trash-talking jeggings. Someone else pointed out that the jarred pb&amp;j combo would be a better analogy, so... that.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of answers from a lot of different folks in this thread.  I'm sure as soon as I'm done typing this someone will come in here and tell you I'm wrong.  But I'm sitting in a factory that makes 100% of a very well known 2-in-1 line of hair products.  The chemical engineer who works with all the formulations reports to the same guy I do, and he's a good friend.  I work with these products every day.  I've been doing this for almost 23 years now.</p>
<p>2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner is just the usual shampoo formula plus silicone.  It contains no part of the usual conditioner formula except the things shampoo and conditioner already have in common.  The silicone basically coats your hair and makes it slick, thereby less prone to tangles and it feels &quot;conditioned&quot;.  We are well aware of this because getting processing equipment clean after making a formula with silicone in it is a lot harder than the normal cleaning process.  It's a huge pain.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
