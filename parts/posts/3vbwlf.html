		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What makes you think calm air isn't stringy?</p>
<p>Edit: Since explaining in the form of a question is not ok, calm air exhibits the same stringy behavior.  You just can't see it.</p>
<p>Edit 2: To elaborate further, the long, straight stringy mixing is what gets called laminar flow. If gasses flow past each other slowly or with sufficiently low shear force, they tend to stretch out like this. When the smoke gets more wavy or swirly or mushroom cloud like, you're starting to see turbulence in the flow, which is often described by something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number" target="_blank">Reynolds Number</a>. </p>
<p>The primary force pushing the mixing of your smoke with the rest of the air is usually temperature. If you put hot air below cold air, they try to trade places in a wonderfully chaotic manner that you usually cannot see. For the smoke, it's heated by the burning thing that made it like a cigarette or incense stick. If you are sitting in a room that's colder than you, you're probably warming the air around you and making a neat looking stringy stream of air rising off the top of your head. This is also happening around everything else in the room giving off heat like your TV, computer, cat, toaster, lights, chargers, refrigerator condenser coils, etc.</p>
<p>If you are smoking and exhale, the cloud looks different because you are pushing the air much more forcefully than the natural convection of the heat. This makes the flow much more turbulent and cloudy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The stingy appearance might be laminar air flow, which is characterized by smooth even air flow.  Since the smoke is initially a higher temperature then the surrounding air there is a pressure difference in the &quot;air current&quot;, these tubes of different pressures are called stream tubes.  Think of drawing a bunch of parallel lines.  The smoke stays together because of this pressure difference, pressure is affected by temperature.  As the smokey air cools the pressure differential becomes less and less, until finally it matches the surrounding air and breaks up into turbulent flow.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer the original question: </p>
<ol>
<li>The flow has a 'stringy' appearance because it is initially laminar flow (i.e. parallel streamlines, i.e the fluid particles move parallel to each other) and is being driven upward by a density gradient (the hot smoky air is lighter than the cooler ambient air so it moves upward, similar to buoyancy) </li>
<li>The flow does not evenly disperse because the time it takes for dispersion to occur (see Sutherland-Einstein relation)  is long in comparison to the time in takes for the smoke to move upward due to the buoyancy force.</li>
</ol>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of off-the-mark answers here.  A large reason for the loss of laminar flow is actually due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability along all smoke-air interfaces, which is an instability that occurs due to a mismatch of densities <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Taylor_instability" target="_blank">&quot;which occurs when the lighter fluid is pushing the heavier fluid&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>The ELI5 version of that is:</p>
<p>If you have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Taylor_instability#/media/File:HD-Rayleigh-Taylor.gif" target="_blank">water on top of oil</a> (not oil on water!), you see crazy ripples as the water tries to push through the oil to get to the bottom.  With rising smoke, you have column of hot air representing the oil, being surrounded by the atmospheric air (the water) trying to push its way in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
