		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a lot of time to go into an in-depth answer, but cholesterol and fats were vilified mainly because when you looked at the hearts and blood vessels of people with cardiovascular disease, you see a lot of plaques which grow and harden and constrict the blood vessels around the heart and the rest of the body. And what are these plaques largely made of? Fats and cholesterol (and a bit of calcium). So naturally scientists looked into does the amount of fats (particularly saturated fats) consume affect the amount of fats and cholesterol blocking up their arteries? And they found that yes they did.</p>
<p>But fairly recently a group decided to look at weather a diet with increased saturated fats was worse for your health than a diet high in refined sugar. And surprisingly what they found is that actually the high sugar diet produced much a much more profoundly negative affect in the heart in just a few weeks. The high fat group had increased ldl levels (the &quot;bad cholesterol&quot;), they also had increased levels of hdl (the &quot;good cholesterol&quot;) which would mitigate a lot of the bad consequences of the ldl cholesterol. The high sugar group on the other hand showed higher levels of total cholesterol, higher ldl levels and lower hdl levels. This is likely due to the sugar causing the liver to release a lot of harmful fats into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Large amounts of sugars can also lead to insulin resistance and eventually can contribute to developing type 2 diabetes, which (amongst a lot of other things) increases your chances of developing heart disease. Sugar also increases your blood pressure.</p>
<p>So what about the studies before that linked high levels of fats in the diet to cardiovascular disease? Well it is true that people who eat more saturated fats are more likely to develope heart disease, what the researchers didn't take into account is that people eating a lot of saturated fats are much more likely to be consuming a lot more sugar, especially refined sugars.</p>
<p>So really the bottom line is to moderate your intake if refined/added sugars but you probably shouldn't load your diet up with high saturated-fat foods either, everything in moderation. Really avoiding any heavily processed foods which are usually very high in fats and sugars is a safe bet.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Uhh, this is something that really pisses me off because it is full of bad science.</p>
<p>First, the body is extraordinarily complex and the only real way to scientifically figure out how diet affects heart disease is to do a well controlled long term study with a large group of people.  You'll see lots of published research results where people make some sort of claim, but those end up being on small groups of people with marginal statistical significance.</p>
<p>So, here's the long term study you need to know about: the Framingham Heart Study.  It has been going on for over 50 years and tracked several generations of people in Framingham, Massachusetts.
Go here if you want to see all the peer reivewed papers
<a href="https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/fhs-bibliography/index.php" target="_blank">https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/fhs-bibliography/index.php</a></p>
<p>The major findings date from the 1960's:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cigarette smoking found to increase the risk of heart disease</li>
<li>Blood Cholesterol level, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram abnormalities found to increase the risk of heart disease</li>
<li>Physical activity found to reduce the risk of heart disease and obesity to increase the risk of heart disease</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, that blood cholesterol levels increase the risk of heart disease.  (This was before the figured out how to test LDL/HDL, it turns out that high levels of LDL cholesterol are the ones that increase the risk of heart disease. )  </p>
<p>Also, note that they don't say anything about diet.  You'll find lots of articles saying that eating X lowers your cholesterol, therefore it reduces the risk of heart disease.  But unless they do the double blind large scale test, you can't be sure.  The human body is very complex.</p>
<p>There have been cases (for cancer) where they did the double blind large scale test for a diet that they though would reduce the incidence of cancer, but it actually increased the rate of cancer.  Here's one with Carotene and lung cancer <a href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/Consortia/members/caret.html" target="_blank">https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/Consortia/members/caret.html</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The risk of heart disease for an average person will be dominated by two risk factors: being overweight and smoking. If you don't do either of those things, your risk is low. </p>
<p>It used to be thought that obesity was only indirectly correlated with heart disease, but new research reveals that it may be directly correlated. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>obesity [...] independently predicts coronary atherosclerosis. This relation appears to exist for both men and women with minimal increases in BMI. In a 14-year prospective study, middle-aged women with a BMI &gt;23 but &lt;25 had a 50% increase in risk of nonfatal or fatal coronary heart disease, and men aged 40 to 65 years with a BMI &gt;25 but &lt;29 had a 72% increased risk</p>

<p>As you can see, being even slightly overweight drastically increases heart disease risk. For reference, a BMI of 23 would be 160 lbs in a 5'10 person. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
