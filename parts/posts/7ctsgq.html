		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you take a close look at a bacteria, it's just a little bag of chemicals with a protective skin around it, plus some other stuff like hairs that can help it move. The chemicals are mostly water plus electrolytes and a few complex carbon-based molecules.</p>
<p>If the bacteria is placed in boiling water, the pressure inside rises and ruptures that skin, and then the chemicals inside leach out and dissipate into the water, while some get changed into other chemicals in the same way stuff like an egg changes when it cooks. But it's such a tiny amount of material and it's dispersed so thoroughly through so much more water that it's not noticeable or harmful or anything.</p>
<p>Baking or frying it does the same thing, rupturing the skin, except in this case there's no water to carry the chemicals away, so after the fluid in the bacteria evaporates you have a itsy-bitsy stain. RIP bacteria.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you boil water to kill bacteria, the dead bacteria remain in the water. If you steam distill water to purify it, the bacterial corpses will be left behind when the water evaporates. Filters can also remove viruses and dead bacteria from water. Bacteria can leave behind harmful toxins after they are killed, which may resist boiling. Depyrogenation is the process of removing or neutralizing these toxins from a solution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer your question: it stays there. That's why there are certain medical equipments that need to have the dead bacteria bodies taken off before they can be used and to speed up healing. </p>
<p>Anything that isn't made readily gaseous is going to stay - especially if you use methods of cleaning like auto-clave. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It's like boiling any vegetable or meat, only smaller.  Much smaller. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, heat in the form of boiling water essentially dissolves the bacteria into more basic elements. Heat in the form of air (baking or frying) does the same, only it vaporizes it.</p>
<p>But interestingly, soap works in a similar way. Soap chemically dissolves the protective &quot;skin&quot; of bacteria, effectively doing the same thing heat would to rupture it, only chemically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
