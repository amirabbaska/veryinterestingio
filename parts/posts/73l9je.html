		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a licensed professional engineer in HVAC, there are a variety of factors that have mostly been touched on already.:</p>
<p><strong>Radiation:</strong> You radiate heat to everything around you. When the temperature of everything around you decreases (such as the walls and windows would in the winter) you'll lose more heat. </p>
<p><strong>Convection:</strong> When the walls and windows are colder than the room, the air near them will cool, and this cold air will fall to the ground and move around your feet (Called a draft). In the summer, warm air goes up to the ceiling and unless you're 9ft tall, you won't feel that as much.</p>
<p><strong>Humidity:</strong> In the winter the air is often more dry in your house because the outside air can't hold as much much moisture. The sweat that you're always producing on some level will evaporate more quickly with low humidity, making you feel colder.</p>
<p>In general, temperatures don't make us comfortable. A certain level of <strong>heat transfer</strong> makes us comfortable. </p>
<p>There's actually a standard in our industry: ASHRAE standard 55 for thermal comfort that goes into great detail on this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real answer is relative humidity (moisture level of air), not all 60 degree temperature is equal, you are constantly losing moisture through your skin, and for that moisture to boil off (evapourate) it saps energy from you, cooling you down.</p>
<p>In the summer, there is a higher relative humidity in the air, slowing this process, if you heat yourself up enough, you will noticeably sweat as this moisture is having a slow evaporation process</p>
<p>In the winter relative humidity is drastically lower, causing this process to almost immediately draw moisture off of your skin cooling you rapidly, therefore making you colder, even though the air is still 60 degrees. This is more common in older homes that don't have a vapour barrier, if you install a humidifier, (or even have a hot shower or two without running the fan to raise levels) you may see noticeable improvements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s due to heat transfer from radiation. There are three types of heat transfer: convection, conduction, and radiation.  Convection and conduction both transfer heat linearly with changes in temperature, but radiation’s heat transfer is to the fourth power of temperature. </p>
<p>So basically if it’s 90 degrees out and you have a window pane, the inside of the glass may be 85 degrees, and it is radiating heat towards your body at a constant rate. Drop the outside temperature to 60 outside, and the drop of radiation heat transfer drops an absolutely massive amount. Remember, it’s not temperature you feel but the amount of energy that’s being transferred to your body ( think a 60 degree pool vs 60 degree air) </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to say for sure without more information but it's only 60 at the thermostat. There's going to be a gradient towards the outside walls and the outside temperature. Imagine a drafty house with 60 at the thermostat. In the summer it will be warmer closer to the window but in the winter it will colder closer to the window. If you are actually comfortable at 70 and you usual sit closer to the window you might need the thermostat at 80 in the winter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neat, I know this one.  There are three basic forms of heat transfer, convective (transfered through air) conductive (transferred through solid material contact) and radiative (does not need a medium to travel). If you're standing in the middle of the room, the heat transfer rate between the air and yourself is the same in both 60 degrees scenarios, however you're losing large amounts of heat to the cold exterior walls/windows through radiative heat transfer in the winter, making you feel relatively colder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
