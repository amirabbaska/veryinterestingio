<p>it seems like, in the reference frame of the person moving towards you, the wavelength would be different by a factor of 1/(1- v^(2)/c^2) so it would go from 3.2*10^-35 m to 6.1*10^-36 m. That would mean it was below the minimum wavelength though, so what would actually happen?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are correct in saying that wavelengths shorter than the Planck length are possible simply because you now Lorentz boosts (changes of reference frame) are symmetries, so you can always boost into a frame where any given photon has a post-Planckian momentum, wavelength, period, etc.</p>
<p>However, a sub-Planckian wavelength λ is &quot;not observable&quot; to you because it cannot be used to locate an object with accuracy λ like you would be able with a normal wavelength, because your photon would create a black hole as soon as it interacts with anything (anything with a &quot;normal&quot; wavelength)*. The smaller λ, the bigger the black hole.</p>
<p>Moreover, the photon is not necessarily a point particle all the way down. In string theory, being a string, it has a minimum size which more or less is a Planck length. So when the wavelength gets smaller than Planck, it's not really a good measure of the photon's localization since its own structural size is larger.</p>
<p>So this should give an intuition into the subtleties of the Planck length works as a minimum length scale. It's not like a grid size or anything of the sort, but it is still a minimum length in some very unconventional sense. I've discussed this a bit more in detail <a href="https://hologrammata.wordpress.com/2017/02/20/is-the-planck-length-the-minimum-possible-length/" target="_blank">here</a> if you're interested. </p>
<p>* actually, this is not strictly correct, see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5xg3wi/if_photons_have_a_minimum_wavelength_what_happens/dei3mjj/" target="_blank">here</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is, as yet, no evidence that the Planck length has any physical significance. It <em>might</em> do, according to some theories of quantum gravity, but then again it might not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is at the speculative edge of physics.  There is no strong observation evidence so you need theory.  But which one?  Physics is unclear about what's going on at around the Planck Length.  Interestingly, this is actually a feature of an alternate theory of black holes by Pawel Mazur and Emil Mottola :</p>
<p>&quot;Quantum theory says that any scale smaller than the Planck length is unobservable and meaningless to physics and physicists. This limit can be imposed on the wavelength of a beam of light so as to obtain a limit of blue shift that the light can undergo. This becomes important for the structure of a gravastar because general relativity says that a gravitational well blue-shifts incoming light, so around the extremely large mass of a gravastar there is a region of &quot;immeasurability&quot; to the outside universe as the wavelength of the light approaches, and then passes, the Planck length. This region is called a &quot;gravitational vacuum&quot;, because it is a void in the fabric of space and time.&quot;</p>
