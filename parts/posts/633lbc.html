<p>Someone I know just got back from a service trip to Jamaica to teach first aid and CPR to villagers and describes a place where everyone is poor, and there are no jobs and no place to go.</p>
<p>Are there any particular reasons, historical or otherwise, for this trend? I have been to Bermuda and the Bahamas and even in the high traffic tourism areas you can tell how poor the people are and how sadly hopeless their situations seem.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Historical and geographical reasons.</p>
<p>Most of those islands were colonized by Spain in the 16th and 17th century and used to produce sugar and tropical fruit crops.  The colonial government had little interest in improving infrastructure, education, or standard of living and many of the residents were slaves.</p>
<p>When the Spanish empire started to unravel those islands found themselves suddenly self-governing with little experience or resources.</p>
<p>Since then they've struggled with corrupt governments, meddling from cold war superpowers, and the simple lack of resources on an island.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a complicated question but i'll give it ago: Poor governance and an atmosphere of zero accountability permeates much of the Caribbean. Blatant corruption, often at the highest levels of government, frequently goes unaddressed.
Small islands like the Caribbean certainly dont have it easy despite the year round sunshine. Aside from sunlight, most of these islands have little natural resources of their own, and are forced to import majority of goods which makes the cost of living higher.
It would be unfair to say that a history of slavery and colonialism have not played a role in the Caribbean's current predicament, but as a person who lives here, it would be disingenuous to be blame anyone else but ourselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These countries have a highly polarized economy with tourism is the primary national product.   Corruption is rampant within the Government.  Tax evasion is commonplace.  Lots of business is done with cash.  Huge multinational corporations own most of the hotels and resorts.  There is a small, powerful elite class of professionals and businessmen who control the service and support sectors.  Everybody else pushes a broom, turns a wrench or hustles for a living.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jumping in as a Bermudian here...Bermuda is not a Caribbean island (it's really quite far away from the Caribbean...no where near it, in fact), and it is definitely not a 3rd world country...quite developed and wealthy, in fact.  It's a tax haven and makes rather god use of the wealth it accumulates from that.  There is some poverty (more in recent years), but...well...Bermuda is quite different from other places mentioned here.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
