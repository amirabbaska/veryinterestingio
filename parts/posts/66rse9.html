		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Swallowing solids and liquids works slightly differently.</p>
<p>Swallow with an empty mouth and pay attention to what you're doing: The tip of your tongue presses against the roof of your mouth just behind your teeth, then 'rolls' along the roof of your mouth backwards towards your throat.</p>
<p>Basically, it's two actions: You open your throat and your tongue forces your food towards it.</p>
<p>When you chug water, you don't do that. There's no need to force the liquid to the back of your mouth, because your head's tipped back and gravity takes care of that for you...basically all you're doing it rhythmically opening and closing your throat.</p>
<p>So, swallowing with an empty mouth is a complex action, and because you're not swallowing anything but saliva and air, you have to manually 'reset' your tongue between swallows. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically, these answers are all a little off the mark. You can indeed swallow similarly to when you chug water. When you take a single, dry swallow (or swallow a bite of food) your voice box (larynx) raises and moves anteriorly to protect your airway (one of several safety mechanisms built into our airway). When you take sequential sips, your larynx remains raised, allowing for small movements and pressure from the bolus (water in this case) to open the muscle at the entrance to your esophagus (upper esophageal sphincter). Try swallowing and keeping your larynx high, then continue swallowing without fully &quot;resetting&quot; the system. It's easier to do with water, as swallowing is largely reflexive, but it can be done volitionally as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical speech-language pathologist: swallowing is triggered by sensory receptors in your throat. When performing a 'dry swallow' with no food or liquid in your mouth, there is no material to 'activate' these sensors. The small amount of saliva in your mouth will usually allow you to do it once or twice, but once that is gone, most people are unable to swallow until more saliva is built back up.</p>
<p>This is also why it is very difficult to prevent yourself from swallowing once food/liquid goes into your throat. Once these sensors detect a bolus, the swallow response is triggered. If, on the other hand, that sensory system is not working as it should, then you may end up with a delayed or absent swallow response. That's when I come to see you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first swallow, you're swallowing spit. Second swallow, there's no saliva for your tongue to push into your throat, so the peristalsis reflex (reflex where esophagus squeezes in a wave to push food down) doesnt happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
