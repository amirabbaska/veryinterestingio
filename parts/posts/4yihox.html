		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's going to vary but somewhere in the range of billions per day.  Viruses are everywhere.  The vast majority are not infectious to humans.</p>
<p>To give some perspective, I used to grow bacteriophage (viruses that infect bacteria) for my grad school work.  (Growing nanotech structures with engineered viruses, to be exact)  When I grew them and did a rough purification, I would end up with 50-100 uL of viscous liquid that was about the size of one eyedropper drop.  That amount of concentrated phage extract would have around 10 trillion bacteriophage in it.</p>
<p>Bacteriophage exist in huge quantities in the ocean.  Their combined mass is estimated to be 20 <em>times</em> the collective mass of all the ocean's whales.  They are in a constant battle with the ocean's bacteria.  Roughly 30% of the bacteria in the ocean die from bacteriophage attack every day.</p>
<p>All the other biomes on Earth have <a href="http://jb.asm.org/content/186/12/3677.short" target="_blank">comparable levels</a> of viral infestation.  (though not quite as bad as the ocean)  So yeah, you're probably coming into contact with tens of billions of viruses daily, if not more.</p>
<p>That's not even counting the huge numbers in your gut, predating all the bacteria there.</p>

<p>Edit:  FFS, this kind of blew up.  I'm AFK for the day, I'll try and respond to stuff later tonight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>NPR published an article <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/06/04/411469959/how-many-viruses-have-infected-you" target="_blank">&quot;How Many Viruses Have Infected You?&quot;</a></p>
<p>It describes that we are able genetically test for them &quot;But there are limitations. The test can only find evidence of past infection with viruses that are already known&quot;. In other words if we dont know what we are looking for we can say you have had it, which means you could have had 1000s of infections but we arent sure how to test for them.</p>
<p>Notable quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;people living in South Africa, Peru, and Thailand tended to have antibodies against more viruses than people in the United States.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;And we get between 95 percent and 100 percent correct determinations of known viruses.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>End thoughts/anecdotal: Potentially a lot, potentially a few. We may have been infected with a lot but we are unable to determine them due to not knowing what to look for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are constantly exposed to viruses, every second while we eat, breathe, drink, etc. Some are harmless, others are harmful, but only a small proportion will actually be able to &quot;infect&quot; the host. Of those that do a large proportion will again be destroyed by both active and passive immune functions (enzymes, antibodies, etc.) before they can cause any issues, or will fail to replicate, or otherwise be inert. Those that do infect their target cell/cells/etc will then begin to replicate and if they cause an immune response will eventually be destroyed, or kill the host, or integrate into the host genome, or fail. The TL;DR: The number is too high to count/estimate as there's no way to measure how many viruses you'll ever contact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You come into contact with billions of viruses everyday. Many of them are RNA viruses that get destroyed by RNase on your skin. The common cold is technically a virus as well (that's why taking antibiotic when you have the common cold is pointless!). You'll inevitably get those once in a while. Viruses also undergo rapid evolutionary mutations reinforced by things like selective pressure (eg vaccination and host immune system). That's why vaccines against common viruses like the flu have to be reformulated every year. So the answer is basically; incalculable. You come into contact with viruses everyday, you just don't know it because your body does a good job of protecting you against them. The only viruses that we actually count are when they begin to impact our health significantly like symptoms stemming from HIV or Hepatitis. Viral loads begin to take on significance in those cases and even that number is not constant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
