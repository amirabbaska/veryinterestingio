		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This might not seem like a hard question but it has an reasonably complex answer like most things in food science;       </p>
<p>Its partially due to factors such as lipid oxidation (fats tasting bad), food dehydrating slightly, starch retrogradation (starches re-organising into bad tasting structures as it cools), loss of desirable characteristics such as crunch/smell/texture/warmth/bun fluffiness etc. Basically the food just looses its desirable characteristics. Due to the ingredients, structure and storage methods of fast food, the loss of desirable characteristics typically occurs faster. That is not to say the ingredients in fast food are lower quality, just that they are not designed to be eaten hours later and this reflects on the loss of characteristics . Yeah i know that might not be satisfying to hear, but going deeper than surface level starts to involve 4-page long explanations of why your bun went soggy.      </p>
<p>There is also the fact that cold fast food that has been out for hours creates a subversion of expectation. There is a lot of psychology in food science that helps uncover what attributes people like and what they do not. To reduce the section on expectations to a ridiculously simple level: if it doesn't match expectations or previous experiences, most people wont like it.  There is also a bit of difference to how critical people are over food made at home vs made by someone else. If say  a home-made steak is over-seasoned most people will think something along the lines of &quot;well its not perfect but its not too bad&quot; whereas if they just paid $30 for the steak and its over-seasoned they will likely think &quot;this steak sucks&quot; </p>
<p>So when you have a burger that is cold, has a soggy bun, smells like cardboard your brain essentially flicks a switch that makes you think &quot;this isn't its supposed to be, this is not good&quot;. You can change this preference by exposing yourself to more and more cold fast food, if you so wish. This can eliminate the dislike or even create a preference for cold food. It generally takes several (10-20) exposures over a short time frame (3-4 weeks) for this effect to start working. (or many exposures over a long period)   </p>
<p>As to why home-made foods taste &quot;fine&quot; is a pretty massive and ambiguous question and would probably vary by individual. Major reasons would likely be lower/fewer expectations, many experiences in eating that food cold before, different ingredient structure and quality, different storage methods, different cooking methods and understanding that home-made food isn't a set experience and has wide variation in end results.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually if we make fast-food type of meals at home, we leave them in their separate constituent parts (bun, toppings, burger) until we want to reheat them, and we skip the fries.<br />
If you bought the parts separately from the fast food place and put it together later it'd be fine too.</p>
<p>It's the same as the food you make at home.<br />
Bake French fries and make a fully dressed burger, then let them get cold and try to eat them after a few hours.<br />
The burger bun will be all mushy with the toppings, and the fries will be gross as hell.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>[edit: fixed word order]</p>
<p>If you ate a bit, when it was fresh, then your next bites will taste less and less exciting. This is true for all your senses. You become desensitized to things until you take some time away from them.</p>
<p>Just think about how sweet luke warm tap water tastes, when you are dying of thirst.</p>
<p>The other answers are correct, but desensitization is an important part of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
