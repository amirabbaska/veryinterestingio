		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The arch shaped crown of a tunnel matches the shape of the stress pattern induced naturally by a cavity within the ground, so a tunnel tends to be stable other than for spalling of small chunks from the roof.  Spalling causes progressive deterioration of the tunnel, and needs to be controlled, such as with bricks, cast concrete, reinforced shotcrete or other tunnel liner system.  A tunnel through hard, strong, weathering-resistant and unfractured bedrock might not need to be lined.  </p>
<p>Cracks alone do not hurt a liner system;  cracks normally occur in most concrete and brickwork due to shrinkage or during local stress redistribution.  However, physical displacement of cracked portions of the liner would be a more serious symptom.  </p>
<p>The other main purpose of a tunnel liner system is to control groundwater seepage.  Some liners include a drainage layer that conducts seepage down to drains near the floor.  A crack that occasionally drips would likely be considered normal.  A crack that is spraying or gushing groundwater into the tunnel would become problematic due to erosion and serviceability issues. </p>
<p>Cracks can be repaired by low-pressure grouting of cement mortar into the cavity behind the liner, with care to avoid interfering with drainage.  Another method is to bolt steel plates onto the cracked liner.  However, a liner that is merely cracked (but not displaced) might well be stable and functioning in a satisfactory manner in accordance with its design.  Tunnels should be routinely inspected by a tunnelling engineer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microearthquake monitoring is used in mines to monitor the health of the tunnels.  Collapse is not generally a single catastrophic event but is proceeded by a period of increased activity.   Use of multiple sensors allows 3-D location of potential problem areas which can be inspected and strengthened.   The process is not perfect but it works.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is done in other transport and other tunnels, but I guess it would be used in modern tunnels depending on the geology and engineering assessment.   In mining the tunnel must go to the target ore; other tunnels will typically have the luxury of choosing an optimal path through the geology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
