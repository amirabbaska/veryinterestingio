		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a type of tax-advantaged retirement account available in the US, set up by employers for their employees to use. The employee controls how much money gets put in, up to a certain amount ($18,500 for this year). The money is withdrawn straight from their paycheck to deposit in the account. The money is usually invested rather than just sitting in a savings account. In some companies, the company will match part or all of an employee's contributions to the account. You have to pay a penalty if you withdraw money from the account before you're 59.5 years old.</p>
<p>There's two ways to put money in: either traditional (you don't pay income taxes on the money now, but you do pay taxes when you withdraw the money in retirement) or Roth (you pay income taxes now, you don't pay any income taxes on the money when you withdraw in retirement).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a society, we think it is a good thing for people to save and invest money for retirement. In fact, we think that it's such a good thing that the government tries to incentivize people to save. The government says &quot;if you agree to save money from your paycheck now - and not touch it until you retire - we'll give you tax discounts on that money.&quot; The specific part of the tax code which allows this is defined in section 401 subsection k.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a form of tax advantaged retirement fund that an employer can contribute to. Let's break that down.</p>
<p>Tax advantaged: You don't pay taxes on income earned from assets in the fund. Suppose you buy a government bond. Normally, when that bond pays out, you have to pay income tax on your profit. But if the bond is in a 401(k), you don't. Similarly, you wouldn't have to pay tax on stock dividends, or capital gains. The idea here is to encourage people to set aside money for their retirement, and most of your assets in a 401(k) will be in the form of investments that would otherwise have tax implications, rather than just being in cash. The &quot;catch&quot; is that you have to pay income tax when you take money out of it after you're retired. However, because most people earn less money when they're retired than when they're working, they'll be in a lower tax bracket, so the income tax their paying will still likely be less than what they would have payed without the 401(k)</p>
<p>Retirement fund: Money you've saved away for retirement. You can take money out of a 401(k) before you retire, but there's a big tax penalty. So don't put money away that you aren't OK doing without until you're over 65.</p>
<p>Employer contributions: Employers are allowed to contribute funds to the 401(k)s of their employees. This is general done by matching contributions up to a limit - that is, if you say &quot;I'm going to set aside $100 from each paycheck for my 401(k)&quot;, an employer would make that contribution for you come payday, deducting it from your pay from that period, but then would <em>also</em> throw in $100 additional. So it's a nice perk for attracting and holding on to good talent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You'all suck at ELI5. What kind of fucking five-year-old knows what a &quot;tax-advantaged retirement account&quot; is? Lets give this a go.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lets pretend that you help your friend Tom with his parents' lemonade stand and they gives you a cut of the money they make. However, for every dollar that you make at the stand, your big brother (David, not Rick) takes 40 cents from you, you know, because David is a dick.</p>
<p>A 401k is like having your own piggy bank that Tom's parents can pay your money to you directly (instead of paying in cash). The beauty of this is that David can't touch a penny of it until you crack open the piggy bank. Additionally, you have awesome parents who want to teach you to be good with your money, so for every dollar you have saved at the end of each week, they will give you a penny. </p>
<p>Now, while you can't crack open your piggy bank for a long time (until it's full), you're getting a ton of penny's from your parents because your dick brother David isn't stealing like half of your money first. And, while David is still going to take his cut when you crack open your piggy bank, you end up with WAY more extra pennies in the end. </p>
<p>There's also Employer Match. Tom's parents are in cahoots with your parents and they like the idea of you not blowing all of your money on candy/toys, so for every dollar you put into the piggy bank, Tom's parents add a second dollar to the piggy bank.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My sister is my beneficiary for my 401k. I didn’t add her social, just her name and address. How will they find her if I die before I can collect? Also, will the account be subject to the same rules (no withdrawal before 66.5, same index fund allocations, etc) if it is now her asset? Will it still be a 401k, just my sister’s 401k?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
