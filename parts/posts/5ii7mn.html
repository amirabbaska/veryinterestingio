I didn't like it but, i guess they could always claim i didn't hear them knock.... BUT Now I live in apartment complex with a 24/7 package concierge and a fulling running leasing office 9a-6p... The driver just flat out lies... It happens over and over again. I once just sat outside one morning with my doggy to see if the driver would show up... sure enough.. no show as i get the text notification that the delivery attempt failed.  How can a company do business like this and get away with practices like this with no real repercussions. </p>
<p>Update: 11:49pm - I am going to change the flair on this to economics, mostly because maybe i am realizing a bigger questions for me is, as there are less and less companies and choices out there and as we lose more and more power as consumers, whats to keep all companies from just not caring. Our power as the consumer public used to come from the &quot;i'll take my business elsewhere&quot; but more and more thats becoming difficult to do&quot; </p></div></div>
