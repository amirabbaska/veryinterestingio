		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The FCC Privacy regulation would have prevented ISPs from selling your social security number, medical information, information about your children, and similar extremely personal information without your express consent.  This regulation would have come into effect later this year.  The FCC is now prohibited from trying to make similar regulations in the future.</p>
<p>So there's no actual change to the status quo: ISPs are able to sell any information they have about you.  Your ISP may allow you to opt out of this; I recommend searching for <ISP> Residential privacy policy, and searching for &quot;opt-out&quot; on that page.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually wrote a somewhat indepth post regarding what the rollback means and what you could do to protect yourself: <a href="http://infinitejestexcellentfancy.blogspot.com/2017/03/fcc-rollback-what-just-happened-and.html" target="_blank">http://infinitejestexcellentfancy.blogspot.com/2017/03/fcc-rollback-what-just-happened-and.html</a></p>
<p>Very basically: your internet service provider ISP  (meaning Verizon/AT&amp;T/T-Mobile...) can now collect, store and sell your internet browsing history, the content of your messages and emails (if these are available), your geo-information (GPS data on your phone), and which apps you used on your phone (and when, for how long...).</p>
<p>This data comes with your name (or potentially, social security number) and will be used by advertisement companies for targeted marketing.</p>
<p>Ofcourse, advertisement companies know nothing about keeping databases secure, so we run the risk of someone leaking this information. At which case everyone is getting doxed.</p>
<p>Hope this helped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
