		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The MKUltra project wasn't about some kind of mysterious &quot;mind control&quot; ability.  It was a research project to investigate a wide variety of drugs and forms of torture that could be used to further the CIA's agendas.  The reason it's often called the &quot;CIA mind control project&quot; is because part of the project was investigating drugs such as LSD that they hoped would make victims vulnerable to suggesting and manipulation.</p>
<p>Experiments of the project mostly include administering various drugs to people and then conducting behavioral tests, sometimes without the victims' knowledge or consent.  LSD was their primary focus, but they also tested a number of other drugs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra#Other_drugs" target="_blank">from the Wikipedia article</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other experiments involved heroin, morphine, temazepam (used under code name MKSEARCH), mescaline, psilocybin, scopolamine, cannabis, alcohol, and sodium pentothal</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think less 'mind control' and more 'using drugs to torture people'. For instance, say you recruit a bunch of college students to do a scientific test, and have them sign non-disclosure agreements. This is a relatively rich market, as there are always college students willing to spend a few hours being poked in exchange for a token sum that can be spent on food or alcohol. Tell them whatever you want; it's enshrined in American law and scientific ethics that it's 100% ok to lie to test subjects about what you actually plan on doing to them, so long as they know they're being tested in a broad sense. Give them each their own room, pump half of them full of saline solution, the other half full of LSD, and blast them with light and sound and see if the LSD-dosed students beg for mercy before the saline crew. Afterwards, write down your results, hand each kid $20 and remind them that if they break their non-disclosure agreement you will send them to federal pound-you-in-the-ass penitentiary. </p>
<p>As for how they found out, the MK-series experiments left a pretty broad paper trail, and as time went on more and more of it made it out into the open air. At first it was mostly rumor and hearsay, hence how ULTRA got it's killer rep as a &quot;mind control&quot; program. But as the years ground on, stuff got declassified or released via the Freedom of Information Act, and the actual paperwork started entering public knowledge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To piggy back off of other people's comments, apparently only 20,000 pages of the original document was found because the rest were destroyed. That's noteworthy, especially considering people claiming to be MKUltra victims went into extensive detail about how the program also entailed sexual abuse, the attempt to produce people that could wage psychological warfare through psychic means, and the act of inducing dissociation to create personalities that would do their bidding, kind of like pawns or figureheads. </p>
<p>It sounds crazy, but governments, which are comprised of people in positions of power, do crazy things in order to keep a grip on the power they already have or to obtain even more. I can't imagine that anyone wanting that much authority is sane, so it really doesn't seem like a far stretch that they actually tried all of those known things and worse. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The series &quot;Manhunt&quot; on Netflix about the Unabomber has an absolutely amazing depiction of Ted K's version of what he went through in MKUltra at Harvard. Some people are convinced that his experiences in MKUltra led him to what he became. The scenes are so sad I definitely felt bad for him. </p>
<p>In the series, a very young and lonely Ted turns to a larger-than-life professor at Harvard for support. The professor spends a year encouraging Ted's anti-technology ideas and builds-up his ego and trust. Ted absolutely worships the professor and participates in his experiments to please him. During the second year, the professor does a complete 180 and belittles Ted, destroying his ego and ideas. It is revealed that the professor never cared about Ted and only used him for his twisted experiments, and Ted is broken forever. I'm sure it's dramatized to some extent, but I believe much of the content of the show is taken from first-hand accounts and interviews. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
