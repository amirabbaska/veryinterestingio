		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I know.  Strange question.  But I was watching a neighbor pass by my house on a skateboard today, and I started wondering about the physics of it.  Obviously, he was moving between points A and B on his journey faster than he would be walking.  But then again, he also has to occasionally use one foot to push against the ground several times to keep the momentum of the skateboard moving forward at a higher speed than if he was just walking.</p>
<p>My question is basically is he ending up expending the SAME amount of total energy by the &quot;pushing&quot; of his one foot while using the skateboard as he would if he was just walking the same distance traveled using two feet?  </p>
<p>Assume all other things are equal, as in the ground being level in the comparison, etc.</p>
<p>My intuition says there is no such thing as a &quot;free energy lunch&quot;.  That regardless of how he propels his body between two points, he would have to expend the same amount of energy regardless whether he was walking or occasionally pushing the skateboard with one foot.  But I'm not sure about that right now.  Are there any other factors involved that would change the energy requirement expended? Like the time vs distance traveled in each case? </p>
<p>EDIT:  I flaired the question as Physics, but it might be an Engineering question instead.</p>
<p>EDIT 2:  Wow.  I never expected my question to generate so many answers.  Thanks for that.  I do see now that my use of the words &quot;energy expended&quot; should probably have been &quot;work done&quot; instead.  And I learned things I didn't know to begin with about &quot;skateboards&quot;.  I never knew there were...and was a difference between...&quot;short&quot; and &quot;long&quot; boards.  The last time I was on a &quot;skateboard&quot; was in the late 1960's.  I'd hurt myself if I got on one today.</p></div></div>
