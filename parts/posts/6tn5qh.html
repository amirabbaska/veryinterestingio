		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I rode in a 2017 Honda Civic with a CVT.  While it was accelerated hard to 60, I heard and felt what certainly seemed to be distinct gear upshifts.  But it has a CVT.  So, it supposedly has a Continuously Variable Transmission and does not have distinct gears.  So, ELI5, what was I hearing and feeling?</p>
<p>*edit:  Thanks for the replies.  It seems that Honda added in simulated gear shifts.  Which is dumb.  Seems like there should be a software hack to remove them!</p></div></div>

<p>Edit: I didn't think people would get worked up over transmissions this much</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you press the accelerator hard, CVT changes the usual ratios to quasi-sport-mode to give you a boost of torque and passing power. That is what you feel.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're hearing and feeling is a manufactured sensation of gear changes. CVT doesn't have traditional gears and doesn't &quot;shift&quot; however, manufacturers found that drivers did not enjoy the constant torque (and sound) of a CVT transmission and added in simulated gear shifts.</p>
<p>IIRC it's mentioned in the Engineering Explained video on CVT: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb6rIZfCuHI&t=5s" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb6rIZfCuHI&t=5s</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve driven a Nissan Maxima that did the same thing. The CVT is programmed to make a few sudden changes to the overall ratio as opposed to sliding across the range, simulating shift points you’d feel with a traditional transmission.</p>
<p>If you want to feel a CVT without the shift points, I believe the Fusion Hybrid I drove for a week operated in this manner.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
