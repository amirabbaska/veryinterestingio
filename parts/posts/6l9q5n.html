My question is how can these tho vs simply get buried? Esp. In places where humans have always lived and nature hasn't reclaimed the settlment.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of course, the natural processes mentioned by others are a major contributor to city and structure burial. This <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/04/underground-rome/376836/" target="_blank">Atlantic Article</a> quickly sums up a more human element (with regards to buried Roman ruins within Rome).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ancient Rome slipped from sight gradually, in a 2,500-year process of natural silting and intentional burial that was already well advanced in classical times. Roman architects frequently tore the roofs from old buildings and filled their interiors with dirt, to make solid foundations for new structures. They embedded earlier buildings in tremendous landfills that raised the ground level of the entire site by several yards. Sometimes they entombed whole neighborhoods in this way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd make a quick parallel to the modern day: the massive landfills that naturally emerge outside the borders of any modern city/town/settlement. Simply put, trash has to go somewhere, and sometimes it buries buildings, too. Couple that with buildings that are already crumbling due to disrepair, and you've got a <em>reason</em> for people to bury structures. </p>
<p>Lastly, look at New York City. Layers on layers of functional infrastructure within a modern city that would not be all that surprising to collectively forget about over thousands of years. Some of those layers were dug while others once saw the light of day</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In reference to the pyramids, the Sahara is encroaching (the sand dunes are are moving/spreading) to the east.  Other structures can be buried under sediment by river flood deposits or redistributed by erosion.  Basically windblown or waterborne sediments get deposited on top of stuff over time. Sometimes it's fast like a volcanic ashe deposit or mudslide. Sometimes slow like the encroaching desert or repeated flood deposits.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Weather moving dust/sand around and stuff is definitely a component like other people have mentioned, however, my ecology teacher who specialized in architectural archeology explained how or was EARTH WORMS*! Some species dig up to 6 feet straight down... And carry the soil up. Iirc at a rate of 6cm/10 years?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another factor is old buildings deteriorate and are usually torn down. In pre-industrial times, it was not easy to cart that rubble elsewhere, so new houses/buildings would be built over the old ones. Hence many archeological sites are layered into different historical periods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Go to a graveyard or look at footpaths / sidewalks in quiet areas. Weeds and grass move slowly over the edges and trap more and more dirt, leaves etc and then plants grow into that. It's a never ending cycle. Last week I uncovered a gravestone locally that was only placed in 1985, but was completely hidden by grass and about 1cm of soil. I expect the process is pretty serious over 100 or 1000 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
