<p>Minor keys contain more dissonance, meaning that when you analyze the waveforms, the separate frequencies do not cycle together. They are &quot;out of sync&quot; on a physical level.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people want to claim that sounds are purely subjective art, but they're not. Sounds are waveforms. If you select frequencies at intervals that coincide, they're going to sound good to your ear.</p>
<p>Layer together waveforms with intervals that do not coincide and your ear will be able to tell that the dissonance makes the waveforms clash with one another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Iranian love songs, or Georgian plowing songs, for instance, can been in, what a westerner would consider, dissonant or &quot;minor&quot; (non well temperament) keys and will be about happiness and prosperity. Also one should consider that scientifically, well temperament, the basis of most western popular music, is very dissonant when looking at the relationship of notes in a chord. Also there are many other scales. You have scales like Dorian, Mixolydian, Harmonic Minor, Lydian and the like which can definitely convey some more nuanced emotions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question.
A few things that I'd like to point to which I think might contribute to the discussion.
The relative degree of consonance/dissonance is directly associated with the number of cycles that are required before 2 (or more) notes repeat their pattern. e.g. in a unison it is a 1:1 ratio and so the two notes are considered consonant. Whereas the tritone/A4/D5 is an irrational number which when we use the same criteria takes the biggest number of cycles before resolution/repetition of the pattern compared to other intervals. Some other intervals, depending on the tuning system used, are 5:4 or 3:2 which resolve faster than the tritone and so, are described as consonant. You can complete the mathematics for any chord and this holds up to any cultural ordering of consonance/dissonance that I am aware of.
When comparing the major key to the minor key in western music, we have a set of melodic and harmonic structures that are common to both. What is happening here is that these two keys, while both considered consonant have slightly different variations. They are tied together and comparable largely due to the dominant -&gt; tonic (V-I, whatever you want to call it) which gives us a cadence. When you compare the harmonies found in these two keys and the intervals used to create the melodies, the minor key is slightly more dissonant than the major key. Given this is the case, and making some assumptions that brains all process patterns in a similar way (big assumption, i know) I think we have an argument for a natural predisposition due to slower pattern recognition in the minor key. Perhaps the minor key lends itself to slower tempo so as to allow time for melodies/harmonies to process, this may make the association stronger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
