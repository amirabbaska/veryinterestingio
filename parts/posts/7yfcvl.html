<p>Edit - much has to do with the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_culture" target="_blank">physical culture</a> movement of the late 1800's. </p>
<p>Long story short, large-scale industrialization took much of the workforce out of the labor intensive work of agriculture, into jobs where factory workers would continuously perform the same action over and over again. This led to a drop in overall fitness for the population, especially seen in the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=N-m_CwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;ots=brfXUQyTu-&amp;dq=Victorian%20army%20physical%20culture&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=Victorian%20army%20physical%20culture&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Victorian Armies</a> of the time who noticed that many of their soldiers were ineffective due to poor fitness. </p>
<p>Slowly, exercising and eating well were blasted into the minds of the public from media giants like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernarr_Macfadden" target="_blank">Bernarr McFadden</a> and gyms and exercise routines were built up around it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ancient Civilizations such as Greeks, Egyptians, Assyrians and others used Calisthenics to train their soldiers and later, athletes.  They based their workouts on the basic movements that every human goes through, lifting, pushing, pulling, walking, etc.  The Greeks and Romans placed importance on physical prowess.  The Greek philosophy was: sound body, sound mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
