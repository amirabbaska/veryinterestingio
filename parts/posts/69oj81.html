<p>Most lanes today are made of a synthetic material. Also in sections that can be replaced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, there are many dents in most lanes from people throwing the ball. They are just hard to see depending on the light. They are minimized by the harder wood at the front, completely sanding the lanes every few years, and putting down a new finish (at my old bowling alley we did this every year). Most league houses don't use real wood anymore, which I understand is easier to repair. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>TLDR: support prevents dents allows only crushing which is smaller and harder to see </p>
<p>The lanes are sitting on top of concrete. When the ball hits the only part of the board that can move is right under the ball. Most dents (the bigger more noticeable ones) involve big area moving a little <a href="https://goo.gl/images/McEhPq" target="_blank">little</a>, the wood can't do that. The ball can only crush the fibers right under it, making a smaller (harder to see) thing.  <a href="https://goo.gl/images/a2Zv1t" target="_blank">smaller dent </a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
