		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly you are smelling &quot;outgassint&quot; -- the various plastics and adhesives used to make car steadily emit small amounts of gases. They do this a lot when they're brand new, then it gradually tapers off, but the materials continue to outgas even years later when heated, like when the car is parked in the hot sun. The gases are a combination of the material itself and the solvents used in manufacturing. Some of them such as formaldehyde are somewhat toxic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plasticizers (chemical which are added to polymers to make them flexible). The plasticizers are volatile and boil off over time. Loss of plasticizer is why old upholstery is often cracked. Most plasticizers are various forms of phthalate.</p>

<p>And other things, most of which is probably not good for you to breathe over a long period of time.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not related to new car scent, but along the same lines:  why do many department stores in a chain all smell the same?  For example:  a Target or a Kohls in NJ will smell identical to one in FL.  Do they use a required air freshener or cleaner?  Is it the products themselves?  Always wondered this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it really depends on the car. there was an article about a dude who brought a professional smeller into a bunch of new cars to try to identify them. mostly plastic, and leather. each car had its own different source of smells. some car companies even have specific departments related to smelling / allowing materials in their cars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
