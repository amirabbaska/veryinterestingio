		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we age our vocal chords weaken and become drier. Our respiratory systems and torsos change, too, with our lungs and chest cavities becoming more rigid, while our spines curve, causing us to stoop over (for some a little, others a lot). Weakened and dry vocal chords become stringy, which prevent normal vibration, causing higher pitched voices that sound thin. And the transformations in the respiratory system and chest mean we have less power behind our voices. Even the joints in our vocal chords can become arthritic, contributing to problems. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has a name presbyphonia which literally just means ageing voice. </p>
<p>As you age your connective  tissue and muscles become weaker. So rather than nice taught vocal cords when you’re phonating they become more flabby. This makes you voice become more breathy. </p>
<p>Voice therapy can help, it’s essentially a work out for your voice. </p>
