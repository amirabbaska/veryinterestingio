		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Communism is at the very far left of the left/right political spectrum. Laissez faire capitalism is its opposite at the far right. Communism is a form of utopia, a perfect human society. However true communism is doomed to fail 100% of the time due to human nature. If society was populated by robots then communism would function perfectly.</p>
<p>True communism calls for all property and the means of production to be owned by the state. All citizens are treated equally. The flaw that will always destroy communism happens when people realise that video game testers, dog walkers, supermodel masseurs, and food critics get the same compensation as ditch diggers, sewage truck workers, hot tar roofers, and morticians. Since society only needs very few video game testers and a large amount of garbage men and ditch diggers, how do you convince anyone to do the less desirable jobs? In communism you are unable to use compensation as an incentive to balance the job market. You can only rely on altruism or lack of self-interest. A society relying on a lack of self-interest from the vast majority of citizens in order to function is doomed to failure. The further you move left the less power compensation has and the more that society must rely on altruism and lack of self-interest.</p>
<p>Capitalism uses supply and demand to balance the job market with the available labour pool. The balance provided by supply and demand can be manipulated towards the left with certain tools such as unions, minimum wage and labour laws. However, without the balance provided by those socialist tools, monopolies will inevitably form and laissez faire capitalism will fail. Monopolies are as certain to doom laissez faire capitalism as self-interest is to doom communism. </p>
<p>As in most things the answer to a healthy society lies somewhere in the middle. Just how far left or right of centre your perfect society lies depends on your view of your fellow man. If you believe man to be fundamentally good then you are more likely to be on the right side. The right side generally calls for less government, less state ownership and more control of goods in the hands of the public. You trust that your fellow man will use part of those goods to benefit society. If you have a less trusting view of your fellow man you are likely to the left somewhere. You prefer the government to be larger and have more control of goods in order for those goods to be redistributed by the government to benefit society. </p>
<p>The weakness of the right side is that it is very difficult to coordinate capital undertakings without a central authority to organise and adjudicate. The weakness of the left is that a portion of the goods that are to be used to benefit society are lost through the government's administration of those goods before they can be used for society's needs.</p>
<p>Side note: U.S. politics is a little different because the right side of the political spectrum has a large bloc of religious voters. Meaning that the right in the U.S. paradoxically calls for more government in many cases because their social agenda requires a government that is able to control behavioural choice even though they want a smaller government that cannot control financial choice. The opposite is also true, in that the left wants less government control over behavioural choices and more control over financial choices This is an example of why the simple left/right model of politics should only be used to make general points.</p>
<p>There are varying shades of communism and capitalism but that is my general take on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every one of these answers is terrible, so let's define some terms and a bit about how economic systems work.</p>
<p>What the West has historically used is referred to as social democracy, meaning relatively high taxation on corporate profits in order to redistribute value to provide social services like healthcare, education, social security, etc. within a capitalist economy.</p>
<p>A capitalist economy is one with private ownership (a single owner or board of directors) of the means of production (factory building, equipment, raw materials), exchange of goods and services for profit in a market economy, and wage labor. Think of it in terms of employers and employees. No matter the value of the things produced by the employees, the employer can pay the workers as little as they like and keep the difference for themselves.</p>
<p>Socialism is worker control of the means of production, including what to produce, how to produce, where to produce, and democratically deciding how profits are distributed rather than by wages. Having set wages would mean that the employer (capitalist) takes the rest as profit, so socialism wants to remove the class divide between people who own and people who do the work (current employees). So wealth is distributed based on labor from the start, preventing a need for redistribution. Communism is an economic stage even beyond that and is stateless (but not government-less), classless, and moneyless.</p>
<p>These are very rough definitions, but I hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Communism is a worldwide stateless society where money and markets have been abolished and production is collectively planned by all. It is the abolition of all exploitation and oppression, where the segmentation of human beings into classes, nationalities, races and genders has been transcended. Rather than mere worker ownership of factories or state-control of resources, communist society is one within which “value” as we know it has been abolished and social planning of the production of goods has replaced markets and rationing. Also abolished is the mental/manual division of labor, where permanent attachment to menial work-task specialization is replaced by a great reduction of the social working day and fluidity between different forms of socially necessary labor.    </p>
<p>Notable Communist authors include: Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, Gilles Dauve, Antoine Pannekoek, and Amadeo Bordiga.</p>
<p>-----Basic Outline-----</p>
<p>All Communists, regardless of tendency, aim for the same end goal: A Stateless, classesless, currencyless society where the means of producing goods are socially owned and the production of said goods are socially planned.
A state as defined by Marxian analysis: An organ of class rule where one class imposes it's will over another through the use of force.
The Means of Production(MoP) are the resources, tools, and equipment required to produce a good or service. Examples include a large swath of farm land that must be tended by multiple individuals, a piece of machinery in a factory who's only purpose is to take resources and turn it into a good, etc. We aim to allow all laborers in society the access to these resources on the basis of a new mode of production aimed at producing goods(supply) based on the needs of society(demand), as opposed to the accumulation of capital and profit. We aim to do this by maximizing socially valuable labor, while abolishing wages, commodity production, and the need for abstract labor.</p>
<p>-----Tendencies-----</p>
<p>What follows is a list of major communist ideologies, and a basic descriptor. For descriptions of specific terms, see TERMS</p>
<p>Reformist Socialism(Utopian Socialism) – A method of achieving Socialism through the use of democratic elections, as opposed to revolutionary means.</p>
<p>Marxism – A method of political and social analysis which utilizes a materialist view of history and a dialectical view of social transformation, it follows the works of Marx and Engels and a few other Post-Marxist writers on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>Left Communism - A reaction to Bolshevism and Social Democracy, and the ideology of “Leninism”. There are two main currents of “Left Communism” stemming from the third international: “Council Communists” who criticized the elitist practices of the Bolshevik Party, and increasingly emphasized the autonomous organizations of the working class . And Italian left communists who reject compromise with the institutions of bourgeois society, participation (or the idea of taking over the trade unions), the dictatorship over the proletariat, against various fronts with bourgeois parties and both are against national-liberation struggles and all forms of nationalism, the bolshevisation of the third international parties and eventually they both agree on the state-capitalist and counter-revolutionary nature of the Russian state by about the early 1920s.</p>
<p>Leninism – Leninism is the theory of party, class, and state developed by the Bolsheviks and implored by the Bolshevik government that a workers' state is composed of officials from the working class holding power inside the party and thus representing the control of the working class over the the state apparatus.
Marxist-Leninist-Maoism - An ideology following the works of Mao Zedong, applying Mao's third world revolutionary theory onto Lenin's political and Marx's economic theories. Promotes concepts such as The Mass Line, Protracted People's War, and the concept of a “New Democracy”.</p>
<p>Trotskyism- An ideology following the works of Leon Trotsky, which revised and expanded Lenin's writings and contributions to Orthodox Marxism. Includes concepts such as Permanent Revolution, the transitional program, and a rejection of Stalinist interpretations of Lenin's work.</p>
<p>-----Points Of Unity-----</p>
<ol>
<li>Communism can only be achieved through the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat, a class whose self-emancipation is the emancipation of all humanity. The proletariat are those without reserves who must sell their labor power to survive, compelled by these conditions to engage in the economic and political battle against capitalism. There is no other “revolutionary subject” that can lead the struggle for communism nor any kind of substitute for the class struggle. In order to triumph in the class struggle the proletariat must organize into a world-wide political party around a programme that expresses its exclusive class interests. Cops and strike-breakers are not part of the proletariat and are class enemies in all circumstances.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We are internationalists. We oppose all forms of imperialism and refuse to side with our own nation-states in worldwide conflicts. In situations of imperialist war the only sensible position to take is revolutionary defeatism: to pursue transforming imperialist war into a revolutionary civil war against world capitalism. We also reject all forms of nationalism as an obstacle to revolution and reject political alliances with nationalists of all stripes. It is unprincipled to maintain anything other than strict organizational independence in relation to those who uphold the nation-state as a positive political force, whether it be those espousing patriotism for our own countries or “national self-determination” for oppressed groups. This includes rejecting “socialism in one country” or any other national road to socialism. Communist revolution must be international in scope or nothing. In logical continuity with our internationalist principles is also our conviction in the importance of upholding a pro-immigrant stance. This means support for the abolition of borders and maintaining an uncompromising position against all forms of xenophobia and national chauvinism. Anything less would mean departure from the basic ethic of working class solidarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We categorically reject that the USSR and its various offshoots such as the People’s Republic of China and Cuba are examples of socialist societies or functioning proletarian dictatorships which serve as models for us to use. While no functioning communist society has existed, we point to the Paris Commune, the early days of the Russian Revolution, the German revolution, the Shanghai Commune and aspects of the Spanish Civil War as historical moments where the working class grappled with the task of forming a new society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We deny political support for all bourgeois parties, including those belonging to the left-wing of capital. Throughout history various factions of the left have served not to advance the class struggle towards communism but to stifle it. This entails recognizing that our enemies aren’t limited to outright reactionaries but also those who defend capitalism under a veneer of anti-bourgeois radicalism. Strategies of Popular Frontism or “mass line” politics can only open the door to opportunism. While strategic work with the rank-and-file of certain organizations may be necessary and beneficial, actual political alliances with reformist or reactionary groups can only mean sacrificing our political independence.</p>
</li>
<li>While we do not discourage workers from joining unions to defend their basic economic needs, we recognize that the class struggle must extend beyond the limitations of unionism. Unions are organs of mediation between workers and capital and are thereby structurally compelled to develop bureaucratic and conservative tendencies that will push against revolutionary class struggle. Repeatedly throughout history, the union bureaucracy has proven itself to be a conservative force that stifles the development of the workers’ struggle and act as a roadblock in the fight for communism. Therefore we reject a strategy of union entryism that seeks to recuperate the existing unions and employ them towards revolutionary ends, instead advancing the autonomy of the working class from capital and the existing union bureaucracy.</li>
</ol>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By communism I am going to presume that you are referring broadly to Maoism, Marxist-Leninism, and similar communist ideologies which took root during the 20th century and have since largely died out. Also, I am going to refer to &quot;capitalism&quot; here in the broadest sense of the term (a market economy). </p>
<p>There are two aspects to this answer: political and economic. I suspect your question is directed more towards the economic side, so here you go:</p>
<p>Communism rejects the concept of private property and profit making. Essentially, nobody is allowed to make a profit and everything (factories, etc) belongs to the government. If you have a great business idea in a capitalist democracy, you can start a business and try to use that idea to make yourself wealthy. This is not allowed in communist societies. There is also no competition because there are no privately owned businesses competing against one another- everything is the government. The net effect is that there is no innovation because there is no profit incentive to innovate. There is no incentive for people under communism to make things more efficient, to develop new ideas, to create better products. Every form of capitalism (even the forms which some call &quot;socialist&quot; nowadays) is based on profit incentives. People develop ideas like Uber, make computers less expensive, or invent Netflix because they stand to make a lot of money if their ideas are successful. Everyone wants to raise their quality of life so the prospect of making money leads people to develop new or better products and services. Communism completely removes this and assumes that government bureaus can do this just as well as free citizens in a free economy. Also, when business ideas succeed in a capitalist system, this means more people are hired by those businesses, which means more money for those workers, who then have money to buy more goods and services, which makes other businesses grow...essentially, everyone benefits. Again, communism rejects this by insisting that profit is evil and the government knows best how to provide goods and services. This is why the Soviet Union collapsed...the whole country was basically an American DMV. Everything was slow, shitty, and in short supply because there was no incentive for anyone to make it any better. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
