		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there're three types of nerve fibres that're important to the pain perception process (called nociception):</p>
<p>A-delta fibres are responsible for transmitting sharp intense pain quickly to the brain. </p>
<p>C fibres are responsible for the dull, slow ache that comes after an injury. Dysfunction of these fibres has been linked to various pain conditions. </p>
<p>A-beta fibres sense light touch and vibration. It's these fibres that are responsible for the effect you're describing. In the spinal cord, all of the various pain fibres synapse before being sent to the brain. But there are also inhibitory interneurons between fibres. The beta fibres activate the inhibitory interneurons and prevent pain signals (on C fibres in particular) from being sent to the brain. This means that although receptors in the injured area are still firing, less of that information is reaching your brain, and thus the pain is perceived to be less. </p>
<p>So when you grab or rub a sore spot, you activate these beta fibres (responsible for light touch and vibration sensation) which in turn activate those inhibitory interneurons and thus your perception of pain is lessened. </p>
<p>There are cool machines called TENS machines which exploit this system to reduce pain - they activate those beta fibres. </p>
<p>Source: Medical student (UK) about to enter 3rd year, did an elective module on the management of pain. </p>
<p>A good resource on how TENS machines work: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4589923/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4589923/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look up the gate control theory of pain. Activating other modalities of sensation can dampen the activation of pain fibres at the spinal roots involved through inhibitory nerve fibres. I'm sure someone else will come along with a more elegant answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have what are essentially gateways for the signals being received by your brain. This is how some pain pills work, they block the receptors. So when you're in pain, if you provide an alternate stimulation at the same spot, such as rubbing the skin around the area, or applying pressure and engaging the surrounding tissue with that sensation, then you've created a competing signal. Since you can only process so many signals from an area at one time, you've basically stopped some of the pain signal from being received. Unfortunately I don't remember all the terminology, as I learned this in Psych of health a few years ago, but that's the general idea.</p>
<p>Edit: /u/premium_rusks stated some of the correct terms and outlined the brief explanation.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Automatic&quot; responses are hard to nail down as to &quot;why&quot; we do something. Often the best we can hope for is finding what might a benefit for a behaviour and assuming it was reinforced.</p>
<p>A bunch below have noted benefits of applying pressure. </p>
<p>Also cool is why we lick wounds (as do other animals). I can't find a link but there have been studies showing the benefits of saliva in fighting infection. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
