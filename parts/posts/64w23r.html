In one episode he tries a 5 dollar kernel of popcorn covered in &quot;edible gold&quot;, what makes this gold edible and the gold you normally see inedible? </p></div></div>

<p>Metal leaf (called varak when used on food) is commonly used to <a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NaUfUAAguXk/V5NQp2ZM4WI/AAAAAAAAEsk/7BpD749v8LQH2K0DAxZTbw3gLdAZ-5p5gCLcB/s640/hy09waraq_G6Q5CTU9_1171148g.jpg" target="_blank">garnish sweets</a> in South Asia (with silver being more common than gold). The amount used is very miniscule, and so it doesn't really affect the taste or texture of whatever is being consumed. The purpose is to decorate the food only.</p>
<p>Sidenote: I've eaten sweets covered in silver / gold leaf before. It isn't actually that expensive because how little metal is actually present in the sheet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no difference. You could swallow a gold ring and you'd be fine; it would pass straight through your digestive system. Gold is inert and won't be affected by digestion. </p>
<p>The gold used on food is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_leaf" target="_blank">gold leaf</a>. It's just regular gold beat into <em>extremely</em> thin sheets - around 400 atoms thick. </p>
<p>It really isn't expensive either. You could cover a cake in gold leaf with a few dollars worth. The gold is so thin that it takes a tiny amount to cover a large surface. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are the same. The key aspect when a metal is consumed is if it is biologically active in that form. If you ate a steel ball bearing you will crap out a corroded steel ball bearing in a day or so and the iron content of you body will not shift significantly. If you ate the equivalent amount of iron sulfate it will have an effect on your body namely it will cause constipation in high amounts as much more of it is absorbed. This is why people with anemia don't just swallow lumps of iron. In the case of gold this is even more true as the gold will not be corroded by you stomach acid so none of it absorbed at all. The metals that cause problems when consumed e.g. thallium and lead tend to be be in a bioactive form when they are ingested or become bioactive readily on exposure to stomach acid etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's thinner and purer than the majority of jewelry gold.  Gold leaf is usually 22k gold, about 91% pure.  Most gold jewelry is 14k gold, about 58% pure.  This is because purer gold is very soft, so jewelry made out of it scratches and is otherwise damaged more easily.  If you swallowed a gold ring of average size it might be uncomfortable going through your system as it would maintain it's shape as it's designed to, though it would probably pass without harm (unless you had some type of digestive problem that could be exacerbated by a solid, indigestible object).  Gold leaf on the other hand is quite thin and made of purer gold since it's not designed to be very difficult to shape.  Due to this it is extremely unlikely to get caught anywhere in your digestive system or be felt on the way out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edible gold is exactly the same as regular gold, except that it's generally been reduced to powder or foil so you don't hurt a tooth on it or choke on it.  But you could swallow a (small) ring if you wanted to and be unharmed. </p>
<p>Gold is biologically inert (which is why they used it for teeth in the first place) and simply passes through the body without interacting with it chemically.  </p>
