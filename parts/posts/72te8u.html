<p>EDIT: It's a joint LIGO and VIRGO detection! This adds even more credibility to these detections. The paper is public <a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/P170814/public" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strain amplitude of 5 times 10^-22</li>
<li>30.5 plus 25.5 solar masses merger into a 53.2 solar mass black hole</li>
<li>540 megaparsec distance (redshift z=0.11)</li>
<li>Reduction in sky localization from 1160 square degrees to just 60 square degrees!</li>
<li>Final black hole spin of 0.7</li>
</ul></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a very quick summary of the new science reported today, and what it means for the future of gravitational wave astronomy. </p>
<p>This event, <a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/P170814/public" target="_blank">GW170814</a> is similar to the three events seen before. The black hole masses are in the 20-30 solar mass range. </p>
<p>The remarkable thing today is that this event was seen with 3 detectors. Past events had all been seen with just the two LIGO detectors, in Livingston, LA and Hanford, WA. This event was <em>also</em> seen by the European VIRGO detector. </p>
<p>So why is this important? First, it allows you to make measurements of gravitational wave polarization. Just like light, gravitational waves can be polarized. The detectors are slightly tilted with respect to each other, allowing us to resolve 'more' of the signal, essentially. </p>
<p>Additionally, the three detectors allow us to localize the event far better than before. This means we know what direction in the sky it happened. For past detections, events were <a href="http://www.ligo.org/images/faq-localization-comparison.jpg" target="_blank">localized to a ring</a>. We get this by knowing that gravitatoinal waves move at the speed of light, so if the signal arrives slightly earlier at one detector, we can localize it to a ring in space. With three detectors/detections, you can do proper triangulation. This has made the localization 20x more accurate (<a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P170814/public/main" target="_blank">see Fig 3</a>). See <a href="https://twitter.com/twitter/statuses/913090863164645376" target="_blank">a comparison of the localization of all 4 events here.</a></p>
<p>Improvements in localization will be necessary for studying new gravitational wave sources, such as neutron star mergers. Gravitational wave detectors are passive. They just sit and wait, and will detect any event that's loud enough, no matter the direction. That's fine for black hole mergers, because they're 'dark' events so you don't expect a big explosion to accompany it. In contrast, a neutron star merger would produce a wealth of electromagnetic signals. If LIGO observes a neutron star merger, and then can localize it well, it becomes possible to do electromagnetic followup observations quickly, giving us more detailed information about how the merger occurs and evolves.  </p>

<p>I asked this question in r/astronomy but I figure here it is more appropriate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
