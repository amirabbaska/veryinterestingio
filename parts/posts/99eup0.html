		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can imagine that many labs are working to culture and understand this microbe, but it takes time to turn something like this into a technology, especially given the incentive limitations mentioned by others here. We analyzed the paper you're referencing in our lab group and came to the conclusion that, at present, it's unlikely that you could do anything commercially viable with this bug. I mean, even if you could get it to eat all of the plastic in the oceans (for example) in a reasonable timeframe (you can't, because it grows really slowly), what you'd effectively be doing is releasing a bunch of CO2 that's currently locked away into the atmosphere. Would you rather have that carbon as plastic in the ocean, or as a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere?</p>
<p>The power of this paper is actually in the idea that bugs that eat plastics are possible, not that this specific bug exists. Ultimately, if you could engineer a strain to eat plastic snd transform it into some other consumer good, that'd be great. This bug gives us a model to imagine how we might do that in the future. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With the exception of plastics like PTFE (and other fluorinated plastics) and PVC (and other chlorinated plastics) it's actually much much better to pyrolyse all of it and use the pyrolytic products as fuel, and either bury the left over ashes or mix them into concrete. Biodegradation is really slow and you only get CO2 as a byproduct, so it's pretty much worthless for managing plastic waste, which can be quite valuable. For example, the ABS in the parts of your inkjet printer can be ground down, pelletized, extruded into filament and made into rocket fuel grains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's probably already been mentioned but there are bacteria that also degrade polyethylene too. I also think there may be a fungus that does something similar too? But anyway this poses other problems like plastic no longer being a sterile environment  and the degradation only occurring on easy to recycle plastics </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an active field of research. I work on a bacterium that degrades plastics and other complex polymer structures. It's a pretty complex situation, because they aren't easy to grow, and their biochemistry is very different since the food source isn't simple, or simply broken down. They need a very large pile of enzymes to deal with the many many different chemical linkages they encounter.  Cool stuff though.</p>
<p>For the record, it's a very long way between discover of a function in a bacterium to using it in a large scale. Usually decades.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is nuts that we have oil because nothing could eat trees for a ton of years, and now we're impatient for something to eat things we embraced explicitly because they didn't &quot;rot.&quot;</p>
<p>That said, even the polyurethane eaters don't make much of a dent, and a biosomething scientist friend I asked just texted me back with, &quot;you don't have to breed solvents.&quot; and that made sense to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
