Some music makes me just completely stop what I'm doing and listen, and music can change my mood in seconds. However, my friend doesn't enjoy listening to any genre of music. She doesn't mind it if its playing somewhere, but she is indifferent to listening to it, and despite listening to many songs me and my friends have recommended, she says she doesn't feel any emotions from it. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human brain is infinite in its variation. Some people respond most emotionally to their auditory senses (like music), some to their visual senses (like art), some to olfactory senses (smell), some to written language (reading), some to kinesthetics (body movement). And this is mediated through their life experiences which may push them closer or further to interest in one particular area. </p>
<p>Have you cried, or felt a chill, at a short story or painting ever? Why/why not? Have you ever become emotional because of a smell? Why/why not? Perhaps your friend has an emotional connection with another aspect of their senses that means nothing to you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people find music to be nothing but upsetting. It sounds roughly the same as industrial noise to them. If your friend was like that, she'd have to forbid music being played in her presence, or stop hanging around with you.</p>
<p>Personally, I am a terrible conversationalist and so I like to have music playing when socializing. This way if the convo lulls, I can start talking about the song that is playing, since I know a lot of music trivia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have an answer to your question, but if this is a subject you'd be interested to learn more about, I highly recommend Oliver Sacks' book, Musicophillia. It's all about the study of music and the mind, and it's a fascinating read. Definitely worth picking up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason is that there is a thing associated with how we learn called &quot;long term potentiation,&quot; which basically means that when two things happen at the same time, like a sound and an emotion, for example, they become associated, so one can trigger the other. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, there was a famous experiment where babies were exposed to a loud noise, which scared them, and bunnies, and for much of their lives were afraid of bunnies, because they associated the visual stimulus (bunnies) with the scary thing (a loud sound).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So say you're an angsty teenage and you're feeling all angsty, and also listening to a particular album a lot. Your brain is going to associate those two things - that specific music and that specific emotion - for a long period of time afterwards. So a decade later, that music still evokes an extremely strong emotion. Because in your brain, the two things are tied together - one triggers the other.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This also explains why these responses are hyper-specific to each person. It requires a specific set of conditions - repeated exposure to the song at the same time as experiencing a specific emotion. That's not something someone else is going to have, so having them listen to the same song won't get the same response. In your case, you listen to music all the time, so this has probably happened for lots of songs, albums, even genres - that's why it can change your mood in seconds. But none of that would happen for someone who just doesn't listen to music. The associations aren't there. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fun fact: you can use this as a hack to learn something effectively, like if you're studying for an exam. Listen to the same playlist or record while studying, then get it stuck in your head for the test. &quot;Hearing&quot; the music in your head will trigger memories of the material that you studied while that music was playing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
