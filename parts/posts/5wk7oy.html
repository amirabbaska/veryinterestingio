		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the word is cute and they are cute.  <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/58247/how-did-bunny-become-cutesy-word-rabbit" target="_blank">Actually, “bunny” is closer to the original word for the floppy-eared critters than “rabbit” is. Up until the 18th century, the common word used for adult members of Oryctolagus cuniculus was “coney,” which was pronounced “cunny.” Eventually, that word fell out of favor because of its similarity to a word that was becoming increasingly more commonly used as a vulgarity. So timid souls along the way chose a rhyming alternative, and “coney” became “bunny.”</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Bunny&quot; comes from Scottish dialect and is of uncertain origin. It's pretty common in English that multiple terms will come from different sources, with none being exclusive.</p>
<p>Incidentally, &quot;rabbit&quot; originally referred only the young, the species in general being called <em>coney</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Genetically they're not a cat/bunny cross breed, but there's a lot of hilarity surrounding the mythos of the cabbit.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
