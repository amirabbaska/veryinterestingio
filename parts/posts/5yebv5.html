		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The conscious brain is story telling machine. It likes to have things form a nice linear storyline. </p>
<p>But sometimes we don't get all the information, weather it's missing, obscured or forgotten. So it'll have a play around to make things fit, filling in gaps and adjusting bits that don't fit the narrative. </p>
<p>We need this to keep ourselves sane and see order in the world. </p>
<p>So the brain is good at making shit up and it'll practice at night and in daydreams. </p>
<p>(it can also fuck up sometimes. We get 'deja vu' when the brain fucks up the order of events in the memory creation and interpretation process. Your brain takes in new information but processes it like it's an old memory. You 'feel' like it's happened before because your brain momentarily said it did, and you are your brain, so you thought it did.)  </p>
<p>Edit: I'm no neurologists, this is all second hand interest stuff. Im happy to be corrected as I'm sure ive fucked up somewhere</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's actually basically exactly how our memory works.  We recreate events in our minds rather than &quot;remember them&quot;.  We add, subtract, confabulate (my favorite new word).  Our brain has building blocks that we construct our memories out of, and frequently they're pretty close to what happened.  But, we can use those same building blocks and combine them in new ways.  We can do it on purpose, and we constantly do it on accident (it's why our memories are so shitty for specific details).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because humans have become such an advanced species due to our ability to look at the current situation and imagine what comes next -- anything from a checkers game with limited possible results to a &quot;if I jump off this rock and slide down that hill, will I be OK?&quot;   </p>
<p>Our brains are wired for imagining things in great detail, because that's how we protect ourselves from potential failure doing everything by trial-and-error.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read a really great book called the Storytelling Animal that hypothesized that humans developed daydreaming and other storytelling activities like playing (makebelieve when you're a kid), dreaming, and oral traditions as a evolutionary mechanism. The author said we developed this habit for linear narrative arcs to practice and teach our offspring lessons we learned in our past in a way that is easily graspable and then subsequently practicable through forms of play. That's why a lot of our stories tend to have a moral or message at the end that is either blatantly stated or gleaned from context and critical thought. It's a great book if you're interested in the anthropological side of storytelling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
