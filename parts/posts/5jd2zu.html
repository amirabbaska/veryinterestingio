			<a href="/posts/5jd2zu" onclick="return false">I often hear about psychological experiments in the past, such as Milligrams, Stanford Prison that could not be done or even replicated today because of informed consent rules. Although obviously informed consent rules are more humane, do they harm psychology as a science?</a>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, without human subjects neuroscience and psychology will definitely be slowed in their progress. However the potential consequences to the participant can be so great in some instances that the harm done would ethically outweigh the gains made.</p>
<p>I'm a neuroscientist and my research is with the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation for neuromodulation on frontal and temporal lobe circuits in human subjects. Every time we find an affect that is considered &quot;adverse&quot; we then have to warn future participant about it and this definitely changes the willingness to participate in further research. That being said, I think most people are inherently concerned when they believe that an experiment could fundamentally change who they are. </p>
<p>As an example of something unexpected and crazy in my lab, we abolished the ability to produce fluent speech for 3 hours with a train of inhibitory stimulation designed to create a sustained virtual lesion in the frontal cortex. This was done to a participant and needless to say they were highly concerned afterwards and we had to change our protocol to avoid this outcome in the future. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There seems to be some confusion here regarding the reasons Milgram's experiment and the Stanford Prison experiment cannot be fully replicated - they cannot be replicated because of ethical considerations, not because of informed consent. As an example of this, we can look at Burger (2009) who partially replicated Milgram's experiment by modifying several variables and ensuring that the study was complaint with current rules regarding ethical treatment of human subjects and informed consent. And in the case of the Stanford Prison experiment, we can look at the BBC Prison Study (2006) that partially replicated the Stanford Prison experiment (though there are methodological issues with the BBC's replication).  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the larger question, the rules surrounding working with human subjects most certainly limit what scientists of all fields can learn and how quickly they can gather useful data. The scientific community at large has decided, however, that the ethical treatment of human subjects is more important than the knowledge we would gain from being able to use unwilling or uninformed study participants.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US at least, deception in research is still allowable in some cases. The researcher has to convince the ethics board that the research couldn't be done without the deception (usually because full disclosure would bias the results), that the risk of the research to the subjects is minimal (which has a regulatory definition), and that the researcher discloses the deception to the subject afterwards. </p>
<p>I think most ethics boards would assert that the original Milgram study, which led subjects to believe they had caused grave physical harm to others, presented more than minimal psychological risk to subjects and so could not be done under today's regulations. So yes, informed consent regulations do constrain science to an extent.</p>
<p>I'm not sure that consent was the problem in the prison experiment. I think the bigger problem was the failure to forsee the mess that would become of it, and Zimbardo's failure to stop the study as soon as it got out of control.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was on my institution's IRB for 8 years, and we oversaw all the psych study applications. This is a complex question.</p>
<p>First, one of the reasons for informed consent is that research as a whole depends on people trusting researchers to perform ethical research that should advance our knowledge of the world around us and not put them at risk. While you may be able to do one study that generates new information unethically or without informed consent, your ability to perform subsequent studies will be greatly hampered because you've lost that trust. A great example is the Tuskegee experiment, where African-American soldiers were infected with syphilis without their knowledge and left untreated to find out how syphilis works when untreated. This made it very difficult to this day to do research in African-American communities because that trust was shattered, and science as a whole suffered because of it. For this reason alone we don't do these things anymore.</p>
<p>Second, you can have deceptive informed consents, which is done quite frequently in psych experiments. These need to be constructed carefully to still describe what's being done, and typically you tell the subject after the experiment what the true study was. The benefit must also outweigh the harm, so something like the prison or your ICBM one likely wouldn't pass muster unless we REALLY needed to know what people did in that situation, simple scientific curiosity isn't sufficient. </p>
<p>Lastly, think about how you would like to be treated if you signed up for a research study. Would you like to be deceived, put in harm's way, or otherwise mistreated? Probably not, so don't ask someone else to volunteer for scientific research that you yourself would be unwilling to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we ignored the ethics of informed consent, we might have short term gains in knowledge, but would ultimately lose out. The public would very quickly lose faith in the process as a whole, and be unwilling to subject themselves to it. At that point, the only way to find subjects would be using full force. Using full force would create psychological conditions which would make the results even more unreliable and difficult to interpret than they are with informed consent rules in place.</p>
<p>So no. It would not help us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
