			<a href="/posts/5jd2zu" onclick="return false">I often hear about psychological experiments in the past, such as Milligrams, Stanford Prison that could not be done or even replicated today because of informed consent rules. Although obviously informed consent rules are more humane, do they harm psychology as a science?</a>

I discussed this with a psychologist friend who insisted that this is somehow compensated for, but I am skeptical and think perhaps he drank the kool-aid.  How do you test whether or not ICBM crews are going to actually launch without actually putting them in that position?</p></div></div>
