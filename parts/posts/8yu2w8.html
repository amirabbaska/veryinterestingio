They love that shit.
Hell, I love that shit. Give me those melon chips. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Culture.</p>
<p>The basic of it is they have seasonal flavors (extra only out at certain times like sakura) and  special flavors. Culturally it's a thing in Japan, expected. So companies always try to come up with temporary new special flavors.</p>
<p>The all the time flavors aren't always more than, say, the us but they stand out. We might not think of the fifty chocolate variations as different but we do notice variations on something unusual. </p>
<p>Most importantly is that people try them. Plus, producing a limited run for Japan would be different from a limited run in the US. Even just distribution wise. Though chips in the US are doing it a lot more, so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A LOT of these flavours are actually the same as other specialty flavours and are available in other countries as well, people just don't notice thanks to package design, food colouring, and marketing. For example, different teriyaki flavoured products are the same as the onion flavours in the US, sakura flavours taste EXACTLY like strawberry instant oatmeal, and anything melon flavoured is the same as anything blue-hawaiian flavoured— one just uses green food colouring and the other uses blue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They <em>sound</em> cool, but that's about it. I've heard people get buyers remorse over things like houses and cars and shit but I've only ever had it over the occasional 200 yen bag of chips when I was feeling frisky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But if you dig a little deeper you'll also find all of the weird flavours too. Things like seawater flavoured icecream, I mean why?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
