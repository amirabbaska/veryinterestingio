		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read that it's pretty rare to completely black out from drinking, but I do about 50% of the time, even from one or two drinks. I know people who have never blacked out and some who occasionally black out but only from severely heavy drinking. What is happening in one's brain when one blacks out? Is there any definitive research into why some do and some don't?</p>
<p>(I am not talking about &quot;browning out&quot; where details are lost and memories are fuzzy.)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I experimented with this after suffering blackouts on a regular basis over about a few months. I read that it was down to the blood alcohol level and at a certain point it interfered with long term memory. So I set out by restricting my calorie intake each Friday before going to the pub and drank 6 pints of budvar over approx 3 hours. </p>
<p>I restricted calories by skipping meals. Breakfast, lunch or dinner </p>
<p>3 meals in sequence = drunk no blackout </p>
<p>Breakfast and lunch = pretty hammered, no blackout</p>
<p>Breakfast = brown outs with a lingering memory of arguing at the Indian takeaway for a smoked sausage</p>
<p>Breakfast and dinner &amp; lunch and dinner = brown outs with little to report.</p>
<p>No meals = ruined. I apparently peed in the cupboard and argued with my own reflection in a mirror before taking the mirror off the wall and placing it in the bath.</p>
<p>Shortening the drinking time from 3 to 2 hours had a huge impact, pretty much without 3 meals i was blacking out. </p>
<p>I also repeated this in different establishments and dark indoor pubs seemed to have a impact, although not enough that I could make any conclusions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We sort of know: alcohol makes neurons in the hippocampus stop talking to each other properly, which prevents the formation (encoding) of longer-term memory, which means that by the next morning, you don't remember what happened the previous night. </p>
<p>Rapidly increasing BAC (like binge-drinking) seems to cause more memory problems. Some people are simply more susceptible to alcohol-related memory impairment than others, and no one is entirely sure why that is.</p>
<p>Be careful with black out-level drinking. Short-term, it can put you in dangerous situations. Long-term, it may not be very good for your brain's health.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

My liver enzymes are perfectly stable (I have to get them tested regularly), but I just don't process toxins as fast as most people. Basically, I get fucked up faster and stay that way longer.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems like every time I go out with my SO (not often) I completely black out by the end of the night. He says he can't tell and that I act perfectly normal. But I can never remember leaving the bar or getting home. No hang overs or vomiting either. (No I'm not being drugged.) its very strange tho... </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>most of the explanations on here make total sense, although there's one thing I didn't see touched on that was part of my experience, that I've always wondered about.
for many years I drank as naturally as I breathed,  and I was able to ingest and sustain, what seems now to be a heinous amount of hard liquor or beer for a 19/20yr female of my size, (5'4&quot; and probably around 100lbs at the time,  if that) and for a good while i never blacked out,  like.. ever. not once! and I had a bad diet,  bad sleeping habits,  you name it.  but there was a certain night when it distinctly changed,  I got into, what was then,  the worse  fight I had ever been in, with my (then) SO. yelling at each other outside a gas station,  screaming after one another down a quiet neighborhood street at some horribly rude hour of the night,  definately post-midnight, bawling in someone's front yard,  strangers coming up and saying if things didn't lighten up they would get the police involved,  the whole nine yards, extremely dramatic bullshit,  totally unnecessary, totally embarassing, but hey,  everyone has at least ONE night where they act a complete fool in their lives... right? lol.
aaaaanywho,  that night I blacked out for the first time and after that I started to black out it seemed like every time my emotions would get even a little frazzled,  it always felt like that night, had like... been some subconscious tipping point where my brain said never again!  so, before- I was able to hold it together but afterwards, even if I was in a perfectly fine mood,  celebrating even, not a dark cloud in the metaphorical sky,  it wouldn't matter, once i passed the tipsy stage and proceeded into drunkenness,  i became an emotional mess and would black out almost like clockwork, (hence beginning the official stages of a definite spiral into a dark alcoholism period)
bbbbbut I'm just wondering if that's common? to have a said,  &quot;tipping point&quot;, or if that's just a mental health commonality pertaining to depression ect ect</p>
<p>and also- the inability to form long term memories is a logically sound explanation for most blackouters, but I'm also curious to it pertaining to if your mixing, let's say MDMA with alcohol,  cuz it was my experience, that I wouldn't black out or get drunk when I was rolling,  us that just a side effect or the drug,  some suppression of alcohol receptors cuz their too busy wanting to dance? lol,  I've always wondered about that.  ah to be young again... lol </p>
<p>(thank you so much, in advance, for your explainations and opinions)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
