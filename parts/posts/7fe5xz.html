		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For example, if I eat 1000 calories of sugar:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many calories will be stored in fat (assuming none of the calories are used for exercise etc).</li>
<li>How many calories are available to perform work with (after the body has converted the sugar to ATP, etc). The assumption is that the conversion process from Sugar --&gt; X --&gt; ATP --&gt; ? is not 100% efficient.</li>
<li>How do the above numbers differ for different sources of energy. For example does eating 1000 cal of fat result in the same number of calories available for work as eating 1000 cal of sugar? </li>
</ul>
<p>Bonus question:</p>
<ul>
<li>How efficient is the body in converting the energy stored in fat to energy available for work (e.g. ATP)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I am not a biologist, from my understanding ATP is the last form of energy muscles use, albeit I could be wrong.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, as far as the processing, storage and other ‘taking in’ goes, you’re looking for the thermic effect of food. That is energy used to convert it from its raw state to one that’s ‘ready to burn’.</p>
<p>Carbs have a 5-15% thermic effect, depending on complexity. Very complex carbs take more energy to process than simple ones.</p>
<p>Fats have at most 5-15%, some sources claim well below 5%, and are seen as the most efficient.</p>
<p>Protein is much harder to digest and process, with a thermic effect of 20-35%, depending on complexity and blend.</p>
<p>So the conclusion here is that replacing fat or sugar calories with an equal amount of protein calories will reduce your net caloric intake after cost of processing. It isn’t a huge number but is meaningful over time - I ran some numbers for a long post a while ago, and it could be enough for a few pounds of weight gain or loss a year. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Atwater system is what we use for rough estimates for the available energy in food--metabolizable energy. The pure energy stored in food, the gross combustible energy, does not equal metabolizable energy 1:1 for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Food must be broken down into monomeric components to be directly absorbed (the majority of this absorption occurs in the duodenum, the first section of the small intestine)  and this breakdown process is reliant on enzymes. Enzyme action is in turn reliant on available substrate surface area and time.  Time for enzymatic action on the food you eat is controlled by gut motility. If you don't eat regularly your body will slow gut motility and this has the effect of increasing how much you absorb from your food. Anything that decreases gut motility will increase the metabolizable energy of food. </li>
</ol>
<p>Surface area is controlled by the physical properties  of the food itself, the mechanical mixing due to GI tract muscular contractions, and in the case of fat--bile salts that act to increase surface area of fat droplets by breaking them into much smaller droplets (micelles) that don't recondense in the aqueous chyme.  Insoluble fiber  plays a role in reducing available surface area for amylase (the enzyme that breaks starch down into simple sugars),  so high fiber foods have decreased metabolizable energy.  But we'll come back to fiber because it is tricky.</p>
<ol>
<li>Monomers (amino acids, monosaccharides, and fatty acids) must be absorbed by gut epithelial cells and transported to the portal venous system.  From there they go to the liver and then see systemic distribution from the liver. These transport systems require energy and some monomers required less energy than others to shuffle around. Some macronutrients yield less metabolizable energy than others due to higher energy investment for transport and uptake. Some people can't absorb certain monomers like fructose very efficiently.  Also, new research is showing evidence that stimulation of sweet taste receptors leads to increased absorption of nutrients in the SI, meaning that some foods like sugar and sugar substitutes may boost the metabolizable energy of others.</li>
</ol>
<p>Further, uptake of macronutrients by tissues is often the subject of regulation. People with severe peripheral insulin resistance see little to no metabolizable energy from glucose because it never enters those cells to be used.  Different tissue types have different macronutrient preferences and adjust absorption and subsequent catabolism accordingly. </p>
<ol>
<li>Macronutrients are catabolized in cells to power ATP generation. There are a number of different pathways and not all have the same ATP yields. The catabolic pathways that require oxygen occur in the mitochondria, which means that mitochondrial density and efficiency affect the metabolizable energy of food as well. People who are physically active have greater mitochondrial density in their skeletal  muscle fibers and there are studies showing that things like fasting increase mitochondrial efficiency--resulting in increased ATP generation.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know your question is more asking about bookeeping but unfortunately bookkeeping is a nightmare, is variable across the population and is even variable in one individual depending on their activity level and things like, weirdly--the bacteria in their colon. I mentioned fiber before and how it is tricky. The Atwater system's largest flaw is its accounting for fiber.</p>
<p>Fiber and whatever monomers manage to escape the small intestine end up in the large intestine, which is full of bacteria. Gut bacteria digest the remaining di and monosaccharides (if you're lactose intolerant, this is where the lactose is broken down) and secrete out short chain fatty acids which is another source of energy for us. Gut bacteria can also partially digest fiber, as well as certain oligosaccharides found in vegetables/fruit, and non-nutritive sweeteners like stevia (not aspartame, aspartame is essentially an amino acid pair that gets absorbed up in the SI). </p>
<p>Because the metabolizable energy is effectively second-hand, there isn't much by way of hard numbers but animal and human studies support the idea that gut bacteria play a big role in obesity and the theory behind this is that some people have more efficient gut bacteria than others, seeing increased metabolizable energy from food sources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said with respect to the thermic effects of food (which answers your third bullet), the proportion of calories eaten that are burned/used for various processes vs stored is in constant flux. Proportions would be based on tons of factors including things like circulating levels of hormones such as insulin (promotes storage I.e, anabolic) and glucagon (opposite effect I.e., catabolic). I don't think you could ever put exact numbers on it. However the body is VERY efficient at 'using' (either burning or storing) calories from food. Only a very small amount of the energy taken in is 'lost' in the form of heat, which helps us stay warm blooded. Look up mitochondrial uncoupling for more on that.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello friend, when consuming calories from any source (protein fat or carbs) the body will undergo specific pathways depending on your current state (fed fasting or starving)  these pathways convert the calorie sources you consume into several intermediates which can then be stored (glycogen, TAGs) or used immediately (glucose, ketone bodies, etc) to produce ATP. Eating pure sugar would generally be broken down to glucose and then stored as glycogen or used to generate ATP depending on your metabolic needs. The pathways that take place are sometimes very efficient (Krebs cycle) and sometimes can be less efficient like the Electron transport chain (where the most ATP  is produced) which will lose around 50 of a vital step (H+ gradient) as heat instead of generating ATP.  </p>
<p>Very simply put calories are calories since your body can convert or store carbs, protein, and lipids into interchangeable intermediates. That is a very basic and generalised explanation. Hope this helps, sorry for typos I'm on mobile!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's one way to do it:  Humans burn 100 watts in food energy - you get this by assuming 2200 kcal diet and convert to joules by multiplying by 4.19e3 J/kcal  and divide by seconds in a day.</p>
<p>A laborer can produce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_power" target="_blank">75 watts of work over an 8 hour shift</a>.  </p>
<p>So the 'useful work efficiency' of a human, treating them as a machine, is </p>
<p>Output/Input = (75 W x 8 hrs)/ (100 W  x 24 hrs) = 25%  </p>
<p>Surprisingly efficient, I'd say. About the same as an internal combustion engine.    It's probably a bit lower in reality, because this laborer is probably consuming more than 2200 kcal.  If you assume 3500 kcal/day, it becomes 14%.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
