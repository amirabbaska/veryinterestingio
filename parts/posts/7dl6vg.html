		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We’re much, much more aware of where those vortices are, and can adjust our position to avoid them. </p>
<p>Also, separation between aircraft is also for safety during abrupt, unexpected maneuvers, not just for vortices. I’m talking directly to the other aircraft in my flight so I’m aware of when abrupt turns will happen.. if I’m in front, I know the position of the other aircraft to be able to avoid turning in a way that endangers them.  Commercial aircraft don’t have a lot of direct communication with other aircraft without preplanning frequencies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aerodynamic factors of vortices can be avoided by flying in proper formation (either with step up or step down, depending on the situation (step up being vertical separation from cockpit to cockpit)). Military aircraft (including helicopters) fly tight formation to decently sized aircraft (C-130s, KC-10s, etc) all the time during in flight refueling and that's generally not too problematic (as long as it isn't too turbulent).</p>
<p>Legally, it's because the FAA requires something like... I think at least <del>1</del> 3 miles laterally and 1000 feet in altitude (I should know this) between each aircraft on an instrument clearance (which pretty much all commercial flights have). Military aircraft can declare MARSA which is &quot;Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft.&quot; This relieves ATC of the 1 mile/1000 feet separation requirement and so the military pilots are now flying formation off the lead aircraft.</p>
<p>Edit: After some google-fu, it looks like lateral separation is 3 miles in a terminal environment and 5 miles en route, with (generally) 1000 feet of vertical separation. Source: FAA order 7110.65, 4-5-1 and 5-5-4.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normal aircraft separation under Instrument Flight Rules is defined in FAA Order 7110.65. Either 1000 feet vertical or 3 miles lateral separation (more if dealing with Heavy aircraft and aircraft on final approach if different weight classes). You can have less than this if flying under Visual Flight Rules (see and avoid).  Military aircraft flying in formation use a rule called MARSA - Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft - in which they fly under one flight plan as essentially one aircraft for purposes of ATC. Military planes doing exercises in restricted airspace are flying under VFR, and are responsible for their own separation.</p>

<p>EDIT: pointed out by another user that MARSA is Military Authority Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft. I accidentally a word. Been out of the aviation industry for about 7 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
