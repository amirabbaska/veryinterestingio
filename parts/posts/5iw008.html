You're viewing them in 1920x1080 or higher, stretching the video onto an area several times bigger than intended.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You always compare things to what you're used to. Eventually the new incredible shiny thing becomes the new baseline.</p>
<p>I remember when I went from learning on a 286 with no hard disk to a 386 with one. That was amazing. </p>
<p>I remember when I went from 4 MB RAM to 16 MB. That was amazing too.</p>
<p>I remember getting on an airplane for the first time. It was an exciting experience. Now it's just boring.</p>
<p>I remember back when I used the internet at 56Kbps. Now at 100Mbps sometimes things are still too slow, despite it being a mind boggling 1700 times faster. Formerly downloading a DVD image would have meant taking up a phone line for more than a week of uninterrupted downloading -- it would have been more like a month in reality if I dedicated all the time I could for it, did nothing else with it, and my parents would have hated my guts for it. Today it's a coffee break, and I still get impatient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on your experience. It was the best you knew back then.</p>
<p>Since, you have seen better quality content and it has risen your standards, thus making old qualities seem lower.</p>
<p>Also, screens have better resolution and are bigger today, making more visible flaws that then were much more difficult to see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe because back then our standards for this kind of quality were much lower. Now that we have cameras the size of ants making 1080p60fps quality video, our standards have been set much higher. And maybe because the tapes are 10-20 years old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
