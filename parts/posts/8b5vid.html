		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a common misconception that deserts are pure sand. Only 1/4 of them are ergs or sand deserts. Most deserts are made of finer particles like silt and clay. At least on top. That answers your question partially as deserts are not pure sand mostly. Why we don't use sand in those other deserts that are, I don't know. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You need sand with a very high silica or quartz content, so some desert sand could very well be used to make glass. But you also need to add other ingredients such as borax, washing soda, or a few other things to help it melt. Typically sand is harvested from places near water for convenience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I'm not mistaken, beach sand is more silicon because quartz does not dissolve in water and beaches are exposed to water regularly. Dry deserts are not usually exposed to water though, so they could have sand made of a lot of other, lower in silicon compounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Desert sand has a lot of calcium in it, like for example White Sands of New Mexico which is almost purely gypsum. It was formed by blowing wind, since calcium is relatively lightweight. Calcium is not very abrasive so it tends to remain calcium based, its not much of a sandblaster medium. Ocean waves, in contrast to wind, has a lot more inertia, so it is ideal for blasting hard rock. Under that condition, calcium is broken into microscopic particles and ends up in the shells of ocean creatures. Apparently wave generated silica and quartz sand is reduced to a consistent size by some physical process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
