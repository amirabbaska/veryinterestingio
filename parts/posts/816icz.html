		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of farmers rent bees so they know their crops will get pollinated.  My neighbor runs a bee business.  Transports them south to work in the winter, brings them back north in the summer.<br />
My friend owns an orchard and they rent bees during flowering season.  It is a business and they make sure they have enough bees to do the job.<br />
In China there was a bee shortage and they pollinated by hand which resulted in a much higher yield (because bees are inefficient) but also a higher cost.
This article is from several years ago.  My understanding is that return of the bees and higher wages mean that they have gone back to natural pollination.  <a href="https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/5193-Decline-of-bees-forces-China-s-apple-farmers-to-pollinate-by-hand" target="_blank">https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/5193-Decline-of-bees-forces-China-s-apple-farmers-to-pollinate-by-hand</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is a case of an environmental issue being simplified for the general public to understand. </p>
<p>So first of all, what we have to know is that produce is almost always pollinated by theÂ  domesticated honey bee, which came from the European honey bee- Apis mellifera. Now these bees are one of 20,000 or so bee species, keep this in mind for a bit later.</p>
<p>At one point back around 2006, domesticated honey bee farmers were seeing something odd. They were seeing massive die offs in their hives, and hives collapsing. They called it Colony Collapse Disorder, or CCD.</p>
<p>Now we do have to keep in mind that some collapse is normal. Winter loss is especially large, due to the stress that winter causes. New colonies can be made by making/buying new queens and splitting colonies- I'm not a bee keeper, so I don't know the details here. </p>
<p>So the statistics out there are a little confusing, because there is annual loss rate and winter loss rate. Winter loss is when the most happens, as mentioned. It gets even more confusing, because I can't find data for annual loss percentages before 2010. I can only find winter loss rate. Oh, I'm taking about the US only.</p>
<p>So, winter loss rate in 2006-2007 was about 32%. An acceptable rate would be around 15%. This got higher in 2007-2008 at around 36%. This has gone down since then, but some years have been better than others. Winter loss in 2014-2015 was about 22% or so, but in 2015-2016 it was about 28%. Annual loss peaked 2012-2013 at around 45%. Last I heard, in 2016-2017 it was 33%.</p>
<p>Keep in mind not all of that is from Colony Collapse Disorder. Some are due to other things, like a queen dying, or other things. One of the key symptoms of CCD is that there is a live queen left. The other two are a capped brood and a food storage of honey and bee pollen. A capped brood just means that their are larvae and pupae in capped honeycomb cells. Usually the hive takes care of these, and won't leave until they have metamorphosised into adult bees. </p>
<p>Okay so now that all the stats are out of the way, why did this happen? That's a tough question. Environment issues are almost NEVER one thing, keep that in mind when you read stuff about the environment. So some people might have heard about parasites, pesticides, and diseases. Which one is right? Probably all of them. </p>
<p>Varroa mites not only weaken bees by sucking their hemolymph- basically invertebrate blood- but they also carry diseases, like deformed wing virus. That name means exactly what it says too- the bees come out of their pupae with tiny, malformed wings and can't fly. They also don't really eat if they are sick too, which leads to their death. There's also other parasites, like trachea mites, that might cause issues.</p>
<p>So where do pesticides come in? Well neonicotinoids were shown to stress bees in a lab setting. Stressed bees, and really animals including humans, are more susceptible to diseases and parasites. This is... Kinda controversial though, because some argue the lab concentrations were too high and bees in the field would never see those concentrations unless they were directly sprayed... </p>
<p>Another factor that may play a role is travel. So beekeepers travel with their bees to reach all sorts of crops. They move from almonds in California, to blueberries in Maine and everything in between. When the bees are in transit, they eat sugar syrup. It's thought that this syrup doesn't have the right nutrient balance for them, and may stress them too. </p>
<p>It's interesting to note that Australia did not see massive bee colony decline. They don't have Varroa mites, but they do have neonicotinoids. Just an interesting bit, I don't know enough about the relationship to say much more.</p>
<p>Anywho, varroa mites don't like high temperatures, and can be killed by raising the hive temperature to over 100 F, but the bees just continue to work. So, we're figuring out ways to solve this issue. Some researchers and organizations say bee populations are growing, though some others question that... The decline numbers are going down though!</p>
<p>BUT. What about those other bees? The 19,999 or so other species? Well, some of them are doing alright, others, not so much. I know the rusty spotted bumblebee, which exists near me, is Critically Endangered. </p>
<p>The main issue I've heard they face is habitat loss. Corn and wheat are wind pollinated, and soybeans are self pollinated, so bees don't really visit those flowers. Unfortunately, that means the fields we have of them take up area that could be food for bees, like wild flowers and trees. Neonicotinoids may also play a role in this. Varroa mites have also spread from honey bees to bumblebees, so... That might be an issue too.</p>
<p>So some species in Hawaii are also endangered, though island species have their own set of problems, like being susceptible to diseases, having a smaller, more sensitive habitat, and invasive species. I haven't followed their issues as much.</p>
<p>Fun facts, some flies and beetles look like bees! Woo Batesian mimicry!</p>
<p>Tl;Dr The domesticated honey bee is showing signs of recovering from Colony Collapse Disorder, but some wild bee species are seeing declines.</p>
<p>Oh if you want sources, just ask! I'm on mobile so it gets messy with links everywhere. I do think the stats source is important though, so here's that one!

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ironically I watched the film theory for bee movie that was made recently and learned something about bees.</p>
<p>We often think honeybees are the sole pollinators but there are many other species of bees, as well as beetles, moths, and butterflies can all act as pollinators.</p>
<p>In the video it's mentioned there are some studies talking about how the environment would be better without honeybees.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they're not collapsing.</p>
<p>The amount of bee commercial honey bee colonies in the US has increased from 2.3 million in 2008 to 2.8 million in 2016. So, pollination is fine.</p>
<p>That's not to say there aren't issues. Even with CCD receding, losses remain high. But because we're dealing with bees, and new colony can be created in less than a year, the number remains stable. This however results in greater costs for bee keepers. The cause of the losses is varied, ranging from parasites to pesticides to loss of good flowers.</p>
