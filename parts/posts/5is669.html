		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did a cursory search of the relation between the moon and earthquakes and found little to nothing, but I was wondering if the moon's rotation, if it is enough to cause tides is enough to affect plate tectonics or the core of the earth itself. It's molten after all, it must have some sort of fluid dynamics to it, right?</p>
<p>I was wondering why the ring of fire is where it is, and came to the conclusion that the shape of the pacific ocean seems conducive to an oceanic suction effect that might add stress to plate tectonics in a ring shape. I'm no physicist but I don't see why a substance covering most of the earth's surface can't affect the earth in much more substantial ways than rising and falling tides. </p>
<p>To follow up, would rising sea levels mean more/stronger earthquakes due to the greater stress exerted by water on plate boundaries?</p></div></div>
