		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Running a puppy mill, by itself, isn't illegal in any state.  </p>
<p>Most counties have regulations that require dogs to be licensed or which restrict the amount of dogs that can be in any given area.  But the penalty for violating those regulations is usually limited to a small fine.  </p>
<p>Additionally, proving that those regulations are being violated is difficult.  Under normal circumstances it requires that the neighbors call animal control out to the house <em>and</em> that the dogs are visible from the street.  Its really only when one of the dogs actually bites someone else that animal control is able to take action because at that point they can seize the dogs.</p>
<p>In order to criminalize puppy mills, states would have to criminalize allowing dogs to breed, which isn't something that is practical or enforceable.  The closest you can realistically do is what California did - which is to outlaw pet stores from selling &quot;commercially raised animals,&quot; but even that doesn't do much since most pet stores have already stopped doing so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It was an interesting perspective that I'd never even thought about and it may tie in to part of your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My county had an extremely hard time regulating known puppy mills in our area and ended up giving up.  The puppy mills were clients of the company you register purebred puppies to.  The company got their lawyers involved to fight the county because they would have lost a ton of money.  It's sad but my small county gave up the fight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having a puppy breeding business is not illegal. Only specific actions of negligence in dealing with the puppies and mothers are illegal. Simply being a breeder is not ground for the authorities to attempt to shut you down, there has to be evidence of you actually breaking the law. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can We PLEASE just add a tax on unspayed and unneutered animals? We make people get them rabies vaccines. Some towns require a license. How hard would it be at that license renewal to tack on a $50 tax if the dog is intact?! The money could go towards low cost spaying and neutering clinics! &quot;oh but then people would just not license their dogs!&quot; They're doing that anyway. Add the tax and some accountability. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
