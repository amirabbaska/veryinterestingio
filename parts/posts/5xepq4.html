		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is essentially a future simulation machine.</p>
<p>The brain can be split into 3 main chunks (I'm simplifying): the hindbrain, responsible for many instincts; the midbrain, responsible for many emotions and sensory integration; and the forebrain, newest and best at future planning. </p>
<p>The forebrain takes longest to develop. It tends to be in teenage development that people have their first epiphanies about existence and their place in the universe. This hits emotional triggers very hard, and is written into your memory as an important experience, to make sure you remember it. Why? The theory is a sense of purpose and value of your life has survival value. You're more likely to live with a strong ability to predict the future, and &quot;purpose&quot; is very much tied to future planning.</p>
<p>Crises can happen when you lose that feeling of euphoria tied to future planning. And since it was tagged in your brain as super important, you feel a sense of loss that is very strong.</p>
<p>Edit: credit to u/starfirex for pointing out that I describe brain structure using an outdated model. All 3 &quot;chunks&quot; have been evolving this whole time. I meant to use it only as a frame of reference for the forebrain and its function.</p>
<p>Edit 2: There's gold in them thar hills! I will celebrate with an awesome definition to share.
<a href="http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/" target="_blank">Connectome</a>: a comprehensive map of all connections in the brain. It hasn't been done in humans yet, but is as important for us to learn as the human genome. I hope to see it all mapped out some day.</p>
<p>Edit 3: a good chunk of this is indeed speculative. This is way beyond what researchers can test. </p>
<p>Attempt at a reasonable explanation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forebrain" target="_blank">The forebrain</a>, as well as mid and hindbrain, are structures which develop differently along the neural tube. A tube becomes your brain and spinal cord.</p>
<p>Perhaps some better read folks out there can help me with a definition of epiphany. My Principles of Neuroscience class defined most new thoughts as &quot;connecting two previously separated concepts in a novel way&quot;. I assumed the definition of an existential epiphany to be something like connecting pathways responsible for &quot;self&quot; with &quot;purpose&quot; or &quot;the rest of the world&quot;. </p>
<p>One of my profs said it in a way that I am retelling: your brain is searching to connect two or more concepts. Under MRI, it appears to be mild activity in many structures. When a connection with meaning is found, there is a sudden burst of activity. A sudden burst can lead to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation" target="_blank">long term potentiation</a>, a fancy way of saying the memory is likely to be stored in long term memory.</p>
<p>If this long term potentiation is paired with emotion (likely through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala" target="_blank">amygdalae</a>), it does two things: further consolidates the memory, and adds emotional content whenever the memories are recalled.</p>
<p>The thought process can also be tied to a rush of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins" target="_blank">endorphins</a>, which is essentially feel-good juice that your pituitary releases. The &quot;loss&quot; I refer to could be a number of new things that you have experience since you had the original epiphany. Reality sets in? You lose confidence? Have you become accustomed to the mindset without new stimulus? Then you may no longer trigger the entire pathway, and lose the paired endorphin rush.</p>
<p>My background is a BSc in Neuroscience. Good scientists will see that I didn't include enough primary lit. I am an amateur attempting to explain the unexplained, but I think my logic and theory is sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain realizes it's going to end.</p>
<p>You may know this fact, but few people <strong>internalize</strong> this.</p>
<p>What does internalization mean?</p>
<p>Internalization is the process by which the brain converts facts it learns into practical life lessons and adapts itself to that.</p>
<p>Example: Let's say you've heard that children are starving in Africa. You know this as a fact, but you have not internalized it. Now let's say you go to Africa, get lost and stuck into a tribe, and now you are experiencing that. When you get home, you will have a much different approach to starvation than if you only knew about it.</p>
<p>There are a few ways the brain can internalize things. The above example is through experience. But other methods include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Epathy</li>
<li>Witnessing</li>
<li>Meditating</li>
<li>Hearing another</li>
</ul>
<p>Among others.</p>
<p>Death is unique. Because Death is something that, once internalized by the brain, devastates it. Because there is no escape. Your brain cannot project an escape route. This hits the deep core of fight or flight. There is no fight. There is no flight. It leaves the brain defenseless to the inevitable doom.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most tragic thing is, is how long the brain can go without internalizing the reality of death. Indeed most people do not internalize it ever. They go to the grave in shock and horror. Others create myths and stories to try and avoid internalizing it. Others try to live live with hedonistic distractions to the reality of death.</p>
<p>But once you internalize it, you are changed forever. And many suffer an existential crisis. Some even suffer small versions of it when they realize their <em>person</em> is dying, but not their body. Children may experience it as they internalize that childhood is ending. New adults around 25 typically experience it as they realize the free life of youth is over. And many by 35 experience it when they realize their high life of sex, drugs, and alcohol is no longer compatible with living healthy and happy. Indeed many at 45 will experience it when they realize they cannot have kids anymore, and many at 55 will experience it when they realize they are not wanted anymore by many people.</p>
<p>These regular crises will continue, until the great final mystery. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
