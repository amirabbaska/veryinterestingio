		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All multicellular organisms need to do some basic things like divide cells, have all the parts of cells, have cells stick to each other, decide how each new cell will function. For example, we all have structures in our cells called ribosomes that help make new proteins. The ribosomes of humans and the ribosomes of bananas do pretty much the same thing (even using the same code instructions for how to make new proteins).</p>
<p>The basic building blocks of cells are the same, with minor changes. So, the basic genetic code for these things is the same, with minor changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing that comes to mind for me, that hasn't already been mentioned, is cellular metabolism. All living organisms break down organic molecules like glucose in order to release energy, which they need to stay alive. This transfer of energy from organic molecules to the organism includes processes like glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (aka Krebs cycle), the electron transport chain, and fermentation. These processes and the proteins that are involved in them are very well conserved between organisms.</p>
<p>For example, I just did a quick search using NCBI &quot;blastp&quot; comparing one isoform of human pyruvate kinase protein (NP_000289.1) to 27 different model organisms. This protein is expressed in organisms as basic as E.coli, and the human protein sequence is around 70% identical in mouse, 50% identical in the house fly, and 33% identical in E. coli, and there are additional similarities in the structure that aren't accounted for in these numbers.</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot that Krebs' last name has an &quot;s&quot;. Whoops!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another thing I would like to add is that the genome (i.e. what we're using as reference when we talk about how much DNA two organisms share) is the most-removed level of information from the phenotype (the physical traits that make up an organism). However, a lot of the genome is devoted to genes whose products help to regulate the expression levels of other genes, as well as to regulatory elements in the genome with which regulatory genes interact. Slight changes in regulatory genes or sequences can have profound effects on phenotype, because they can influence many different genes which produce proteins that have a more direct effect on phenotype. Those master regulatory genes are often present in many organisms and generally well conserved, but very little of them has to change for the phenotypes of those organisms to be radically altered. (I'm obviously generalizing here.)</p>
<p>One instance where this concept is very noticeable is the difference between domesticated plants and their wild relatives. Often, domesticated and wild relatives will have very similar genomes to the point where they may still be considered the same species. However, their transcriptomes - the relative expression levels of all their genes - differ wildly. When you look at the variation in transcriptional activity, you can better understand why the variants look so different despite sharing so much genetic material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A large amount of genes in the genome are &quot;essential genes&quot;, meaning if you get rid of them the cell will die. Most of the work on eukaryotic essential genes is done by yeast geneticists that have all sorts of cool tricks to test if genes are essential or not, such as by making temperature sensitive yeast strains that will stop expressing a certain gene at higher temperatures, so if you put the yeast at that higher temperature and they stop dividing or die, you'll know that gene is essential.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to distinguish two different types of 'genetic differences' that people talk about.</p>
<p>There's the &quot;<strong>within species</strong>&quot; genetic variation (i.e., what people are referring to when they say your DNA is 50% like your father'), which measures the degree of difference or similarity only at those sites in the human genome that are considered variable sites (not &quot;fixed&quot; sites). While technically, any position can have a variant or mutant (though not all will be compatible with life), on average, each human individual differs from any other unrelated human at about 3,600,000 positions [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09534" target="_blank">1000 Genomes, Nature, 2010</a>]. That sounds like a lot, but is only 0.055% of our 6 <del>tr</del>billion basepair diploid genome. So, 50% like your father is 50% of 0.055%.</p>
<p>Then there's the &quot;<strong>across species</strong>&quot; genetic variation which has many different approaches, but generally looks for variation that is uniform (&quot;fixed&quot;) in species 1 and fixed in species 2... but different. So, \~ALL humans have an <em>A</em>, while \~ALL bananas have a* *T (times the whole genome). But there's more! These numbers typically ignore (or only use, or incorporate in some way) those sequence regions (gene, gene clusters, or longer blocks) in species 1 where a similar sequence can be found in species 2. This is called synteny. Basically, researchers look to see if the genome of species 1 (human) can be (computationally) cut up and reassembled into a genome resembling species 2 (banana) using some kind of threshold for what can be called a similar region or gene. See [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synteny" target="_blank">Wiki link: synteny</a>] [<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Human-mouse_synteny.jpg/440px-Human-mouse_synteny.jpg" target="_blank">Wiki image: synteny</a>]. How well you're able to match these genomes relative to how much remains unmatched is another way to examine the similarity between two species. This is usually the approach referred to when people say we're 96% similar to chimpanzees. It means that 96% of the human genome can be mapped onto the chimpanzee genome with pretty high confidence. However, it's also true that only 29% of our genes are actually 100% identical, with the remainder having an average of \~5 changes per gene [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04072" target="_blank">Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, Nature, 2005</a>]. That's still really, <em>really</em>, genetically close for two species - but you're not more similar to a chimp than you are to your father.</p>
<p>Others have given you a great answer to your exact question on how similarities manifest (metabolism, cellular processes, multicellular organismal processes, etc), but I thought I'd take the opportunity to contextualize what &quot;50% similar/50% different&quot; means to a geneticist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
