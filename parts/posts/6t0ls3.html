		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My linguistics Professor told us that even in completely unrelated languages, their early words to address the parents tend to gravitate towards a certain type of sound. Her explanation was that the lip muscles are one of the earliest muscles the child learns to use, because sucking is important for survival, so bilabial open syllables (open syllable are simple consonant+vowel combination) like &quot;ma&quot; &quot;ba&quot; or &quot;pa&quot; are the easist for a child to learn.</p>
<p>&quot;mom&quot; and &quot;dad&quot; would then be the slightly more grown up version of &quot;mama&quot; and &quot;dada&quot;. (da is a bit of an odd one out because it's not bilabial, but still relatively easy to learn compared to complex words)</p>
<p>Even in languages in which parents are traditionally addressed more formally, they usually start out with easier &quot;baby&quot; words, and adopt the more formal terms later when the child can speak properly. But in many cases, some variation of the babyterms just stick.</p>
<p>In short: a baby physically wouldn't be able to address his father as &quot;Alexander Leopold von Gro√üauchenbach&quot;, so they just call him &quot;dada&quot; instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We all know how addressing people works differently in different dialects of English. (mom, mum, ma, mother to name a few)
most of these forms are based on language acquisition. Children go through different phases where they start using open syllables (think mah , moo, da) then later they start using repetition (mama, dada, moomoo). Nasal M is &quot;easier&quot; to learn (one of the first sounds to make) because it's a constant flow of air through the vocal cords (voiced) then out the nose. Pronouncing the p or d (which are considered plosives) requires better coordination of muscle groups since the airflow has to actually be stopped for their realization.</p>
<p>m is easier to learn than p.</p>
<p>addressing people, especially specifically defined people groups such as: coworkers, bosses, servants, family members, clerics etc. is incredibly complex and a fascinating part of linguistics.
There are other languages where it's commonplace to refer to parents by their first name, or as already mentioned in other comments: japanese people refer to their siblings when it comes to a direct address with the japanese word for &quot;sister&quot;.</p>
<p>other languages are way more interesting than English when it comes to the direct address of people, or family members.
this ain't no ELI5, but for anyone interested in that topic i suggest starting to read about the concept of politeness and language, esp. Brown &amp; Levinson &quot;Politeness: Some Universals in Language Usage&quot;</p>
<p>the basic breakdown of how you address someone is very complex.
Brown and Levinson postulate that humans have two distinct &quot;faces&quot;. A positive face and a negative face. The positive face is something like: I want to feel great and mighty and powerful. The negative face is I want to keep the stuff I have and not have anyone threaten me or my position.
Positive face politeness is saying how great the other person is.
Negative face politeness is saying how little of a person oneself is to make the other person appear bigger/greater than oneself in comparison.</p>
<p>How does that work in real life tho?
Well if you look at french for example, they have the &quot;tu&quot; and &quot;vous&quot; for the english &quot;you&quot; singular and plural respectively. This so called T-V-Distinction can be found in other romance languages like spanish for example. If you used &quot;tu&quot; with some total stranger or a police officer or a person that is usually respected, that's considered rather impolite and offensive. You're (according to Brown &amp; Levinson) &quot;threatening&quot; their positive face by not adhering to societal standards in paying respect to their position in society.</p>
<p>English only has the &quot;you&quot;, but think about old english &quot;thou&quot;. You've seen it in bible texts and in religious contexts mostly.
Only a few centuries ago the thou got replaced by you. The politeness towards people like parents and immediate family members, which used to be addressed with a &quot;thou&quot; (informal, less social distance) got reinterpreted and children started to &quot;you&quot;(more formal, more social distance, but also respect) the parents to show more politeness and practiced the positive face politeness. This was in no way the children's choice obviously.</p>
<p>Funnily enough we find examples of people wanting to use a different way of expressing the lacking concept of plurality when it comes to the word &quot;you&quot; in English. The lack of distinction gives rise to words such as &quot;y'all&quot; or &quot;yous&quot;.</p>
<p>I could go on and on. Such a fascinating part of language &lt;3
feel free to ask more</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> &quot;thou&quot; is informal and more direct, which was a deliberate choice for the church at the time. 'God and his representations (priests, clerics, bible etc.) are so close and involved in society'. It was a kind of marketing scheme in that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My Sociology of Cognition professor gave some lectures on totemism and how people across cultures dedicate special titles as a collective to people they look up to, whether it's a community leader of some sort or a person within the family depending on the pecking order. </p>
<p>Mom is mom, Uncle Joe isn't just Joe but mixing uncle and Joe is ok because not as high up on the respect order as the parent. Kids raised by grandparents might call the grandmother mama since they play that roll. </p>
<p>All societies have pecking orders and status symbols, etc. It helps us cognitively sort the world around us. Where this originated I'm not sure, but the idea he was relaying is that we all, as collectives in society and as individuals, need to make sense of the social order around us by sorting people with signs of status and respect. </p>
<p>We say &quot;hey doc&quot; to doctors but we don't call them by first name, generally. </p>
<p>We say &quot;professor&quot; rather than just their name, maybe &quot;professor (last name)&quot;. Some adjuncts are ok with &quot;professor (first name)&quot; but my Sociology of Knowledge professor earned her PhD mid-semester and people started calling her &quot;professor (last name)&quot;. </p>
<p>There's no society out there without these designations of status, and it makes sense. Obviously mom has a higher status in one's life than the mailman, no offense to the mailman. </p>
<p>I don't know of any society where it's acceptable or normal across the board to call mom and dad by their first names only, but I might be wrong. Social sciences are fuzzy and my area of focus is more on current dynamics because I'm also studying public policy and political science but that's what I've gathered so far. </p>
<p>Hope this sorta maybe answers the question along with the other gems in this thread. There's no one exact answer I think, because even cognitive sociology is theoretical rather than full blown empirical, compared to say, chemistry and whatnot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are addressing a question of ontogenetics, i.e. why it's easier for individuals to say &quot;mom&quot; and &quot;dad&quot; earlier than arbitrary names. But OP's question is actually a different question: (s)he's wondering why this became cemented even later in life. In other words, OP is asking a question about why we stick with those words <em>instead of</em> actual names.</p>
<p>I'd actually like to question an assumption in OP's question, which is that &quot;actual names&quot; for individual persons (that they kept throughout their life) predated words for &quot;mom&quot; and &quot;dad&quot;. It's much more likely that humans had &quot;words&quot; (or conventionalized noises) for referring to or getting the attention of their caregivers long before we had conventionalized names.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
