		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't see what surviving world wars has to do with wealth, other than if a country didn't survive, it wouldn't be around to have any wealth. Do you mean, why is Germany so rich even though it LOST two world wars? There are two main factors at play here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Erhard" target="_blank">Ludwig Erhard</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan" target="_blank">Marshall Plan</a>. </p>
<p>Ludwig was a German politician affiliated with the CDU and the second Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) from 1963 until 1966. He is often famed for leading German postwar economic reforms and economic recovery.  During that period he promoted the concept of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_market_economy" target="_blank">social market economy</a> (soziale Marktwirtschaft), on which Germany's economic policy in the 21st century continues to be based. So Herr Ludwig played a major part in rebuilding the economic structure and introducing the new currency, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Mark" target="_blank">Deutsche Mark</a>.</p>
<p>The Marshall Plan was an American initiative to aid Western Europe, in which the United States gave over $12 billion in economic support to help rebuild Western European economies after the end of World War II. The goals of the United States were to rebuild war-devastated regions, remove trade barriers, modernize industry, make Europe prosperous again, and prevent the spread of communism. Germany took this money and used it to kick-start their manufacturing industry. </p>
<p>So to tie it all together, Germany had a new economical model, new money, an infusion of US cash to spur new businesses, and from what I'm reading, a willingness to work hard to make things better. All of these things lead to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirtschaftswunder" target="_blank">Wirtschaftswunder</a> (German for &quot;economic miracle&quot;), which is a term that describes the rapid reconstruction and development of the economies of West Germany and Austria after World War II. The growth rate of industrial production was 25.0 percent in 1950 and 18.1 percent in 1951. By 1960 industrial production had risen to two-and-one-half times the level of 1950. The German GDP increased along with production, leading to higher wages for the people. All of this lead to Germany being the wealthy nation that it is today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other posters have explained why Germany is wealthy today, but your question's first part concerned the world wars. </p>
<p>Before WWI, Germany was an industrial first world power, with colonies around the world like its contemporaries, and had a strong focus on industrial militarism. WWI famously ended before Germany collapsed on the front and was invaded herself, its generals wanted to preserve their nation after witnessing the devastation caused by industrial scale warfare. Germany was made to pay for the damage to other countries, which compounded with the depression.</p>
<p>As a result of the depression, the nazis gained power, and part of their nationalistic policies were cancelling all foreign debt, and seizing all industrial capacity from private ownership to rebuild their warmachine dismantled after WWI. In the events up to WWII, they seized other nations and did the same thing, taking their assets and production and re-purposing it for Germany. This is what sparked WW2, the invasion of Poland for this (and other social policy reasons of the nazis, like the extermination of 'undesirables' in their philosophy). </p>
<p>Germany was rocked by WW2 and the defeat of the nazis, but this time the United States spearheaded a plan to rebuild the nations in a capacity that would not repeat the events of the past two wars. Part of this was turning focus away from militarism to industrial development for consumers. Since germany had not truly taken a beating in WWI and had gorged itself off stolen wealth from 1933-1945, and getting the industrial might of the last superpower standing in the world to rebuild her with a focus entirely on economy and quality of life (to compete with the soviet sphere in her eastern half), if Germany had been anything other than a beacon of hope it would have been a discredit to the Allies' efforts altogether.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whilst it has been mentioned here, the role of the Euro is tremendously important. In German economic terms the Euro is hugely undervalued and this makes their export products extremely cheap, this is a massive benefit to a large manufacturing country. It has been estimated that, if Germany returned to the Deutchmark, its dollar equivalent value would be 1.5 - 2 times that of the current Euro. </p>
<p>Yet Germany is playing a dangerous game; it has consistently resisted the tight fiscal and political cohesion required by a common currency - essentially Germans do not want their taxes to support the far weaker economies of the EU bloc. Under these circumstances the Euro is almost certain to fail. In fact, as the Euro enters its final death throws, the <em>only</em> way it can survive is if Germany withdraws from the currency. Many economists within the EU are now citing this as the Euro's last chance.</p>
<p>If they did leave, the value of the Euro would collapse, effectively killing off Germany's trading position in the Eurozone because their products would become twice as expensive.</p>
<p>Furthermore, German GDP isn't that good (1.7% in 2015, the highest it has been since 2008), without all the benefits it gains from using the Euro its economy would likely go into recession. Needless to say, the Germans are not keen on this idea and will probably resist any pressure to leave. Therefore, the only option it has is to support tighter fiscal union with the other Eurozone nations but, with the current political climate in Europe, this is also extremely unlikely. </p>
<p>This puts the German economy on a knife edge; either they cut and run and try to make the best of it, or they hand over their superior fiscal autonomy to a bunch of bureaucrats in Brussels who, let's face it, have tried to run the Eurozone economy based on an ideology rather than prudent economics.</p>
<p>So whilst Germany <em>appears</em> to be rich, and I do concur that they run a highly disciplined economy, they're actually riding a gravy train at the expense of all the weaker Eurozone economies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Germany has a large population.  That's a large part of why they've done so well.  Per capita, their GDP is in line with the rest of Western Europe.  They're also in one of the best situations within the Eurozone.  They've been able to keep wages low relative to southern Europe and have an export-based economy.</p>
<p>Its very hard to know what Germany would be like without the world wars.  The east would be better off, that's for sure.  But otherwise who knows.  That was over 70 years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
