		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a distinction between the random, short-lived, ringing you mention and chronic, low level ringing. The latter is (edit: <em>usually</em>) the result of some degree of ear damage. The former is not, and happens to a large percent of people at least once or twice. It's thought to be caused by muscle spasm that results in temporary constriction of the ear canal.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because you have certain specialised hair cells in your inner ear that don't just passively respond to sound, but also vibrate when they detect sound, so that faint sounds get amplified. This can sometimes cause positive feedback: the one set of hair cells vibrates a bit, then the next set responds to that, and the first set increases it even more until you're hearing a ringing in your ears. </p>
<p>It goes away because your nervous system detects the problem and damps out the oscillation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the symptoms of dehydration is ringing in the ears, or tinnitus like others have mentioned. The next time you hear the ringing, try to remember the last time you had anything to drink—then drink some water!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't see any good explains yet.</p>
<p>I get the random, 10-15 second high-pitch ringing from time to time, one ear at a time and it'll happen to both ears.</p>
<p>I did have a cold, quite a few years back.  Coughed a lot and at some point I had a constant ringing for a month, maybe two.  </p>
<p>It was very troubling.  I had a hard time sleeping, thinking and listening.  Was pretty sure it was the start of my doing deaf, but I didn't go to the Dr. Because I did not have the money.</p>
<p>Anyway, one day it just stopped.  I could hear again.  My hearing did not seem to be affected in any way.  I can still hear high-tech TV noise.  I still hear the hydrogen peroxide bubbles crackling when my wife throws her contacts into that little clear-plastic container.  I still hear click a from the other room. Etc.</p>
<p>Could this be some sort of repair mechanism under certain circumstances?  Hope to see a detailed ELI5 at some point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
