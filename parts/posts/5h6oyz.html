		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I asked the author about this some years ago,
and he suggested that Godel's proof only works
for discrete mathematical structures, not continuous
ones.  ie. it applies to elementary arithmetic, but
not to geometric calculus.  Hence, not to Newtonian
physics, ever--perhaps as per the Principia, or for some
problems in quantum physics--but not to contemporary
real world physics.</p>
<p>Godel's proof involves mapping all possible proofs
about numbers on a number line, to numbers on a
number line.  Always makes me think of a snake
swallowing it's own tail.  </p>
<p>I've seen it argued that all you need is to axiom-ize
a system for Godel to apply.  But I have never understood
that claim.  It seems to me to be likely to be true, but
I don't see how the proof works, because I don't see
how you can claim there's a mapping to a specific, but
unreachable proof without a discrete number line, or
some discrete-number-line-like entity to
attach all possible proofs to.</p>
<p>Tarski did seem to provide a twisty way to suggest
otherwise, which I haven't managed to understand, but
it might be worth your time checking out.</p>

<p>J. R. Lucas and Roger Penrose have both used the incompleteness theorems to argue that human minds cannot be (modelled as) Turing machines.  Penrose goes further to suggest that this gives clues as to the fundamental physical laws (specifically that they are deterministic, but not computable).  But AFAIK, his research programme has not enjoyed much support or empirical success; and the broad consensus is that the Lucas-Penrose argument does not work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Goedel's incompleteness theorem is not all encompassing. Euclidean geometry is both complete and consistent. You could think of the physical universe as having a true model like Euclidean geometry, and atop that context humans construct formal structures that Goedel's incompleteness theorem does apply to, like arithmetic with natural numbers, even though natural numbers aren't part of the underlying Euclidean geometry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Distinction must be made between &quot;physics&quot; and &quot;the physical universe&quot;.<br />
The first is a (partial) description of the latter. While physics may be 'GÃ¶del incomplete', the universe/nature/reality is probably not - if only because nature does not describe what it does, rather it just does. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
