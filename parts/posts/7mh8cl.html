<p>When you drink milk does the calcium build up in your system waiting for you to get some D3? Or does D3 sit in your system waiting for calcium?</p>
<p>What happens between the calcium and D3 to turn it into bones?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Milk contains various building blocks for the body, and as you've pointed out calcium is one of them. Vitamin D is important in creating bones, but it is in your body anyway, assuming you don't live in perpetual darkness. Yes, children who grow up in dark environments but with ample food typically have lower bone density, but at the same time it's not the key ingredient. </p>
<p>Bodily processes are incredibly complicated, and the process of ossification (making bone) is not as simple as calcium+vitD=bone. There are thousands (that we know of) factors that directly or indirectly affect bone development and repair. Vitamin D and calcium are just a part of the whole equation, and lacking either of them is rarely the cause for problems with bone development. </p>
<p>In fact, it's rarely spoken about, but one of the most important roles of calcium in your body is to do with how cells &quot;stick&quot; to one another - through little anchors that require calcium to properly work. <del>This is why calcium deficiency is more obvious in places like the mouth (scurvy) - where the cells in your gums literally fall apart from one another because of the junctions I mentioned earlier.</del></p>
<p>Calcium and Vit D are important for bone growth, but the equation is much broader than that. Neither waits for the other, and unless you are <em>severely</em> malnourished, they won't be the thing that affects the growth of your bones. </p>
<p>You get plenty of calcium from the food you eat and the water you drink (especially if you live in an area with &quot;hard&quot; water, which is heavy in ions like calcium)</p>
<p>Further, milk isn't there to provide calcium - it's more of a side effect. Many foods like citrus <del>(hence I mentioned scurvy earlier)</del>, cereals, seeds, and fish have a higher content of calcium in the same volume as milk. Milk has a lot of fat and protein which is much more important to the body than the tiny amounts of calcium it needs</p>
<p>Edit: I mixed up Vit C and Calcium in the scurvy point</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Milk doesn't actually help build bones. As
u/yellowyeti14 mentioned, milk actually hurts bone growth. </p>
<p>The idea that milk improves bone growth was a very successful marketing ploy that sounds feasible because it has a reasonable amount of calcium and calcium is useful for bone growth. This however isn't the whole story. </p>
<p>The whole story is that the lactose and casein in milk are acid forming once digested, and since calcium is a base, most of the calcium bonds to the formed acid and is neutralized. Additionally, there is usually more acid formed than calcium consumed, so your body actually starts pulling calcium away from its bones to neutralize excess acid. </p>
<p>If you want to build strong bones, eat green leafy vegetables. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't really turn milk into bones. Bones are made of a combination of a protein called collagen and calcium phosphate. So eating/drinking more calcium and protein (which milk has both) allows your body to make more bone. Think of construction workers building a wall. The wall are your bones and the workers are your bodies processes that mske bone. If you supply the workers with more brick and material they will be able to build a stronger, thicker or taller wall. Similarly if you give your body more calcium and protein (particularly while you're still growing), it will be able to make stronger bones. Vitamin D (which is also in milk) helps your body absorb the calcium you eat, otherwise you will just pee it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vitamin D affects what our body does with calcium in more than one way. Vitamin D's main job is to make sure that there is enough calcium in the blood. Calcium has many important functions. One is as a structural part of the bone tissue. Calcium also functions as a messenger for cell functions, for example in muscle and nerve cells, and also as an integral part in blood coagulation. These are reasons to regulate the amount of calcium available in the blood, as vitamin D helps with in these ways:</p>
<p>1) Vitamin D helps the absorption of calcium through the intestinal cells. This helps the body get more calcium.</p>
<p>2) Vitamin D tells the cells that brake down bone tissue to release more calcium (from the bones) into the blood. The bone tissue is the main resevoir of calcium in the body. Breakdown of bone tissue and release of calcium will happen if the amount of calcium in the blood is to low.</p>
<p>3) Vitamin D helps the reabsorption of calcium from the pre-urine in the kidneys. This helps the body keep the calcium it already has.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
