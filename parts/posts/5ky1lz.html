<p>And the pain is not just from surgically repaired areas. Even the &quot;ole football&quot; type injures become sore as well. </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There's no full agreement among scientists that weather causes pain, or if a specific mechanism is at fault, Jamison says. But there are plausible theories.</p>
<p>One leading theory points to changes in air pressure. Although many people say that their pain worsens with damp, rainy weather, research has shown that it's not the cold, wind, rain, or snow, Borenstein says. &quot;The thing that affects people most is barometric pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>Barometric pressure is the weight of the atmosphere that surrounds us.</p>
<p>If you imagine the tissues surrounding the joints to be like a balloon, high barometric pressure that pushes against the body from the outside will keep tissues from expanding.</p>
<p>But barometric pressure often drops before bad weather sets in. This lower air pressure pushes less against the body, allowing tissues to expand -- and those expanded tissues can put pressure on the joint. &quot;It's very microscopic and we can hardly notice, except that we have these sensations,&quot; Jamison says.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok I did some actual literature searching.</p>
<p>Most published studies seem to read more or less the same conclusion as this one : <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20570193/?i=5&from=/15229951/related" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20570193/?i=5&from=/15229951/related</a></p>
<p>&quot;CONCLUSION: The studies to date do not show any consistent group effect of weather conditions on pain in people with RA. There is, however, evidence suggesting that pain in some individuals is more affected by the weather than in others, and that patients react in different ways to the weather. Thus, the hypothesis that weather changes might significantly influence pain reporting in clinical care and research in some patients with RA cannot be rejected.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a little input on this. </p>
<p>I'm an air traffic controller and a big part of my job is controlling medevac helicopters transitioning through the airspace. We aren't supposed to give the aircraft altitude adjustments because if someone is bleeding in the aircraft, changing the aircraft's altitude a few hundred feet can mean the difference of a person remaining stable and a person bleeding out.  </p>
<p>This is sad when you think about helpless pilots in Afghanistan when they fly out of steep terrain. Those pilots know what's going on behind them and know that clearing the ridge by climbing 1,000 ft is going to kill his passengers.  </p>
<p>At my last base, we were one of the busiest airports for VFR traffic in the country, working 12-14 aircraft in a pattern was almost a daily occurrence(for tower, that's pretty damn busy).  I've had situations where we have been busy as shit and a medevac helo called needing to cut straight through my airspace with a critical casualty. I've made blanket broadcasts telling all the aircraft at once to change their altitude and 'race track' just so medavac can get through without any issues; it's that important that they don't climb.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Barometric pressure.  Injuries never heal perfectly (yet).  When the barometric pressure changes, you are getting stretched or compressed.  The scar tissue does the same, but at a different rate than surrounding non-damaged areas.  That makes it hurt.  The greater the change, the more pain.  Once the barometric pressure stabilizes, the stretching and compressing stops and everything goes back to &quot;normal&quot;.  That's why it hurts before the storm, but not necessarily during or after...at least for me.</p>
<p>Arthritis works under a similar method.  Any currently inflamed tissue will ache because some level of damage is occurring - sort of like tugging at a big cut on your arm.  Leave it be and the pain will stop.  Keeping tugging and it will keep hurting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
