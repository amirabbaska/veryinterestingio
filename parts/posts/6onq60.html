<p>While technically correct, &quot;proton mass measurement&quot; is a bit misleading. At this level of precision, the uncertainty of the relation between different mass units has to be considered. What they actually did is a comparison between the mass of a proton and the mass of C-12. The latter happens to be used in the definition of the atomic mass unit by a historical accident. Instead of a proton mass measurement, you could also call it a better calibration of the atomic mass unit. If the measurement can be repeated, and the deviation and smaller uncertainty turns out to be accurate, then it will make the uncertainty in unit conversions smaller. Nice to have for precision measurements. It won't change how we understand the universe. Measurements that can do that (e. g. antiproton to proton mass ratio) have larger uncertainties from elsewhere (e. g. the antiproton mass), they just rely on very accurate units to avoid uncertainties from that side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
