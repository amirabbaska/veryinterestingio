		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They would merge and become one larger black hole.  This happens once their event horizons overlap.  This combined black hole goes through a a process called <em>ringdown</em>, during which the object rearranges itself into a roughly spherical shape, becoming a canonical rotating black hole (a &quot;Kerr black hole&quot;).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We've saw this happen before. They merge into one big black hole, and if they're large enough or moving fast enough, they can create gravitational waves. This was detected very recently, and proves a lot about Einsteins theory of relativity that we weren't quite sure about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we treat the fabric of spacetime as a relatively static medium, is it correct in assuming that events like this alter the very state of reality (if only minutely)?  In other words, does the dimensional construct of the universe on our scale change?  Does time and the physical space I inhabit actually change, just as the position of floating debris would move were a stone to be thrown into the pond it floats in?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most answers until now focus on a general relativity description of the problem. However during a black hole merge energies / distances are reached comparable to the Planck length and thus quantum gravity becomes relevant. This is not so much relevant for the description of the GW emitted and measured by LIGO which can be described by the approximation we know as general relativity, still we should be careful to create the impression that we really understand what happens during a BH merge without a complete theory of quantum gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
