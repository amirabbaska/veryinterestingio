<p>My cheapest tier of water costs $3.49/'unit', which is $4.66 for 1000 gallons of water. This suggests that <em>just the water cost</em> of a pound of beef should be close to $5. I buy [ground] beef at Costco $3 per pound. What gives?</p>
<p>edit:
I have synthesized what I thought were some of the best points made (thanks all!)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This number represents primarily untreated water e.g. rainwater and water pumped directly from aquifers by farmers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the US, there are indirect subsidies to the price of beef, as components of their feed are subsidized (e.g. corn). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Farmers are free to raise their cattle in places where water is cheap</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obviously $3 ground beef is the least profitable beef obtained from a cow â€“ they are getting what they can for that cut. </p>
</li>
<li>It seems clear that, in the context of the linked articles, these figures are misleading; the authors are likely not expecting the reader to call to mind a slurry of rainwater, runoff and treated water. In the case of the NYT article, the leading line is that the average American &quot;consumes&quot; this water. Obviously there is very little to no opportunity cost to farmers benefitting from rainwater, and it is not fair to say that by eating beef your are &quot;consuming&quot; the cited amount of water.</li>
</ul>
<p>edit2: Tears of joy are sliding down my gilded cheeks. I would like to thank my spouse preemptively, for not chiding me for reading these comments all day, my parents, for spawning me, and /u/LizardPoisonsSpock for providing that sweet, sweet gold.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought this response from Josh Velson, on Quora, was worth quoting, particularly his comment that for each type of water, it is crucial to consider the [value of] alternative uses. Damn I love the interwebs.</p>
<hr />
<p>Among other things, those estimates account for the water used to grow the crops (much of which is rain) and water used for irrigation (much of which is given at little to no cost from natural runoff or taken from groundwater aquifers at low cost - under a 50 cents per metric ton).  Only a small amount of that - roughly 20 gallons (according to this widely cited website: The Hidden Water We Use - National Geographic) - is actually used for drinking and processing.  </p>
<p>What gives is that most of that water just doesn't cost anything, much of it because it literally falls from the sky.  Most of the Great Plains farmland used to produce feed grains is rainfed.  Embedded water estimates are useful, but it is still more useful to be considering the alternative use of that water.  If the alternative use is replenishing unsustainable withdrawals from fossil aquifers, then that's a good thing (and in truth that's most of the result of marginal decreases in water use from meat consumption).  However, there is a point at which much of that water will simply go down the Mississippi, so it's important to realize that this isn't just sitting in a big reservoir somewhere that's being depleted.  There are natural environmental inflows of water as well as withdrawals.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Meat manufacturing uses water in many different ways: directly to the cattle, growing feed for the cattle, and cleaning in the processing facilities. The exact amount of gallons/lb is difficult to narrow down because of all the factors involved, but most of the water is used in the growing of feed for cattle. Corn and soybeans are major crops used as cheap feed for cattle production in the US because of government subsidies for the farmers growing them. These subsidies make it cheaper to sell to large scale meat manufacturing facilities, ultimately making it cheaper for meat to be produced and thus carrying the benefit of low cost production to the consumer. If you live in the US and pay taxes, chances are you've already paid for a good portion of that pound of beef, and the price at the super market is just paying the rest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your water is expensive because it's purified and piped directly to your home, and the rancher or farmer has no ability to sell his free rain water to you.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A combination of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>meat subsidies</li>
<li>cheap availability of land</li>
<li>mispricing of water generally in areas like California - recognizing that most farms get water from wells on their own land - they still draw water from a common water table available to everyone and the lack of a regulatory framework in drought ridden areas has led to this mispricing</li>
<li>mispricing of other utilities like transportation (roads), and electricity</li>
</ul>
<p>Before people jump on this, let me explain. There are a lot of good reasons to keep farms in the country (self-reliance, etc.) so making a conscious decision and keeping core pricing of water / electricity / roads low so the industry flourishes makes all the sense in the world. But doing it on a state by state basis, where a drought state like California supports a massive amount of subsidized farming is less than ideal. Not effectively managing the water table in that state due to lack of a framework is poor management and detrimental in the long run. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of beef is raised in areas where there isn't enough water to raise crops economically. Since there isn't enough water, it doesn't make economical sense to try and raise crops. But you can put cows out on that same land and they will do fine. It takes a lot of land, but this kind of land isn't all that expensive and most places have agricultural exceptions for property taxes. The water costs are mostly free, as it comes from the sky. There aren't a lot of ranchers who buy water to grow grass. As it stands, beef prices are off the charts right now because drought of 2011 caused them to sell off most of their broodstock and they are still trying to build their herds back up to previous production levels. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
