<p>My cheapest tier of water costs $3.49/'unit', which is $4.66 for 1000 gallons of water. This suggests that <em>just the water cost</em> of a pound of beef should be close to $5. I buy [ground] beef at Costco $3 per pound. What gives?</p>
<p>edit:
I have synthesized what I thought were some of the best points made (thanks all!)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This number represents primarily untreated water e.g. rainwater and water pumped directly from aquifers by farmers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the US, there are indirect subsidies to the price of beef, as components of their feed are subsidized (e.g. corn). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Farmers are free to raise their cattle in places where water is cheap</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obviously $3 ground beef is the least profitable beef obtained from a cow â€“ they are getting what they can for that cut. </p>
</li>
<li>It seems clear that, in the context of the linked articles, these figures are misleading; the authors are likely not expecting the reader to call to mind a slurry of rainwater, runoff and treated water. In the case of the NYT article, the leading line is that the average American &quot;consumes&quot; this water. Obviously there is very little to no opportunity cost to farmers benefitting from rainwater, and it is not fair to say that by eating beef your are &quot;consuming&quot; the cited amount of water.</li>
</ul>
<p>edit2: Tears of joy are sliding down my gilded cheeks. I would like to thank my spouse preemptively, for not chiding me for reading these comments all day, my parents, for spawning me, and /u/LizardPoisonsSpock for providing that sweet, sweet gold.</p></div></div>
