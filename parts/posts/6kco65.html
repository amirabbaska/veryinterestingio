		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever shined a bright light through your finger tips? Notice how you can see the light coming though? It may not be as bright because your finger is absorbing a lot of it but still light makes it through to the other side.  well wifi or radio signals are essentially light or electro magnetic radiation. They are simply outside of the human visible spectrum so we don't see them. Same thing happens though with certain wavelengths of light can penetrate through solid objects. They'll be weaker on the other side but they can go through. On an atomic level there are gaps even in solid. If light is of the right size aka wavelength it can slip through these gaps. Differing materials have different gaps and density this absorbing different amounts of light. Glass will let through more light than metal for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As has been mentioned, its similar to how visible light can penetrate a window.  I cannot explain it like you are five.  The fundamentals of the interaction between EM waves and matter is described by quantum theory.</p>
<p>Bulk material, that is not a lone atom, has what is called bands and gaps.  These bands and gaps exist at different energy levels.  Electrons can occupy bands, they cannot occupy gaps.  So you have an incoming EM wave with an energy.  That energy added to the material's electrons would put them in another band, where electrons can exist.  This absorbs the EM wave.  If the energy added to the material's electrons would put them in a gap then electrons can't go there and won't absorb the EM wave.</p>
<p>Visible light has an energy that glass cannot absorb, its in the gap.  Different EM waves have different energies and can penetrate or be absorbed by different materials depending on the bands and gaps of the material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Atoms are mainly empty space. Even a solid body is mostly free space.
All electromagnetic radiation (visible light, radio signals, x-rays and so on) is made of photons of different frequencies. When photons encounter - i.e. approach - an atom, they might interact with a certain probability. The likelihood of the interaction strongly depends on the photon frequency.
A photon can pass by an atom or be absorbed and re-emitted at the same frequency (this is what happens with transparent materials) or be absorbed and its energy released after as different (lower) frequency photons (when materials are heated by elm radiation).</p>
<p>Every element / compound has its range of 'more likely' interaction in the spectrum of all frequencies. This means that higher and lower frequency photons outside this range generally don't interact, letting the radiation beam pass through the material only slightly dimmed.</p>
<p>The visible light is the radiation that interacts alot with solids, making them opaque. On the other hand, both high frequency photons like x-rays (or even more, gamma rays) and low frequency photons like radio waves don't have too much impediment in solid materials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
