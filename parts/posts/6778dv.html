<p>Example 2: Titanium by David Guetta feat. Sia</p>
<p>Example 3: Clarity by Zedd feat. Foxes</p>
<p>The way it's listed, it's as if the DJs are singing and the lead singers are only singing the bridge or something. Why are these DJs considered different than just a regular music producer or songwriter and paid so much more?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they are also the music producers, which is a separate skill entirely from being a DJ. DJs perform live, mixing tracks together or one after the other; music producers use analogue synthesisers (machines that make noise which you can change the sound of) or computer programs (called Digital Audio Workstations, which emulate a studio filled with synthesisers) to &quot;perform&quot; music that they wrote. Calvin Harris, Avicii, and other producers of electronic music are the people writing the chords, melodies, rhythms, as well as designing the &quot;sounds&quot; that play the noises. A vocalist is just performing on top of the rest of the tune, which was the producer's work. Most pop music is created in the same way nowadays, with music producers and songwriters writing the music, while the vocal performer (who may or may not be involved in songwriting and production) gets all the credit, because that is more easily marketable. However, the music producer really is doing far more work. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tell me this... Why do large pop acts get to plaster their name all over other peoples work when all they did is walk into the studio, grab a piece of paper with lyrics someone else wrote, and sing to a beat &amp; melody someone else produced. They get it handed to them because they can kind of sing and have &quot;star quality&quot;. That's the mystery to me.</p>
<p>But to answer your question... Producing is a totally different beast than singing. Most of these guys are the lyricist, producers, mixing engineer, and the performer. Would you give full credit to someone for just showing up and singing a vocal for the song you put all the work into? I think not.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It because they write all the music and lyrics.  Then they essentially hire a talented singer for the vocals.  A traditional songwriter may only write the lyrics or just the music.  Maybe they come up with the basic layout of the song and then sell it to an artist who works on the song, along producers and studio musicians, to flesh out the song, essentially acting as co-writers.  Calvin Harris hiring Elle Goulding is pretty much the same as hiring a studio guitar player to play a solo over your song.  </p>
<p>Why do they get paid so much?  It because they market themselves so well.  They could just be like a song writer and sell their songs without ever getting on stage, but they discovered they make way more money by retaining creative control.  By making a superior product, they control their own fate.  You want a Calvin Harris hit song?  You can't just buy the rights and call it your own.  You have to ask him to be featured on the song and give him full credit.  It's a pretty ingenious system on the part of the DJs.  They don't have to write full albums with the same band.  They just release a series of singles with all different types of artist, keep their sound fresh and allowing them to pump out a large number of songs.  By featuring top billings singers, like Elle Goulding, they are also riding their popularity to promote the song.  All this adds up to them receiving royalties and residuals on a bunch of hit songs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are all these reasons being listed, but here's the real reason: </p>
<p>Because that's how they and the record company choose to market the song. They've decided that the producer is the big &quot;brand&quot; that they feel most secure with, and use that to move units. </p>
<p>This is not new, btw. Other artists have done the same - Santana gave vocalists co-credits when he started collaborating, and Burt Bacharach is credited as the main artist on songs where he does no singing at all going back to the 1960s. Quincy Jones also got main credits on several tracks that he didn't perform on. There are entire records that he's listed as artist on where he never plays or sings a single note. </p>
<p>The name attached to the song is a matter of what brand you're pushing, not who deserves credit. Credits are why liner notes exist. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
