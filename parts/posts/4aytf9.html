		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has the ability to make itself sick. If you eat something and the body wants to get rid of it, it can secrete a substance that will induce vomiting. Once you vomit, it removes the irritant, and it removes the vomit inducing substance and this is why you usually feel better almost instantly. </p>
<p>Think of it as a natural syrup of ipecac courtesy of your stomach, liver, and gallbladder. </p>
<p>Edit*** To answer peoples questions, a chemical called TNF (tumor necrosis factor) stimulates the brain to shut down the digestive system by relaxing the stomach and digestive tract. This slows digestion to prevent absorbing the irritant further. TNF is produced by several different cell types in the body and has links to anti nausea medications and cannabanoids as a method of reducing nausea by blocking TNF receptors. Any medical researchers out there, feel free to correct me. </p>
<p>The mucus lining of the stomach can become irritated, and this is what causes the actual contractions that result in vomiting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What about when you vomit from seeing something traumatic? I've seen some fairly horrific videos on the internet and some have &quot;turned&quot; my stomach. Never actually vomited from the sight of something but I know it 11th possible. I was once in a science class when a sick student bolted out of the room while simultaneously pinwheeling puke. Some landed on the floor near the front of the class and 3 people all started throwing up just at the sight of it. I always wondered why people do it. Hopefully someone can answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there are usually bacteria in your stomach that release toxins as waste material which can irritate the stomach hence the bad feelings, to <del>git</del> get rid of the bacteria the body begins to raise its temperature to create a less favorable temperature for that bacteria, and begins to also release substances that force you to vomit and expel the bacteria

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not your stomach directly that decides that you should feel sick, it's your brain. There are a variety of causes, but the conclusion of your brain is always the same: The stuff inside your stomach is harmfull, it must go out. This might happen if for instance after you were on a roller coster: You feel very dizzy, so your brain thinks that you might have eaten something poisenous. Same thing applies to other symptoms, like fever - or if you have eaten something very gross, after all, the only purpose of your sense of taste exist to distinguish the things you can and should eat from the one you should't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This actually is a pretty complicated question because there are a number of different types of nausea, and not all directly and initially involve the stomach (motion sickness, stimulation of the area postrema from irritants in the blood supply, etc.)</p>
<p>Upon stomach and GI irritation, cells in the body called enterochromaffin cells release serotonin. There are a plethora of serotonin receptors, but the 5HT3 subtypes are particularly important for sensing nausea. Afferent/sensory enteric neurons with these receptors tend to synapse near the chemoreceptive trigger zone and vomiting center of the brain, causing nausea sensations. </p>
<p>Additionally, there are 5HT4 serotonin receptors which increase gastric motility when stimulated. This can cause an irritated stomach, which releases serotonin, to become more contractile. This can lead to a positive feedback loop of stimulating more nausea until you vomit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
