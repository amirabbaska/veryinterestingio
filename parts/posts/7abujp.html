		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are an input into the economy, just like oil or farm land or machines.  As a general rule, the more people you have, the more you can produce. So, on a surface level, a shrinking population is bad for an economy in the same way that a dwindling oil supply or lack of capital is bad.</p>
<p>Unlike most of those things, people also create demand, not just supply. So fewer people can also mean that people aren't out there looking to buy new stuff---especially land and houses. which can also upset the economy quite a bit. </p>
<p>On top of that, shrinking populations also usually mean aging populations.  As people get older they tend to go from being net producers to net consumers, especially when health deteriorates.  This can force a country to make hard choices about how, and how much, to support an older population that increasingly can't support itself.  This is made worse by the fact that some jobs simply aren't suited to older people (There are very few 80 year old coal miners, or 70 year old ER nurses, and even when people are only 40 or so they may find that family and health makes it hard to work the kind of job or hours they could have worked when they were 50.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A small generation of kids now will have to support the bigger generation of their parents in a few decades.

If the ratio of elderly to workers gets out of wack, the government either has to cut benefits to the elderly, raise taxes on workers or borrow money.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A decreasing population doesn't result in more jobs for fewer people. Because there are less people, fewer products will be needed, therefore fewer factories and resources will be needed for those products, therefore fewer jobs will be needed to run those factories, and then a new equilibrium is established where people are once again saying &quot;there aren't enough jobs for all these people&quot;.  </p>
<p>At the same time, you have that peak generation right before the population decrease thats too old and weak to work, with not enough production to support it, but they still consume resources, so everyone becomes poorer overall.  </p>
<p>Also, while automation is increasing, it is nowhere near where it needs to be for our society to become a utopia running on auto-pilot. Still a ways to go. Until we all have Mr. Handys, you better get to work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
