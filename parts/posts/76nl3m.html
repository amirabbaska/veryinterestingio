		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>False virtual nerve signals emanating from the site of the pinch in the nerve.</p>
<p>We say the circulation is cut off because the concept of blood circulation is more familiar to people and because the circulatory system kindasorta runs parallel to the nervous system in the limbs.</p>
<p>Of course you can disprove the misconception by noting that different sides of your ring finger get numb depending on which nerve you pinch, which would be impossible if the circulatory system were the cause.</p>
<p>Incidentally, people who get limbs amputated sometimes suffer from virtual propioception and even virtual pain caused by the cut-off nerve endings, giving them the undeniable sensation of the amputated limb still being there, oftentimes sticking out in an impossible direction. I heard a story of a man who had his arm amputated at the shoulder but he could still sense its presence sticking out straight to one side - and the virtual sensation was so powerful that he was compelled to walk through doorways sideways so as not to hit anything with his nonexistent limb.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
