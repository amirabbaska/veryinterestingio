		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>that is the difference between a conventional oven and a convection oven (one with a fan). the fan does two things. The first is it mixes the air in the oven, so you get a more even temperature throughout. This helps things cook more evenly. The biggest difference, though, comes from the flow of air through the oven. Moving fluids, be they gas or liquid, transfer heat faster that stagnant fluids. Stagnant air is often used as insulation. Conventional ovens do have some airflow due to the slight temperature differences between the top and bottom of the oven and having a heating element on the bottom, but this is minor compared to convection ovens.</p>
<p>TL;DR faster moving air transfers heat better than slow or non-moving air so a convection oven cooks faster than a conventional oven.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You'll have to understand conduction vs. convection to understand this.</p>
<p>Conduction is just the transfer of energy through a stable, still medium. Like a metal pot on a hot stove heating up. The same thing happens in air and water.</p>
<p>Convection is the transfer of energy by a <em>circulating medium</em>. I really like water with floating ice as an example. Water near the surface is cooled by the ice and sinks (more dense), and warmer water moves up to replace it. Because of this circulation (convection), warmer water is always in contact with the ice and it melts faster. Without circulation the water around the ice would be &quot;ice-cold&quot;, as you can imagine, and the ice melts more slowly. In water, this difference is around 5-10x longer when there's no convection.</p>
<p>Your oven works the same way, and the food is the &quot;ice&quot;. Where the example differs is the energy is coming from outside the system (in the oven case), so convection ovens are even better because you can put more energy into the food with faster air flow (more air at the same temp inherently carries more energy to your food).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is often assumed that moving air only cools an object. This is untrue. Moving air transfers heat more efficiently. This effect can help with either cooling or heating an object. It mostly depends on the temperature difference between the air and said object.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If can be explained by wind chill (where more cold atoms are being pushed by you so you get colder quicker.)  </p>
<p>Let's assume you put a fan on the elements of a stove. Now they are being chilled quicker because of wind chill. You oven is a (mostly) closed system. This means the energy the elements lose gets absorbed by your food. So now, your food (the air around it) is getting hotter quicker than in a traditional oven.  </p>
<p>Some Notes: The air circulates in a normal oven too, it's just slower. Also your oven leaks a lot of heat. This means that getting it to temperature faster can save lots of energy.  </p>
<p>Tldr. Put a fan on your oven elements to cool them off, and your oven will get hot faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
