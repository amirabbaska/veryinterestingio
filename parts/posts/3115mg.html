		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm a professional managed care contract negotiator for a major health system in the US who also teaches health administration classes at a local university. Most of what I can say is already stated, albeit a bit fragmented across 200 replies. Let me try to be comprehensive:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There's a difference between what's price and cost. Hospital prices are what hospitals charge for a service. Like any other business, charges include the direct costs (supplies, clinician time, etc.) and indirect costs (power bill, departmental overhead, etc.). Included in the indirect cost is always an amount to cover uncompensated care. This is cost incurred by people who can't or don't pay their bills, and it's re-allocated into future pricing, creating inflated charges, which are reported as the &quot;price&quot; for healthcare services in the media and quoted by politicians. <em>edit</em> In addition, government programs with set payment systems (i.e Medicare, Medicaid) often cover some, but not all of the direct cost of care. This too is passed on in the pricing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>American law states that anyone who shows up to a hospital emergency room with an actual emergency must be treated without regard for ability to pay (EMTALA). This means that someone with no insurance can still receive life-saving care through the ER and not pay a dime. Unfortunately, 30 years of this law in practice, coupled with no requirement to have health insurance for most of that time means that we've developed a cycle of inflated ER charges grossly above the actual cost of doing business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one pays 100% of billed charges. Yes, managed care organizations (MCOs) do negotiate down, but so do many self-pay patients individually.  At some of my hospitals, a self-pay patient can get a better discount than a member with a health plan, because hospitals know a) charges are inflated, and b) some money is better than no money. (also, and off topic, but you can negotiate directly with many providers for self pay for discounts of 50-75% off the price of the bill, depending on the hospital and the situation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most hospitals are not-for-profit. This is key to remember, because (anecdotal testimony to the contrary notwithstanding) hospitals don't just jack up prices. It's not a question of &quot;because they can&quot; or &quot;because MCOs will pay&quot;. I promise you, MCOs fight very hard to get the best possible discount so they can sell their insurance plans to as many people as possible, and unless a hospital is all alone in a market, high prices will drive customers elsewhere (unless it's through the ER).</p>
</li>
<li>PPACA has changed a lot of this going forward, but we have a lot of business practice in place today that will not change quickly. One of the key things to look for over time (5-10 years) will be if the rate of increased prices slows down. Prices will continue to rise because of inflation, but whether they rise at more shallow rates than prior to 2010 is one of the metrics that is used to gauge Obamacare's success.</li>
</ol>
<p>tl;dr - Hospital prices is not hospital cost. Customers who don't pay make it more expensive for those who do, and 30 years of this cycle results in the price for a $90 pair of pills.</p>
<p><em>edit</em> to include government programs above that pay some, but often not enough, to cover the direct cost of care.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This will be buried, but fuck it.</p>
<p>The problem is there is such a litany of factors and all the participants can't accept their share of the responsibility.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Former insurance guys will tell you negotiation cuts down 50% of that stated price, and really they are taking the brunt of free riders on the healthcare system in the US. And they're right, in part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Former hospital guys will tell you that there are such huge liability costs, preparation costs, emergency room visits without insurance costs, over-charging insurance so when it is negotiated down the get a fair price, that they have no choice but to charge that much. They are right, in part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doctors will tell you they are so afraid of getting sued that they have to charge that much, and they dont choose the pricing anyways. They wont mention that in California, for example, despite its population tripling in the last half century they haven't opened a new medical school in the state for 50 years or significantly expanded their number of graduates. They have the most powerful, most uniformly respected and unmentioned union in the country and artificially reduce the supply of doctors. They are right, in part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Republicans tell you its all liability and our amazing medical innovation that forces them to charge more. They also say sometimes government healthcare is a Byzantine system emblematic of the advantages of a decentralized system. They are right, in part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Democrats will tell you insurance companies and medical companies gouge the consumer for profit, and the inefficiencies of American healthcare is only because our government is chronically unable to pass beneficial legislation because of obstructionism and lobbyists unique to American politics. They are right, in part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medical companies say protecting patents on medicine is paramount, that allowing generics to proliferate would hurt a very prolific American R@D system that needs these higher prices. They are right, in part. Never a mention of how they bribe doctors to push their product, but its only marketing. They are right, in part.</p>
</li>
<li>My grandpa hates American government healthcare, without realizing he has been on the VA system his entire life and served relatively well by it. </li>
</ol>
<p>The problem is, for the last twenty years, we have not realized that we have the unique luxury to pick and choose a healthcare model from ALL the other countries in the world with sane healthcare systems and we have such a lack of curiosity and political innovativeness we are still stuck in a system from 1919. And nobody has the maturity or courage to admit their part in it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insurance aside, it takes many people to take care of you in a hospital. When you come to the hospital er for stitches, you are first met by a triage nurse and tech who ask why you are there and take your history and vital signs. A person from the business office will then register you and get your insurance information if you have any. Next you go to a room which was just cleaned by one of the environmental workers, where you get a new nurse and tech. The doctor will then come see you and decide you need stitches. He needs the sutures and antiseptic scrub which was stocked by someone from central supply.  Most people want some numbing medicine before the doctor starts sewing which is kept stocked in the ER by someone from the pharmacy. That is nine people involved in 4 simple stitches. That's assuming you didn't need X-rays, food, or labs during your stay. That is also not taking into account other operating costs of the hospital. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/health/exploring-salines-secret-costs.html" target="_blank">this article from the New York Times.</a> It's called How to Charge $546 for Six Liters of Saltwater.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that America <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_\(PPP\)_per_capita" target="_blank">spends more</a> on healthcare per capita and as a percentage of GDP than any other country, yet most of the other developed countries have universal care. I wonder why?... hint hint, read the article I linked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is expected that the customer (read not as the patient, but whoever is paying the bill... usually this is private insurance) will haggle it down.  Therefore, it's a highball first offer.  Uninsured people tend to be the least financially educated, and will not even attempt to negotiate the price.   Insurance companies like to be able to send a bill with the &quot;original&quot; price and what they negotiated as a way to say, &quot;See how much I do for you?  See what you'd pay without me?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>Prices are high because hospitals must treat anyone in need of critical medical attention, regardless of ability to pay.  If a person can't pay their bill, and do not have insurance to cover the costs, the hospital must accept it as a loss, and raise other rates accordingly.</li>
