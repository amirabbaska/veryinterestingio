		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a little of both. With how we currently probe high energy regimes, there is a fundamental limit to the energies we can obtain from collisions, related to accelerator designs (including size). But it is, pedantically, a technological limitation, because the science doesn't say &quot;the only way to test string theory is to use your current understanding of accelerator physics to build a very large accelerator,&quot; rather it says &quot;if you want to avoid building a very large accelerator, you need a breakthrough in how you probe very high energy regimes.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a &quot;technical&quot; limitation in the sense that there's no reason why we couldn't build one that big. </p>
<p>But, although this is an often-made claim, it's really a quite misleading one. It's based on the idea that there's a certain &quot;characteristic&quot; energy scale associated with string theory, and in order to <em>directly</em> test string theory, we need to create particles of this energy, which requires a ridiculously large particle accelerator. These claims are true, but they are not the whole story.</p>
<p>Think about it like this. Suppose you have a ruler. Let's say this ruler is only accurate to 1mm. That is, you can't use it to measure distances smaller than 1mm. Any measurement that falls between two different mm marks, you round to the closest mark. </p>
<p>With this ruler, you can never measure something smaller than 1mm. Even if you try to do something clever, like make a lot of measurements and average them together to get a really accurate measurement, it won't work, because you always rounded to the closest 1mm mark.</p>
<p>This means that, with this ruler, you can never <em>directly</em> measure distances smaller than 1mm. This does not mean, however, that you can not use the ruler to <em>indirectly</em> measure distances smaller than 1mm.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you have a microscope that magnifies an image by a factor of 1000. You could then pick something that's smaller than 1mm, magnify it by 1000 using the microscope, measure the magnified image, and then divide that length by 1000. This allows the ruler to indirectly measure distances much smaller than it can directly measure.</p>
<p>There are lots of other ways you can come up with to use this ruler to indirectly measure very small distances.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are lots of indirect predictions of string theory that do not require enormous particle accelerators. In fact, there are so many of these predictions, and they are so structured, that pretty much all string theorists at this point are convinced in its correctness. (Mostly, the problem is in getting the theory to make predictions of the specific quantities you'd like to study, which is hard because the theory is complicated.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
