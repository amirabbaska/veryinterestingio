		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's simply a matter of 1) increased bloodflow to the area and 2) various biochemical processes involved in the healing. When your body senses the damage from sunburn, it activates the immune response, which triggers increased blood in order to deliver white blood cells needed to fight potential infection and building blocks to repair the damage. This rush of blood by itself will increase the temperature. In addition the host of chemical reactions associated with the heavy cellular construction work needed to clear debris and repair the tissue will generate additional heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the immune response answer given earlier, the fact that it's a burn doesn't have to do with your skin radiating heat. That happens with other types of injuries as well. With sunburn, a widespread area of your skin has been damaged so the immune/repair responses are caring for a large amount of skin surface area and thus a large amount of heat generated. If you accidently slam your fingers in a door or cut yourself or get scratched by a cat for example that area will feel hot to the touch as well.  These injuries are much more localized though and the heat from the immune/repair response isn't readily noticeable like with a sunburn. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sunburn is caused by UV overexposure causing damage to the DNA in cells. The exact mechanism of this is actually fairly interesting but not entirely relevant to the question. The important part of this is that your body recognises that DNA damage and begins processes to repair it.</p>
<p>One of the bodies responses to damaged cells or foreign substances is inflammation, in this case an acute form of inflammation (basically this means that it is short lived as opposed to say chronic arthritis).</p>
<p>Inflammation has five cardinal signs:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Rubor</em> (redness)</li>
<li><em>Calor</em> (increased heat)</li>
<li><em>Tumor</em> (swelling)</li>
<li><em>Dolor</em> (pain)</li>
<li><em>Functio Laesa</em> (loss of function).</li>
</ul>
<p>The heat and redness radiating from the affected region are caused by increased blood flow to the damaged area which is part of the inflammatory process.</p>
<p>However, this is not the whole story; Some people may have realised that when sunburnt, an  afflicted region not only feels hot but it is also more <em>sensitive</em> to heat application as well. </p>
<p>This is the result of of prostanoids and bradykinin being released as another part of the inflammatory process. These hormones increase sensitivity to heat by reducing the threshold of heat receptor activation thus making the area feel &quot;hotter&quot; than it actually is. </p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood rushes to the surface of your skin at a much higher rate when you have a sunburn. Your skin is actually fairly cool compared to your body temperature (i.e. it isn't 98.6F). When you get a sunburn, more blood (at the body temperature) is being transported to the surface (not usually very close to the body temperature) causing more thermal energy at your nerves. You feel hot because you are in fact hotter than usual at your skin.</p>
<p>Also, the nerves in your skin have been damaged. So things don't feel quite as they should. Even if you cooled down, you might feel hot, or you might feel extra cold, or you might feel pain. Your nerves are wonky, so some signals won't translate to your brain quite right for what is actually happening.</p>
<p>If you had a sunburn all your life, your brain might have learned how to experience pain, cold, and heat differently so as to make sense of the external stimuli. But since you don't usually have a sunburn your brain doesn't know that the cool compress isn't doing damage to your body and it is just your nerves sending the wrong signals for what is actually happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a form of inflammation. It's a normal biological process at the site of injuries, similar to a swollen sprained limb.</p>
<p>The body increases blood flow to the area in order to provide increased resources for healing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
