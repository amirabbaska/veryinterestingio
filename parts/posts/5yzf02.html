		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that the imperfections effectively act as a catalyst that reduces the activation energy needed to form the bubbles. As a result, nucleation (the first step of bubble formation) will happen much faster in those regions than in the bulk of the liquid.</p>
<p>To get a more complete answer, we have to consider the energies involved in bubble formation. Fist of all bubbles form spontaneously. That means that there is a negative Gibbs energy Gv associated with the process. Moreover, this energy will scale as the volume of the bubble, which is why I labelled it Gv. However as the bubble first starts forming (in a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleation" target="_blank">nucleation</a>), the process is not energetically favorable. The reason is that on top of the volumetric Gibbs energy, there is also an interfacial Gibbs energy. (Gi) This second factor is due to the fact that by creating a bubble you are preventing the surrounding water molecules from being stabilized by other water molecules. As a result, the surface tension wants to squeeze the bubble out. </p>
<p>As a result, you have to competing energy contributions, the volumentric (Gv) and surface (Gi) terms. Now as you increase the size of the bubble, Gv eventually wins out <a href="http://i.imgur.com/53VlsT5.png" target="_blank">as shown in this diagram</a>. But in order to get to that regime, bubbles must first get enough energy to grow past the hump were energy needs to be added. This hump is called the activation energy, denoted as G^* in the diagram. In the case of the bulk solution, this activation energy can be very high. As a result, bubbles can form so slowly that you basically never see them. This process is called <strong>homogeneous nucleation.</strong> </p>
<p>However, near surfaces or other imperfections, the interfacial energy can be much lower. The umbrella term for this process is <strong>heterogeneous nucleation</strong>. There are two main mechanism for how this process may play out:</p>
<ol>
<li>There can be solid surfaces or grooves that are in contact with the bulk liquid. At these points <a href="http://i.imgur.com/JhKFs2r.png" target="_blank">gas can bind to the surfaces and grow into small nuclei.</a> Because the area of the bubble in contact with the water is smaller, the interfacial energy is smaller. Eventually the bubble can grow past a critical size, detach through the water and zip to the surface.</li>
<li>There can exist pores that are already partially filled with gas, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/XVOXtp8.png" target="_blank">as shown in this diagram</a>. Additional gas can then seep in, creating a larger pocket of gas. This gas can then leave the pore as a bubble and escape. The process can then start all over again.</li>
</ol>
<p>The key point in all cases, nucleation will happen in those regions much faster, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Nucleation_finger.jpg/640px-Nucleation_finger.jpg" target="_blank">which is why you see so many bubbles there.</a></p>
<p>edit: I expanded my answer a bit to include specific mechanisms of heterogeneous nucleation</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those imperfections act as nucleation sites. In your example they help with the physical separation of the gas (carbon dioxide) from liquid (water). When you open the bottle some of the carbon dioxide dissolved in the water wants to leave (pressure change) and go into the air but it can't because the individual CO2 molecules cannot overcome the viscosity of the water. The nucleation site provides a place for CO2 molecules to aggregate and form bubbles capable of breaking the hydrogen bonds of the water molecules. Without the imperfections there is nowhere for the CO2 molecules to coalesce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever bubbles do form randomly within a liquid, they'll quickly travel to the surface and pop. Along the surface of the glass, there's more possibilities for nucleation, and there's also somewhere for the bubble to stick and grow. So you get a survivorship effect as well.</p>
<p>Beer with a head demonstrates a variation on this behaviour. You get far fewer bubbles on the insides of the glass, the way you do with cola, and the bubbles that do form throughout the beer collect together in the beer's head and last long enough to make a significant layer of bubbles. The bubbles in ale heads last longer than lager bubbles and much longer than watery old cola-bubbles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
