<p>During normal re-entries from Low Earth Orbit (LEO), most spacecraft enter the atmosphere mainly horizontally, so they slowly encounter the thicker portions of the atmosphere, which greatly reduces the g-forces, or deceleration (1g = 1x Earth gravity acting on you, so 7g = 7x Earth gravity).</p>
<p>With a ballistic re-entry, one of which occurred early today after the Soyuz MS-10 failure and subsequent abort, they re-enter the atmosphere more vertically, although still with some horizontal velocity. Since they hit the thicker parts of the atmosphere quicker and more head-on, the deceleration and g-forces are more extreme.</p>
<p>Imagine side-scraping a wall in a car, you'll get some big scratches and dents, but it would be a lot tamer than hitting it head-on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order to go to space you have to get moving really really fast. The space station they were heading to is moving at nearly 5 miles a second. That's about 300 times faster than a car on the freeway. </p>
<p>In order to come back to earth (alive) you have to get rid of all the speed. It takes a giant rocket to get up to that speed and it would take a giant rocket to get rid of it. That's a problem because launching a big rocket takes an even bigger rocket. </p>
<p>Thankfully there is a way to cheat. You can use the atmosphere to slow down. If you've ever flown a paper airplane or a glider you've experienced this. The air gets less thick the higher you go so at the top of the atmosphere you will only have a little slowing down while near the surface things will slow down quickly. </p>
<p>People cannot feel speed but we can feel a change in speed. That is what g forces are. A change in speed. One &quot;g&quot; is equal to the force we feel from gravity. So a spacecraft entering the upper part of the atmosphere will only feel a small force. On the other hand, the thicker air in the lower atmosphere will create a large force. Generally spacecraft enter the atmosphere at an angle that allows them to slow down nice and slowly through the upper atmosphere. In this case though they couldn't do that. So it hit the thicker part with a lot more speed than normal. That meant they slowed down very quickly and the crew experienced that as high g forces.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm, most of these are good explanations, but not explaining it to you like you're 5.</p>
<p>The spacecraft is like a pebble, and the earths atmosphere is like the surface of a pond. Normal re-entry is like a well skimmed pebble, it approaches the pond surface at a very low angle, causing it to rub off the surface of the pond over a period of time, gradually losing speed until it gently drops into the water.</p>
<p>A ballistic reentry is like taking the same pebble and throwing it as high as you can above the pond with an under-arm throw. It goes up, then comes more or less straight down and hits the water hard. If you were underwater you'd see that the pebble slows down almost instantly, then gently drops to the bottom of the pond. That <em>instant</em> slowdown would be experienced as very high g-forces, both for a pebble entering a pond and a spacecraft entering the atmosphere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey this is related to my thesis. Others have done a good job answering but I’ll give it a go too. Basically, ballistic reentry is uncontrolled flight with no lift like a bullet. Literally it’s just falling out of the sky. However, the Soyuz and basically every other entry vehicle  are shaped and packed in such a way that they generate a small amount of lift (upward force). During a normal entry, the direction of the lift can be controlled by rotating the vehicle about the velocity vector (direction of flight) using Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters. This is known as bank angle control. You can control how far down range (forward)  you go by changing how “up” the lift vector is and cross range (left/right) by doing a bank reversal to change whether the lift vector points left or right. This is how Mars Science Lab landed so precisely compared to previous missions.</p>
<p>By controlling the vehicle, you can chose a trajectory that glides more, slows down slower (less peak deceleration), and impacts with a shallower angle. In uncontrolled (ballistic) flight you generate no lift and are basically just falling out of the sky, generating a higher peak deceleration. Normally ballistic is the worst case trajectory that you can do but if a problem is encountered, it’s the fail safe because it’s the simplest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During re-entry, the 7G forces are in the direction opposite of gravity. It is the force of deceleration caused by entering the atmosphere.</p>
<p>All of the sudden friction from traveling through the air causes the spacecraft to slow down and that is the force that cause the 7Gs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
