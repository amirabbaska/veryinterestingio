I'm currently visiting my sister in Arizona and on a desert jeep tour was told that one of the original landowners in the Sedona area had to drill 1000 feet to reach water which sparked my curiosity. Only had an occasional few moments after posting to check back in but I really appreciate the explanations.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes. There are a few types of underground water supplies. The first is the water table. </p>
<p>When it rains where does that water go? Well you do see most of it run down the sidewalks, and streets. Where does the rest go? Underground of course. It drains through cracks, and soft soil till it reaches the point of saturation. The bottom of that point is the water table.
For example this water table is at 75ft. You take a drill,or even shovels, and started digging a hole you will hit water (depending on the last good rain) anywhere from just below the surface of top soil to 75ft.  Where you place the pump in that type of well will give you so much water. If you go into a drought that type of well goes dry rather quickly. </p>
<p>The second type of underground water supply is an aquifer.  Aquifers are deep. My example will be the one near me in San Antonio Texas. Surrounding San Antonio you have rivers. Comal, Guadeloupe, San Antonio, etc. They start in the hills, and flow down to the sea.
Rivers are the blood vessels of the earth.  What you see on the surface is just one vain. Underneath them in the cracks in the bedrock are the rest.
All that water from the rain that didn't soak into the ground runs off into the creeks that supply most of the river's water. As time goes on between rain storms the upper layer of soil drains the rest of the water tables into the river. Then the river supplies the underground aquifer.
The San Antonio aquifer is larger than the city itself by hundreds of square miles. Test wells drilled into it at several locations is how it is measured. Every night the local weatherman on the news will tell you what the level is. On average it is around 640 feet.
The water dept keeps an eye on that daily to make sure the population and agriculture have adequate allocations. If it gets low you have restrictions put in place. Like not watering your lawn on certain days. To extreme examples of limiting total number of gallons used per day.</p>
<p>Sorry if I put you to sleep. I know a five year old would be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Generally, groundwater is present in most places across the Earth's land surface. Unlike the picture in most people's heads of underground rivers and caves, the water is usually trapped in the tiny pore spaces (gaps) between rock particles, or in fractures and cracks in the rock.</p>
<p>Part of my job is telling people where to drill wells to get the water they need. Most of the time, it is possible to get groundwater unless the rock is something extremely impermeable like a mudstone or claystone.  Even these rocks can sometimes have fissures that may contain water.</p>
<p>One interesting relationship you can see on maps is the one between river networks and the potential for groundwater.  On mudstone, drainage is terrible, leading to most water getting whisked off by rivers before it has the chance to make it to an aquifer. The density of the river network is far higher.</p>
<p>On a very permeable rock like the chalk here in the U.K., there are far fewer rivers - most of it soaks into the ground and ends up in the chalk aquifer before rivers can form. It's possible to drill wells in the chalk that yield millions of gallons of clean water a day.</p>
<p>Here's a link to an old log of such a well dug in the chalk. It's made of several boreholes, a dug well and a connecting tunnel that they had to lower people down to dig:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wells work by accessing aquifers. Aquifers are not underground lakes, pockets of water, or underground streams. None of those actually exist. Instead, aquifers are usually made of loose or consolidated sand or gravel. There are small spaces (pores) between the grains, like in a box filled with marbles, and water fills these gaps. The pores are connected, which allows the water to flow to areas of lower pressure. Wells are basically holes in the ground, so water flows into them to fill that hole.</p>
<p>How deep you have to drill a well varies by aquifer. To give an idea of how much they can vary, u/Juanfartez said that the wells in San Antonio were about 640 feet deep, but in the town where I am in western Minnesota, the wells are usually about 80 feet, and the aquifer itself starts at about 20 feet below the surface. </p>
<p>Not all places will have aquifers, because not all types of rock store water and allow it to flow. Clay, for example, stores water pretty well, but it doesn't allow it to flow. You can see this by squeezing a handful of wet clay. Igneous and metamorphic rocks like granite or marble only allow water to flow through fractures in the rock. So while they can be aquifers, they generally aren't very good because they can't hold much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>None of these are really eli5. So, have you ever been to the beach? When the waves go out, there's this smooth dark sand left behind. If you step on that you can see the water get squeezed out of the sand as you put pressure on that spot with your foot. Underground there's a lot of stuff that holds water just like the sand. If you reach the sand with a pump you can suck water out of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
