<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kraft-Macaroni-Cheese-Ounce-Boxes/dp/B00NGJSCMK?th=1" target="_blank">Cheap to manufacture/Cheap to buy</a> - At $0.12/ounce, you're essentially looking at ~$0.03/ounce manufacturing cost (possibly less), which is basically like printing money for Kraft or any other manufacturer. A box of Kraft Mac N Cheese goes for about $1.30 at Dollar General, and there are 3 servings per box. If you eat that 3 times a day you're only spending $1.30/day on food. Talk about a poor college kid's dream. These two aspects are the root cause of Mac N Cheese being everywhere in the US. It's cheap to mass produce, so supply is through the roof. The next few points explain the demand piece. </li>

<p><a href="http://www.ar15.com/forums/t_10_17/624139_Real_shelf_life_of_Kraft_Macaroni_and_Cheese_.html" target="_blank">Practically impervious to spoilage</a> - Shelf life discussions that I've read show Kraft lasting up to 5 years after expiration date. For grocers, expiration dates are about a year out from when they arrive to stores. This means that it's cheaper to buy in bulk and keep massive inventories of the stuff, and slowly sell over the year. For consumers, it's cheap to buy in bulk and just eat whenever. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/diet-fitness/information/comfort-food-guilty-pleasure2.htm" target="_blank">Salty, Fatty, Starchy, Sugary</a> - A box of Mac N Cheese has salt, fat, starch and sugar, which are the 4 main drivers of food cravings. Simply put, Mac N Cheese is delicious, and scientifically manufactured to be something that children crave. </p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://nerdist.com/star-wars-kraft-macaroni-and-cheese-gets-nostalgic-in-new-ad/" target="_blank">Nostalgic</a> - Because of the reasons above, people associate Mac N Cheese with their childhood. This means it remains a staple <em>through generations</em>. This is perhaps the most powerful factor in the perpetuation of its popularity. </li>
</ol>
<p>*<strong><em>Edit</em></strong>  - Just a note to those commenting that this doesn't necessarily explain why it's an American phenomenon. There are a ton of sociological and economic issues involved here, the most important of which is post-WWII expansion and the baby boom. </p>
<p>Through the 50s and 60s, prosperity in the home was measured by having a well-stocked pantry. Largely due to lean years of their youth, Americans in the 50s prided themselves on having a big, full pantry. As a result, the average american home bought lots of non-perishables (soup, spam, canned meats, dry goods, etc), and loved keeping their pantries stocked. Mac N Cheese was one of these non-perishables, and its popularity in the 40s, 50s, and 60s would make it a staple for generations to come. </p>
<p>That and marketing. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like American Ramen. You can put basically whatever you want in it. It's cheap. I, for instance made pulled pork last week. So I added my pulled pork with onion, sweet peppers and mushroom. Then threw in a little cheddar and Greek yoghurt (makes it creamy). It's molto bene, I look forward to lunch</p>
<p>Edit: I'd like to report that I'm about to get to the office and partake in macaroni ecstasy. My knees are weak and arms spaghetti/macaroni</p>
<p>Edit 2: it is done. There's a mixture of satisfaction and shame. It was worth it. The gods have been sated</p>
<p>Edit 3: someone asked for recipe. Pulled pork tenderloin. Hit it in the smoker for about an hour(optional, unless you're Texan, apparently) then 10 hours in the crockpot with cumin paprika oregano and a touch of Worcestershire. Made regular Mac and cheese out of a box (actually 3 boxes, this is a week of lunch). Before the pasta goes back in the pan, saute a medium red onion, 2 bell peppers worth of whatever sweet peppers you like  (I like the jalapeno size sweets that come in a bag, chopped into rings), 1 of the small square containers of mushrooms (sliced). Saute that veg, toss in the pulled pork to warm it up, get it all happy. Add in the pasta and start adding the cheese you like. If you like the box stuff, use it. Melting cheeses like cheddar, little mozz, little gouda couldn't hurt. I used the cheese in the box and then about half a cup of white cheddar extra, because fuck you, that's why. After that starts to melt, add in yoghurt until it gets to your preferred creamyness  (no homo. Or all homo, I don't judge, and who gives a shit). Cover it with hot sauce. Or don't. I'm not your father and I assume you live in a free country. Shove it in your filthy maw until you hate yourself. I'm American, it's what we do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But make it from scratch with sharp cheddar, dry mustard and top with paprika and breadcrumbs and bake and it's the shit. The good home cooked from scratch Mac n cheese is good shit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of reasons for this. It was first popularized by Thomas Jefferson, who apparently loved the pasta and cheese dishes he encountered in France and Italy when he traveled. He even went so far as to buy a pasta-making machine, which apparently didn't work because the ambassador who bought it didn't know anything about pasta. Then Jefferson just imported it and European cheese. He served Macaroni and Cheese at dinner parties, much to the chagrin of the attendees, who were not used to such food at the time.</p>
<p>In the 1800s, Macaroni and Cheese was considered a relatively fancy dish and was basically a butter-cheese-pasta casserole. By the end of the century, pasta had become more common, and it was no longer a fancy dish.</p>
<p>It really hit its stride in American (and Canadian) culture as a part of the processed food revolution driven by the World Wars and industrialization of supply lines. Processed cheese was patented in 1916 by Kraft, and its long shelf life and cheap production made it an ideal product for the Depression and WWII rationing. It was remarkably cheap (you could get multiple servings on a single ration ticket) and filling and didn't require any meat (expensive and difficult to get during rationing). Women were also entering the workforce in response to labor shortages, and Mac N Cheese was easy and quick to make.</p>
<p>This boom exposed a huge number of families to Mac N Cheese, and it continued to grow as parents had fond memories of being able to afford a dinner that tasted and felt indulgent, even if it was very inexpensive. It grew from there, and the latest wave of interest has been fueled by the growing artisanal food movement, in which families that have climbed the class ladder can afford more expensive fresh ingredients and are reexploring the original European roots of the dish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
