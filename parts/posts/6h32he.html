		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good responses here, and for the most part bang on.  I've been involved with the testing and certification of aircraft at my airlinel to allow the use of onboard portable electronic devices, and in some cases onboard transmitting portable electronic devices.  In the industry, these are known by the acronym PED or TPED.  </p>
<p>The rules vary from country to country, but in Canada, before an airline can allow the use of PED or TPED during critical phases of flight, they have to demonstrate that they will not interfere with the onboard aircraft systems.  </p>
<p>This is commonly accomplished by blasting large amounts of RF inside the aircraft, in various locations throughout the cabin, of varrying frequency and transmitting power.  I'll admit, I'm not an engineer, so the details of this test are a little lost on me.  Anyway, while the RF storm is being conducted inside the aircraft, we need to test all of the aircraft systems and every possible combination of RF interference.  This is done by actually powering up the aircraft, all electrical systems and all the engines.  To test our aircraft took two 12 hour days of sitting in the airplane with the engines running and not going anywhere. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, I was quite surprised with the results.  Our aircraft passed most of the tests, but failed a couple as well.  The RF radiation was causing the door proximity (PROX) sensors to fail on the forward cargo door, causing warnings in the cockpit that the door was open, when in actuality it was not.  As you can imagine, this wouldn't be a good thing to happen in flight.  </p>
<p>Long story short, after completion of this testing we can use non-transmitting PEDs in all phases of flight, and we can use Wi-Fi in non critical phases plof flight, but it's the cellphone frequencies that caused our issues so we are not allowed to have cellphones active on cell networks during any phases of flight ( from cabin door close at the start to cabin door open at the end.)</p>
<p>Modern aircraft are built with this in mind, and all of this testing is normally completed by the manufacturer during the design and development phases.  For older aircraft, this process that I outlined above needs to be completed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of misconceptions every time this subject is brought up. </p>
<p>EMI, Electromagnetic Interference, is a serious consideration in aircraft design and operation, and has been for decades.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this NASA report from 1995, <a href="https://see.msfc.nasa.gov/sites/see.msfc.nasa.gov/files/rp-1374.pdf" target="_blank">PDF here</a>, which details several incidents, aviation and otherwise. Probably one of the most famous is the series of five UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters that crashed between 1981 to 1987. The accidents were a mystery for some time, but it was later confirmed that they were caused by signals from radio tower which caused the stabilator to go to a full down position, which put the helicopter in a dive. These accidents earned the UH-60 the nickname &quot;lawn dart&quot; at the time. </p>
<p>IIRC in the 1990s it was quite common for the crew to instruct passengers to turn off all electronic devices for take off and landing. This is because it was not uncommon for devices to cause things like radio static or in severe cases minor interference with navigation.</p>
<p>To be clear, I'm not sure that consumer grade electronics ever posed a deadly threat to commercial aircraft. However, EMI shielding and testing was not nearly as thorough back then as it is now. Part of the reason for that is small electronic devices were not ubiquitous back then. Asking people to simply turn off an electronic device during take off and landing (critical phases of flight for navigation and radio communication) was not a big deal to people back then. It was easier for the FAA to just require that they be turned off, than to require extensive (and expensive) testing. </p>
<p>Additionally, I'm not aware of any credible sources which say that the reasoning was that passengers would pay more attention in the event of an emergency. It was certainly my personal experience that back then passengers stuck their noses in magazines and books as much as they do their cell phones and laptops now. If that was ever an official reason it was almost certainly not very effective.</p>
<p><strong>The FAA's decision a few years ago to officially allow electronic devices at all phases of flight was, as far as I can tell, for two reasons: better understanding of the risks because of increased testing, and the fact that we all knew people were doing it anyway.</strong> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The TL;DR is that the FAA used to have rules forbidding non-approved devices. They loosened these because they realized it was dumb. </p>
<p>Interfering with the planes electronics? Sure, its possible. But RF interference isn't a thing due to FCC certification, and it would have to be an <em>extremely</em> noisy device to cause slight interference with gauges. My wife has made phone calls when we've been up flying general aviation, and have had no issues aside from the occasional &quot;GSM Buzz&quot; in the headset - same as you'd get with speakers and a GSM phone.</p>
<p>Shielding? Nope, not really. Most of the electronics nowadays are digital (which helps), and shielded wires... but no more shielded than the cable you use to charge your phone. And they're not &quot;hardened&quot; by any means (unless we're talking military, which is a separate point entirely). The GA stuff I fly personally? Lol... and zero issues with a 1975 airplane (and probably 1990s electronics...)</p>
<p>Network congestion on the ground? Likely not - you're more likely to just lose signal and get kicked by the cell system, and not the FAAs problem. Remember, the FAA makes rules for <em>airplanes</em> not <em>cell phones</em>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Airline pilot and flight instructor here. The laws (regulations) still forbid the pilot(s) from using unapproved electronics during typical flight and on specific types of instrument approaches (CATII AND III). As for consumer grade electronics, they would interfere with the instruments back when the regulations were written. Here's the &quot;ELI5&quot; part: pilots used to navigate with very sensitive electronics called automated direction finders (ADFs). These were essential very sensitive devices that operated on AM radio waves and would tell you the difference in angular deflection between the nose of the aircraft and where the radio beacon was. These radio stations known as Non-Directional Beacons (NDBs) were effectively AM radio stations that broadcasted specific morse code identifiers that would let you know that you had the correct station. The ADF however, was sensitive enough that a handheld radio or other strong electromagnetic fields generated by any decent sized and poorly shielded electronics in the cockpit could deflect the bearing pointer on the ADF and cause loss of navigation fidelity in the instrument. In fact, whenever an aircraft would fly near lightning (within 30nm of a cell and honestly far too often) the ADF would deflect to point directly at the lightning strike (which emits all radio wavelengths simultaneously). So the rules were created to prevent erroneous readings from causing airplanes to navigate poorly and geneally into each other or the planet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ironically, I have a degree in computer engineering with a specialty in radio signals, but I'm not going to weigh in on that aspect of the issue because I don't know enough about avionics to pretend to be an expert.</p>
<p>However, there's an important concept in capital-R Risk (the practice of identifying and mitigating risk for corporations) which essentially boils down to &quot;if the cost of an incident is incredibly high and the cost of mitigation is incredibly low, you pretty much have to do the mitigation.&quot;</p>
<p>It costs the airlines almost nothing to enforce the &quot;turn off your electronics&quot; rule on each flight. The flight attendants don't make more money for enforcing it, and passengers don't have the option to change to another airline because all airlines enforce it. Thus, cost is approximately zero.</p>
<p>However, one crash in which the airline is found to be at fault - a fairly likely scenario if the crash was caused by some avionics fault induced by a heretofore unknown mechanism of electromagnetic interference from a personal device - could cost the airline hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. </p>
<p>Thus, you find yourself in a situation where the rate of risk is impossible to measure (we don't know of specific ways that avionics could fail, so we can say low but not precisely how low) but the cost of an incident is definitely extremely, extremely high, and the cost to mitigate the risk is extremely low, approaching zero. Airlines are going to take that deal.</p>
<p>Maximum ELI5 answer/TL;DR: If you could eliminate a small risk of suddenly dying by scratching your cheek once a day, you'd scratch your cheek once a day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
