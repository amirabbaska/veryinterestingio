		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In most science fiction I've seen nebulas are like storm clouds with constant ion storms. How accurate is this? Would being inside a nebula look like you're inside a storm cloud and would a ship be able to go through it or would their systems be irreparably damaged and the ship become stranded there?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks to everyone who answered. Better than public education any day.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nebulae are really diffuse clouds of gas, so there wouldn't be much effect at all. It's kind of like how a flight path through the &quot;asteroid belt&quot; has negligible chance of crashing into asteroids, unlike what you see in the movies.</p>
<p>From: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although denser than the space surrounding them, most nebulae are far less dense than any vacuum created on Earth – a nebular cloud the size of the Earth would have a total mass of only a few kilograms. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The inside of a nebula would not look that much different from what we see when we look out at space. In the visible spectrum is may look like a faint haze or darkening of the stars. </p>
<p>This is because nubulae are extremely diffuse. From a distance they only look thick and cloud like because we are seeing structures that are light years in thickness. Also, in most of the pictures you see, you are looking at combination of radio, infrared, visible and in extreme cases (near a SNR) X-ray emission from scattered light or accelerated charged particles. These images are combined to highlight the nebula. Often you can see right through them in some wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>As for ship flying through it, it would see an increased flux (flux is the rate of something hitting a surface) of low energy particles. Kinda like an extra strong solar wind. So a ship would probably be just fine. If a planet was in there like earth with a nice magnetic field and atmosphere, there would be more and brighter Aurora assuming the host stars‘ solar wind didn’t blow all the nebula‘s particles far from the planet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>nebulas on earth would be considered high grade vacuum. Air has a density of around 10^(19) particles per cubic centimeter. Even planetary nebulae only reach up to about 10^(4) particles per cubic centimeter. (according to wikipedia which cites the book
<em>Astrophysics of gaseous nebulae and active galactic nuclei</em>)
I have seen higher densities being cited as well, e.g. in the horse head nebula with particle densiteis up to 10^5 particles per cubic centimeter.  (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0501536" target="_blank">source</a>)
If you were inside a nebula, locally you wouldn't notice much. On short distances not much would change. However you also wouldn't be able to see very much from the outside, since on large distances too much light is absorbed.  </p>
<p>In the end this is another case where sci-fi (especially movies) often portaits reality incorrectly for dramatic gain.</p>
<p>However if your spaceship would be very very fast, e.g. if it was travelling with a significant fraction of the speed of light with respect to the nebula. Then the particles could potentially start to damage the spacecraft. This is because the small particles could actually gain so much kinetic energy with respect to the ship that they would start to inflict some damage, at least on a molecular level. You wouldn't be able to see very much of it though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't let these comments make your idea of space seem mundane in reality.  The formation of a gas giant protoplanet could very much look like what sci-fi depicts of a nebula.  While being larger (as depicted) and even more crazy. </p>
<p>While the rings of Saturn (and even more extreme planetary rings) would look similar to the asteroid field depicted in Star Wars or even more dense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While I understand that a nebula seen from a far looks a lot denser than it is, what about temperature? I understand that nebula are often places of star formation and that average temperature can be quite high. Seems hard to believe the average temperature could be very high if diffuse matter is actually not very dense at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
