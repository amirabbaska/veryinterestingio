		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dentist here.  There are several different reasons mouth breathing can be detrimental.  I'll just list a few, and then answer any specific questions in response.</p>
<p>When your mouth is constantly open and/or exposed to air flow, it dries out your saliva - which is the mouth's way of cleaning itself.  With poor salivary flow comes an increase in bacteria, which can cause significant damage to teeth and gums.  This damage can be seen as cavities, decalcified tooth enamel, brittle teeth, swollen or puffy gums, and bad breath just to name a few.  Dry mouth can also be caused by certain syndromes and medications.</p>
<p>Another concern for mouth breathers is the excessive eruption of back teeth.  Like many other animals, human teeth will erupt or grow outwards away from the bone until the teeth run into something else - usually another tooth, but sometimes soft tissue like gums.  As a mouth breather, your teeth spend less time touching, and more time erupting.  Normally, this slow but steady eruption would compensate for tooth wear and other changes in your bite, but as a mouth breather your teeth will erupt excessively.  This could cause an open bite (where the front teeth do not touch while the back teeth do), excessive vertical growth of the lower jaw, constriction of the nasal passage and sinuses, a longer face appearance, poorer breathing due to lateral constriction of the airway, and several other anatomical changes.  The worst part about these changes is that each one of them typically leads to poorer nasal breathing and more mouth breathing, which in turn leads to poorer nasal breathing and less mouth breathing.  It's a vicious cycle that can impede everyday life, lead to poorer sleep quality, sleep apnea, significant dental issues, and generally a poorer quality of life.</p>
<p>Some people are born with perfect dental and facial anatomy, and some are cursed with really bad anatomy.  Unfortunately, there are very few therapies besides surgery available at this time for those with less than ideal anatomy.  Orthodontics may help, some medications can dilate nasal passage ways and increase nasal breathing, and there is a growing field in myofacial therapy aimed at correcting these issues non-surgically.  </p>
<p>The good news is that the surgeries available are getting better and better, and the medical and dental fields are beginning to take these issues much more seriously.  It has led to some significant changes in the ways we view and treat compromised or less than ideal airways, and the factors that lead to them.</p>
<p>If you suffer from poor nasal breathing, research dentists or ENTs in your area, and find someone who specializes in sleep and airway disturbances.  It could literally be life changing.</p>
<p>Good luck OP!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mouth breathing isn't the best for your health because the nose is designed to &quot;treat&quot; incoming air in order to heat it and filter out particles from reaching your lungs. If you just suck it in through your mouth you don't get that. It isn't a big issue normally but in some specific cases it can be bad.</p>
<p>The other side of things is that mouth-breathing is looked down upon socially. There are other phrases such as &quot;slack-jawed idiot&quot; or &quot;drooling moron&quot;. This likely stems from the practice of mentally handicapped people to leave their mouths to flop open, perhaps while staring blankly into the distance or when fully mentally occupied. Precisely why this control escapes them I am unsure; it might simply be that they don't recognize the social importance of such body language rather than because their mental resources are unable to keep up with such secondary concerns.</p>
<p>In any case the perception exists that those who do not control their mouths are simpletons, so if you breath through your mouth you run the risk of picking up such associations. Of course we can't speak about your particular medical situation but if you need your jaw to be broken it seems likely you already run the risk of abnormal physical appearance leading to assumptions about mental ability, so avoiding the commonly recognized signs is even more important.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an orthodontist, so I can give some insight to the dentofacial orthopedic side of it.</p>
<p>Your maxilla (upper jaw) develops by equilibrium forces between the tongue and the cheeks. If there's an shift in that equilibrium the maxillary development suffers, and this imbalance can occur from mouth breathing and other oral habits (thumb/finger sucking, tongue thrusting, pacifiers, lip biting, low tongue posture, etc.).</p>
<p>When you mouth breath, you're taking the tongue from its normal superior (upper) posture and bringing it inferior (lower). Without the tongue helping to shape the maxilla the cheeks squeeze it inwards. Narrow maxillas usually result in posterior crossbites (back upper teeth sit towards the tongue side of the lower teeth). If it is asymmetric in constriction, the lower jaw gets forced to one side and that shift can alter your TMJ and mandibular (lower jaw) development. People with these crossbites are usually recommended palate expanders if they are age/development time appropriate. If you catch these crossbites too late in the game, surgical expansion is required to obtain a normal bite again. Also, keep in mind the asymmetric lower jaw development that would occur if a narrow maxilla forces a mandible to shift to one side as it's growing.</p>
<p>From the dental side of things, dry mouth will result in inflamed gums and reduced saliva. Saliva is a natural antibacterial that helps to reduce decay by diluting sugars and &quot;attacking&quot; cavity creating bacteria (IT ONLY HELPS AND PROPER ORAL HYGIENE IS STILL NECESSARY). Inflamed gums are bad, because it creates stress on the soft tissues. Recession and bone loss can result from significant or prolonged inflammation. </p>
<p>In your case, it sounds like it's too late to attempt simple Rapid Palatal Expansion. So, you need Surgically Assisted Rapid Palatal Expansion. This is because your maxilla has fused at the maxillary midline suture (happens when we complete jaw growth).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
