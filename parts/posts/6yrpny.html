		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's often forgotten what level of risk was considered acceptable during the space race. A 10% loss rate was seen as tolerable back then. NASA was ok with losing every tenth mission. The Apollo Astronauts could not get life insurance because they were operating under such high risks (cool snippet: Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins signed a bunch of commemorative postcards before the Apollo 11 launch, as a kind of alternative life insurance. If they didn't come back, the postcards would be worth a ton of money, and their families could sell them).</p>
<p>Also, space flight isn't particularly hard, but it is very expensive. We know how to do it, we could put together a Mars mission tomorrow if we had to, but it's not cheap. It wasn't cheap back inthe 60's and 70's either, but it was considered a good investment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the math your computer does to run Call of Duty could be solved with an Abacus and a lot of patience. There were professional mathematicians titled Calculators who did loads of math on pencil and paper to figure out flight trajectories and stuff that today we have complex programs that can do it in real time.</p>
<p>Fun fact, many early maneuvers in space were eyeballed by the astronauts because they didn't have time to do the math.</p>
<p>Getting into space may take less time to do mathwise, but rockets are still engineering marvels and take a load of work to make and maintain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several reasons, one of which is that the TI84, the standard high school calculator, probably has more computing power than the Apollo 11 space craft did. That is a fact that is pretty much set in stone. However, the Apollo 11 space craft had a specially designed computer that was made to only calculate orbital mechanics and such. This allowed for the Apollo 11 computer to have a far superior ability to calculate the needed numbers and adjustments. An example of this optimization used in everyday life is finding the area under the parabola. Draw a rectangle where one corner is on the highest or lowest point of the curve, and the opposite corner is somewhere on the curve; the area of the parabola in the rectangle will always be 2/3 the area of the rectangle created (people still in high school, don't cheat by using this fact, learn your integrals). It is because that the computer is specifically designed and programed to only deal with orbital mechanics and space ship stuff is why it was so underpowered. However, an everyday calculator's &gt;general&lt; computing power is too inferior to even point the rocket in the correct direction.</p>
<p>Fun fact, to get to the moon by eyeball, get into low earth orbit, then look for the moon rise, when you see it, fly towards it for a bit and u will intercept it.</p>
<p>On another note, getting into space is not hard, what's difficult is getting into space without using up the entirety of the worlds GDP. </p>

<p>edit. Grammar.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Answering like you were actually five: Because the difficulty of space flight isn't based on computer power, but on the challenge of building and affording the actual thing that flies.</p>
<p>Imagine trying to hand build your own clock, out of bits you have at home say. Imagine how well it would work. Now imagine how well it would work if you also ran as fast as you can down the street, shaking your hand built clock as hard as you could.  </p>
<p>Now imagine you're actively running at 18,000 miles, shaking it unbelievably hard, and if one part fails the very thing that got you going that fast blows everything into tiny pieces.  </p>
<p>That's the real problem, not controlling where the nose points. You could do that by hand. The early astronauts often had too as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
