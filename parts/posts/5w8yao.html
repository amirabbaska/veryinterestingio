		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the universe reached heat death (assuming something like the big rip didn't happen first), would quantum tunneling still occur? If so, would the universe be expected to eventually randomly reach a sufficiently low energy state that stars, galaxies, and planets could reform? I assume the odds of this happening are incredibly low, but if the universe is going to sit around in heat death forever wouldn't the probability approach 1?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The probability for a fluctuation (quantum or otherwise) that decreases entropy is on the order of exp(- ΔS / k_B), where ΔS is the entropy variation and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. This is unimaginably small even for very little entropy variations. Let me make a little example:</p>
<p>Trouton's rule tells you the entropy of vaporization of most fluids is about 86 J/K per mole at standard pressure. So the vaporization of a mole of water (~18 ml) at standard pressure involves an entropy increase of ΔS ~ 86 J/K = 6.2 * 10^(24) k_B. This means the probability of just 18 ml of water spontaneously condensing back into liquid is of the order of exp(-10^(24)). </p>
<p>That's about zero point, about 10^(23) zeroes, then one. The time you need to wait for this to happen through fluctuations is equally huge. As a comparison, the time it takes for even the largest black holes to evaporate and heat death to be truly reached is incredibly smaller than this.</p>
<p>Now there is no certainty on whether the Universe will last <em>forever</em> forever. This amount of time is so large that hoping we can extrapolating the physics we know is ridiculous. But I mean, if you do, and you also assume no big crunch (so negative spatial curvature) then sure, the total probability is 1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
