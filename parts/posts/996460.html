		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, it seems like the prevalence of cancer today is relatively high in developed countries. I don't have any figures but historically I'm not aware of it being a leading cause of death, whereas 3 of the top 10 causes of death in high income countries are related to cancer, according to the WHO.  Is cancer actually becoming more common in developed societies due to pesticides, processed foods, air pollution, sedentary lifestyles etc. or are we simply eliminating other diseases which historically would have killed people at a younger age, and because people are living longer they are more likely to develop cancer over time? I'm not sure it's possible to answer this (unsure how reliable historical data relating to cause of death are, and also not sure how it would be possible to assess whether the child of a medieval peasant would have developed cancer later in life had they not died of childhood diseases), but if anyone has any insight into this I'd be really grateful!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So it depends. Some cancers do have environmental components such as, as you mentioned, exposure to pesticides. The biggest factor though is increase in life span and improvement of healthcare and sanitation. Prior to the 19th/20th century in the West, people would more frequently have died of infectious disease. But now we have water treatment and closed sewers keeping infections like cholera at bay, and vaccination and public health programs preventing or treating infectious diseases. So there are now fewer deaths from those causes. Improvements in health over all now mean spoke are living into their 70s and 80s, whereas 60 would have been quite average for much of human history (bear in mind life expectancy models take infant and maternal mortality and deaths from accidents and disease into account). The longer someone lives, the more likely they are to develop cancer (more time for mutations to accumulate). Some cancers are also slow growing, so something like prostate cancer may have never been noticed by the peasant dying at 60, but would be noticed by the modern man living until 75. The biggest thing I can think of at least is that people are living longer and just not dying from other diseases that they used to. But there’s no reason why a peasant boy from the 16th century wouldn’t develop cancer. It’s just more likely something else would kill him first. </p>
<p>But that being said, cancer comes up in medical texts. Breast cancer is described by the ancient Greeks, Persians, and Indians. If you’re into medical literature, “The Emperor Of All Maladies” discusses this a great deal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, it's a myth that cancer was never a &quot;leading cause of death&quot; in pre-modern times or in underdeveloped countries. The ancient Egyptians described cancer in 3000 BC, and cancerous growths have been found on mummies. Hippocrates coined the term &quot;carcinoma&quot; and &quot;carcinos&quot;, later translated into the Latin &quot;cancer&quot;. Both the Greeks and Romans kept extensive medical texts about <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.25553" target="_blank">the diagnosis and treatment of cancer</a>, all of which stated that there was no treatment for advanced cancers. There's an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.25553" target="_blank">entire field of medical history</a> devoted to ancient physicians' understanding of cancer.</p>
<p>That said, in the pre-antibiotic era, most people died of infectious disease, traumatic injury, or childbirth. So cancer was not THE top cause of death, but it was definitely a significant cause of death. If a medieval peasant was lucky enough to live to a ripe old age, he or she would have been at risk of developing many of the same cancers that we have in the modern day.</p>
<p>The exact risk level of each cancer would depend upon the epidemiology and risk factors of that cancer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aad.org/media/stats/conditions/skin-cancer" target="_blank">Skin cancer has always been the most common cancer</a> in humans, and it's indisputable that pre-modern humans spent more time in direct sunlight than we do today. An old medieval peasant, toiling in the fields for decades, would have been at very high risk for both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers.</p>
<p>Cervical cancers are largely preventable by vaccination, screening, and treatment of pre-cancerous lesions. For this reason, <a href="http://globocan.iarc.fr/old/FactSheets/cancers/cervix-new.asp" target="_blank">cervical cancer incidence</a> varies by nearly 10-fold between the most-developed countries and the least-developed countries. Up until the 1940s, [cervical cancer was one of the major causes of death in the US]( <a href="https://report.nih.gov/nihfactsheets/viewfactsheet.aspx?csid=76" target="_blank">https://report.nih.gov/nihfactsheets/viewfactsheet.aspx?csid=76</a>). A medieval village would have a very high rate of cervical cancer mortality. It would just be outweighed by the even higher rate of childbirth mortality and infectious-disease mortality.</p>
<p>Some other cancers are clearly lifestyle dependent. The overwhelming majority of lung cancers are caused by smoking, so a medieval European village would have extremely low rates of lung cancers. A Native American village would still have lung cancer though. The same could be said for other smoking-related cancers such as head and neck, esophageal, and bladder.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/obesity/obesity-fact-sheet" target="_blank">Many cancers are strongly linked to obesity</a>, the most common of which are breast, colorectal, and uterine. Since obesity is a disease of modernity, and medieval peasants would likely be underweight, they would have a decreased risk of obesity-induced cancers.</p>
<p>Colorectal cancer actually falls into an interesting category, because it can be caused by a modern lifestyle but it can also be prevented by modern medical care. This is reflected by the paradoxical trends of colorectal cancer <a href="https://www.aafp.org/news/health-of-the-public/20170307colorectalcarates.html" target="_blank">decreasing over time in older patients and increasing over time in younger patients</a>. This is because most people younger than 50 haven’t had colon cancer screening, so their cancer incidence reflects the effects of obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and overly-processed diet… while most people older than 50 are actively screened for colon cancer. Screening compliance has improved over time in most developed countries, and the screening exams themselves have improved with new technology such as fecal DNA testing and CT colonography. A medieval peasant would have an extremely low risk of developing colon cancer at a young age, but that risk would increase significantly if they somehow lived to be 65+.</p>
<p>Some liver, intestinal and urogenital cancers are caused by [parasitic infections]( <a href="http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis" target="_blank">http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis</a>). These are exceedingly rare in the developed world, but are a common cause of death in Africa. A European medieval village would not be at risk because the parasites only live in tropical areas, but an African medieval village would be at major risk for parasite-related cancers.</p>
<p>When people talk about the increasing cancer incidence in the present day, the concept of overdiagnosis usually enters at some point. Overdiagnosis is controversial because it is extremely difficult to measure accurately; two researchers using different statistical techniques on the same data set can calculate very different numbers for overdiagnosis.</p>
<p>However, it is certainly true that a large number of people die <em>with</em> cancer instead of dying <em>of</em> cancer. If we did autopsies on a whole bunch of 80- and 90-year-olds who died of heart attacks and strokes, we would probably find a lot of prostate cancers, kidney cancers, breast cancers, colon cancers and skin cancers that never caused any symptoms over the patient's natural lifespan.</p>
<p>If any of those cancers get diagnosed while the patient is still alive, by definition you're wasting time and money because they would never have affected the patient in the first place.</p>
<p>The problem with overdiagnosis is that no one can forsee the future. If you do manage to find an incidental kidney cancer in a 88 year old patient, no one can tell you if that patient is going to &quot;naturally die of something else&quot; next year and never be affected by their cancer, or if that patient could live to be 100 but you have to cure their cancer first.</p>
<p>In most of the cancer screening literature, overdiagnosis is primarily a concern for patients 65 and older. It's the reason why some diagnostic screening guidelines often tell you to stop doing tests after a certain age - whether it is 65 or 75 or 77 or 80 or &quot;when patient's overall health deteriorates&quot;.</p>
<p>If a medieval peasant was really lucky and lived to be 80, they might benefit very slightly from not having unnecessary CT scans and other tests, decreasing the chances that they would be diagnosed with a harmless cancer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary cause of cancer is TIME. <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6331/1266" target="_blank"><a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6331/1266" target="_blank">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6331/1266</a></a> </p>
<p>6% of cancer is genetic, 29% is lifestyle, 65% is chance. </p>
<p>To explain why, just take the fertilized egg you began as, that cell divided and divided. Every time it divided the end caps of the chromosomes, grew shorter. These end caps are called telomeres. After a while the cells began to activate the hTERT gene or ALT mechanism, both of which can lengthen telomeres. Or else the cells would stop dividing after about 50-70 cell divisions, because the telomeres would be too short for successful cell division. </p>
<p>When you are an adult, and cell division mostly stops, the hTERT gene and ALT mechanism is turned off in most cells. All cells except where you still need large amounts of cell division (skin, stomach lining, and a few other places). </p>
<p>What then happens over time is that some of your healthy cells have their mechanism for cell-division activated by a random chemical accident. These cells then divide and become numerous, but most of these cells lack the subsequent chemical accident which also activates either the hTERT gene or the ALT mechanism. So they eventually run out of steam. These are benign tumors. </p>
<p>A small portion of the benign cancer cells, also has the chemical accident which activates the hTERT gene or ALT mechanism. These cells then divide unhindered forever until the patient dies. Because of various anti-cancer mechanisms inside the cells, cancer cells divide slower than normal cells, and are generally slower to recover from damage. That is why cancer drugs work, we give poison in non-lethal doses many times over several weeks, and because normal healthy cells recover faster, the cancer cell numbers get culled down. Eventually the patient has fewer cancer cells than what we can detect. Which is about 1 billion cancer cells or so, remember that we have 37 200 billion cells total.  <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03014460.2013.807878" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03014460.2013.807878" target="_blank">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03014460.2013.807878</a></a></p>
<p>The problem with todays treatments are that some cancer cells always survive. This is a must. Anything so lethal to cells that 100% of cancer cells die, will kill so many normal cells that the patient dies. </p>
<p>These remaining 1 billion cancer cells, are the best survivors against whatever poison you used. And when they divide all the subsequent cancer cells will also be just as good at surviving against that poison. So what happens is that any drug you use successfully once, has an extremely reduced effectiveness the next time that patient has detectable cancer. As a result, few today die from the first few generations of cancer, only after several successful remissions, do patients regularly die from cancer. </p>
<p>When asked why the US tax payer should pay for the human genome project, the scientists responded &quot;it will cure cancer&quot;. And in 2005, the same year the human genome project was completed, a cure for cancer was proposed. This cure is to remove the hTERT gene and ALT mechanism from as many cells as possible. And then forcing apoptosis of senescent cells that suffer from short telomeres as a result. It should be mentioned that forced apoptosis is already what we have to do to cure diabetes and age-related weakening of the immune system, and a few other things besides. So cancer researchers get that one for free. Then to replace the cells lost to apoptosis, and to add cells with plenty of telomere-length, we grow stemcells in the lab that lack the hTERT gene and ALT mechanism, by adding drugs that lengthen telomeres. Then we give patients these stemcells. It should be noted that stem-cells are already a requirement to cure diseases caused by the gradual loss of cells, like parkinson's disease, and the international stem cell corporation (ISCO) is already in human trials to treat parkinson's in this manner. So cancer researchers would get this part of their cure for free also. </p>
<p>Here is the proposed cancer cure in detail: <a href="http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/WILT-FBS.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/WILT-FBS.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/WILT-FBS.pdf</a></a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
