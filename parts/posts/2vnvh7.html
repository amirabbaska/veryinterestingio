<p>There's no question about it: modern biology is built on evolution. From genetics to paleontology, evolution – and particularly evolution by natural selection – has made an indelible mark on our field.</p>
<p>Our experts will be here to discuss the impacts Darwin's work has had on their areas of expertise.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>From Watson and Crick to Darwin</strong></p>
<p>It's easy to forget, in 2015, just how much we know. Every 10 year old in the United States has heard the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest,&quot; and every 13 year old knows that children inherit the genes of their parents after their parents [CENSORED]. Of course organisms fight to survive and pass on their genes, and of course this is based on the transfer of DNA from parent to offspring. Of course, of course, <em>of course</em>. </p>
<p>But Darwin didn't know anything about genes. He didn't know about DNA and he didn't know about genetic inheritance, since the work of Gregor Mendel was then still not known. I think this underscores the level of Darwin's genius -- I find it hard to believe that I would be able to ride a boat around the world, look at some birds (I'm paraphrasing), and come up with, well, <em>natural selection</em>, without already knowing what I know. But, how do we know all that we know about genes and DNA? Is there a direct link between, say, the work of Watson/Crick, arguably the crowning achievement of 20th century biology, and Darwin? </p>
<p>James Watson and Francis Crick, as you may know, made their names by elucidating the structure of DNA -- the famous &quot;double helix.&quot; They, also famously, ended their first paper with a nod towards the double helix easily suggesting a way to copy DNA for the purpose of passing it on. This potential copying mechanism would, of course, facilitate the passing of the fittest DNA. But why were they chasing DNA's structure in the first place? Well, at the time of the double helix papers in 1953, DNA's importance as the genetic material was still relatively new. This was definitively shown by two sets of experiments. In 1944, Oswald Avery and his colleagues showed that if you mixed a deadly form of <em>Streptococcus</em> (similar to the &quot;strep&quot; in &quot;strep throat&quot;) with an innocuous form, the innocuous form all of a sudden became deadly. They got the same result if they mixed the deadly bacteria's DNA with the innocuous bacteria, but not if they mixed protein in. In 1952, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase showed that if you infected cells with viruses carrying either radioactive DNA or radioactive protein, only the radioactive DNA got into the cell. Hershey won a Nobel Prize for this work but not Chase because in the '50s being a female scientist was like being one of those dogs that wears a tutu and stands on its hind legs. </p>
<p>But why did they need to prove that DNA was the genetic material? Well, before Avery and Hershey/Chase, the prevailing logic was that <em>proteins</em> were the basis of genetic inheritance, mostly on the flimsy-in-hindsight logic that proteins are more chemically diverse than DNA, which is chemically repetitive. What <em>did</em> we know before then, then? Considering what I just said, it seems counter-intuitive but the concept of chromosomes, what we know today as structural organizations of DNA, was already known at this point. However, they were only known as mixtures of DNA and protein (which we now know are just histones and other <em>associated</em> proteins that do not carry genetic information). Whether DNA or protein was doing the legwork was unknown, but proteins were favored. </p>
<p>I'll skip over a few other more famous scientists and talk about an under-appreciated one: Theodor Boveri. In the late 19th century he studied the nucleus of parasitic worms (who wouldn't?!) and noted that as cells divided and reproduced, chromosomes in the nucleus vanished and then reappeared in the same orientation -- suggesting that this represented &quot;continuity&quot; in chromosomes, which is precisely the kind of thing Mendelian genetic inheritance would require (though chromosomes and inheritance weren't formally united until Thomas Hunt Morgan in 1915. He...<em>sigh</em>...also won a Nobel Prize. Boveri did not). </p>
<p>From there, skipping over a few more people, it's on to Mendel and his pea plants (and his <a href="http://upress.pitt.edu/htmlSourceFiles/pdfs/9780822959861exr.pdf" target="_blank">maybe fake</a> data) and Darwin. Natural selection, to inheritance, to chromosomes, to DNA, to the double helix. If you are interested in reading further about any of the work or the people who did it mentioned here, the wikipedia articles are a good start but I highly recommend <em>The Eighth Day of Creation</em> by Horace Freeland Judson as mostly a history of 20th century biology. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Field: <strong>Plant Biology</strong></p>
<p>Much of what I study is related to the plant hormone <strong>auxin</strong>.  The distribution of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) throughout plant tissues is largely responsible for controlling plant architecture.  For instance, lateral organs (leaves, branches, flowers, etc.) initiate from the shoot apical meristem at sites of local high auxin concentrations.  Today, we spend a lot of effort understanding how the patterns of auxin distribution are made, mostly focusing on the role of polar auxin transport proteins like <em>PIN</em>-family proteins.</p>
<p>While Darwin predates the work that identified the chemical and the genes responsible for its synthesis, transport, and degradation, a lesson on auxin isn't complete without mentioning Darwin.</p>
<p>Darwin performed the first experiments that identified some sort of communication between the shoot apex and the hypocotyl (seedling stem) of seedlings.</p>

<p>It was a fairly simple experimental setup, but the conclusion is quite powerful.  Using a single light source and various objects to shade plant parts, he gained crucial insight about how plant parts interacted.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bio.miami.edu/dana/pix/auxin_darwin.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.bio.miami.edu/dana/pix/auxin_darwin.jpg</a></p>
<p>He demonstrated that the shoot apex was sensing the light, but the result occurred in the a different tissue.  In other words, plants were not dumb masses of cells that simply propagated, but consist of dynamic tissues that interact.</p>
<p>Later experiments would demonstrate that the signal was a diffusable chemical eventually identified as IAA.  These experiments use the same experimental system; young shoots bending toward light sources.  Of all the complex behavior that plants demonstrate, this simple model yielded insights because it was easy to manipulate and very robust.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
