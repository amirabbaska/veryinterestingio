		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basis for saying alcohol destroys brain cells was from a man applying alcohol directly to brain cells in a Pitre dish. Drinking doesn't actually kill brain cells when people drink, because it's not coming into direct contact in such a high concentration. If it actually acted like that, people would be severely mentally impaired (and permanently so) after just a few visits to the bar, especially the way some do on their 21st birthday.</p>
<p>Also, when people get so drunk that they don't remember what they did, it's not that they can't remember their actions, but rather at that point of drunkenness their brain simply stops recording memories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the idea that alcohol destroys brain cells is entirely a myth propagated by the temperance movement in the early 19th century. Alcohol doesn't destroy brain cells, even though shitfaced drunks might <em>look</em> braindead.</p>
<p>Chronic alcohol abuse may result in Wernickeâ€“Korsakoff syndrome, which is a severe, potentially fatal, neurological condition with symptoms like amnesia, confusion, and confabulation. To the untrained eye, this makes an alcoholic look like a bumbling idiot. It's important to note alcohol itself doesn't cause WKS, rather, it's a deficiency in thiamine (vitamin B^1) which alcoholics frequently encounter as A) their diets are usually very poor and B) alcohol inhibits the body's ability to absorb B vitamins. That's why alcoholics (such as myself) often take vitamin supplements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is classified as a depressant.  If enough alcohol is taken, the effects will be slowed down communication in the brain leading to slurred speech, impaired motor control, and other effects.  Taken in high enough levels it is toxic leading to effects such as black outs, passing out, and potentially even death at high enough levels.</p>
<p>There effects are generally short term, but they can be complicated if someone is a chronic drinker particularly if chronic usage is long term.  There is also the possibility of both psychological and physical addiction which distorts behavior.</p>
<p>So in my opinion, the loss of memory and slowed thinking is a yes since this opinion is based on personal experience and that of a general consensus of anyone that has drank to get drunk.  I'd say the IQ loss is possible but only is those cases where the usage was chronic and long term.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it is true that the neocortex of chronic alcoholics is often atrophied at autopsy, indicating either fewer cells or cells with less volume. Neocortical volume is in fact correlated with IQ.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
