		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Capacitance is the ability for something to store charge. It's described in units if <em>Farads</em>. In engineering, choosing the right capacitance is critical for a very wide range of applications, from energy storage to filtering. It effectively describes the number if electrons (charge is measured in <em>Coulombs</em>) that are present for a given voltage. Crudely, you can think of capacitors as a reservoir of potential energy, like filling a bucket water and hoisting it up. The capacitance describes how much charge the &quot;bucket&quot; holds for a given voltage.</p>
<p>Over-volting a cap (being too generous with voltage from a supply) can damage the dielectric that stores the electrons. Effectively, you push the storage ability to a limit where the chemical breaks down and there's usually a terrific surge of current. Humans are only able to hold a few pF. You can try to probe it crudely by touching the proves of an LC meter.</p>
<p>So what does this mean? It means that when your body has been charged up by the potential energy of tens of thousands of volts (by wearing wool socks and walking around, or by driving your car, etc.) The discharge can occur if you handle a good conductor, especially if it has a path to ground.</p>
<p>You can be personally over-volted, but your fate is similar to burning a capacitor. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Static electricity is a difference in electric potential energy, it is a relative difference of charge carriers. What hurts you is the electric discharge that can result from static electricity. The electric discharge occurs by finding or creating a path to conduct charge carriers to balance out the difference in electric potential. When i say it creates the path, the electric potential has so much energy that it can convert an ordinarily insulating material into a conductor, temporarily. This is what happens when lightning strikes, it forces the air to conduct electricity, and i think it goes without saying that lightning can hurt us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so, not in the conventional sense, mostly because of where the charge is stored and the path it would take off you.  Even if you rubbed your feet on the carpet then touched something a million volts the other way... I doubt the path and amps would deal real damage.  I suppose there is always a threshold though. </p>
<p>I don't consider vdg machines and blasting people with lightning the same as generating a static charge on a person and releasing it in the spirit of the question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The circuit is defined by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-body_model" target="_blank">human body model</a> (HBM).  The highest credible voltage you can charge the body to is ~20,000 volts. But then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_capacitance" target="_blank">equivalent capacitance</a> is about at most a few hundred picofarads. So the stored energy is at most ~0.06 Joules. Hardly enough to do anything damaging to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
