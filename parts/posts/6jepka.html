		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised nobody has mentioned the fact that humans are predisposed to feel more affectionate towards &quot;cute&quot; animals, and feel disgust for those that look alien. <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cuteness" target="_blank">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cuteness</a></p>
<p>Not only have scientists identified the specific facial traits that trigger &quot;caretaking behavior&quot;--big eyes, bulging craniums, retreating chins--dogs and cats have evolved to elicit it. For example, cats purposefully utilize the frequency range of a baby's cry when attempting to solicit care. <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(09)01168-3" target="_blank">http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(09)01168-3</a> And over time dogs have evolved to appear more like human babies over years of humans preferring dogs with paedomorphic facial expressions. <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082686" target="_blank">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082686</a></p>
<p>The examples of preferential treatment by humans for &quot;cute&quot; animals is extensive. You can simply look at the types of animals on the endangered creature list, or which animals get funding for research.  <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/trends-and-biases-in-the-listing-and-recovery-planning-for-threatened-species-an-australian-case-study/DC0D198D842AE8963787297094B8C263" target="_blank">https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/trends-and-biases-in-the-listing-and-recovery-planning-for-threatened-species-an-australian-case-study/DC0D198D842AE8963787297094B8C263</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been shown that this bias isn't learned, but is hard-wired into our brains. The following study found that kids ages 3-6 showed the same preference for animals with infantile features, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019884/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019884/</a></p>
<p>At the same time that dogs and cats have evolved to ingratiate themselves to humans, humans have evolved to utilize dogs and cats to fulfill social and psychological needs. This study of the human-animal bond focuses on neuroendocrine regulation--primarily oxytocin secretions--and the considerable health benefits that result. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4782005/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4782005/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A swedish scientist named Arne Ohman conducted an experiment to understand fear of spiders, snakes, and other things by exposing a subject alongside an electric shock.</p>
<p>What he found was that one shock was enough to create an ongoing fear response for future exposures. This fear persisted for spiders and snakes, but eased over time for other stimuli.</p>
<p>He concluded that there is a hereditary predisposition to fear of spiders and snakes not present for several other common, learned phobias.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't remember the name of the scientist or the study, but I do recall an experiment where very young children and babies are exposed to snakes and spiders etc, they showed no fear and tried to play as they would with any other toy or pet, this shows that fear of this type of stimulus is learnt and not hereditary.</p>

<p>Edit 2:
Thanks to u/Naggins, I'm pretty sure this was the one I was thinking of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Albert_experiment?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Albert_experiment?wprov=sfla1</a> </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A famous study indicates that its how dissimilar to us humans they are. I remember a study which ranked self reported fear of a load of animals and it found those with different eyes to us, more legs or different body shape, fur, slime, speed of movement, unexpected movements and fast movements evoked more fear. </p>
<p>Various combinations came out as scarier or more frightening and I believe spiders, having many more eyes, many more legs, quick and unexpected movements results in significant difference to us, therefore evoked a greater fear reaction in those polled.   </p>
<p>Edit :This got more attention than I expected, the study is by Bennett levy and marteau if I remember correctly, I'll try and find a link to some details about it.  </p>
<p>Edit 2 : lots of good questions for a good discussion but sadly I'm not a psychologist! However we have to remember that multiple other factors will factor into phobias and fear responses, including past experience and learned behaviour, as well as cultural factors too. This studies results are by no means the sole answer to this question!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201702/subconscious-fear-exposure-helps-reduce-phobias-study-finds%3Famp" target="_blank">This article</a> contains details of a study that showed that areas of the brain associated with fear are triggered when we  are shown images of spiders subconsciously(the images were displayed so quickly the subjects weren't consciously aware of seeing them).
It would be interesting to see the results of the same experiment with very young children. </p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>....<em>Peterson and colleagues examined the degree to which specific areas of the brain involved in fear processing and deciding how to respond to a phobic image were activated when someone was consciously aware or unaware of the spider image. Interestingly, they found that even though non-conscious awareness didn't register in a way that could be brought to mind or was cognizant, this type of exposure caused subliminal fear responses to skyrocket.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
