<p>Basically describes that bombing would throw up dust which would cover the poles, which would then melt due to solar heating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the poles are made of mostly frozen carbon dioxide, a.k.a. dry ice. Musk's assumption - which doesn't really bear out if you do the math - is that nuking them would sublimate a good deal of this, putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, thereby enhancing the greenhouse effect enough to make the planet habitable.</p>
<p>No matter how you look at it, though, it's just not enough. There's not enough energy in a single nuke to release enough CO2 to make much of an impact. Even if you used multiple nukes, there's still not enough CO2 total to raise the temperature into a habitable range. Moreover, if you did use that many nukes, you would've just strongly irradiated the largest source of water ice we know of (found under the dry ice), making colonization that much more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: It would sublimate the CO2 at the poles...but really not enough to make it habitable.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: My inbox is getting filled with &quot;But what if we just...&quot; replies. Guys, I hate to be the downer here, but terraforming isn't easy, Musk likes to talk big, and a Hollywood solution of nuking random astronomical targets isn't going to get us there. For those asking to see the math, copy-paste from the calculation I did further down this thread:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CO2 has a latent heat of vaporization of 574 kJ/kg. In other words that's how much energy you need to turn one kilogram of CO2 into gas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A one-megaton nuke (fairly sizable) releases 4.18 x 10^12 kJ of energy.</p>
</li>
<li>Assuming you were perfectly efficient (you won't be), you could sublimate 7.28 x 10^9 kg of CO2 with that energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, consider that the current atmosphere of Mars raises the global temperature of the planet by 5 degrees C due to greenhouse warming. If we doubled the atmosphere, we could probably get another 3-4 degrees C warming since the main CO2 absorption line is already pretty saturated.</p>
<p>So, let's estimate the mass of Mars' current atmosphere - this is one of the very few cases that imperial units are kinda' useful:</p>
<p>Mars' surface pressure is 0.087 psi. In other words, for each square inch of mars, there's a skinny column of atmosphere that weighs exactly 0.087 pounds on Mars (since pounds are planet-dependent).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are a total of 2.2 x 10^17 square inches on Mars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mars' atmosphere weighs a total of 1.95 x 10^16 pounds on Mars.</p>
</li>
<li>For something to weighs 1 pound on Mars, to must be 1.19 kg. So the total mass of Mars' atmosphere is 2.33 x 10^16 kg.</li>
</ul>
<p>To recap: the total mass of Mars' atmosphere is 23 trillion tons. One big nuke, perfectly focused to sublimating dry ice, would release 7 million more tons of atmosphere. That's...tiny, by comparison, and would essentially have no affect on the global temperature.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR, Part 2</strong>: You'd need 3 million perfectly efficient big nukes just to double the atmosphere's thickness (assuming there's even that much frozen CO2 at the poles, which is debated). That doubling might raise the global temperature 3-4 degrees.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
