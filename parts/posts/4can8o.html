		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for a veterinary ophthalmologist. We see small animals, mostly dogs and cats. Not only does every species have different eye issues, but it can even vary by breed. If you call me and say that you have a certain breed that is a certain age I can usually guess what is wrong with your pet just by discussing the symptoms. Dogs don't have a macula, so they can't get macular degeneration.  However they do have degenerative retinal diseases such as progressive retinal atrophy, sudden acquired retinal degeneration, and senile retinal atrophy. They also develop cataracts, glaucoma, and retinal detachments just like humans. Depending on the condition we can usually restore vision (cataract surgery, retinal reattachment surgery, glaucoma treatment) but dogs can't alert you when something is wrong with their vision. Therefore we see a lot of cases that are too far gone to treat. In cases where vision is lost dogs do extremely well. Other senses take over and they adapt. The only dogs we see that have trouble are ones that were skittish or fearful prior to becoming blind. </p>
<p>Cats are aliens. Most people don't notice that their cat has gone blind until they take them to a new place and they are more hesitant. We had a blind cat jump from the exam table to a chair in the room after only 5 minutes of exploring. They are creepy. They also have wicked healing powers when it comes to bad corneal ulcers. We had one cat come in with a stick in its eye. We kept it over night to treat with topical therapy and the next morning the stick had fallen out, the cornea was sealed, and a few weeks later it looked like nothing happened and the cat is still visual. </p>
<p>I'm sorry, I went off on a tangent. I get kind of excited talking about veterinary ophthalmology. What was the question again? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans have much greater visual acuity than just about any animal except birds.  A lot of our sensory input is through our eyes... But that's not true for all animals. So visual defects don't have as big of an impact on dogs, for instance, because they rely more heavily on other senses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human vision &quot;in the wild&quot; is generally quite good--at least nearsightedness requiring corrective lenses is very rare.  Just check out <a href="http://i.imgur.com/NW6IbDK.png" target="_blank">this graph</a> showing increases over time.  There are also datasets from hunter-gatherers showing very, very low rates of nearsightedness. People of course still suffer from a variety of illnesses and injuries that can damage the eye.  The modern epidemic of myopia is due to some environmental influences (my money is on dim indoor lighting during childhood).  Much like obesity, this vision problem in humans isn't something with many natural parallels.  Species which need good vision generally have good vision...unless they are placed in some environment dramatically different from the one they previously inhabited (just like humans have been).</p>
<p>That said, there are plenty of species with terrible vision.  Many rodents are nearsighted, for example.  But this isn't really a defect, unlike humans they simply don't <em>need</em> to see far away in any great detail.  It's more akin to human's subpar sense of smell...it's just not a sense they rely on.  Primates are unusual among mammals for relying so much on vision.  Hearing and smell are more important, relatively speaking, for many mammal species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans do have a wide range of vision issues, and rates of nearsightedness and farsightedness both have been increasing at epidemic rates around the world. However, this is not an inherent condition.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ideas about why nearsightedness is on the rise in human populations especially in developed countries. Computer screens and books, lack use of long-distance vision, etc, have all been floated as possibilities. However, a recent study demonstrated that decreasing exposure to outdoor-brightness light is massively correlated with increasing rates of nearsightedness in children. A study was done in China where researchers experimentally varied the amount of outdoor time vs indoor time during that children were exposed to during recess, at different schools in the same area.</p>
<p>The amount of kids in each class who developed nearsightedness was directly and dramatically correlated with outdoor light exposure in these kids. On the other hand, time spent reading, looking at computer screens, etc, showed no correlation.</p>
<p>We know that light, blue light in particular, has extremely profound effects upon our hormonal equilibrium, our sleep/ wake cycles, and many other things. With this study, we've established that it appears that exposure to outdoor levels of brightness (120, 000 lux) is necessary for proper development and maturation of the eye. </p>
<p>Thus, nearsightedness in humans is a modern phenomenon, caused in part by decreasing exposure to outdoor light.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're wondering if animals have more vision problems:</p>
<p>They're hard to diagnose if the patient can't communicate</p>
<p>Many of the genes belonging to those with problems are dead ends because they are preyed upon more easilly by predators.</p>
<p>They aren't required to read and write, so mild vision imparment in animals is less crippling than it is for humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
