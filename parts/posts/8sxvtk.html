Hand washing actually removes and rinses bacteria and viruses away from the hands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me start by saying that I would suggest that I'm not the person who by any rights should ever be commenting on an AskScience post.</p>
<p>That being said, knowing what soap does is one of the most important functions in life, and I'm astonished by how little folks know about it. So here is a slightly layman's answer.</p>
<p>Oil and water is immiscible. This means they cannot mix. If you stir oil into water, it will separate and float to the top.</p>
<p>When you add soap, it allows the two to mix. </p>
<p>So when you wash your hands, the majority of the work being done is not thanks to antibacterial properties, but rather just allows the oil and grossness on your hands to bind with the water, so that the grime sloughs away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Soap functions by encapsulating dirt/grease causing it to detach from your hands. The hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of soap molecules allow for this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main difference is that soap and water removes physical soil, the sanitizer does not. If you use only the sanitizer, that physical soil remains and any bacteria hiding in or under it remain and continue reproducing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Traditional soap is both oily and watery, making volumes of dirt easier to rinse off down the drain. Hot water, scrubbing hard and long, helps. The alcohol, 50% or stronger, kills most germs like a machine gun.  The gel alcohol is easier to keep on the hands for the 20 seconds needed. Clean, Then Sanitize. If you are trying beat germ transmission, then doing both thoroughly will help your odds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
