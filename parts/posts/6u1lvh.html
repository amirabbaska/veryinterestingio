		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They’re also announcing it for other studios. Disney and Warner Brothers don’t want to both plan one of their big movies for the same weekend. Sales for both would suffer as a result. Disney is the reigning king of the box office right now (based on annual totals), and they’re basically calling dibs on the best calendar dates years in advance. Other studios can then work around that calendar. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have noticed a trend lately with Disney in regards to its Marvel that they release a full schedule that is years in the making. I think it's a smart way to excite their own fan base. It gets them talking and who knows, maybe there are people who work for the production company taking notes on what the word on the street is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To slowly build up the hype. They don't forget about its existence until a week before - they release news articles (&quot;actor X was cast for the role of Y&quot;, &quot;movie just started filming&quot;, &quot;movie entered post production phase&quot; etc.), they release promotional materials such as posters and trailers, and as the movie's release date comes closer the promotions become more and more aggressive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what other people have said, it's the same reason candidates during election season have all those signs everywhere. It starts establishing recognition, which means when you inevitably hear it again your brain recognizes it as familiar, and due to the nature of our brain, therefore good. Studies have shown that people who haven't researched candidates are more likely to vote for the name they recognize. It's more likely you're going to see a movie you've heard about, even if you don't know anything about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are loads of reasons most have been mentioned. One big one though is control of the media. It takes years to make a film and very difficult to keep it a secret. if you don't involve the media outlets, they will get involved and then you don't control the story.
But all in all, lots of good reasons to do it, no reasons not to, very little cost. Why wouldn't you?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
