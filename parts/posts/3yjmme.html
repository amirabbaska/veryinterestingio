<p>So zed is British and zee is American, yes? Well, that might be the case today, but once upon a time things were quite different...</p>
<p>Historically, both zed and zee were used pretty much interchangeably in both British and American English, alongside a whole host of other more outlandish names for the last (or rather, second last) letter of the alphabet, like izzard, uzzard, zad, shard and, our personal favourite, ezod. Of the two we’re talking about here, however, zed it by far the oldest, and takes its name via French and Latin from that of its Greek equivalent, zeta. Zed first appeared in print in the early 1400s, in a Middle English document that fairly straightforwardly described it as “þe laste lettre of þe a b c”—which is considerably nicer than what William Shakespeare had to say about it.</p>
<p>Zee, on the other hand, first appeared in print in a British language textbook—Thomas Lye’s New Spelling-book—in 1677. The name zee itself is thought to have originated as nothing more than a dialect variation of zed, probably influenced by the regular bee, cee, dee, ee pattern of much of the rest of the alphabet. But precisely how or why it became the predominant form in American English is unclear.</p>
<p>One widely-held theory is that because zed, as the older of the two, was the most widespread variation amongst British English speakers, during the Revolutionary War American English speakers looking to distance themselves from anything even vaguely British simply adopted the zee version as their own to make a stand—no matter how small it might seem—against British control. Alternatively, there mightn’t have been any political reasoning behind it at all, and the name might simply have come to the forefront as American English was forced to adapt and simplify as more and more colonists—coming from ever more distant countries, and speaking an ever more varied array of languages—began arriving in the New World.</p>
<p>Whatever the motivation might have been, by the mid-nineteenth century zee had become the standard form of the letter Z in the United States, and has remained so ever since. </p>
<p>Though the campaign to resurrect ezod begins here...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were two ways to pronounce the letter for a long time. It was apparently a regional way to say it. Thomas Lye in the 1600s wrote a spelling book in England and he pronounced it Zee. (Actually, he wrote &quot;ze&quot; and t is &quot;te&quot; and p is &quot;pe&quot;)   </p>
<p>Here's an interesting quote from the US:  </p>
<p>1882   E. A. Freeman in Longman's Mag. I. 94   The name..given to the last letter of the alphabet..in New England is always zee; in the South it is zed.  </p>
<p>For whatever reason, the zee became the prominent word in the US. You ask why, and despite the many attempts at an answer, <em>we don't really know.</em> And that is the unsatisfying but true answer.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, some Americans definitely WANTED it to be zee, which would make it more in line with the other letters. <a href="https://www.englishforums.com/English/SpellingBookNoahWebster1800/mzkqw/post.htm" target="_blank">https://www.englishforums.com/English/SpellingBookNoahWebster1800/mzkqw/post.htm</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different manners of speaking are natural in a language, England is home to a great many dialects, which were exported to the Americas. It happened to be that some forms of speaking prevailed in each place as English came to be more standardized, and these often differ between North America (and between regions in North America) and England. For example, although &quot;diaper&quot; is universally used in America over the English &quot;nappy,&quot; the word &quot;diaper&quot; was first used as such in England. The non-American colonies, having close ties to the United Kingdom for much longer than the U.S., tended to emulate the U.K. speaking habits, which is why their national varieties don't differ quite so much as American and British English do.</p>
<p>In this particular case, we know that &quot;zee&quot; is first known from the 1670s, but it may have been in use earlier. It likely comes from the way the letter is pronounced in many words, whereas &quot;zed&quot; comes from the French name &quot;zede.&quot;</p>
<p>It's worth noting there is no objectively correct way to pronounce words, and there is particularly no standardization for letters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Zee vs. zed
Zee is the American way of saying the letter z. Zed is the British way. Neither is right or wrong, and nobody is ignorant for pronouncing z the way they do.</p>
<p>The zed pronunciation is older, and it more closely resembles the Greek letter, zeta, from which the English letter is derived. And zed is closer to other languages’ spelling and pronunciation of the letter; for instance, the French say zède, German speakers say zet, and Spanish speakers say zeta. These are points in zed‘s favor.</p>
<p>The U.S. pronunciation probably came about by analogy with the letters bee, cee, dee, gee, and so on. It was standard in American English by the 19th century, and it’s now so deeply engrained that many Americans are unaware of the British pronunciation.</p>
<p>Australian and New Zealand English speakers usually say zed. Canadians say both.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
