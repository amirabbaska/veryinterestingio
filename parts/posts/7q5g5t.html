		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, ignoring survival conditions, staying where you are should increase your odds of being found. A search party will systematically rule out locations where you are not, and you risk moving into a previously searched area or even away from the search party.
There is always a chance you will head towards the search party, or even back towards safety, but assuming there only a handful of directions that lead to safety (an entrance to the area you're lost in for example) then you have a low probability of heading in that direction.
If you can't be sure that a search party is coming, it changes things a bit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The less experience you have the more important it is to stay put. And you always have far less experience than you believe. </p>
<p>You have a huge chance of wandering away from where the search is focused if you decide to make a go of it. You are wasting energy you need to put into survival, especially if you are injured.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would refer you to what-if.xkcd.com, but this one is only in the book: If 2 people are dropped on an empty, Earthlike planet, what is the fastest way for them to find eachother? The answer there is to leave a trail of dated markings, resting two days for each day of travel. When you find a new trail you did not create, start following it as fast as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you realize you are lost the best thing to do is stop, do not keep wandering aimlessly. Take a look around, calmly, and try to determine the best area for some sort of shelter. Look around you for open areas, you want to be seen from the air. Make a big 'X' on the ground using contrasting color material (ie: green branches on snow). Also make something that you can wave in the air. Contrast and movement are the keys here. The international signs of distress are X's and anything in 3's (three lines, three fires, etc.). </p>
<p>The search teams will begin at your last known place (car) or place last seen (someone saw you on a trail) and work out from there. If you keep wandering around you are expanding the search area and decreasing your chances of a quicker rescue. Most searches, weather permitting, are started with a quick air search, followed by a hasty ground search using vehicles, followed by ground search teams. If you can find an open area or a trail, fire road, logging road nearby stay near those. If nothing like that is near you find the nearest 'open' area you can and park yourself there. If you have to relocate to a better position (necessary resources) leave obvious 'sign'. Broken branches, arrows made using rocks or sticks, showing which direction you went will help searchers looking for you. Be obvious and large with your 'sign', don't assume someone will see it, make it large enough that someone can't possibly miss it.</p>
<p>Anything reflective (mirror, watch, cell phone glass screen) can flash sunlight for miles. At night, anything than can create light (lighter, flashlight, glow stick) can also be seen for long distances. The thing to remember is people will be looking for you so make it easier for them to find you. Shout, wave something colorful, smack rocks together, anything...just don't sit around and play 'hide and seek'. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vancouver, BC has inhospitable and dangerous wilderness areas literally less than twenty minutes' drive from its downtown core. Consequently, ill-prepared hikers who wander off marked trails and get themselves lost, or worse yet too injured to backtrack, are very common. </p>
<p>A large preponderance of those needing to be rescued are visitors who incorrectly assume the local mountains are just tamed urban parks, because they look so benign and inviting from the highrise hotel window. Not so; once an unaware or inexperienced person steps off the parking lot gravel and into the treeline, things can start going wrong for them very, <em>very</em> quickly - especially if they head out in flipflops and shorts, as some actually do. But to be fair, locals in Goretex and trail boots also need to be retrieved, sometimes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.northshorerescue.com/" target="_blank">North Shore Rescue</a>, one of the world's busiest volunteer rescue organizations, gets nearly 3 calls a week, year round, to find or rescue people stuck in the bush, and will field as many as five calls a <em>day</em> over some summer weekends. Last year they spent over 10,000 rescuer hours on searches and recoveries. Often these SAR callouts require multi-day searches by a dozen or more highly trained and well-equipped volunteers; reports of missing hikers are typically made late in the day, often leaving only a few crucial hours to rally and search before nightfall requires ops to be suspended until first light. In short, these guys and gals are world experts at finding people in technically challenging, very dangerous terrain that is often heavily overgrown and lethally steep, then getting them out safely.</p>
