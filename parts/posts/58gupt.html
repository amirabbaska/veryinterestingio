<p>They're a permanent resident in the upper half of the US, but they're seasonal in most of Canada and the southern US. How exactly do the populations migrate? Do they replace each other linearly, where they all more or less fly an equal distance south, or do the birds present in the upper US mostly stay put in their 'territory' while those from Canada have to migrate all the way to Texas to find an unoccupied area to spend the winter?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Totally depends on the species. I doubt you can make many generalizations about all birds. One that I know about is the Golden-winged warbler. They have a pretty wide summer breeding range, but are mostly rare breeders throughout. However, the whole population winters in a much smaller area in central America. Going down to Costa Rica in the winter and you wouldn't consider them a rare bird at all. Other birds are colony breeders and only breed in a few locations but then spread out to a wide winter range. </p>
<p>Canada Goose is kind of an oddball because there is what's called a resident Canada Goose. These could almost be considered a separate subspecies that started not migrating (I think in the 1950s) and became permanent residents and prolific breeders at many parks. <a href="http://www.geesepeace.com/whygeesedonotmigrate.html" target="_blank">http://www.geesepeace.com/whygeesedonotmigrate.html</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There really isn't much of a pattern to the changing population distributions of the Canada Goose, due in large part to interactions with humans. Because humans have created so many large habitats that have abundant fresh water, food, and lack predators (such as parks and golf courses), many populations have established permanent colonies and have mostly abandoned migration themselves, but continue to receive seasonal migratory populations. Individual flocks also migrate in widely varying directions and distances, as well as varying the number of rest stops and their length, and begin the migration at varying times. Some geese follow the same route every year, while others like to change it up. So, due to too many variables about the individual's migration, if they migrate at all, there really isn't any consistent pattern for the species as a whole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the gulf coast of Florida's panhandle, starting in about November and continuing into December, sometimes January, you see a lot of robins gathering along the coastline. It's weird because you don't think of robins in flocks, but that's what you see. Hundreds and hundreds of them lined up on park benches and dunes, looking out at the gulf. It's like they're waiting for a good northerly breeze or trying to get their nerve up. When the cold fronts start clocking across the country in the winter, they get that north wind. After the first big one hits, they're mostly gone but a few who have arrived late or didn't have the nerve hang around, sometimes all winter. They tend to disappear when spring comes around, I think catching a ride with first ones flying back up from their winter in <del>Costa Rica</del> Central America and the Caribbean  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many different types of migration among birds, but they can be broken down into three general categories: Full-migration, partial-migration, and residents. Full-migrants have a distinct geographical separation between breeding and wintering populations. One of the best examples being the arctic tern, which breeds in the arctic and winters in Antarctica, migrating nearly 25,000 miles twice a year. Residential species are self-described; breeding and wintering grounds are pretty much the same. Although, many year-round species do migrate slightly, such as the  band-tailed pigeon who generally stay in the same range, but will change their elevation preference between the two seasons. Partial-migrants, such as the Canada goose, are species where breeding populations and wintering populations overlap geographically. Depending on the species, some populations will migrate farther than others. In some species, sex and age determine how far species migrate. I'm having a hard time thinking of a specific bird, but some migrants have intraspecific competition where the older males will outcompete the younger ones, forcing first or second year individuals to migrate farther for competitive breeding ground than their elders. Species that have well documented subspecies, such as the song sparrow and white-crowned sparrow, will have specific breeding and wintering grounds. But looking at the species population as a whole, it appears that they are partial migrates with overlapping ranges between the seasons. Bird migration is fascinating, and there is no golden rule to describe it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
