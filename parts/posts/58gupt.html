<p>They're a permanent resident in the upper half of the US, but they're seasonal in most of Canada and the southern US. How exactly do the populations migrate? Do they replace each other linearly, where they all more or less fly an equal distance south, or do the birds present in the upper US mostly stay put in their 'territory' while those from Canada have to migrate all the way to Texas to find an unoccupied area to spend the winter?</p></div></div>
