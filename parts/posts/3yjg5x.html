<p>And yet, I've been reading and talking with non-experts involved in fitness science that we just haven't found the right material, with the right type of properties to replace real cartilage. </p>
<p>Doctors/medical researchers, what are the major hurdles faced by prosthetic cartilage today? </p>
<p>Edit: please keep this as ELI5 as possible, I don't have a very scientific background. </p>
<p>Edit2: Researchers : where is the research at now? What sort of time-frame are we looking at for general use of prosthetics, if you can provide one? </p></div></div>
