Basically my question is what physical properties of oil make it an ideal medium for cooking food to have that crunchy exterior? Why doesn't boiling water achieve the same effect? </p>
<p>I assume it has to do with specific heat capacity. Any thoughts?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason for using oil is just to make a thermal path between the pan and the food, so the food doesn't only cook exactly where it touches.</p>
<p>The reason boiling doesn't achieve browning, is that water cannot be heated above 100C, except at extreme pressures. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction" target="_blank">Maillard Reaction</a> is commonly what turns food brown and produces a pleasant taste, and this happens at 140 to 160 C.</p>
<p>And according to: <a href="http://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-frying" target="_blank">http://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-frying</a></p>
<p>&quot;When food is plunged into hot oil, the water in the food starts to boil and percolate toward the surface. In order for a crisp, dry crust to develop, there must be a barrier between the hot oil and the migrating water. This barrier is typically something starchy. As the starch fries in the hot oil, it dries into a pleasantly crisp shell and protects the moisture beneath. The food inside steams while the coating browns and crisps.&quot;</p>
<p>EDIT: As /u/Choralone points out below, the Maillard reaction can take place at lower temperatures, but very slowly. So cooking items over several hours can sometimes produce similar results, but perhaps not with the types of food that are normally fried.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a sense the answer is a matter of definition: &quot;frying&quot; means &quot;cooking food in oil.&quot; But that doesn't explain why it's a good idea.</p>
<p>Air is very bad at transferring heat, so if you cook food in a completely dry pan, it will only cook where the food touches the pan. Oil and water are much better at transferring heat, so if you put either of those in the pan with the food, it will cook much better, much more evenly, without burning at the spots where it touches the bottom.</p>
<p>The difference between oil and water is that water absorbs a load of energy when it gets to 100⁰C and then evaporates, keeping the temperature of the water at 100 degrees (even if you heat the pan loads) and, once it stops doing that, no longer providing that heat transfer function it used to. Oils have a much higher boiling point so they heat up way more. This is important because food tastes better if it's been cooked at a higher temperature; the Maillard reaction happens at about 150⁰C so it can happen in hot oil but not hot water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a chef the reasons we were told during my apprenticeship are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>provides a barrier to prevent sticking</li>
<li>adds flavour</li>
<li>with steak it encourages the millard effect which provides a nice crust (this is more created by the air flowing around the item being fried)</li>
<li>protects the item from drying out.</li>

This is where I learned a lot about frying and may answer some questions you have as well. This channel is really interesting in general but there are more videos about food like extracting caffeine and whipping avocado. <a href="https://youtu.be/a4gYv2BK-HQ" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/a4gYv2BK-HQ</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because removing water from food concentrates flavour and facilitates the creation of The Mallard Reaction (browning) and since oil can reach temperatures higher than water, cooking in oil allows for the fast and easy removal of water while at the same time cooking the food. You can never achieve the Mallard Reaction by boiling food, boiled food never ever browns. And &quot;frying in air&quot; is the same thing, you are using hot air to heat the oil that's already in the food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
