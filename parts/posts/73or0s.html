		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can make money three ways when they are selling you a new car, the dealer markup, and any hidden incentives from the factory.<br />
The second way is what they offer you for your trade in.<br />
The third way is through financing of the vehicle.   They secretly get kickbacks from certain finance companies depending on what rate they offer you.   Say, hypothetically, you qualify for a 3% rate, but the finance manager will offer you a loan for 4%, so then the dealership gets a kickback of $500, and if he gets you on the hook for 5%, the dealership gets a kickback of $1000.   </p>
<p>So the salesperson will usually chat you up and try to pull details about what you want out of the deal, they find out what your &quot;hot buttons&quot; are, and lets say you demand to get $5000 for your trade, when it's only worth $4000, well then they can jack up your interest rate by two percent and make that back up.<br />
Or, lets say you demand a certain interest rate, so they agree to that, but the amount of money they will give you on your trade-in just went down.<br />
Since usually people only have one hot button, it's easy for them to find out what that is and then structure that accordingly.
So it's all a big shell game.   You ask for something, they concede, but make it up elsewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for a heavy truck manufacturer (we are talking semi trucks) and the process is similar in the truck world. Our truck dealerships actually make very little money on the sale of the truck. We, as the manufacturer, usually have promotions running that gives the dealership and sales people incentives to really push whatever model(s) we are interested in pushing. We give it back in the form of rebates, gift cards, funds for the dealership to use on marketing, and a variety of other incentives. </p>
<p>The real money maker for a dealership is parts and service.  We sell genuine parts that came on at the factory for upwards of 60-100% margin. The dealership then turns around and marks it up to the end users (you and I) for the same amount.  Yes, those wiper blades that cost you over $20 we as the OEM sold to the dealership for $4-8 bucks. </p>
<p>Parts and service from a dealership border on price gouging but they can get away from it. However, I truly believe if you have the money it’s worth it in so many ways to have your vehicle serviced at the actual dealership that represents your car brand. We give them TONS of training how to properly service your vehicles, plus, we ship them actual tools to fix your specific car that most repair companies can’t get. </p>
<p>Don’t worry - dealerships take in the money hand over fist and it’s truly due to the parts and service departments. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They say that the real money is made of incentives from the manufacturer to sell the cars - they just need to move a set number of cars, it really doesn't matter how much they sell them for. And then they get big payouts from the manufacturer. And that's the money they want - not some tiny profit from marking up the car. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually sell cars so here's the breakdown: </p>
<p>If you're buying a brand new car, there is a good chance they really ARENT making any money, or maybe only a couple hundred bucks. Dealerships have an invoice cost of their vehicle, which you can typically get a new car at or below that invoice cost. Most place also have about 4% of the cars cost as marketing incentives and otherbullshit from the manufacturer, but it has nothing to do with dealership markup. So if you're buying a new car at or below invoice, there is a very good chance no one is making any sizable income off of that (for instance, I will typically make only $50-75 flat fee for selling the car). But then you might ask, how does a dealership make money?</p>
<p>Well, if you're buying the car at that dealership, then you're likely going to service it there, too. It costs pennies to the dollar to actually perform service on the car, so they'll make more than the money they lost on that one new car in the multiple service visits they'll have to the dealership. But that's not all:</p>
<p>3-6 years down the road, now you'll trade that car in. So the preowned manager will typically give you a trade in value way under what the car will sell for after being fixed up on retail. So now one preowned car could have $5000 profit on the cost of the car alone, making up for a few of those new cars. You might think this is unfair, but sorry, any preowned manager worth his weight isn't going to put any sizable discount on his car, because it's actually keeping the lights on at the dealership. Just the rules of the game unfortunately. </p>
<p>The unfortunate part is that unlike any other business, people don't feel a dealership is entitled to make a profit. But like, people still have to get paid and lights still have to be kept on. So it is what it is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK.  So it all comes down to how you define &quot;profit&quot; for a car dealership.</p>
<p>First, and most obvious there's the amount that they paid the manufacturer for the car vs what they sold it to you.  That's the &quot;only a few hundred markups&quot; that you see. </p>
<p>Uncounted in that is that manufacturers often give rebates.  So if you sell car X the manufacturer might kick an extra few hundred your way.  This is partly how the manufacturer influences what cars are pushed when.  So for example, if the new Accord is coming out next month, Honda might incentivize selling the old Accords off by giving a rebate on them for a few months. This gives the manufacturer more control over what salespeople push than simply adjusting the original cost of a car. </p>
<p>Next are targets.  Often a dealership will get a bonus if they hit certain targets for sales.  So if they have a 100 vehicle target, but only sell 99 they get nothing but if they sell 101 they get $1,000 for every vehicle.  These numbers are made up but show the point.  The dealership stands to make significantly more profit if they hit these targets than if they miss them. </p>
<p>Next is financing.  Dealers get kickbacks from financing companies.  If a dealer sets up a loan with company X, they might get a few hundred bucks for doing so.  Many manufacturers also have financing companies, for example, &quot;Ford Motor Credit Company LLC&quot; is the bank owned by Ford Motor Company.  This bank contributes a significant amount to Ford's overall bottom line. So the incentives from the credit company are also present.</p>
<p>Next, and perhaps most important is service.  The assumption is that a new vehicle comes with a warranty.  Most people get their warranty service at the same dealership they bought from.  The dealer's service department charges the manufacturer for those services.  </p>
<p>So if you go in and get something done under warranty, your local Ford dealer invoices Ford Motor Company for that service.  Even though you are not paying the dealer, the dealer's service department is still making money on that service.  Now, the rates negotiated by the manufacturer are much lower than you or I would pay, but there's a significant amount of service work done through those dealers that this back-end revenue is part of the assumed profit when they sell a new car. </p>
<p>Then there's the remainder of the dealer's service work.  Because they sell new cars, people assume that they are the best equipped and trained to service all cars of that brand.  So collision repairs, or out of warranty repairs are all gravy for the dealership and those exist because of the new car sales side of the business. </p>
<p>Lastly, there are used cars.  People often trade in a car when they buy a new one.  The dealership flips that car to another buyer, at a profit, or they sell it at auction (often at a profit).  </p>
<p>So the dealer makes its profit in many ways.  There's the straight margin, the manufacturer incentives, and bonuses, there's the trade in, the financing and the future service.  All of those are sources of profit that flow from selling that 1 new car. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
