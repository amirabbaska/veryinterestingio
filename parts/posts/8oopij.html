If the universe is infinite as well though there should be an infinite amount of stars visible on the night-sky or if you want to amount for light pollution, there should be when you're watching from Space. </p>
<p>I have a few theories why it could be (finite amount of light spread too thin, infinite amount of planets/asteroids getting in the way...) but let's hear it from someone who actually kbows their shit :)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two things going on here, both related to universal expansion.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The universe may be infinite, but as it is expanding, the distance between us and anything further than 14bn ly away is getting bigger at greater than c, <del>so light from them can never reach us.</del> The <em>observable</em> universe - the stuff that we can see - is about 46bn ly in radius, so any galaxies beyond that are invisible.</p>
</li>
<li>Due to expansion, electromagnetic radiation is red-shifted as it travels (basically its wavelength increases by a factor of about 2 x 10^(-18) every second). So stuff that was emitted as visible light a long time ago will gradually become IR, then microwaves, then radio waves and so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>That doesn't mean it isn't there, though. It just means we need radio telescopes rather than visible light telescopes to see it.</p>
<p>In practice, there <em>is</em> &quot;light&quot; all around us, which is shown by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ilc_9yr_moll4096.png" target="_blank">this notable image</a>. That is a picture of the cosmic microwave background (based on years of data collection); basically it is a picture of the sky in all directions, showing the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation in the background (so stuff leftover from the very early days of the universe). This radiation has a frequency in the high GHz (so microwave radiation) and is good evidence for the universe being pretty much the same in all directions - on that picture the effective temperature of the radiation is about 2.7K, but the range of temperatures (brightest to darkest) is about Â± 0.2mK.</p>
<p>So in theory the night sky is bright - in that there's radiation in all directions. It's just very <del>high</del><em>low</em>-frequency (<em>large-wavelength</em>), and very cold, so we can't see it. </p>
<p>[<em>Edit: I'm getting a few common follow-up questions, so here are some rough answers:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/8oopij/if_light_doesnt_dissipate_with_travel_distance/e05hckt/" target="_blank">But nothing can go faster than the speed of light, how can distant objects be moving away faster than c</a>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/8oopij/if_light_doesnt_dissipate_with_travel_distance/e05qk8s/" target="_blank">What about the inverse square law; light spreads out - wouldn't that explain it</a>?</p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/8oopij/if_light_doesnt_dissipate_with_travel_distance/e05g7wh/" target="_blank">How is universal expansion changing; is the observable universe and what is in it getting bigger or smaller</a>?</li>
</ol>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is known as Olbers' paradox and if the universe was static, this would definitely be the case. The night sky not being bright is one of the contradictions between reality and models that assume that the universe is static and infinite and as such indirect evidence for cosmological models that make no such assumptions.</p>
<p>An easy explanation is that since the universe is finitely old and the speed of light is finite, our observable universe is not infinite and thus the night sky does not have to be bright.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1303/cmbr_planck_3600.jpg" target="_blank">This is what the Planck satellite sees</a> when looking at the sky. A full bright sphere in the microwave domain.  </p>
<p>How comes? Well the Universe is not static, it's expanding. All objects are moving away from us, and the further away they are the faster they run away.  The Doppler effects tell us then that light coming from distant objects will be &quot;redshifted&quot; : its wavelength will be longer. At some point, objects are so far (and so fast) that the wavelength becomes too large for our eyes to detect it. Light becomes infrared. And if we keep going, this distant light shifts all the way down to microwaves before reaching us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light does not dissipate, but it does decrease in intensity for several different reasons. First of course being the inverse square law, if you double the distance, the intensity is divided by 4. Secondly, and most importantly for large distances, the universe is expanding, which causes a doppler shift for light that travels a great distance. Because that light emanates from a source where the intensity of emission decreases with frequency (bluer colors of light are harder to make), which means there is a lot of red, then less green, a lot less blue, etc. After that doppler shift, the red becomes infra-red, the green -&gt; red, the blue -&gt; green. And if it is from the beginning of the universe almost all the light we would have seen in that era has shifted into the microwave portion of the spectrum, it is invisible and very, very dim.</p>
<p>Basically, there is a horizon to the universe, we can't see past a certain time, which is a certain distance away from us, and so even in an infinite universe, we cannot see past that horizon. On top of that, the universe is expanding, which unintuitively means that horizon is getting closer to us. Eventually that first light will no longer be visible, and then the furthest galaxies will disappear, and then the intermediate, and the close. Until the universe is so large that only our own galaxy will remain visible to us (though by that time the universe will have evolved past stars if memory serves, so it will look very different to begin with).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speed of light is limited and universe expansion is making far away objects to &quot;move away&quot; from us faster than that. As a result there are a lot of stars too far away from us, for their light to reach earth, and there are many starts moving away so fast, that we'll never see their light.</p>
<p>In fact due to universe expansion we will be able to see less and less stars over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
