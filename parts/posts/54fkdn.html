		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because more surface area is exposed to the heat source and there's fewer easy places for the heat to dissipate to.</p>
<p>If you try to light it from the middle, the bottom surface of the paper (above the flame) heats first, and the top surface only heats up as the heat transfers through the paper (which does have thickness even if it is pretty thin) and it actually loses that heat to the (non-flame) air above the paper.</p>
<p>If you light from the side, the flame can heat both sides of the paper at once <em>and</em> there isn't anywhere else for that heat to go besides into more of the paper.</p>
<p>Edit: This isn't a be-all end-all answer.  Avgjoe33 points out correctly that the buildup of carbon dioxide underneath the paper blocks the heat transfer as well, since it has nowhere to go if you're heating it from the center.  However, a blowtorch aimed horizontally will still light the edges of a sheet on fire faster than the center, I suspect, even if the paper is being held vertically (and thus not blocking the escape of carbon dioxide gas).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, so many wrong answers here... The flame used to ignite the paper is plenty hot and the paper is so thin that we can assume it heats-up uniformly. We will also assume the paper is held parallel to the floor so there is a minimal fuel feeding effect.</p>
<p>The real reason it's hard to ignite the center of a piece of paper is that the paper itself actually gets in the way of carbon dioxide leaving the burn point. With an upright candle, if you hold the paper edge to it, the paper will ignite and the CO2 has plenty of places to go. If instead you place the center of the paper over the flame, the hot CO2 is trapped against the paper you're trying to burn (remember heat and hot gasses rise), so the burning slows down. In engineering, we would say the burning reaction is mass-transfer limited because there's too much CO2 in the way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since nobody has answered correctly I will. Low pressure flame applied to a flat surface will be suspended from that surface by laminar flow. Low pressure flame applied to a corner will produce turbulence, allowing the hot gasses to contact the corner before they cool. High pressure turbulent flame however, will break the laminar flow which is why a jet lighter will light the center as fast as it would light the edge. Conduction and heat-sinking play only a very minor role as paper is a poor thermal conducter.</p>
<p>Tl;Dr: It's all about turbulence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an experiment you can try.  Get a small candle, a tape measure and a nice long receipt, like the grocery receipt.  Cut the receipt into squares.   Now take the tape measure and pull out about 30cm of tape and lock it into place.  Set the tape measure on its end so that the tape is sticking straight up in the air.  Light the candle and set it beside the tape measure.</p>
<p>Take one of the squares of paper and hold it over the flame of the candle (not too close).  Notice how it turns black. Receipts are made of paper that is coated with a kind of ink, called thermochromatic ink, that turns black when heated. </p>
<p>Take another square and start lowering it from well above the candle flame.  Note the height that it starts turning black.  Try holding the squares horizontally or vertically.  Does the height that it starts turning black change?  </p>
<p>Warning: This experiment can be dangerous.  Do not try it at home.  Go over to a friend's house, or behind the school after hours, or find a cool adult that will let you try stuff like this.  And remember: Good science is about good observation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the edge, you can hold the flame so it's touching both sides of the sheet. That way, every bit of the piece of paper gets hot enough to burn very quickly. If you start in the center, you can only hold the flame to one side. The other side will stay relatively cool for a relatively long time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
