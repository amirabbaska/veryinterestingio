Does zero gravity influence the cameras sensor? If so why isn't the Live Feed affected as well?<br />
Here an example: <a href="https://youtu.be/QvTmdIhYnes?t=46m20s" target="_blank"><a href="https://youtu.be/QvTmdIhYnes?t=46m20s" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/QvTmdIhYnes?t=46m20s</a></a></p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long term radiation damage on the cameras. Astronauts, for example, when they close their eyes, will occasionally see flashes of light as a heavy ion or charged particle crashes through their skull and fires off a photo receptor cell in their eye despite their eyes being closed. Luckily when <del>we lose cells</del> cells are damaged they can regenerate, not so for a semiconductor matrix inside the CMOS/CCD sensor of the camera.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sensitive parts of the cameras are semiconductor arrays. Every now and then a bit of cosmic radiation will fly through the camera and cause a chemical reaction in one of the pixels which causes that pixel to malfunction.</p>
<p>The effect is apparently temperature dependent so cameras inside will be more effected than cameras outside where its very cold. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even on airplanes, if it’s a really expensive camera you’re supposed to use a lead lined box. Our news cameras need to be black balanced every time we fly too. Black balancing is telling the sensor what black looks like and resets all the pixels, because there is so much more radiation and parictle at 36000ft it sets them off and they forget black. My Canon 5D has 2 dead pixels from a few flights now. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually an experiment they're running!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the HDEV collects beautiful images of the Earth from the ISS, the primary purpose of the experiment is an engineering one: monitoring the rate at which HD video camera image quality degrades when exposed to the space environment (mainly from cosmic ray damage) and verify the effectiveness of the design of the HDEV housing for thermal control.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like others have said, most likely damage to the camera's sensor - the part that basically digitally converts light to a resolvable picture, performing the same function as film would in a traditional camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/qzyKLoEDb64" target="_blank">Here's a video of lasers at a light show causing irreversible damage to a modern camera's sensor.</a></p>
<p>You can imagine the level of radiation a camera up in space gets compared to one inside the Earth's atmosphere, hence the damage you see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
