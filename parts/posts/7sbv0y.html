		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed stories and certain experiences myself where say you'd have a discussion about something sexual and your normal answer would be something along the lines of &quot;no, never&quot;.  When it comes to the actual moment I've noticed people are more easily convinced to do the same thing they would say no to.</p>
<p>I read a story a while back about a woman who got coerced into anal and she regretted it big time.  I've also had experienced myself where I did things I normally didn't really like and also the women I've been with have done stuff they said they didn't like as well.</p>
<p>How does &quot;thinking with your dick&quot; actually happen?</p>
<p>Edit: Never thought I'd get a front page post.  Thank you all so much for your answers.  Laughed quite a bit at some people lol.</p>
<p>I suppose most people would be interested in this though.  Especially you nasty freaks who eat ass.  No judging but that's a whole new level of &quot;thinking with your dick&quot;.</p>
<p>I came across this post that I think people would be interested in if it doesn't hit top voted.  I'll be watching it later :).</p>
<p>There's been plenty of behavior studies on this.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how in Inside Out there was an emotion called Disgust?  Well when you hit puberty you get a new emotion called Arousal.  Arousal likes to encourage you to do things that Disgust doesn't like, so whenever Arousal wakes up she ties Disgust up and puts her in a closet.  Whenever Arousal goes back to sleep Disgust wakes up, looks over your memories, and gives you her opinions on them... vocally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Studies show that sexual arousal reduces feelings of disgust. It works for women and men.</p>
<p>Possible reasons for it could be that it allows people to have sex when they otherwise wouldn't, which is a good trait to have for passing on genes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, during sexual arousal your brain floods your body with adrenaline, which helps to remove possible fears and concerns around the outcome of your actions. Combine this with the fact that sex is very different to the <em>thought of</em> sex, and it's quite easy to convince yourself that your making a good decision.</p>
<p>There are also a bunch of social elements involved. If you are asked to do something you normally wouldn't do, but you are already involved in a sexual act, you may feel a need to reciprocate and attend to the person you are having sex with. This is quite a natural thing to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ABA:  If people have not had sex recently, they can be very motivated by it (Deprivation from Unconditioned motivating operation). When something or someone lets them know they might be able to have it (Discriminative stimulus), that can make them more likely to do things that have ended up with having sex in the past (evokes momentary frequency).  They may have a learning history in which complying with requests gets them what they want (generalized response class for mand piance).  If their behavior is followed by an something that makes them likely to egage in the behavior again (stimulus of positive reinforcement), like an orgasm, they might do that type of stuff again.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you want the chemical reasoning, it's complicated, but a lot of things get secreted in your brain and...elsewhere, when you are aroused. These chemicals tend to inhibit normal judgement. That's the simplest way to put it, honestly, though the effects of being &quot;horny&quot; are a bit more complex than that in practice.</p>
<p>I would also argue that a lot of things that people say they would &quot;normally never do&quot; are simply things that people won't &quot;admit&quot; to ever wanting to do. It depends on the individual, but sexual urges for a lot of people tend to be...well, perverse. Telling yourself that you &quot;would never&quot; do something is a self-defense mechanism for many, as is the guilt or regret you may feel after doing the act. It's easier for many to simply distance themselves from how they behave under &quot;any&quot; influence, sexual or otherwise.</p>
<p>This can become a problem sometimes. It is a problem when people have sex that was entirely consensual, for example, which they later regret. In the worst cases, this might lead to false accusations of sexual assault, which does an enormous disservice to real victims. It is a problem when it leads people to publicly denounce certain sexual acts or practices as &quot;disgusting&quot; despite them being between consensual adults, simply to justify their own moral or personal integrity to others.</p>
<p>Though coercion is certainly a real thing, and when talking about sex, there's a very vague boundary between coercion and consent much of the time. If you agreed to something while you were &quot;horny,&quot; something that might affect your decision-making just as much as drinking alcohol (for example), then can you really be said to have &quot;consented&quot; to anything properly in the first place? That's the nature of our biology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
