Teams like the warriors switch them out every game. Is this an aesthetic-driven rule, or is there another reason behind this?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nets can tear.  If the 'hole' is near the top of the hoop, the ball can go through the hoop, enter the net, and hit one of these 'holes' - and bounce back out!</p>
<p>So, you could end up with a situation where a game is won or lost based on the condition of the net, and not the quality of the shot.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Hmmm, didn't realize everyone would be so interested in basketball nets today!  Guess I should elaborate...  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/nhDBC2N.jpg" target="_blank">Here is the worst place to have a net break</a>.  If the rope the arrows are pointing to breaks, you end up with a hole that's huge, yet not quite large enough for a basketball to go through.  And, to make matters worse, any shot that's coming from the center of the court is going to naturally be aiming for that hole (because of the parabolic arc the ball travels).  So, when the ball 'swishes', it will no longer hit those two ropes and be funneled down through the net - it will now hit the ropes marked with the green line instead - which will send the ball bouncing back along the same trajectory it came in on.  And, it does all this without the ball fully entering the hoop.  A few inches of it remain above the hoop.</p>
<p>So, yeah, that's how one single tear in a rope could completely alter the outcome of a basketball game.  That one damn rope there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The net slows the ball down and makes the trajectory of the ball after a made basket more predictable. For a team that likes to fast-break like the Warriors, it's imperative that the ball be corralled and inbounded as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>Even losing 0.5 seconds due to a wayward ball is going to likely mess up your chance to move the ball past half court fast enough to catch a team not ready to play defense (still celebrating showing three fingers putting the pistols back in the holsters and all the rest...)</p>
<p>As a net gets broken in it stretches and the ball becomes more likely to go wayward as it comes through the basket making it less likely to be instantly corralled and inbounded. This is such an important part of the Warriors style of play that they change the nets out for every game. </p>
<p>Along the same lines... the NBA instituted a rule change 2 years ago to call a technical foul on a player of the team who just made a basket if they touch the ball after it comes through the basket. This was to address the issue of teams who would try to grab the ball after a made basket to slow the other team down by 1-2 seconds.</p>
<p>The Phoenix Suns with Steve Nash were famous for inbounding the ball after a made basket so fast that many teams would try things like grabbing the ball after a made basket - pretending to be helpful and tossing it to the ref. Nash would always get pissed when it happened since he was the master at catching other teams lazily getting back on defense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of misinformed responses. Nets are replaced when damaged or as chosen by coaches to slow down or speed up gameplay. A new net is tighter and releases the ball slower after a shot than a net that has seen some action. It is used as a method to slow the clock in between baskets and give your team a very small additional break to regroup and breathe. However often times an undamaged but used net will be swapped in for the opposite reason, to create fast breaks after a basket and give the opposing team little time to get ready to play D. It's to fix something that's broken or an old school tactic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>NBA doesn't want nasty nets on television.  So some exec decided that 7 games is the max lifespan of a net and put it in the rulebook.  New nets are clean and nice looking, making the game look professional.</p>
<p>Warriors change out every game because they want to. Maybe they think it makes them look extra professional.  Maybe they sell or give away the nets to fans/charities/execs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
