		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So in a sort of theoretical sense, a lot of the password requirements that your company has will improve security.  For example, rotating passwords on a regular basis cuts the amount of time someone has to take advantage if your account gets compromised.  If you haven't changed your password in 10 years, then anyone who has ever known your password in those 10 years, whether you shared it with them, they looked over your shoulder, or they somehow &quot;hacked&quot; your password, they can still do damage.  Change your password right now, and your account become secure again.</p>
<p>Similarly, having long random passwords with numbers and symbols are harder to crack with brute-force methods.  Keeping a password history and preventing you from using one of your prior passwords keep you from switching back to that password you used for 10 years.  All these measures are improving security... theoretically... sort of...</p>
<p>The problem is, it also makes you more likely to forget your password, which means you'll probably write it down or store it somewhere.  Then your account is only as secure as the sheet of paper your password is written on.  Or worse, people get frustrated by the requirements and come up with a way of making it simpler.  For example:</p>
<p>I once worked at a place that required your password be at least 12 characters, with at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase, one number, and one symbol.  The password had to be changed once a month, but it started warning you two weeks before expiring, so it would nag you to change your password every two weeks.  It kept track of your last 10 passwords and wouldn't let you reuse them.</p>
<p>This is over-kill, and is likely to cause more security problems than it fixes.  Most people wrote their password down on post-it-notes and stuck them to their monitors, which meant anyone sitting down at their computer knew their password.</p>
<p>A bunch of people, however, figured out an easy way to come up with memorable passwords.  They started cycling through a list: Password0!, Password1!, Password2!... Password9!</p>
<p>I brought this up to the IT manager, and he didn't care because he thought those were &quot;strong passwords&quot; because they met the requirements.  I tried explaining that those are terrible passwords, but he didn't seem to understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you use a unique password for work only, it typically does very little to increase security, if you use that password ANYWHERE else it does a lot to increase security.  Unfortunately most people reuse passwords so the policy tends to makes sense.  </p>
<p>In my opinion you're far better off implementing secondary factor for login (e.g. <a href="https://helpdesk.lastpass.com/multifactor-authentication-options/" target="_blank">https://helpdesk.lastpass.com/multifactor-authentication-options/</a>)  and then have a yearly password change policy.</p>
<p>My favorite story about how badly enforcing password changes too often can backfire involves a woman who was forced to change her password every month, had to have caps, numbers and punctuation, and it kept track of her last 50 passwords.  She was proud of her method of dealing with this problem, her password was MonthnameYearNumber!</p>
<p>January2015!
February2015!
March2015!</p>
<p>She always knew her password and was able to do it forever, she had no clue how insecure it was -- she had a problem and solved it.  You can't trust people, use a secondary factor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in support for a company which enforced a 90 day password expiry, and remember the previous 12 passwords. We had a need to sometimes log on as the user to sync their files to a new device, if their current one they have (in the field, like remote sales staff) was damaged/inoperable. </p>
<p>I never had anyone question me when I said &quot;and I'll need your password&quot; they just gave it over freely. It's against company policy, and no one gives a shit. To say social engineering is the easiest way to obtain a password is an understatement. </p>
<p>After 30 or so times of this happening, it was pretty apparent that 90 day password policies suck shit. 'Giraffe123' 'Monday1' 'Winter1' 'Summer1' etc. and increment to the next number. Typically it was always capital first letter, generic word, number (like my examples above).</p>
<p>So to summarise, 90 day policies suck shit. It would be better to have an annually changed cryptic password policy (e.g. subject the password to a strong means test / length requirement). If a breach is detected then it should be changed but until then there's little point. Setup 2-factor authentication or something to mitigate risk of compromised passwords.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The theory is it limits the damage that can be done by people who knew passwords at one time to the window when the passwords are valid.</p>
<p>In practice, not so much.</p>
<p>Just for fun, try calling up your company's help desk and saying you forgot your password and need it reset.  If they don't have some reasonably foolproof way of authenticating you, then your company has no IT security.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
