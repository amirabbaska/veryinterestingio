		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You wouldnt think it but unlike most smoke THC smoke is a bronchodilator.  It was an active ingredient used in the early 1900's in asthma cigarettes (like <a href="http://antiquecannabisbook.com/chap7/CGrimault.htm" target="_blank">Grimault</a>'s) laying some doubt on the idea that it causes an increase in COPD related illnesses.  One of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1099949" target="_blank">few studies done on it in the 70s</a> showed it was comparable to medicine prescribed for asthma patients (namely isoproterenol which wouldnt be prescribed for it today) and using it in an inhaler it could stop a full blown attack in its tracks.  </p>
<p>People might downvote me for the over used comparison with Tobacco Smoke, but there is a big misconception that all smoke is equal.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1277837/" target="_blank">It isnt</a>.  Yes there are carcinogens in the smoke and people are generally getting more tar since there aren't really any comparable filters for weed as there are for tobacco cigarettes.  But two things that happen with Tobacco smoke are increased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis#Tumor_angiogenesis" target="_blank">Angiogenesis</a> which is the bodies ability to create new blood vessels, in this case specifically for cancer tumors. As well as being anti-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis" target="_blank">apoptotic</a> which is the process our cells go through when they reach their end of life, meaning they don't die properly, or in other words mutate and increase chances of cancer.  These aren't seen happening with Cannabis smoke.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is evidence that pot may increases the risk of psychosis <em>if</em> you are already vulnerable (i.e. you have a close family member with schizophrenia). There is also evidence that using earlier and using more often correlates with psychosis that starts earlier and is harder to treat than expected.</p>
<p>However, it's also possible that people who smoke a lot more often are self-medicating for symptoms that are actually the prodrome of psychosis or another mental illness. (So of course then people who use more, more often would be more likely to be diagnosed with psychosis or a psychotic disorder.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I smoked pot for 13 years 3-4 joins a day, everyday. I recently stopped to prove to myself and others that I can. I have been clean for 2 going on 3months. I had some withdrawals like couldn't sleep till late at night (2-3 am wake up at 7:30am) for the first 2 weeks now I have very vivid dreams. I do not smoke cigarettes and drink maybe 1-2 beers every 2-3 weeks. Still want to
Smoke every once and a while mainly for social reasons      But I don't give in. Ps I have just been distracting myself with work and working out here and there. P.S. I am pretty normal health wise. No heart problems never been paranoid while under the effects of pot. Mainly just wanted to hang and chill with my lady and friends. But like I said this is just me and some people like cigarettes I preferred pot. I suggest if u are going to try it. Don't make any plans of going out and being in a very public place. Don't do it around children and mainly don't have any responsibilities for a couple of hours and just find a good friend or life partner.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have been smoking weed pretty much daily for nearly 26 years now, easily 10+ a day.  I can honestly say that I have not noticed any negative effects it has had on me.   </p>
<p>As mentioned in various other comments and linked studies, if anything my smoking has helped with ongoing issues with back pain and stress, as well as helping to calm down my asthma and relax my breathing.   </p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am not a Doctor and my evidence is purely anecdotal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While many drugs have symptoms that appear rapidly weed has a longer span of time needed to produce effects. Some people can smoke weed for their entire life and have no issue similar to some people being able to handle other drugs. Only recently have scientists found results that weed (THC) has ill effects. The main reactions that happen are symptoms of withdrawal e.g. mood swings, that do tend to clear up over time. THC has been linked to mental health issues by worsening the effects of depression or interfering with medication. </p>
<p>Now here comes the less supported parts. Many people in the business environment feel that people who smoke weed are less ambitious as time goes on. Since it is hard to measure ambition it is just stated and hard to support. </p>
<p>It has been found that 1 in 10 users become addicted to weed. From what I have looked into I am unsure as to if this is an effect of  THC or the act of smoking but those who smoke weed over time also have a higher risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular issues. </p>
<p>Edit: THC, the compound responsible for the &quot;high&quot; of weed affects people differently. It is also hard to separate the difference between THC's and smoking's effects. If you want to read some of the sources I have found there is a mixture of government, organizations, and educational pages. I encourage you to read them but there will be bias as many government sources are against the use of weed. </p>

<p>The most helpful one I found was a Peer-Reviewed paper on the effects on the brain of weed but is not always easy to follow. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3037578/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3037578/</a> </p>
<p>Also some sources have suggested that the medicinal use of &quot;Cannabis&quot; has damaged the liver and kidneys less than medical drugs treating similar problems. <a href="https://www.drugscience.org/sfu/sfu_longterm.html" target="_blank">https://www.drugscience.org/sfu/sfu_longterm.html</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
