		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You only sense 3 very specific parts of that scale. Red, blue and green. All colors in the middle work simply because they tingle two receptors at once, so your brain guesses the frequency causing that tingle must be somewhere between the frequencies it actually senses.</p>
<p>Have all 3 colors come together and you get white. Have only two of them and your brain tries to make sense of it. Which basically means, magenta, combination of red and blue doesn't actually exist on electromagnetic spectrum, it's simply the color sensation you get from both red and blue rods activating. Which means, you can put red, green and blue on some wheel and then have colors between them gradually move from all blue to all red to all green and back to blue, and thus capture pretty much all colors you can sense.</p>
<p>There exists a condition where some people, mostly women, have four, instead of usual three, different colors they react to. Weird stuff, I don't know how they react to color wheels and displays that we have, all which are based on three-color eyes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is an artifact of how your eyes process color.</p>
<p>A normal human eye has cone cells sensitive to red, green, and blue.  However, the red cone is a little quirky and is also sensitive to a region in the blue spectrum.  As the frequency of light increases, the red cone fires, then the green, then both blue and the red, which is why violet looks a little reddish.  In fact, RGB screens can't produce monochromatic violet light, so they simulate it by combining red and blue in a manner the stimulates our eyes in about the same way violet would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Colours aren't exactly just frequencies. They're the result of those frequencies being detected and interpreted by our eyes. Your TV can produce the colour yellow, but (usually) it can't produce light of a frequency that we'd call yellow. It produces red light and green light, and that combination looks just as yellow as &quot;real&quot; yellow light.</p>
<p>If you want to transition smoothly from red to blue, there are two ways to do it. You could gradually change the frequency, moving through the rainbow until you get to blue. The &quot;long way&quot; around the colour wheel represents that. Alternatively, you could gradually make the red light dimmer and a blue light brighter until you have just blue light left. These mixtures of red and blue light give the &quot;short way&quot; around the wheel, through the magentas and purples. There's no single wavelength of light which corresponds to those colours, but they're still colours that you can see and name.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've tried to whittle down the explanation to the bare bones:</p>
<p>We have a bit of weirdness in how we perceive red light and blue light simultaneously, giving us something that is similar to violet.  This allows us to move fairly seamlessly from red back down to violet and then back up to blue.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can compare the light spectrum with the musical scale. It too is just frequencies on a non-periodic scale. However when you double the frequency you get the same harmonics so it is periodic. A low D and a high C sounds quite close to each other even though they are very different pitch. It is similar with light. The visible light spectrum covers one &quot;octave&quot;. For example purple is very similar to red because it is almost half the frequency. But on the spectrum scale they are at opposite ends. This is even more evident with digital camera sensors as they have a bit wider spectrum and is able to detect infrared. However it is the blue sensors that is able to detect infrared as infrared is twice the frequency of blue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
