I am aware that the body doesn't fully adjust for this, i.e. the fat content on the person body is generally the same as what it would be if the person were their correct height depending on diet and weight of course.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a very unique case: my scoliosis ended up as bad as a 68 degree curve to the left (usually curves to the right). I was corrected with surgery to I believe 5 or 10 degrees curvature. However I also have a severe pectus caranatum (chest deformity) as well as my stomach being quite high in my chest cavity. This makes it difficult to breathe at times</p>
<p>My scoliosis before surgery was quite painful and I had severe back pain and neck pain. 3 years after surgery I'm much stiffer, but no more pain unless I do a bit of lifting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>In the vast majority of people with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis, there's no appreciable damage to internal organs. The organs are well able to adapt to curvatures of the spine without serious compromise. For this patient population, the major sequelae of their scoliosis if untreated is that it may progress, lead to deformity, poor cosmesis, and back pain.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to people with what's called Neuromuscular Scoliosis. This occurs in patients with weakness -- such as patients with Muscular Dystrophy or SMA(Spinal Muscular Atrophy). In these populations, the scoliosis will invariable continue to progress, and if untreated can lead to organ damage -- most notably impaired lung function(due to difficulty with air movement), and neurological damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
