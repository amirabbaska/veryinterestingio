		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just going to Copy-Paste from another thread I replied to:</p>
<p>Ok, I do netsec &amp; net eng so without going into super specifics let's give this a whirl:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but is it now also possible Google to sell my browsing data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It always was, and they do. Google makes it's money by creating user profiles, and selling them to ad agencies, or running ads themselves. That is where their money comes from.</p>
<p>The thing is google doesn't have all your browsing data. Google has your search history, any tracking done through their ad services, your email, your location if you use google maps, and basically anything you do on chrome or stock android, especially if you are signed in.</p>
<p>Now google themselves uses this information to provide a very good service. Ever wonder why google searches tend to be the best? Well not only are they the biggest, but because of their user profile, they know what you want.</p>
<p>Take a member of /r/the_donald and /r/politics. Have those two users both search the word &quot;impeach&quot; and they will get two different suggestion lists. While both will likely have &quot;Impeach Obama&quot; and &quot;Impeach Trump&quot; they will likely be in different order.</p>
<p>This is because google is predicting what you want based on previous search history &amp; email keywords (yes google scans your email).</p>
<p>Now google provides <strong>excellent</strong> service, but there is a price to pay for it. On the internet if you are not paying for something you can assume you are the product being sold.</p>
<p>Unless of course google is your ISP. Then they get everything, because they can see everything.</p>
<hr />
<p>Onto what <em>YOU</em> can do about it. Get yourself a VPN (Virtual private Network).</p>
<p>There are many providers, I myself use NORDVPN, but they aren't the most popular due to some customer service issues, and they aren't the most secure if you aren't running on openVPN. The upside is they are relatively cheap, very simple to use, and have a lot of nodes all over the world.</p>
<p>But if you are just looking to anonymize your traffic, circumvent region locks, and maybe hide some torrenting I think they're great.</p>
<p>On to the technical side, who is a VPN and what does it do?</p>
<p>A VPN basically creates an encrypted traffic tunnel &amp; routes all your internet traffic through that.</p>
<p>So instead of seeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>workacct1484 connects to reddit.com </li>
<li>workacct1484 pulls down images from /r/unxpectedjihad</li>
<li>workacct 1484 receives torrent traffic from <nodes></li>
</ul>
<p>my ISP instead sees:</p>
<ul>
<li>workacct1484 blarglblarglc'thulhuharblehoggglyfthagn to <Server></li>
<li>workacct1484 blarglblarglr'lyehharblehoggglywtagn to <Server></li>
<li>workacct1484 blarglblarglph'ngluiharblehoggglymglw'nafh to <Server></li>
</ul>
<p>So my ISP has no idea what I am doing on that connection, only that all my traffic is going to that server. So while they <em>could</em> sell my browsing data, it would be useless.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.limevpn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/banner.png" target="_blank">Diagram</a></p>
<p>Now you might say to yourself, &quot;Self, what if the MPAA suspects workacct1484 of torrenting. Can't they sue &amp; subpoena the VPN provider for their logs?&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, they can. Which is why you need a VPN provider that does not keep logs. Many of them don't and what happens is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>MPAA sues &amp; demands VPN logs</li>
<li>VPN provider says Ok, but we don't have them. We do not keep logs. We cannot give you something we don't have.</li>
<li>MPAA curses</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if you start torrenting too much (like actually releasing the new content as node 0), or start doing more shady things like drug deals, and the FBI needs to get involved, you may be in trouble. Because a VPN can be compromised. It's not a 100% guarantee. But security isn't about being unbreachable, it's about being more secure than the attacker cares to break.</p>
<p>How do we get around this? TOR:</p>
<hr />
<p>TOR the onion browser, a necessary tool in the fight for privacy.</p>
<p>What does TOR do? Well TOR encrypts your traffic. At every. single. network hop.</p>
<p>What do I mean? Well you don't connect to reddit.com. do a traceroute to even google.com &amp; you will see many hops. Each hop TOR re-ecnrypts your traffic.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.linuxreviews.org/images/7/72/How_tor_works.png" target="_blank">Diagram</a></p>
<p>This does create a slow connection but a much more secure connection. It is not 100% secure though. If someone controls both the first &amp; last node you use, they can do reasonably well finding out your traffic with some other information. I won't get into the specifics, but suffice to say it is <strong>NOT</strong> easy, but it <em>CAN</em> be done.</p>
<hr />
<p>So if you really want to ensure privacy what do you do? Well first off, stop using chrome. Use an opensource browser like opera or firefox.</p>
<p>Second get a VPN.</p>
<p>Third use TOR over that VPN.</p>
<p>Fourth, start calling your representatives &amp; telling them how you feel, then GET OUT &amp; VOTE. Representatives can see who is registered to vote, if you call or email and bitch, but aren't registered to vote, they do not give a single fuck about your opinion.</p>
<p>Finally, realize you lack the money &amp; expertise to stop a truly dedicated attacker with any sufficient backing.</p>
<hr />
<p>And finally what does this mean for you?</p>
<p>For the average person. Nothing. You will not really see an impact from ISPs selling your browsing data to advertisers. Because it's already happening. And it's not just ISPs. It's google, microsoft, apple, amazon, onstar, basically everyone does it. Especially facebook. </p>
<h1>GET THE FUCK OFF FACEBOOK IF YOU CARE AT ALL ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY.</h1>
<p>They are literally public enemy #1 when it comes to privacy.</p>
<p>But why should you care?</p>
<p>Because these people are often very careless. Not because they choose to be, but because they honestly don't give two flying fucks about your data. And if they get compromised other people may be able to view your data. Maybe your company buys your data &amp; sees you looking for a new job &amp; fires you. Maybe your neighbor buys your history &amp; sees that you frequent /r/clopclop (NSFW) and uses that to blackmail or embarrass you because you called them out at a school PTA meeting. Maybe an identity thief sees you going to <Local Credit Union>.com and now can focus their attack.</p>
<p>If you don't think your internet history matters, then post it here. All of it. Oh and everything you cleared. And everything done in &quot;private&quot; browsing modes.</p>
<p>And because, personally, I just don't think it's right. You should be allowed privacy. You shouldn't be tracked, and monitored, and sold like cattle. You are a person, not a commodity. And because very often people do not have choice in ISPs, you need to actually fight for your rights because the market is not &quot;free&quot; and there are no realistic competitive options.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It could mean invasion of internet privacy, more information for third party affiliates (ADs, blackmail) that come from you.</p>
<p>Plus National Agencies that bulk search your information, all this is controversial and not publicly admitted nor should be taken to heart in truth but the very fact that ISP does this opens a lot of doors.</p>
<p>Australia has some of the worst internet in the world, they also have a law in which meta data (websites you visit) can be kept up for 2 years by your ISP.  This is usually so the our agencies can get some private information to link you dangerous things or advertisement data selling.</p>
<p>As other have said, having a VPN protects you in a small way against a small threat, it will encrypt your traffic and make it harder for the ISPs to figure exactly what traffic, what website you are on. But some ISPs do have tools that narrow it down to exactly kind of data, not what data but what kind if you are using text, video, torrenting. Nethertheless, unless you have leaks, they shouldn't find out anything about what you are doing.</p>
<p>Commerical VPNs are not the trustworthy in the sense of absolute security as they could be monitored, bought but they do protect you from ISPs as they usually don't have the power nor interest to chase your data.</p>
<p>Either ways, a VPN is not absolutely secure but it should provide doubt and shouldn't link you to any data that the ISP can use. If they tell you to stop using a VPN or link you to something. That's a basic invasion of privacy and would recommend switching. What ISP is directly selling browser history anyways?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
