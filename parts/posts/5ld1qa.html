		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>as u/Midnight Rising said, you use your muscles all day long. however you also use them to an extent at night. they tend to tighten up do to this. most people compare muscles to a rubber band, however when you use a rubber band, you cause it to wear down and break. when you use a muscle it actualy tightens. this is usually do to some chemical you release during activities  (someone help me I don't remember the chemical). </p>
<p>so basically think of your muscles as a rope. and using them ties knots in said rope. these muscles are connected to different things, so having more rope to spare makes it easier to work with. however, by making these knots, you have &quot;less&quot; rope and it makes it harder to move.</p>
<p>stretching is like untying those knots. you give out &quot;more&quot; rope and make it easier to move or do things. your muscles are more free and less inhibited. it's not so much that stretching feels good as it is that not stretching feels bad. it's just the comparison of before and after that makes you feel better.</p>
<p>side note, you should stretch often and thoroughly. tight muscles are a pain in that area, however they can cause more pain after a period of time due to the areas they connect. for example my back hurts a lot due to my posture. but many areas of my back hurt due to the knotted muscles pulling on other objects. </p>
<p>and for the love of God if I'm wrong please someone correct me in a nice way so I can do better for myself, and forgive any typos. kinda drunk</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, a lot of things that are good for you &quot;feel good.&quot; It's like nature's motivation. Eating feels good, which is nature's way of motivating you to take in energy. Having sex feels good, which is nature's way of motivating you to reproduce. I think somewhere along the line in evolution, essential tasks/behaviors became intertwined with the activation of reward centers in your brain. So if in some bizarro universe licking your nipples was essential for your survival, that would feel good too, because everybody who hated licking nipples would've died off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After long periods of inactivity, your muscles, tendons, legements, etc., are at rest. When you stretch, your body releases these chemicals called marklar that, much like n-dolphins, help you feel better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
