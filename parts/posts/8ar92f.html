		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pigment in your skin that gives you your color is called melanin. When you're exposed to the sun, your skin produces more melanin to protect you from the sun's radiation, this is a tan. </p>
<p>Some people don't have their melanin evenly distributed throughout their skin. Instead, it's clumped together into little spots. Freckles are just a tan in people whose melanin is clumped into spots. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two semi-related questions as a fairly freckled fellow...</p>
<p>1) I skinned my shoulder and got really bad rug burn like 15 years ago.  Freckles refuse to appear there now.  Is that because I haven't exposed it to enough UV to reform, or did I &quot;kill&quot; the pigmentation?</p>
<p>2) There are places, like lower legs that get little to no UV light and yet have deep dark freckles year-round.  My guess is a freckle's impact by UV varies and some are just dark no matter what...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
