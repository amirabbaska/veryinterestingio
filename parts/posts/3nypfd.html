		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is something that actually begins happening in the womb, and continues throughout life, but we're not sure exactly why.</p>
<p>we know it has to do with REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. Some suggest that during REM sleep, certain brain cells that release noradrenaline are switched off, and these cells are associated with inhibiting the penis becoming erect.</p>
<p>another suggestion is that more Nitric Oxide (NO) than usual is released during REM sleep. NO is a vasodilator, which means it increases the width of blood vessels, increasing the blood flow to the penis.</p>
<p>P.S. this is my first ELI5 answer, I hope it's simple enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Men have several night-time erections. On average, a healthy man has three to five erections during a full night's sleep, with each erection lasting 25-35 minutes. It's common for men to wake up with an erection, informally called a &quot;morning glory or wood&quot;. This is in fact the last in the series of night-time erections.</p>
<p>During the sleep cycle, the extra blood increases oxygenation as it serves as a system of repair and helps to maintain functionality. Morning wood is just a remnant of REM sleep, which is why men wake up to erections</p>
<p>Just like men, the absence of norepinephrine during the REM phase of the sleep causes erections. In women, this phenomenon is called Nocturnal clitoral tumescence while it is called Nocturnal penile tumescence in men. In women, not only the clitoris get engorged with blood but the vagina too.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every time a man enter REM sleep, he gets an erection (women's clitoris' get a similar thing that happens to it, as well, as some lubrication).  Although people's sleep cycles in and out of the various stages (in 90-120 minute cycles), the amount of time spent in each different type of sleep changes as the night progresses.  </p>
<p>Basically, you get the majority of your REM sleep in the morning (especially the last two hours). And since REM cause all men (with working penises) to get erections, you get wood near wake up time.  If you wake up out of REM.... morning wood is observed.</p>
<p>aside: this is how we test for erectile dysfunction and whether it's a physical problem or it's a mental problem. If it's mental, erection in REM still happen. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As has been stated before, men get erection during REM phase of the dream, but I would want to speculate more why it actually happens.</p>
<p>According to some evolutionary biologists, it was beneficial for our ancestors to get erected during deep sleep, because erection prevents urinating. Sleeping is activated by the same parasympathetic system that enables us to pee, so erection could be body's physiological mean to counter nocturia. Urinating while sleeping could have exposed our ancestors for predators who locate their prey by smell. </p>
<p>More over, nocturia is common with young boys, who wet their beds until their physiology enables erection. When a man grows old and loses the ability to get erected, nocturia or nightly incontinence usually comes back. </p>
<p>Or maybe this is just bollocks and erection during REM only happens because of an absurd bug in our genetic code.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
