		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not actually a chemistry effect but a physics one. Metal is a very good heat conductor which means it can change temperature very rapidly. What happens as you touch the spoon to the ice is that the warm spoon heats the ice up and a thin layer melts into water. But this removes the heat from the spoon. There's plenty of ice and the spoon is now cold so that thin layer of water freezes again - with the bottom of the spoon in it, trapping it in the top layer of the ice. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This only happens to extremely cold ice as he phenomena relies of the spoon's ability to conduct heat well to 1) rapidly melt the ice where the 2 surfaces meet with the residual heal from a room temperature spoon, 2) the remaining bulk of the ice cooling down the spoon to or below 0c (this is where super cold ice is important), and then the cooled spoon freezing back a small amount of that molten ice back into solid, essentially adhering the 2 together, but not firmly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
