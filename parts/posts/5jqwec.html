Also, when I say teachers, I'm really mainly referring to elementary and high school teachers.  It just seems to me like those who are charged with educating our children for almost all of their early lives, and those who are charged with serving and protecting, would get paid a little bit more than they do.  I work in IT, and while it's not by much, my entry level position is paid more than an entry level patrol officer with the police department.</p></div></div>
