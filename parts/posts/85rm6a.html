Apperently they have enough sperm to keep the two remaining ladies getting pregnant, but it is not that straight forward of course.</p>
<p>To my surprise however, I read that there are thousands of their Southern counterparts left. I don't have a clue about the differences between the two though. Although the reasons they are still around might be really interesting, I am more interested in the biological difference between north and south. Could 'we' rejuvinate the northern species by using their southern brethren? How different are they?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Northern and Southern once though of as subspecies (like different breeds of domestic dogs) are believed to be of different species entirely. DNA evaluation shows it is an evolutionary divergent lineage a million or so years ago. They are similar in that they both have wide mouths as they are both grazers (where their names came from). But other than that are as different to each other as they are to the black rhino, different morphology, different genetically. Like domestic dogs are similar species to <del>wolves</del> foxes, coyotes etc NOT subspecies.</p>
<p>Edit: as others have pointed out, wolves and dogs ARE sub-species. But foxes and coyotes etc are not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

by Helen Pilcher  has a good chapter about this. Basically the Northern White Rhino has been functionally extinct for years. The sad truth is it's just a waiting game to find out the exact of when they will disappear, likely forever.</p>
<p>Based on physical appearances we believed the Northern and Southern White Rhinos were sub species and therefore it was not as important to to protect them both individually.  It turns out we were wrong, the northern and southern whites cannot crossbread, meaning they are more genetically distinct from each other that dogs/wolves, horses/zebra, cattle/bison and any other cross-able species.</p>
<p>They tried a bunch of things to save the species but the only remaining specimens were too old or had other problems making breeding impossible. They tried artificial insemination but it's very difficult because rhinos have complex labyrinthine vaginal canals. Which has also made it very hard to try to implant IVF eggs into the southern rhino species as a type of genetic rescue, it could risk the surrogate mother's life.</p>
<p>We have preserved DNA from these three and several other white rhinos, but at this point (and for years now) the only chance of preserving this species is through genetic rescue, essentially finding a safe way to clone these last few animals and implant them into an existing rhino species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>To touch on this part of your comment, the two females are unable to get pregnant but it's believed their eggs are viable so Kenya is working on developing a method for extracting those eggs.  If successful, they can implant a genetically pure Northern White Rhino fertilized egg into a southern rhino surrogate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here are the basics to get you started:</p>
<p>1- Subspecies definition</p>
<p>The fact that these are considered subspecies, and not full species, tells us that whoever researched them originally decided they were not genetically different enough to be their own species. I can't claim genetics were definitely involved (in &quot;early days&quot; subspecies vs. species depended on how differently two populations looked and behaved, which is still relevant today in some cases).</p>
<p>Here is a really non-scientific example of what this means. We humans are all one species. Let's say, in no racist manner, that &quot;Americans&quot; are considered the standard human. The British are then discovered. The British are clearly humans, but they sound a little odd, look a bit different, and occur in a different part of the world. They are not different enough to be their own species, but possibly a subspecies (the English and Americans are not actually their own subspecies, but this is a fictional example). In other words, a subspecies is very similar to the original, but not completely.</p>
<p>So, compared to the other rhino species, the death of one subspecies is not quite as important. Why? Because the species still survives (white rhino), just that one population (a subspecies) will die out (the northern subspecies). The loss of a subspecies does not mean the animal is extinct entirely, because another subspecies still exists. A subspecies however does represent a unique genetic variant of the &quot;white rhino&quot; species and should be preserved if possible, but it isn't as bad as losing an entire species.</p>
<p>So anyone mourning &quot;the loss of a species&quot; is not wrong, but they aren't right either, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>2- Rejuvenation</p>
<p>So there are a few factors here but we can't straight up impregnate a southern white rhino with northern genetics. That would produce a hybrid, and hybrids are 50/50 of each. That doesn't save anything, because hybrids can never produce pure parents. You can mix red and white paint, to get pink paint, but you can never get pure red and white back out.</p>
<p>I'm not so up on the actual science of solutions here, but to actually rejuvenate the northern white rhino you would have to have 100% northern DNA involved. From my explanation you would expect there to be a &quot;base white rhino DNA&quot; and then DNA specific to each subspecies. Sadly it isn't that simple, you can't just take a &quot;basic white rhino DNA&quot; from southern and combine it with &quot;unique northern DNA&quot;. It just doesn't work that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
