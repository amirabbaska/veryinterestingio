		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of factors that come into play when it comes down to coffee and caffeine. Question to you is, are you buying the same type of coffee every time you go or is it a different type? Caffeine levels in coffee vary from brewing method all the way down to the type of beans, ground level, temperature, brew time, etc.
TLDR; There are a ton of ways caffeine content inside coffee can vary based on the way it is prepared.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a similar experience with coffee. Some days I'll drink half a pot and don't notice a thing. Other times I've drank a single cup and feel jacked. </p>
<p>I drink coffee black. </p>
<p>Never more than two consecutive mornings in a row.</p>
<p>Always on an empty stomach before breakfast.</p>
<p>Assuming you always consume your coffee the same way each morning. </p>
<p>I suppose it could be associated with the caffeine content of the coffee or a host of different variables about the profile of the coffee. </p>
<p>-How old is the coffee bean
-How long ago was it roasted
-How long ago was the coffee brewed
-Type of coffee
-Etc....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the answers are reasonable but for me it's about how much/quality of sleep I got the night before. The more rested I am the less wired I get with a big cup of coffee. The days where I've had less sleep than normal or even staying up all night then going for big cup, I get wired to bits after even couple sips. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brain chemistry and hormone fluctuations. Think of this - some days you are just in a good mood. Some days you might be crabby for no apparent reason.  Our bodies are not perfect at maintaining perfect and exact chemical and hormonal harmony. They tend to fluctuate from all kinds of factors: sleep, exercise, diet, etc. And in many cases, and with many people, these fluctuations can occur without much outside influence and even require medication to assist maintaining normal or consistent levels. In any case, the introduction of something like caffeine can greatly affect those sometime subtle fluctuation levels and seem to affect us differently base on where our bodies chemistry or hormonal levels currently are. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
