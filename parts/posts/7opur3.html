		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Measuring the age of the universe doesn't really involve relativity because we're not comparing reference frames from different observers. If have 2 observers in 2 different reference frames, they might not agree on the age of the universe, but that's not really useful information for us.</p>
<p>The main way we've measured the age of the universe is by measuring it's rate of expansion and working backwards. The further away an object is, the faster it's accelerating away from us. From this, we were able to make a model of the universe's expansion, and work backwards to when it was first expanding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The age of the universe is given typically in the frame of reference where the background radiation of the universe is homogenous and isotopic. That is to say, it looks the same in all directions. </p>
<p>To your question, I want to stress that this age is no more or less valid than another frame of reference in which the universe could be much younger. However it is the frame in which the universe is oldest, and it has some practical applications.</p>
<p>In other frames of reference, the universe could be much different in age and this poses no conflict.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to reframe the original question, because I'm not entirely sure it was answered throughout this thread:</p>
<p>If two observers were to measure the age of the universe from two different points, one from the Earth, and the other from, for example, the orbit of a massive black hole (a point where space-time would be relatively skewed compared to Earth), would both observers get the same answer? If so or if not, then how/why?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When an abulance zooms past you the pitch of the sound is different when its rushing towards you vs once its past you. This is called the doppler effect and is a consequence of the sound waves being affected by the ambulance zooming towards you or zooming away from you.</p>
<p>Light is a wave too. And a similar effect happens to light waves travelling through the universe because the univserse is expanding. This is conceptually quite hard to imagine because when i say expanding i dont mean things are just flying away from each other and thus the total size of the observable universe got bigger but actually, the SPACE itself is expanding. This is easier to imagine when you get rid of a dimension, namely the third one and just think about the surface of a balloon. Lets draw a couple galaxies on the surface of that balloon, then pump air into it and the balloon will expand and the galaxy drawings will get farther apart from each other. </p>
<p>This is whats happening to our universe but in 3D , not. 2D. Whats even weirder is that we have no idea WHY this is happening and instead call this force thats expanding the universe , making everything accelerate away from us, dark energy. Its estimated to make up about 70% of the universe, with dark matter, the other made up part of the universe which allows galaxies to be heavy enough to not fly apart, making up around over 20% of the universe and normal matter, the stuff you me stars and planets are made from is sitting at under 10, so we dont even know what more than 90% of the universe is made up of!</p>
<p>How this tells us the age of the universe is because we can look into the night sky and the further away something is the more red shifted due to the doppler effect it is, as well as the further back in time we are looking since the light has taken longer to reach us, and thus become more red shifted in wavelength due to travelling through an expanding universe for a longer time.  We can observe right up until the universe becomes opaque due to it being too hot and dense that light did not travel in straight lines so it becomes impossibke to 'see' anything anymore. Akin to looking through a jar of water, you can see the other side but pour some milk into the jug and your just going to see some illumination penetrating the milky solution, not objects anymore.  We can mathenatically model how long we think it takes for the univefse to go from big bang to the first point in which light waves were gwnerally travelling in straight lines and we can tell how far back this point was in time by how red shifted the light reaching us from then is. That information plus our refined estimates of the rate of expansion of the universe allows us to tell the age of the universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that puzzles me...  In order to determine the age and size of the universe, they are using what we can observe and extrapolating from that, correct?
If I'm understanding correctly, then these numbers don't really mean anything, because the universe likely exists well beyond what we can observe, and we likely aren't in the center of the universe, so the actual &quot;edge&quot; of the universe could be a different distance from us depending on which way you look.</p>
