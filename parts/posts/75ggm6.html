		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is called bioregenerative life support, and in falls in the broader category of Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS). Short answer is yes, but not infinite and not without disadvantages.</p>
<p>Note that plants aren't the only way to recycle oxygen. Currently they use water electrolysis to inject oxygen into their atmosphere, and use the resulting hydrogen to apply the Sabatier reaction with CO2. This yields methane as a waste product, and captures oxygen from CO2 in the form of water, so they can later apply electrolysis again and recycle oxygen.</p>
<p>A clear advantage of using plants would be trapping carbon into edible forms, so you'd be recycling not only oxygen but also food. However, not all plants have a 100% edible mass, and those who do usually offer very few calories if not negligible (e.g. lettuce).</p>
<p>A problem with plants is that they could die under some conditions, so this system isn't 100% reliable. And in any case, whether bioregenerative or artificially regenerative, you can never achieve a 100% reuse of ECLSS resources. But it's ok, you can get close enough and have them for a long time relying on very little supplies.</p>
<p>They are actively researching on this topic. Recently they've been able to grow lettuce in the ISS.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whoa something I can answer - I worked on the Lunar Greenhouse Module at the University of Arizona! </p>
<p>Bioregenerative Life Support Systems could continually produce oxygen and some amount of food (our goal was always atmospheric conditioning with food production as a windfall of that). In fact, you kind of have to decide if you'd like the plants to focus on growing leaves for oxygen production or fruits for food production. Either way, there are a lot of challenges in feeding those plants. We proposed using composters to recycle human waste to make the system fully sustainable, as plants &quot;breathe&quot; pure water out which could then be utilized as drinking water as well. I don't know all the details about that part of it, as that wasn't my section. We also intended to use Fresnel lenses with fiber optic cables to deliver sunlight directly to the plants, with blue and red LEDs as a backup (it'd be placed underground because the moon lacks an atmosphere to burn up space debris).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, hydroponics would have difficulty in a low gravity environment like the ISS without some real specialized design, which the plants may not like. The moon would give us an environment that is a little more familiar to us and the plants. </p>
<p>Edit: the guys in charge of it did an AMA a couple years ago if anyone wants to look around for more info without leaving Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3npxoj/move_over_hollywood_we_are_roberto_furfaro_and/?st=J8LQQOVW&amp;sh=91652fb3" target="_blank">Link</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants are very finicky. While having them in space would be the most logical way to produce life support, it is difficult because of a lack of gravity. While we have been able to grow sunflowers aboard the ISS, the lack of gravity showed some problems in their development.</p>
<p>Plants require gravity to tell then which direction their roots should grow. Obviously, down means soil. Without gravity, plants become lost and will have more difficulty growing, resulting in limp produce.</p>
<p>While there has been some success, growing plants in space is still unreliable, but will improve in the near future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Unfortunately, it failed as they were not able to replenish the oxygen quickly enough.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean it's impossible, but it didn't work previously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In terms of &quot;garden&quot; you'd be talking &quot;another iss&quot;. The experiment to grow food on the iss also was a bit trickier than intended (more time than expected, process revised)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
