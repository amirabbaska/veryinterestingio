		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason they were fined is because they sold US made/designed goods to Iran and North Korea, among other permitted countries.  They want to continue to sell those goods to the &quot;other permitted countries&quot; but would be prevented from doing so if they didn't pay the fine.</p>
<p>They have tangible assets in the US, if they refuse to pay the fine the US could seize those assets.</p>
<p>Like most companies engaged in international trade they use the US banking system.  If they refused to pay the fine they would be prevented from using the US banking system, which could destroy their ability to do business in much of the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
