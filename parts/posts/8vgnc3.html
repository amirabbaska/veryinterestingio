		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>5G Is completely different to 4G - 4G was essentially the same as 3G but bigger and better. Bigger pipes allowed better speed and capacity. 5G allows for much more intelligent use of network capacity, such as being attached to multiple cells at once and being able to make one call or data session. We haven't had the ability to do that in the past and it effectively gives us a massive advantage in load balancing traffic. 4G will continue to be developed, in the same way as 2G kit still plays a part in modern networks, and is still subject to upgrades and optimisation. It's just the developments had been to allow the big changes that warrant the 5G status, and it can be argued that these are all changes that we need as soon as possible</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
