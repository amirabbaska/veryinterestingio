		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To Clarify: I want to know if the body evens sleep deprivation or &quot;catches up&quot; over time, even if you do not compensate with extra sleep. For instance, if I have a night where I only get 4 hours of sleep, I would try to get 9 hours of sleep the following night to &quot;catch up&quot;. However if I only get the recommended sleep around approximately 7.5 hours the following night, will I then still be in a sleep loss? If so, how many nights consisting of a &quot;normal&quot; amount of sleep will I need to regulate one bad night?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We just talked about this in my psychology class today. There's a case study about this guy who, as a high school student, wanted to break the record of longest number of days without sleep (which was 11 days at the time). He made it 12 days, probably with some &quot;micro sleeps&quot; here and there. He suffered all kinds of side effects, from headaches to irritability to hallucinations and more. When he finished, he slept about 12 hours a night for three or four nights and was right back to normal with no lasting effects and was able to go back to a regular sleep schedule. So really the idea of your body having to catch up isn't completely accurate. Your body just needs sleep in general to function properly and consolidate memories/repair itself. If you have one sleepless night you'll probably have a rough day, but if you get the recommended amount of sleep the following night you should be right back on track. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We sleep to remove the waste products our neurons create while they function. During sleep, the neurons narrow, and the glymphatic pathways expands, allowing significantly more passive flow of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that carries the waste products out of the brain. </p>
<p>The longer we go without sleep, the higher the concentration of the waste products in the fluid. This would also mean that proportionately more waste product is removed from the brain if you have gone longer without sleeping--in the same number of hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Following this line of thought, when you are 'catching up on sleep' you do not need to make up hours additively. The first few hours of sleep are proportionately the best. This makes sense with the anecdotes you read in the other comments.</p>
<p>Source: Interest with sleep stuff &amp; medical background &amp; did some neuro research in medical school-but I'm also not a neuroanatomist. The first 1.5 paragraphs is based on recent research, the last bit is biologically-plausible theorizing based on this brand-new research behind the glymphatic system, which provides a basis for why we need sleep at all. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long time ago (more than 5 years ago) I read in a science magazine about this subject. </p>
<p>If you go a night without sleep, you should continue your regular sleep pattern the following nights, it only takes a few nights of sleep to &quot;catch up&quot; no matter how much sleep you have missed on the first night. What is important is to keep the same sleep pattern all weekdays, because it is more healthy for the body. So young man, this is why you are not allowed to stay up late in the weekends. Now go back to bed.</p>
<p>I read this long ago, so I cannot come with an actual source and cannot guarantee if the research is up to date.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<li>
<p>yes, but only a tiny teensy weensy little bit tired</p>
</li>
<li>for a bad night, it depends how bad. if you're a little tired, it will take 1 normal night. if you're pretty tired, it will take 2 normal nights. if you're super duper tired it will take 3 nights. if your eyes fall out, 4 or 5 nights.</li>
