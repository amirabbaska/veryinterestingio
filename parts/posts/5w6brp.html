		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like all processes and activities controlled by the brain, paying attention requires the release of neurotransmitters onto neurons (in this case, specifically those associated with motivation and learning).</p>
<p>A prolonged and constant stimulus (e.g. listening to a long lecture) that induces neurotransmitter release can use up all the neurotransmitter, which would cause the neural pathway to become fatigued. Therefore, the neurons involved in this activity are said to have become acclimatized - unresponsive to further stimulation.</p>
<p>Acclimatized neurons are the reason you space out. The particular regions of the brain involved in motivation and learning about the given subject are simply out of neurotransmitter and can't process further inputs.</p>
<p>However, these neurons can be responsive again once they reuptake the neurotransmitters. This happens automatically but occurs fastest when you preoccupy yourself in another activity, which allows a different set of neurons to be used instead of the ones that are fatigued.</p>
<p>Some people space out less than others because the same activity might activate a different number of neurons or have a different pattern of neuronal activation from person to person. In brains where the total activation is spread out among more neurons, the fatigue takes longer to set in.</p>
<p>So a person who loves history might actually enjoy a long, complicated, and monotonous lecture on the Civil War because it activates different parts of his brain over a larger volume of it. Whereas, in a person who is not interested in history, the lecture would stimulate (and strain) the few parts of the brain that they would use to try to understand the lecture, such as those associated with speech and memory.     </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain regions most strongly implicated in mind wandering are called the default mode network.  This network has abnormal properties in people who have ADHD.  The default mode network is the part of the brain that is most active when spacing out, when thinking of oneself, and when thinking about ones social group.  The Wikipedia article has some great pictures.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Attention is mainly due to dopamine. Sometimes get too much dopamine from a particular tract of sensory neurons delivering information to your brain. </p>
<p>So it seems dopamine is highly elevated prior to ejaculating to porn, and then comes crashing down afterwards, and by doing that we are actually killing our dopamine receptors and weak neurons in the brain and it's all because of the abnormal hit of dopamine.</p>
<p>It also has to do with subclinical electrical changes in random parts of the brain that don't fire when they aren't in sync. It'd be like if you're on the Titanic to send a morse code message asking for help, but you have no sense of rhythm and you send a jumble of beeps. So the morse code listener is not alarmed by an SOS message, but just thinking it is noise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
