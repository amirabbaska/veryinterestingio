		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some other great answers here, but I want to add a couple of things:</p>
<p>First of all, the human eye is sensitive to red, green, and blue. That's what makes those colors special. There's nothing magical about those colors that make them &quot;primary&quot;, it's entirely based on what the human eye sees.</p>
<p>We sense other colors based on a combination of those receptors. So if we see pure yellow light, we perceive it as somewhere between red and green.</p>
<p>On a computer monitor, if you mix red and green in just the right way, it's indistinguishable <em>to the human eye</em>.</p>
<p>To a different animal, the computer monitor might look terrible!</p>
<p>Now think about pigments.</p>
<p>Red paint doesn't glow, it doesn't give off red light. Rather, it <em>absorbs</em> green and blue light, and reflects the red.</p>
<p>So when mixing paints, more light is absorbed, not less. It subtracts from what's reflected to our eyes.</p>
<p>That's why if you take the exact opposite of red, green, and blue, you can produce any color on paper.</p>
<p>The opposite of red is cyan.</p>
<p>The opposite of green is magenta.</p>
<p>The opposite of blue is yellow.</p>
<p>By mixing cyan, magenta, and yellow, you can <em>subtact</em> from white paper to get any color you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally something I can answer.  </p>
<p>The short answer is: you've been lied to your whole life about the primary colors.  They are in fact Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow, in the context of pigments.  These are the subtractive primaries. In the context of light, they are Red, Green, and Blue.  these are the additive primaries.  That's why the pixels on your monitor are red, green and blue, but on your printer, the ink is a mixture of cyan, magenta, and yellow.  your monitor is producing a colored pixel by adding the three primaries together in different combinations.  your printer is producing a colored dot on paper by absorbing various combinations of these same primaries.</p>
<p>Essentially, CMY is the inverse of RGB, and you can visualize it by understanding this -- ink &quot;produces&quot; colors by absorbing certain light and reflecting others, while a monitor simply emits a combination of primary colors.  Your monitor is black until some colors are lit up.  your paper is white (it reflects all wavelengths) until certain colors are absorbed (certain wavelengths are prevented from being reflected).</p>
<p>In order to produce a red color, your printer mixes magenta and yellow pigments.  This is because the magenta ink absorbs green light, while the yellow ink absorbs blue light, leaving only red light to be reflected to your eye.  Similarly, cyan and yellow produce green because the cyan absorbs the red while the yellow absorbs blue.  you can work out the rest for yourself.</p>
<p>You can think of the different colored inks as different filters.  If you mix all three inks together they will filter out all three of the additive primary colors, producing a black dot of ink.  (of course your $100 printer is not always perfect, and mixing CMY together is a waste of expensive ink, so there is almost always a black cartridge called the key color -- that's the K in CMYK.)</p>
<p>Basically you've been taught a dumbed down version of what the primary colors are since you were a toddler learning to finger paint.  the people who made your printer know the real truth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Red, Blue and Green are &quot;additive&quot; colours, meaning if you mix them perfectly you get white. Paper is already white, so it doesn't work as well. Cyan, Magenta and Yellow are &quot;subtractive&quot; colours meaning if you mix them perfectly you get black, it's almost impossible to mix them perfectly though so a different ink is used for black. You save a lot more ink subtracting from white on already white paper .</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CMYK produces the largest color gamut while remaining efficient at only 4 colors on pretty much all presses.  Color gamut is the area a press can reproduce of a LAB value chart (color chart)</p>
<p>If you were to look at the color gamut of RGB vs. the color gamut of CMYK, you would understand why.  Then look at the color gamut of OGCMYKV (Orange, Green, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black, Violet) for an even larger color gamut.</p>
<p>Depending on the color accuracy the client needs, you can pick the best process for the job.  CMYK will satisfy most clients.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary colours of light - that which your eyes see and computer monitors display - work off combinations of red, blue and green (RGB)</p>
<p>CYMK (Cyan, Yellow, Magenta, Key/Black) are the primary colours used for printing and ink, printing and ink work off combinations of these colours.</p>
<p>Note that red, blue and yellow haven't been mentioned. They're the primary colours of paint and paint colours are what typically forms the basis of colour theory. The concept  of &quot;you've been lied to your whole life if you think these are the primary colours&quot; is bull, and I'm sure your education demonstrated that the paint colour theory taught to people is not bull.</p>
<p>Three colour sysems because of different media and methods - light, ink and paint. We just teach people about paint primaries due to it being the basis of colour theory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
