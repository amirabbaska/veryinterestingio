		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you speak, you hear your own voice as it sounds vibrating through your head (for lack of a better way to say that). </p>
<p>When you hear your voice through a recorder, you're hearing your voice without that vibration. </p>
<p>Edit: Had I know so many people would see this, I would have tried explaining a lot better than I did here but thanks either way!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you can't hear yourself correctly how can you impersonate someone else correctly? I know my Michael Cane impression sounds perfect in my head, but when I hear it recorded it sounds way more nasally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
