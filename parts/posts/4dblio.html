		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is yes. </p>
<p>The simplest expression for the static pressure of a fluid, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatics#Hydrostatic_pressure" target="_blank">hydrostatic pressure</a> (P), is:</p>
<p>P = phg,</p>
<p>where p is the density, and h is the height and g is the gravity of Earth. In other words, to a great approximation, to figure out the pressure at the bottom of a body of water, all you have to know is the height and density of the <em>column</em> of water above it. The reason is that the static pressure is caused by the weight of all the water directly above it. As a result, you don't have to worry about the total amount of water in the body, nor even the shape of the container, as summarized <a href="http://i.imgur.com/SZpcw8S.gif" target="_blank">in this neat infogram</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: Just to be explicit about why this answer is approximate, there are two key simplifications that I made: 1) I ignored the position of the column with respect to the sea level (which affects how much air sits on top of the water and adds to the total pressure), 2) I assumed the column was wide enough that you could ignore <a href="http://i.imgur.com/CLbYUeM.jpg" target="_blank">edge effects such as capillary action</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add something that was bugging me: water pressure doesn't double every so-and-so many meters, that would lead to insane pressures really quickly. Instead, you just add one atm in pressure for every ~10 meters. It's adding, not multiplying. Since your calculation was correct, I'm assuming that you meant the right thing, but I couldn't just leave that alone. Sorry :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. Technically it would be the pressure under the ocean minus 100 feet of air since I assume it's in the sky. But, if the tank is rigid and applies pressure back into the water to keep it in a column, you will feel the pressure. Fluids are cool like that, they have constant pressure along constant elevation. If the tank were a cylinder, rectangle, triangle, or the ocean, 100 feet under is 100 feet of pressure. The formula for static fluid pressure is density of the fluid <em> gravity of the planet </em> depth under the fluid you are at. </p>
