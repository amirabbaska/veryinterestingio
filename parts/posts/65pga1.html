		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read about how people, after a complete corpus callosotomy, can continue performing tasks requiring coordinated action from their right and left sides, e.g. running. Yet, if the brain hemispheres can not communicate directly, then in such cases, how does the coordination, or even the initiation of a gross action occur? Could it be like this:</p>
<p>Let's say there is a stimulus to run, e.g. a dinosaur comes chasing and both hemisphere fire, yet whichever side gets going first, the other side starts complementing it with a response that will keep the body balanced and running. E.g. If one side speeds up, the other either agrees and speeds up accordingly, or maybe it quarrels. But both sides know that it is in their interest to escape the velociraptor.  </p>
<p>Essentially, I'd guess that the hemispheres' coordination is via the feedback that they receive from the already effectuated actions of their other half. Maybe this occurs on a subconscious level for both sides? Anyways, if true, I can't understand how it doesn't lead to massive problems, e.g. you see your Ex and one side want's to interact and the other wants to walk off. On the other hand, does the operation enable legitimate multitasking? </p>
<p>Finally, as a extra, is there any resolution for the debate on whether split brains constitute to 2 incomplete minds in 1 body? It seems reasonable to say, no? Sorry for the long post. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Severing the corpus callosum would not totally destroy your proprioception since that is at least somewhat handled by your cerebellum, so at first and certainly over time you would understand where your limbs are at all times.  Just because the largest tract in the brain is severed it doesn't mean you just have two separate brains now, the vermis of the cerebellum is still there, maybe information would even eventually learn to cross over lower in the brain stem.  The brain is amazingly elastic sometimes!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They still can do basic motor tasks involving coordination, not complex (for a while, anyways). Basically, the corpus callosum connects both hemispheres of brain, this makes it easier for us to use our coordination more efficiently. So they still can do these functions, but it's two different sets of motions and thought processes. </p>
<p>Use an example of tying your shoes. When you tie your shoe, you don't think for both your hands, you just act and think of the action of tying your shoes, and act.
They on the other hand, have to have two different thought processes for each of their movements, as they can't connect the motions together properly.</p>
<p>These motor functions are simply more complex and complicated, rather than impossible</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are other direct tracts that link the two hemispheres without having to pass through lower brain structures.  The corpus collosum is only one of three such &quot;commisural fibers&quot;.  They can do some of the work that the CC does in normals.</p>
<p>Everyone on this thread should look at the drawing of a coronal section (What you'd see if a samurai standing to the side of me hacks my head in two with a downward strike) in the link below. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to remember that the cerebellum contains more than half of the neurons in your entire brain, and is largely responsible for &quot;quieting&quot; unwanted or unwarranted neural signals. This &quot;mini-brain&quot; not only coordinates but &quot;cleans&quot; motor signals in the brain, allowing us to have smooth and coordinated motions. </p>
<p>We can thank our cerebellum for any kind of fine motor control, motor memory/learning, and general motor control. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
