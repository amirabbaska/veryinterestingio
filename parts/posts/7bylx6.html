<p>You can multiply both sides of an equation by -1, and it is still equal.</p>
<p>in fact, calling electrons positive would have made current a bit easier in typical situations because charge carriers would move in the way of the current.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Benjamin Franklin had a 50-50 chance of making the usual charge carriers the positive charge, but he blew it. He had no idea of the existence of protons and electrons, and when we did find out about them, the laws of electro-magnetism were well established and it was too late for a sign change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have answered the question, but I wanted to add that what you're asking is the difference between &quot;Conventional Current&quot; and &quot;Electron Flow&quot; explanations of electricity. They both work, but I find that they are understood differently well by different people. Personally I vastly prefer electron flow, because you can think of any circuit as a fluid system like the water pipes in your house. I find this makes it a whole lot easier to understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Protons cannot flow.  They never leave the nucleus and if the nucleus moves, the whole atom and thus the conductor itself is physically moving.</p>
<p>In semiconductor electronics we have a confusing concept of charge carriers &quot;n-type&quot; and &quot;p-type&quot; lattice materials.  This kinda implies protons could move, but it's not the case at all.  Immobile as always.  Rather, the p-type lattice material (a substance of combined atoms, not an atom) can lose an electron, but it <strong>cannot</strong> gain an electron.  We call that motion of a &quot;hole&quot; but that's just a vacancy opening up in adjacent atoms as the electron picks up and leaves, rather that motion of an proton.  n-type material can gain an electron but cannot lose an electron.  Both are unlike plain copper which can gain or lose electrons.</p>
<p>If you put n-type and p-type physically against one another and attach copper wire to either side, something bizarre and mind-bogglingly useful happens: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>electrons can freely flow through the copper -&gt; n-type -&gt; p-type -&gt; copper, which isn't remarkable.</p>
</li>
<li>if you reverse the voltage source, electrons try to flow from copper -&gt; p-type, then stop.  p-type cannot send electrons to an n-type it's physically touching.  So NO current flows that way.</li>
</ol>
<p>THAT is now a diode!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>If you can switch charges in equations and the physics is the same, this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-symmetry" target="_blank">C-symmetry</a>. Almost all fundamental forces obey this, but the weak force violates C-symmetry.</p>
<p>There is also parity symmetry (switching spatial orientations) and time reversal symmetry. The three together result in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPT_symmetry" target="_blank">CPT symmetry</a>, which says that any Lorentz invariant (respecting relativity), local (no action-at-a-distance), Hermitian (real observables) quantum field theory must behave the same under combined time, charge, and parity inversions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
