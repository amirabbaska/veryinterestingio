		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certain molecules have electron clouds that can trap photons of light, bounce it around internally, and spit it back out with less energy than it had going in. That’s what’s called “Fluorescence”.</p>
<p>If the light going in is <em>just</em> in the ultraviolet range (too much energy to see), then if it hits a fluorescent molecule, the lower-energy light that escapes might be in the visible range.</p>
<p>In short, a blacklight is just as bright as (brighter than!) the objects that it causes to glow. But you can’t see the light going in; only the light coming back out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The chemical reacts with the iron in blood and glows under UV.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each color of light has a different frequency, kind of like high and low pitched notes on a piano. Blacklight is a higher frequency (higher pitch) than we can see. It would be like playing a piano key that we can't hear. </p>
<p>Some materials will absorb this frequency and re-emit it at a lower frequency (fluoresce), like one of those toy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PBQV4HG/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_mOnuAbY9Z0YPZ" target="_blank">voice distorter microphones</a>. It comes out lower frequency than what goes in, so now you can see it. </p>
<p>DNA is the part of certain bodily fluids that fluoresce. It is the carbon ring shape in the T and G base pairs that have this &quot;voice distorter&quot; quality for light. So only bodily fluids containing DNA will fluoresce. </p>
<p>Blood contains red blood cells and plasma. Plasma has no cells and red blood cells have no nucleus or DNA. They are hollow so that they can carry oxygen to all the parts of your body. </p>
<p>On a cop show, police will spray an area with a chemical that only distorts the frequency of light when bonded with oxygen. The oxygen concentrated in the red blood cells combines with the <em>luminol</em> in the spray and fluoresces only when in contact with blood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bodily fluids are rich in biological macromolecules (mostly proteins and amino acids) that contain aromatic rings (e.g. tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine). Aromatic rings contain &quot;free flowing&quot; electrons that are easily excited (jump to higher energy level) by high energy light and release visible-spectrum light energy in repeated cycles of excitation-energy release. Amino acids released by your sweat glands will also fluoresce, as will artificial aromatic compounds like sunscreen or pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Aromatic rings are special cases of conjugated electron systems within molecules. Conjugated  electron systems are responsible for the color absorbing properties of colorful compounds like carotene, chlorophyll, and other natural as well as artificial dyes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
