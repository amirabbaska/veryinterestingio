Did software engineers just find better ways to utilize space when there was less to be had? Could modern software take up less space if engineers tried?</p>
<p>Edit: great explanations everybody! General consensus is art = space. It was interesting to find out that most of the music and video was rendered on the fly by the console while the cartridge only stored instructions.  I didn't consider modern operating systems have to emulate all their predecessors and control multiple hardware profiles... Very memory intensive. Also, props to the folks who gave examples of crazy shit compressed into &lt;1mb files. Reminds me of all those old flash games we used to be able to stack into floppy disks. (penguin bowling anybody?) thanks again! </p></div></div>
