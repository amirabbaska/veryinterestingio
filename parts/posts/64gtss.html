		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A little late to the party but I read something interesting on it a while back. The idea that prevails currently is that your brain has 3 (and a half?) ways of knowing whether or not you're moving. 1) it's telling your legs to move and they are 2) your inner ear says you are 3) your vision says you are (and a half: your peripheral vision says you are). If there is a mismatch on any of these fronts ie: you're in a car reading (legs say they're not moving, direct vision says you're not, peripheral says you are, and inner ear says it's confused depending on how bad the driver is) your brain wants to know why. Because your brain hasn't evolved as much as our modes of transportation have it can come up with only one explanation, you're being poisoned. The fastest way your brain has to get you unpoisoned is to forcefully eject whatever nasty thing you put in your face back out of your face bits. How much your brain actually believes it's being poisoned varies from person to person so not everybody gets car/ motion sick. </p>
<p>Tldr
Brain: wtf is happening guys?
Legs/ears/eyes: yes things are a happen
Brain: uuuuuhhhhh poison? Idk man just to be safe empty out whatever we just ate and we'll call it good. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I frequently suffered from motion sickness and only recently discovered the reason.</p>
<p>It's because the jerks / accelerations felt by you inside the vehicle give the illusion that you are moving, but the still insides of the vehicle give the illusion that you are at rest. Your brain can't handle these conflicting inputs and hence - motion sickness.</p>
<p>An interesting corollary of this theory verified by observation is that <strong>the driver does not feel motion sickness, even when the other passengers might.</strong></p>
<p>This is because the driver's attention is fixed on the road, and therefore their brains realize the fact that they are indeed moving, corroborating the input felt through the accelerations experienced by the driver.</p>
<p><strong>Fix for motion sickness</strong> : </p>
<p>If you're in a car, look out the windscreen and concentrate on the road in front of you. I've done this experiment many times now. Everytime I don't do it, I feel motion sickness. When I do it, I feel just fine.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: The purpose of concentrating on the road is to anticipate the turns and the bumps of the motion in advance, and prepare yourself for them. The driver is the one guiding the vehicles, so they already have this covered. For other passengers, you need to make a conscious effort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your inner ear detects motion but your eye does not, the body interprets this as illness. Carsickness can often be mitigated simply by staring at the horizon for a while, and so can seasickness. This is why on yachts, crew who are seasick will often be sent above deck to steer.</p>
<p>Sailors swear by candied ginger to remedy seasickness, this is widely used on small vessels. It may well help with carsickness as well. There are also prescription meds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a simple concept, your eyes think you're not in motion because they're looking at a stationary page. Your mind knows you're in motion because you are. The conflict makes your brain think it's ill, so it assumes you're ill because you consumed a toxin, so you puke. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
