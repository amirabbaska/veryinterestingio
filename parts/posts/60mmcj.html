		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diamagnetic materials don't exhibit a Curie temperature mainly because they don't form magnetic domains (regions in the material in which the magnetic dipole orientation is uniform). Magnetic domains only form in materials that exhibit exchange interaction (a quantum mechanical phenomena), and thus ferromagnets, ferrimagnets, and antiferromagnets are the only to form magnetic domains. Those domains form in order to lower the energy state of the material, and thus is a process that orders the material, while thermal energy tends to disorder it. When the thermal energy's tendency to disorder the dipoles overwhelms the ordering that happens from the forming of magnetic domains, the material becomes reduces to a paramagnet. Paramagnets simply don't have that ordering phenomena because they don't form those magnetic domains (since they don't exhibit exchange interaction). </p>
<p>TL;DR A paramagnet cannot become a ferromagnet/ferrimagnet/antiferromagnet since it doesn't form domains, but in the reverse case, ferromagnets can reduce to paramagnets at a temperature high enough (Curie temperature, or Neel temperature for ferrimagnets (might be for antiferromangets, can't recall)) to overwhelm the ordering process that forms domains.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diamagnetism is a quantum mechanical effect arising from the induction of an emf in an electrons orbit from an external magnetic field. This is present in all materials that contain electrons and will always oppose any magnetic field. It isn't associated with magnetic domains or the orientation of magnetic moments, it is just a effect which is in accordance with Faraday's law of induction. </p>
<p>Essentially the orbit of an electron is slowed when it experiences an external magnetic field and this reduces the magnetic moment of the orbiting electron, this reduction in magnetic moment is observed as diamagnetism. </p>
<p>Materials which do not demonstrate any other form of magnetism can be observedly diamagnetic, even though this effect is present in all materials. The effect is largely temperature independent , so no curie temperature is observed. (Ignoring superconductors which are essentially perfect diamagnets) </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
