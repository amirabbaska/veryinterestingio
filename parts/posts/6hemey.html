		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could see them pretty well, even though the outermost ones are receiving a fraction of a percent of the light that Earth does. This is because our perception of light is logarithmic; Large changes in light emission by bright objects look the same as small changes in dim objects. Think about how your computer screen looks inside at night compared to outside on a bright day; It looks brighter inside because your eyes adjusted to the lower ambient light, and the actual objective difference of light conditions is much bigger than you might expect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Which means they are reflecting PLENTY of light for you to see them up close just fine. </p>

I imagine that if you were all the way out near them that they would appear even brighter because less ambient light. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can see Jupiter and Saturn in pretty good detail with a smallish telescope. The telescopes increase the amount of light that is brought in, so that helps, but you can also see Jupiter and Saturn as little bright dots in the sky if you know where to look. You would certainly be able to see them up close. I'm really not sure about Neptune. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
