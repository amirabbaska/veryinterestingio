		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>New Roman Cursive!</p>
<p>Long before movable type was invented, scribes wrote everything by hand. Though Classical Latin was Unicode (only upper case) mideval scribes found Greek Cursive to be a way to write more quickly and avoid making costly mistakes on expensive parchment. So Western Europe acquired the capitals thousands of years before it went back to Greek to borrow its lower case cursive letters, which became our cursive letters. Most of the letters had just gotten smaller and curvier to reflect their use in cursive writing, and some had no Greek equivalent so a small version of the capital was adopted. </p>
<p>But some Aa, Bb, Dd, Ee, Gg, Hh, Qq, and Rr, had just changed a lot in Greek during that time. Dd are different ways of drawing what was once a triangle, Aa rotated 90 degrees, e is a writing of E very quickly, the tail of g reflects the tail that G used to have. R became something like a 2 around this time, developing into r much later than the others. </p>
<p>With the advent of movable type, it became important to standardize the letters and move away from scribe creativity or laziness. It also put the scribes out of work, so their efforts to speed up writing became less important. We developed standardized cursive with public schooling so that children could write faster, but otherwise, we've stuck with the c. 1500 letters. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lower-case letters originated with cursive writing developed for writing with a pen, as opposed to upper-case letters which were originally chiselled into stone. That's why lower-case letters have more, and tighter, curves.</p>
<p><a href="http://fraleighsboutiquenc.com/wp-includes/js/crop/carolingian-minuscule-5012.jpg" target="_blank">Study this table</a>, showing the Latin alphabet in various different styles. You'll notice some letters missing: Z isn't there at all, I and J were originally the same letter, V and U were also originally the same letter, and W is a later innovation and was literally a &quot;double-u&quot;.</p>
<p>For example, notice how the G appears in the different styles. G is basically C with an extra stroke added. In some styles, the stroke goes upwards, in others it goes downwards. Sometimes the main part of the letter is closed to form a circle, and the extra stroke is added to the circle.</p>
<p>The letter Q is basically a circle with a tail added: it's just a question of how you attach the tail to the circle.</p>
<p>And that's basically how it happened. The letters in row I became our upper-case letters, and those in row IV evolved into our lower-case letters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the effects of handwriting (tight, loopy letters), the writing utensils effected letter shapes.  A lot of people with modern ballpoint pens struggle to write a traditional cursive &quot;r&quot;.  But try it with a pointy nib or quill.  You can only pull the nib or go sideways (it's too pointy to &quot;push&quot;), so you're forced to write &quot;r&quot; in two strokes.  The flexible nibs basically force you to write a perfect traditional r.</p>
<p>You can also see this with the &quot;french e&quot; where the center line joins to the next letter (instead of the bottom line).  That letter is also written in 2 strokes.</p>
<p>If you want to see what a modern hand-writing alphabet looks like, designed for use with modern pens, check out Quickscript.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
