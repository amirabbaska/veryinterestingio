		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this would call on Computer Scientists and Network engineers, with domain knowledge in cell tower installation/setup.</p>
<p>I want to know what ATT or Verizon's average cost is assuming data transfer is over a cell tower in the lower 48 US. I'm not interested in capital investment numbers because these eventually are fully subsidized through pricing I would think is obvious. I'm just interested in the number it costs to transmit the data over all the network hardware to my phone. </p>
<p>Also I'm mostly talking about the last mile or endpoint node to my phone. I realize depending on where the data is originating the costs can vary, at least it would be nice to have some explanation of how numbers add up in the ISP world. So we can be more educated consumers. </p>
<p>EDIT: Many have brought attention to operating/maintenance/employee costs. While these costs are substantial, they are relatively fixed or stepped and heavily subsidized. I want to know a big telcom's average variable costs on delivering data from point A to B, if both A and B are in the US and B is an endpoint like my cell phone. </p>
<p>EDIT2: After reading through all these comments, maybe the better question would've been: On average, how much would every customer of ATT have to pay per month to support all of ATT's network and operational costs.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrical engineer who has done a decent amount of work for Verizon and At&amp;t. The two main operating costs for carriers is renting tower space and electricity. Most cell phone towers are owned by tower companies like American Towers or Crown Castle. Carriers will rent a 10' section of the tower and roughly 200-400 sq ft of space on the ground to store equipment. Cost of rent will vary based on location but it is typically around 2,000$ a month. Electricity costs will vary based on the location of the cell site. Basically, the more people using the equipment, the more power the equipment will draw. For Verizon, in a decently populated area, they will peak around 10kVa or roughly 40 Amps at 240V. Verizon has a few different types of sites as far as equipment goes. Some sites will be smaller scale sites that will not handle as much data while others are central hubs that will draw alot more. For electric bills that I have seen in populated areas you are looking at ~250 a month. The number of cell sites that are needed will depend on the tower heights and how much interference is in the way from site to site. Basically, you need more cell sites in the city or in the woods then you would in the desert.    </p>
<p>Assuming you are only downloading from one cell site, the cost to run that cell site for ~5 minutes will be about 25 cents. Have to figure that you will not be the only person ever using the tower though.</p>
<p>2000rent plus 250 electric yield 2250. 2250÷30days÷24hours÷60 minutes gives cost per minute of .05 dollars, or 25 cents for 5 minutes. (thanks to arglebargleglopglif)</p>
<p>Edited for horrible math.... working to much + alcohol does not equal good math for some reason...
Few extra notes...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yes, this cost does not include a lot of the costs associated with running a company, upgrades maintenance and so on. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The life of cell towers does not really matter a lot as the provider is typically not the owner of the tower. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LTE means long term employment to people in the industry. Cell sites get upgraded all the time to have more capacity, more efficient equipment and so on. </p>
</li>
<li>The download speed depends on the internet in the area. If the cell tower is in a town that has old internet than the tower will be limited. Also worth noting that all providers on the tower are connected to the same internet connection which means that all providers will have the same speed. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Telecom in general, both wireless as well as broadband data, are an interesting study in economics. It takes well over $100million to run a fiber optic cable with 24 strands between New York and LA. Paying for right of way, fiber, bulldozers, repeaters. And more for techs to repair it when inevitably someone cuts it during construction.</p>
<p>Once that’s built, the variable cost of sending data, or putting another user on is almost zero. The biggest fixed cost is the stamp on the monthly bill. The 24 strand fiber would carry terabits - thousands of gigabits with the proper termination optical equipment.</p>
<p>But if you are that company, you have to recoup the $100 million plus the techs cost.</p>
<p>You could price 1 Gigabit/sec at $1 million/month and maybe 10 companies could afford it. That’s where we were in 1970when bandwidth was very expensive and the phone company was a regulated monopoly.</p>
<p>Or you could price it at $1/month and hoper there were 10 million customers in NYC and LA that want to send 1 kilobit/sec.</p>
<p>Or somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Then you have to lay lines to everyone’s home. Some downtown in high density areas are cheap to cover. In the rural areas or suburbs, it may cost over $1000 per house to wire. So, how to you get that back?</p>
<p>While everyone thinks cellular and broadband rates are highway robbery, it’s pretty close to cost. There are profits. For companies with a large number of customers, large profits. Those who don’t attract a large number of customers go out of business because they can’t pay for the large fixed cost.</p>
<p>While there’s no marginal cost of ‘one more customer’, someone has to pay for the fixed cost or the company dies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the answers in here are way off the mark, and are only looking at one minute facet of a much larger infrastructure.<br />
I cannot give you exact figures, but providing 1gb of data to a mobile customer certain costs more than 0.01c in the vast scheme of things outside of just electricity.</p>
<p>Most modern LTE towers are run via fiber or microwave transmission.  As an example of putting LTE service in a rural area; Running those lines alone requires:
-municipal planning,
-paying for contractors,
-surveyors,
-people to map out coverage maps and overlaps.<br />
-People to be hired to negotiate with local officials in order to get a deal or financial support for the infrastructure.    Usually this comes with other arrangements (wait until water lines are put in, cover a portion of the ground crew, pay to upgrade a school, etc).  Yes, I know many carriers don't follow through on these obligations, but it is more complex than people think.</p>
<p>So now we have approval to build a tower, now we go and find land you either have to buy from a local government (who will certainly upcharge 10x what it is really worth), or convince a local farmer or building owner to let you build on their land, and pay a monthly fee.
Now you call a town meeting, and need to appease people, this isn't free and staff need to be paid etc.</p>
<p>Great, you have a tower site, you paid possibly tens of thousands to contractors to run lines to your rural tower via fiber along roads etc.</p>
<p>Now the tower itself costs a bunch of money, as do the transceivers of which there could be dozens on each tower.  Costs a little to wire it into the grid and add back up power.</p>
<p>Now you pay a crew to wire it up, and spend 2-3 months of testing, while you wait for approval of activation.  Sometimes this is dependant on getting approval from a local government as well as from the engineering team.</p>
<p>So now the tower is up.  In each region will be a team of engineers who maintain and test the tower ongoing.  They also have an emergency team they keep on call for various regions.  All need to be paid.</p>
<p>Then you have a fleet of vehicles that need to be paid for, maintained, and stocked with equipment, including back up equipment for towers.</p>
<p>You need to also pay for a central building to house those vehicles locally in various regions, pay for all the costs that come with running a facility.</p>
<p>That is just the local side of things...</p>
<p>You also need programmers to make control software, and pay for monitoring software, and also have people integrate those things into your existing software infrastructure.  You also need a team that constantly work on updating or keeping things up to date.
Then there is a team that monitors status of the service/towers.</p>
<p>You also need trainers to train, and software needs to be made to also train.</p>
<p>You need to also pay for 1000s of customer service reps, foreign and domestic, their managers, training, software, support staff, a building and facility.</p>
<p>Theres the cost of the actual frequencies, most countries auction them off and that costs money.</p>
<p>Research and Development too, paying for various contracts with ZTE/or one of the other manufacturers of tower equipment.</p>
<p>Then you have buyers and dealers who work with companies like apple, Samsung etc to make deals and get devices on the network.</p>
<p>Software developers who make/test software releases on devices for the network.</p>
<p>Teams of marketing people who work in advertising, making deals with various manfactueres, working with advertising agencies to create content for tv and other various media.</p>
<p>Then we have retail locations.  You have thousands of staff in various positions.  Training for them, POS systems and software, payment systems, merchandising that is updated weekly.  Support teams for them too.  Train regional managers as well.  Incentives programs and various other systems to be put in place.</p>
<p>There are maybe 100 other systems I am missing out on that a carrier has as &quot;costs&quot; in the transmission of a signal.</p>
<p>So those people who are using purely electricity to calculate the cost of the transmission are only using a tiny part of a much larger system of costs and profits.  Sure with all the monthly fees and income more than cover the costs, and I'm not saying that 0.01cents is way off, because it might not be in the long terms, but people need to realize it isn't so simple to calculate.</p>
<p>TL:DR While 0.01cents may not be far off, it isn't a simple calculation of electricity costs to figure out the cost of 1gb of data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The correct answer, as any accountant knows, is what does Verizon want it to be?</p>
<p>There are a ton of costs setting up a cell network that don't include the cell towers. You have to have the switching equipment, internet interfaces, backhaul lines, emergency power, and so on, and that's just equipment. You need customer service, repair techs, and a trouble ticket system. You need a billing system, software and hardware, and people to run it. There's more, but you get the idea. And the costs of ALL of those things have to be reflected in the final price. </p>
<p>I don't even think Verizon could answer the question because, quite honestly, they don't give a f. I worked at a cellular provider in Canada when it was in its infant stages, and I lived through all the issues with trying to build out a network. No one would have ever asked this question, because there's no point in answering it. We don't price based on marginal cost (which, as others have pointed out, is extremely low); we priced on expected revenue vs expected costs to get a target profit margin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer your question the way it's proposed, but I'll say this. The cost to the company is maintaining a network that can handle a certain number of people on demand in any given area. It's more about the available bandwidth than the amount of data used. </p>
<p>If everyone used their data without any fear of usage cost, it would be easy for the network to be overwhelmed by the users.</p>
<p>I agree that the cost vs the amount of data given is crazy. </p>
<p>However, thanks to competition even the big carriers offer reasonable unlimited plans now. ATT doesn't even consider throttling your data until you hit 22 GB (for unlimited users) of usage on your line. Even then, you only experience throttling when the network is congested. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
