		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the two masses were the same, it (the center of mass) would coincide with the L1 Lagrange point, but otherwise no. An object passing through the center of mass would have to orbit the heavier body faster (in degrees per second) than the lighter body, and so could not remain at the center of mass.</p>
<p>The center of mass is not (unless the two bodies are the same mass, as above) the point where gravity from the two bodies cancels out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The L1 Lagrange point, which is the one between the objects, is always closer to the least massive object, while the center of mass is always closer to the most massive.</p>
<p>They can only be at the same point if the masses were exactly the same, which is essentially impossible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My intuition suggests to me that for binary mass systems, L1 is indeed atop their mutual center of mass, no matter their mass ratio. Here's the catch: The distance from the more massive body to their mutual center of mass must be measured as a geodesic in hyperbolic space - the Lagrangian distance is measured as usual. I would love to be proven wrong, especially diagrammatically :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
