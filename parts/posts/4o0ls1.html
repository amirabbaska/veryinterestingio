<h1>Answer below</h1>
<h2>Do trains get derailed by a stone or a coin on the track?</h2>
<p>No, trains do net get derailed by stones on the tracks. That's mostly because trains are fucking heavy and move with such power that stones, coins, etc just get crushed!</p>
<h2>Why are train tracks filled with anything anyways?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Distributes the weight of the track evenly</li>
<li>Prevents water from getting into the ground Â» making it unstable</li>
<li>Keeps the tracks in place</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why stones and not any other option?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keeps out vegetation</li>
<li>Stones are cheap</li>
<li>Low maintenance</li>
</ul>
