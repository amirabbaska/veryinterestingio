		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides the amount of pistons.</p>
<p>For example, if I have a 4.0l v6 and a 4.0l v8 engine made from the same manufacturers, same materials etc. is there any difference between the two engines? Are there any advantages or disadvantages to having an engine with 8 pistons, to having an engine with 6 slightly larger pistons to give the same volume?</p>
<p>Edit* Just to &quot;ELI5&quot; my question, the v6 means the engine has 6 pistons, and v8 means the engine has 8 pistons. The volume in that relation, unless I have been lied to my whole life, is the total combined volume of all the pistons when pulled all the way back. Correct me if I'm wrong but a 6 piston engine has 0.66 liters of volume in each piston (4l/6pistons), and an 8 piston engine has 0.5 liters of volume in each piston (4/8).</p></div></div>

<p>Edit:
Lots of people asking for ELI5 of ELI5, so here goes:
Engines, like all engineering, is an exercise in compromises.  You need to balance a whole bunch of factors to get a solution that meets the result.  In engines, there's a whole bunch of factors, but for most purposes, you can focus on these:</p>
<ol>
<li>An engine needs to make sufficient power to move the vehicle</li>
<li>An engine needs to balance out all the vibrations inherent in the spinning and shaking that's going on.  If you don't manage this, eventually the engine shakes itself apart.</li>
<li>The engine needs to fit inside the vehicle (and, for performance applications, be located in a way that maximizes the handling characteristics of the car).</li>
<li>The engine needs to consume only so much fuel.</li>
</ol>
<p>A V8 engine handles all 4 of these in a nicely balanced way: its not really good at any one of the 4, but its 'good enough' to make it one of the best overall engine layouts.  It also sounds sexy as hell.</p>
<hr />
<p>The cylinder configuration of an engine has effects on two major factors, the smoothness / vibration, and the 'packaging' or sizing / shape / how it fits in the car.  Cylinder count has nothing to do with power, typically - that has to do with displacement, flow of the heads, shape of the combustion chamber, cylinder pressure, compression, ignition timing, and a ton of other factors.  Up until 2013, F1 used 2.4L engines that were V8s, a size commonly set up as an I4 in commercial vehicles.</p>
<p>V8s come in two major flavors; flat plane and cross plane cranks, which describe how the pistons connect to the crankshaft.  Cross plane V8s (where if you look edge-on the crankshaft looks like a cross) sit at a sweet spot of packaging - its only 4 cylinders deep so it can fit under hoods easily, but can pack a large engine displacement in a nicely sized cube while being vibrationally balanced.  They do limit RPMs a bit though because of the cross plane balancing adds rotational mass, so high performance / racing V8s tend to go with flat plane cranks.</p>
<p>V6s have even better packaging, but are unbalanced vibrationally, forcing a tradeoff of longevity vs power.  Most commercial solutions favor the longevity side of the equation, so most people's perception of a V6 is an uninspiring motor.  It doesn't have to be, but a V6 that outputs a ton of power is also an engine about to shake itself to bits.</p>
<p>Inline 4s have excellent packaging as well but are also terribly balanced, often requiring an extra shaft to keep the engine even remotely smooth, so power output is very weak. But because of the small size they can still rev well, so they're used where engine efficiency is more important than broad performance.</p>
<p>Inline 6s are better than V8s and basically every other engine at power delivery and smoothness (its why BMW uses them) but packaging them is really hard because they're very long and practically require rear wheel drive.  If what you care about is performance of an engine and no other considerations, you want an inline 6 or its bigger brother, a v12 (which is two I6s working together, so butter smooth).</p>
<p>Horizontally opposed engines (Subaru, Porsche) are balanced and have near perfect behavior internally, but are a total bitch to package.  Subaru's understeer is a result of having to hang the engine really far out in front of the wheels to make room for AWD.  Older Porsches have a reputation as Widow Makers due to the engine hanging far out the back of the car causing oversteer.</p>
<p>Flat plane V8s have lower rotational mass so they rev higher and generally produce more power, but lose some of the V8 engine balancing.  These are used in higher performance engines (Ferrari uses this layout, as well as the new Ford GT350) but require more maintenance and tend to have shorter effective lives.</p>
<p>V10s are used in some applications and have some benefits, but its mostly a 'I have a bigger number than you' sort of thing.</p>
<p>So why are V8s so popular?  They're the 'poor man's performance' engine: cross plane V8s sit at a great intersection of balanced engine, packaging, and RPM potential.  They're not great at all 3, mind: in fact, far from.  But if what you're looking for is everyman's performance, cross plane V8 will fit in anything and deliver great performance, while not costing too much.</p>
<p>There are some misconceptions that are common: low RPM torque is one of them.  The V8 configuration has nothing to do with that - it has everything to do with the tuning of the engine with respect to camshaft profile and flow.  Racing configured engines focueds on high RPM performance tend to have really poor low RPM performance, and small I4 engines can have lower RPM torgue with turbos or by camming them down, but their peak will then suffer as a result and be even more boring.</p>
<p>The desirability of V8s in car culture has to do with the accessibility of power at the V8 configuration. Because of the factors above, the most big engine cars commercially made tend to stick with the V8 configuration due to its ease of packaging.  Car culture then connected power to V8, even though that isn't the cause. Additionally, cross plane V8s have a sound that is very distinct and to my ears absolutely sexy, though the purr of an I6 or flat 6 is equally sexy to me as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>A lot of other questions.  Yeah, the VR6 is worth a mention, so are Wankels, as well as I5s.  All really cool solutions to interesting problems.  A lot of those things have been addressed but one thing wasn't: what actually determines whether or not an engine performs well?</p>
<p>Think about a bike.  You have the easiest time pushing on the pedal when it is rotated out at 90 degrees, so the pedal arm is parallel to the ground.  Another example of this is its hardest to do the bicep curl when your arm is parallel -&gt; gravity has the best lever on your muscle at that point.  A piston is the same: the goal is to get the peak combustion pressure on the piston as its descending right around when the crank is rotated 90 degrees.   The problem is the engine spins at a range of speeds, and so it takes different amounts of time for the flame to reach the piston.  A ton of factors go into this, and its all about balancing these issues to get an engine to perform the way you need for that solution:</p>
<p>A long stroke forces the flame to travel further, meaning its easier to get it to strike the piston head correctly at low engine speeds.  At high engine speeds, the piston is moving away from the flame very fast and its hard to get it to reach peak pressure at the optimal time.  A short stroke, wide bore has a shorter distance to travel so the flame front impacts the piston best at high speeds - at low speeds you need to hold ignition until really late.</p>
<p>The more metal turning, the more force it takes to turn it.  Reducing the amount of mass in rotation and the total surface area in contact allows more of the energy to be used for moving the vehicle, yielding fuel economy and power gains.  If done improperly or over-zealously, removing mass will reduce the lifecycle of the engine.</p>
<p>The engine needs to 'flow' well, or allow air in and out at the right times.  The cycle of a cylinder happens really fast, and in that period of time all the air for combustion needs to get in, injected, compressed, and ignited.  Getting that cylinder packed with as much air as possible allows more fuel to be dumped in, giving more power.</p>
<p>Everything that moves needs to have a counter-movement somewhere else.   This is to handle those vibrations.</p>
<p>I can go on and on. I love engines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there, assuming both engines are 4-cycle type, one difference is that the 8 cylinder engine will have 8 power cycles (8 power output pulses) per 2 rotations of the crank vs. 6 with the 6-cylinder engine. With all other things equal this would mean the power delivery is smoother. Luxury cars tend (especially in older days) have more cylinders to get the smoothest output possible - sometimes up to 16 cylinders! The torque curve (torque output vs. RPM) would likely be broader with the 8-cylinder engine again as it has more power pulses per rotation. </p>
<p>So more cylinders for a given volume does have advantages, but also disadvantages - namely added complexity and cost. Adding 2 more cylinders doesn't sound like a lot, but that's more crank to spin, 2 more connecting rods and pistons, at least 2 more injectors, these days 2 more ignition coils etc. </p>
<p>So if you are a car company you might stick with lower cylinder count to get costs down, and potentially have better reliability with the reduction in complexity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth, a 4.0L V8 will be able to rev higher than a 4.0L V6. That's because the per piston displacement is lower on the V8, in this case, 0.5L/piston, and the V6 would come in at 0.66L/piston. What this means is the V8 will have a smaller bore/smaller piston and a smaller stroke. This means less rotating mass and, with the shorter stroke, less movement of the piston. This means this specific 4.0L V8 would be able to rev higher without stressing the crankshaft and connecting rods. The balance (as others have mentioned) is an added perk.  </p>
<p>You'll see this come into play: for example, Porsche used a 4.5L V8 in the Cayenne introduced back in the early 2000s. General Motors (Pontiac) had a 3.8 L V6. Even though the Porsche is a larger motor, they were able to get the engine to redline at 6,500 RPM, whereas General Motors accomplished only 6,000 RPM out of their V6. There are some other considerations that play into that outcome, but the displacement of each cylinder is no small part of that difference. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is the surface area to volume ratio.  When you make lots of smaller cylinders versus fewer large ones, you are creating more surface area per given volume.  This has the effect of more effective cylinder aspiration per capacity and rpm, which means youre spending less energy in getting air in and out, so more power heads out the crankshaft instead.</p>
<p>Another big advantage is that smaller cylinders have higher rev limits.  It is (a little bit) easier to make power by spinning faster over other methods like forced induction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
