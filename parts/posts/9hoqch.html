		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.thedodo.com/7-animals-who-love-it-loud-785605994.html" target="_blank">Top 7 Loudest Animals</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Humans: 120 db ( <a href="https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/worlds-loudest-shout-belongs-to-northern-ireland-teacher-28559417.html" target="_blank">Loudest Shout</a> )</li>
<li>Bird: 100 db ( Three Wattled Bell Bird )</li>
<li>Monkey: 140 db ( Howler Monky )</li>
</ul>
<p>As for why humans typically enjoy their 70-90 db conversations and never really evolved to push higher is more biologic than a matter of size. Humans don't need a daily scare tactic, or even a screaming contest to gain attention or to assert dominance. We have other effective ways to communicate with words and body language in most cases. So what we don't use or need in nature, will often shrink or evolve for efficiency or practicallity.</p>
<p>The animal kingdom often uses more basic means of communication with loudness being a primal factor of how well the message is made. If you can guard yourself with a loud enough roar, or find a mate with it. This will be a trait to keep developing and may the best win.</p>
<p>However, there's always a tradeoff in evolution and this loudness can mean a loss of other abilities or even finesse with it. I'd rather have our articulations and subtlety than a loud roar that's no longer of much benefit personally. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
