		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ortho resident here.</p>
<p>Lets start with some anatomy. Like others have said, long bones have two parts, a cortex and a medullary canal. The cortex is the outside of the bone and is what is usually seen on X-rays. It contains cortical bone which is arranged in a way that it is very strong. This is where most of the bending and compressive strength of bone is and is what most of the shaft portion of long bones (femur, tibia, humerus, etc) are made of. The medullary canal contains a combination of bone marrow and what is called cancellous bone, which is bone that does not contribute as much to the strength of the long bone, but is important part of bone health.</p>
<p>We place a rod down the femur by taking advantage of the medullary canal. You can place a rod in the femur by going in from the top or the bottom of the femur. First a hole is drilled in line with with medullary canal either through the greater trochanter (the large bump at the top of the femur) or through the knee. This is all done under X-ray guidance (called fluoroscopy). We then line up the fracture fragments, place a long wire in the medullary canal and then ream. These reamers start out small and get larger. This helps remove any of that cancellous bone and medullary contents that would get in the way of the rod we place in. We ream until the reamers start to &quot;chatter&quot; on the cortical bone. We then place a rode slightly smaller than the final reamer down the canal. This is all done under imaging guidance through the hole in the bone we made at the top or the bottom of the femur. The rod is hammered to the appropriate depth. Finally screws are placed at the top and the bottom of the rod to hold it into place. These are placed perpendicular to the bone and the rod in order to &quot;lock it&quot; into place so it doesn't move up or down.</p>
<p>We do rodding or &quot;nailing&quot; of long bones because it does not require large incisions and it is what we call a load sharing construct so patients can weight bear the next day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First realize that the femur is a hollow bone with marrow at the center. That's why on x-ray it looks white/opaque on the outside and darker/grey on the inside.</p>
<p>By saying it's hollow however, I'm not implying it's weak. It's not.</p>
<p>So the first thing they do is ream out the marrow with... You guessed it! A reamer. The diameter of which is determined by the size of the rod they determined this particular femur needed.</p>
<p>The rod has &quot;serrations&quot; on either end that allow it to be hammered in but make the opposite movement difficult.</p>
<p>They then do this for the other side. Though to be honest, I've forgotten how they bring the opposite be ends of the fracture together....</p>
<p>The reamer is used with a guide &quot;wire&quot; (it's actually thicker than a wire) and lots and lots of x rays are taken to make sure the reamer stays on course and doesn't deviate from the marrow to the cortex (the thicker outer part I mentioned earlier).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I was a radiological tech for 10 years until recently, and was fortunate enough to assist with a few of these surgeries.  It is not a delicate procedure. They stretch, rotate, drill and hammer by whatever means to get the hardware placed correctly. Normally a representative from the manufacturer would assist the surgeon in placing the device because there are not many &quot;one size fits all&quot; implants, so the surgeries are similar but never identical.  I'm sure a tutorial could be retrieved from YouTube, but if it's accurate it will look pretty violent the first time you witness the procedure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Separate the muscle at the top to expose the bone, and drill a hole downward to expose the hollow shaft. Align the bone with traction on the leg, and pass the rod through the center of the bone above the break and in into bone below. Watch with x-ray video to rotate the leg below until at its normal alignment with foot facing forward and the cracks even.  Drill through bone from the side and into holes of the rod at top and bottom to place a pin that prevents the rotating or sliding on the rod.
Wake them up and let them walk on it as it will bear normal weight again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The femur is highly vascularized which is why reaming the canal doesn't weaken it. </p>
<p>There are typical two entry points, the greater troch or the piriformis fossa (depending on the angle of the nail and the preference of the surgeon,) although they're are Supracondylar nails whose entry point is between the condyles in the middle of your knee, this is use when a fracture is way to distal for those other nails to cover. </p>
<p>You reduce the fracture a couple ways, a ball tip guide wire will help, each company has some sort of &quot;reducer&quot; which just looks like a long skinny finger, sometimes depending on the fracture pattern you need provisional fixation with small single cortical plates, most of the time using &quot;c-clamps&quot; to hold the fragments or a &quot;spiked ball pusher,&quot; or just something to push the fragments back into place and then clamp them while you ream is all you need. Nailing a fracture doesn't create absolute stability, for the most part it provides relative stability, patients will have weight and motion restrictions during the healing process. </p>
