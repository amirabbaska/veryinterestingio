		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit! We're Jamie Nunez and Dr. Ryan Renslow, scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Rainbow colormaps have long been known to make data interpretation difficult and sometimes even impossible for those with colorblindness, yet they are still very popular due to limited alternatives. That's why we developed an open-source Python module that can automatically convert colormaps into forms easily interpreted by those with or without color vision deficiencies.  One colormap in particular that we created, called cividis, enables consistent and accurate data interpretation for both people with normal vision and those who are colorblind. Cmaputil can be used by anyone to create their own optimized colormaps and can be accessed here: <a href="https://github.com/pnnl/cmaputil" target="_blank">https://github.com/pnnl/cmaputil</a> </p>
<p>Cividis is currently available in Python (matplotlib &amp; plotly packages), R (viridis &amp; viridisLite packages), COMSOL, and more. Read our PLOS One paper &quot;Optimizing colormaps with consideration for color vision deficiency to enable accurate interpretation of scientific data&quot; here: <a href="https://goo.gl/UDPWFd" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/UDPWFd</a></p>
<p>We'll be on at noon PT (3 p.m. ET, 19 UT). Ask us anything!</p></div></div>

<p>I have had a very tough time trying to convince people to move away from Jet. I even got reviewers complaining that Viridis has not enough contrast and that it shouldn't be used. How do you manage to convince the (often older) people who are reluctant to switch to more linear colormaps? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Question - Did you consider blue-yellow colorblindness in generating Cividis, or just red-green (which is more common). I imagine the same optimization process would work to generate a blue-yellow robust map.</p>
<p>A correction - I believe recent literature has shown sensitivity to more gradiations in grayscale than the thirty you report in the paper <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2750996179177269393&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=5,33&amp;sciodt=0,33" target="_blank">source</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
