		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed that going as far back as the early 1900s, films have always had a length of around 1:45:00, to 2:15:00, with some variance between. Yet, despite this variance, most films end up somewhere in that gap, usually settling in at around 2:00:00 or so. This seems like such an odd length to me, and very specific. Films are usually noted as being particularly long, or short, if they don't fit this length though. </p>
<p>Why is that?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You will notice that most popular movies (namely, comedies or action/adventure films produced by major film companies) are 90 minutes long on average.  That's because many screenwriters follow a <a href="http://scripteach.com/?page_id=223" target="_blank">three part structure</a> for plot development.  The film is essentially broken down into three &quot;acts&quot;, where the first act is an introduction to the characters, the second act depicts the conflict between characters that develops the storyline, and the third act is the climax and resolution.<br />
If each of these is roughly 30 minutes long, the film ends up around 90 minutes.  They can be longer due to plot twists and more complex stories, but the movies with the most basic format are somewhere in this area.</p>
<p>If you watch enough films you may notice when these &quot;acts&quot; start and finish, and the next one begins.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its a pretty good length of time as much longer and you want a break to use the bathroom or get something to eat, and much shorter and you don't have time to really tell a self contained story (the television shows you are used to rely on the audience already knowing things about the characters, setting, plot, before the episode starts and this is why so many shows have a double length first episode).</p>
<p>However I think we have recently started to see that this is very much not the ideal length of time to tell a deep story.  And television shows that you can marathon on netflix are starting to really take the crown for storytelling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Answers here forget human history.</p>
<p>This length is a heuristic.</p>
<p>Think thousands of years of time with music, dances, plays(all of theatre), opera, symphonies, political gatherings, etc...</p>
<p>Even class length tends to be no more than 2 hours.</p>
<p>Considering the history and the fact that it is a heuristic and you would probably come to assume it has something to do with anatomy: such as concentration limits, or bladder?  Probably bladder.</p>
<p>Yeah, bladder.  </p>
<p>tldr;  bladder is why</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, remember that movies are a business. Its less of a big deal now with multiplexes and digital, but old film theaters despised 3 hour or longer films because they couldn't do as many screenings through out the day... less screenings equaled less ticket sales, and less concession sales.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was a business decision to maximise the number of screenings in a day at theatres, while giving movie goers the minimum length needed to seem like a &quot;feature film&quot; rather than a 30 minute episode of a series that they could watch on tv.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
