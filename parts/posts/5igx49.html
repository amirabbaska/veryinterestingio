Yet, despite this variance, most films end up somewhere in that gap, usually settling in at around 2:00:00 or so. This seems like such an odd length to me, and very specific. Films are usually noted as being particularly long, or short, if they don't fit this length though. </p>
<p>Why is that?</p></div></div>
