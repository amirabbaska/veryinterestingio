		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I would say I understand 1-5 but I actually really don't get the first dimension. Or maybe I do but it seems simplistic. Anyways if someone could break down each one as easily as possible. I really haven't looked much into 6-11(just learned that there were 11 because 4 and 5 took a lot to actually grasp a picture of. </p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">Haha I know not to watch the tenth dimension video now. A million it's pseudoscience messages.   I've never had a post do more than 100ish upvotes. If I'd known 10,000 people were going to judge me based on a question I was curious about while watching the 2D futurama episode stoned. I would have done a bit more prior research and asked the question in a more clear and concise way. </a> </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a mathematician, the first thing I can say is to NOT watch a video called &quot;Imagining the Tenth Dimension.&quot; It's poor math and worse science and completely misses the point.</p>
<p>A better way to approach this is to understand what &quot;dimension&quot; really means to a scientist. A &quot;dimension&quot; is basically anything you can measure with a single number. So, for instance, a line is one-dimensional because you can describe any distance along that line with one number: the distance forward from some starting point. You could use a 1-dimensional measure to describe your position along a highway, or how far you are from the north pole, or the amount of time that's passed since midnight, or so on.</p>
<p>We commonly say that we live in 3-dimensional space. This is because it takes 3 numbers to describe our location. For instance, you could describe your position relative to the earth using three numbers -- Latitude, Longitude, and Height above sea level. Or you could describe your position relative to the room you're in -- measure the distance from the floor, left wall, and back wall, for instance. You could even measure your position relative to three points in space, and this is exactly how GPS satellites work! The important thing here is to note that two numbers aren't enough -- we need 3 numbers to give a useful description of a location.</p>
<p>When we talk about things with &quot;more than three dimensions,&quot; we usually mean we're talking about things too complicated to describe with only three numbers. Spacetime is a common example, because if you want to identify an <em>event</em> (like, say, a wedding), then you need to give at least three dimensions to identify the location, plus one dimension to identify the time. But it's quite possible to make other spaces which have more than three dimensions -- for instance, if a library database is indexed by Year, Subject, Author's Last Name, and Media Type, then it could take 4 numbers to identify a point in that database space. And there's no upper limit -- you can make &quot;search spaces&quot; like this as complicated as you like, requiring any number of dimensions to identify a location within them.</p>
<p>When mathematicians talk about extra dimensions, they're often thinking about adapting existing mathematics to see how it would work in four or more spacial dimensions. For instance, we know that a line has 2 sides, a square has 4 sides, and a cube has 6 sides -- and we can prove that if there was a four-dimensional shape that fit this pattern (a &quot;tesseract&quot; or &quot;hypercube&quot;), then it would have 8 sides (and each side would be a cube, just like all 6 sides of a cube are squares).</p>
<p>When <del>physicists</del> [string theorists] talk about extra dimensions, they're often thinking about how they could use additional types of measurement to better describe space. At very small scales, our space doesn't seem to obey &quot;normal&quot; three-dimensional laws -- so adding more dimensions is a way of getting more specific about what's going on at the <del>quantum</del> [subatomic] level, where <del>momentum and position</del> [some stuff I don't actually understand since I only studied undergrad mathematics] are tangled up in each other.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr: dimensions are just a thing we made up to describe how we measure things, there's no objective way to say how many the universe has, and if someone tells you to visualize all dimensions as branching structures then they've been watching too many time travel movies.</strong> </p>
<p><em>Edit: Wow, this blew up, and many of you had great corrections. To be honest, I don't know what the hell physicists actually want out of extra dimensions, I only understand the math concepts.</em></p>
<p><em>Also holy shit, it's over 9,000. Glad you all found this helpful! Remember, math isn't just for geniuses, it's for everyone who can read a book and ask a question!</em></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP I think you're misunderstanding the concept of a dimension in the first place. There is no such thing as the 'first' dimension. Once you decide you've got a particular number of dimensions (usually 3 if we're talking about things in physical space) they're all indistinguishable. So what is a dimension? Well the number of dimensions simply specifies how many numbers you need to tell where a specific point is: on a flat piece of paper you need two numbers, the first number could refer to how far to move along and the second to how far up but there's no reason it needs to be this way; you could just as easily describe that point by its angle to the horizontal and how far it is away from some specified point. Whatever way you want to describe it though, you always need two bits of information so the flat surface is 2D. </p>
<p>Edit: I'll try and flesh this out to have a go at the 11 dimensions bit.</p>
<p>First off, dimensions beyond 3 spatial and 1 time are theoretical. There's still disagreement among string theorists over the number of extra ones they'd like: supergravity has 7 more spatial ones but i've heard the number 26 thrown around as well. I don't think there's any way to intuitively understand why those numbers should be what they are, its just the way the (very) complicated maths works out. As to why we can't move in these extra dimensions, the classic explanation is that they're curled up very small. This is like if you look at a straw from a long way off: it looks like a line (so 1D) but actually you could move around its surface so to describe where a dot on a straw is you would need two numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AKTS6Umods" target="_blank">video</a></p>
<p>Now, this is the visualization of the 4 dimentions. It is a bit simplistic, but it translates the point. Earth orbits the sun, in a 2D space - on an elipsis. (No it is not a circle, since it is not perfect one - elipsis). However, it also &quot;wiggles&quot; slightly up and down from it's trajectory. Oscilates, I believe is the english word for it. So, technically, in order to describe its motion (position of Earth at given intervals), we need the 3 dimentional coordinate system: X - horizontal, Y - vertical and Z - Depth. Now, the fourth dimention is Time. How do we show that? We obviously need a 4th reference point. In the video, the Sun is portrayed as the axis along which we will measure the movement of the other planets. So it is stationary, relative to them. Lets say we put the axis T - time, through the Sun. So the sun moves forwards in time - basically, along the line/axis T. Relative to it, the Earth, which orbits the Sun, now moves not in an elipsis, but in a spiral - a helix. This is why the statement that Earth moves in an elipsis through space (3D) and in a helix through Spacetime (4D) is true.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot give you a good explanation of the other dimentions. But the answer of r/ohballsman is quite simple - the more you need to describe a given point, to identify its location, the more axis-es you'll need. Each axis is a dimention. 1D is a point. 2D a circle. 3D - a sphere. And 4D... well, best gues is a cyllinder, but that will need some more explaining. (It's sides will be moving in a given direction, at a constant rate, up to infinity.)</p>
<p>I may be wrong on some points regarding time, because of its relative nature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>One thing almost all of the posts on here are missing is the idea of orthogonality.  In simple terms, this means that the dimension should be at &quot;right angles&quot; to each other.  But more importantly, it means that the dimensions are not intertwined.  You can fix all of them, and then change one without changing the others.  For example, you could have a position in a 2-D plane and then change your z-value without changing your x-y position.  You can change your time value without changing the xyz position.  An object with a certain cross section in n-dimensions can be extruded to a solid in n+1 dimensions.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
