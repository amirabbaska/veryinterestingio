<p>This is one of the biggest discoveries in physics and cosmology in decades, providing direct information on the state of the universe when it was only 10^-34 seconds old, energy scales near the Planck energy, as well confirmation of the existence of gravitational waves.</p>
<hr />
<p>As this is such a big event we will be collecting all your questions here, and /r/AskScience's resident cosmologists will be checking in throughout the day.</p>
<p>What are your questions for us?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alan Guth and Andrei Linde just said at the press conference that the inflaton field decays randomly and non-uniformly, and that as it decays, there remain regions of the universe where it hasn't decayed and which continue inflating.  Linde said &quot;this inflation must go on forever&quot;.</p>
<p>This gives me a mental image of a very lumpy universe, with comparatively tiny margins that look like our observable universe, and vastly larger regions that are essentially empty except for the inflaton field and which are still expanding at an absurd rate.  </p>
<p>Is this the right view of our universe?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think one of the biggest things to point out here is that red-shifting evidence supports continued and accelerated expansion, but that this paper provides evidence for very, very early expansion (inflation). Most of the news outlets reporting on this make it seem like we didn't have evidence for expansion until now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
