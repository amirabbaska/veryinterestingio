		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep scientist here. We cannot know what they are thinking about.
However, in mice, dogs and cats at least, they become less active and usually move to their &quot;nest&quot; or dog bed. Here they move from an active wake period (a classification of wake), to a quiet wake period. From here they move into nrem sleep. This behavioral state is classified as really slow and big brains waves known as delta waves. REM sleep state happens less frequently than wake and NREM. When it does it happens after NREM sleep. </p>
<p>So animals transition much the same as humans, well depending on the animal, as some do not have REM sleep. Hell, some animals like ostriches have a mixed state of NREM and REM sleep. Really weird.</p>
<p>anyways, with respect to rodents (mice and rats) they transition super quick. Moving form wake to nrem to rem much faster as they spend less time in these states.</p>
<p>I can run down later and run a recording to show you the different muscle/brain activity that helps us differentiate states or just link to papers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every mammal studied has some kind of sleep-like state similar to human sleep. As for what they think about before they sleep, we may never really know for sure. Some brain activity suggests they they might indeed recite recent behavior they have just partaken in but that's just conjecture based on the activity of several neurons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an answer to your question but a fun related fact.</p>
<p>When cats were given a drug that inhibited their body going into paralysis while asleep they got up and started chasing around and pouncing on dream mice. There's video of it in this sleep documentary on Netflix. It's super cool.</p>
<p>So we know Cats dream about chasing food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2869.7.s1.7.x/pdf" target="_blank">Functional Brain Imaging of Human Sleep</a>: &quot;The results suggest that the permissive and executive processes of slow wave sleep and REM sleep are similar in humans and in animals... In our case, we wanted to describe the characteristic distribution of SWS (&quot;short wave sleep,&quot; not-dreaming), REM (&quot;rapid-eye-movement&quot;, dreaming) sleep or wakefulness (W). We thus compared one particular state of vigilance with all the others. Our results, which were largely confirmed recently... show that each state of vigilance is characterized by a different distribution of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF).&quot; <em>(So each state of vigilance is associated with blood flowing (= that area of the brain metabolizing = that area of the brain active) to specific brain regions.)</em></p>
<p>&quot;in REM sleep..., we observed, as expected, an activation of pontine tegmentum and thalamic nuclei, suggesting that the mechanisms of REM sleep generation are similar in humans and in other mammals.&quot;</p>
<p>Pontine tegmentum controls what stage of sleep you're in. <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Consciousness_Studies/Neuroscience_1#The_Role_of_the_Thalamus" target="_blank">Thalamic nuclei</a> activation = consciousness. The thalamus informs the pineal gland, which is an area of the brain that has photoreceptor cells - which is considered strange because it's in the dark, as far as our visible light goes, and the wavelengths to which pinealocytes respond are visible (Heerd and Dodt 1961).</p>
<p>So, animals go through the same stages of sleep that we do, and use the same mechanisms. However, the animals are going to have different neural structure.</p>
<p>The &quot;lying awake slowly drifting off&quot; phase is &quot;N1&quot; for &quot;non-REM sleep stage 1&quot;. <a href="http://image.slidesharecdn.com/bh4tzdymsgg3cjgm1yk1-signature-9b55f59e471c8e8545ca3dad396accb5adfc7bd97e45529d466342260673f31c-poli-151011070454-lva1-app6891/95/sleep-38-638.jpg?cb=1444549217" target="_blank">Here's a handy chart</a>, cited, for what brain regions are inactive during that stage. The posterior cingulate cortex (mammals) is associated with emotional salience and discrimination - <a href="http://tinyurl.com/jasbnrv
">it gives us the sense of personal identity, who you are,</a> and is activated in autobiographical memories. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precuneus#Function" target="_blank">precuneus</a> is associated with several things but again a coherent sense of self, memory, the &quot;default mental network&quot; which causes us to brood over unsatisfactory memories when the environment lacks novel stimuli, and motor coordination/target shifting and acquisition.</p>
<p>Finally the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_nuclei_of_thalamus" target="_blank">anterior thalamic nuclei</a> modulate alertness and episodic memory, and are involved in orienting the head to stimuli.</p>
<p>All of these anatomical features are present in mammals, so animals will be experiencing the same thing as you: a series of waves of rising and falling self-awareness, self-identity, access to biographical memories, orientation to their own actual physical body. However, it will be in their sensory/cognitive mode rather than yours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
