		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Better than that</p>
<p>Crows used to be primarily a grain eating species (scare crows) but the advent of cars made for roadkill which is an abundant food source. Vultures are no present in much of the country so crows have taken their place. </p>
<p>Some ravens have also been observed deliberately placing hard shelled nuts on the road to let cars crack them</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals may have gotten better at not getting hit, but that could just as well be due to crossing less frequently- not necessarily due to an improvement in crossing skills. In either case itâ€™s hard to pinpoint whether those changes in behavior are genetic or just learned. You could probably make educated guesses based on the species in question; is this species known to exhibit learned patterns of behavior across individuals and generations? Or would avoiding traffic collisions have to stem from genetic instinct? Of course the best way to find out is to experiment. Or occasionally there is an actual physical adaptation, as another commenter gave an example of, which obviously settles the question for that particular species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ive noticed that Kangeroos closer to cities here in Australia tend to stay by the road and are less likely to jump out in front of vehicles from being dazzled by heaflights or startled by the approaching vehicle then their more skittish cousins in the outback.</p>
<p>I think there is a good case for selection, the skittish ones are reproducing less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps in some cases but habitat fragmentation is a major problem with conservation efforts. Animals and plants as well as their associated ecosystem services don't do well in many but fragmented habitats compared to an equal area of nonfragmented ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that it isn't natural selection that makes some animals better with roads but rather learned behavior from parents or experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
