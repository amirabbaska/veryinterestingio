		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, immunotherapy has long been seen as a holy grail for cancer treatment. The immune system is naturally programmed to attack cells that have gone a bit weird (to use the scientific term). The problem tends to be that the cancer cells can also alter themselves so that they are disguised from the immune system, or in fact inhibit any immune cells that come into contact with them. This stops the immune system from seeing them as dangerous, allowing the cancer to grow. So the balance of the immune response is in favour of leaving the cancer alone.</p>
<p>What this treatment does is inject the tumour with molecules that tell the immune cells in the vicinity of the tumour to wake up and start doing their job, overcoming the inhibition that the cancer cells have put in place. This means that the balance of the immune response is now to attack the tumour, which seems to work very well.</p>
<p>The really cool thing is that now that the immune system is trained to see the tumour as bad, and will attack similar cells in different sites. This is why it behaves in some fashion like a vaccine.</p>
<p>It's perfectly viable, and very exciting. As always, there is always the question of how well it translates into human biology but it is still very promising. I think one problem is going to be how specific the immune response is. In the paper, they see the immune cells are trained to attack cells with protein markers unique to the tumour cells, which is a good sign. One concern might be that if you accidentally trigger the immune response to normal cell markers, it could cause your immune system to attack healthy cells which would obviously be a very bad consequence. Another would be how readily a tumour can evolve to overcome the immune system attack. If the immune system only ends up going for certain markers, it could miss tumour cells that don't have the same ones. These could then continue to grow and cause the cancer to return.</p>
<p>ETA: thank you kind, golden stranger!</p>

<p>This type of cancer vaccine is kinda old news. What's really cutting edge are the personalized cancer vaccines based on mRNA that are in clinical trails in humans <strong>already</strong>. Basically, these vaccines are tailored to an individual's cancer. You see, your cancer and my cancer may have the same name, lymphoma for example, but they may be very different in terms of their susceptibility to drugs and especially to vaccines. Using personal genomics to tailor mRNA to program your own cells to make a vaccine against your very unique form of cancer is the real key to all of this. Adding on top of this is that mRNA is just a superior way to produce vaccines. As it turns out, when your body makes the vaccine inside its own cells, it stimulates your immune system more effectively than a vaccine made in a factory and injected (this has to do with MHC1 and MHC2 activation). </p>
<p>These clinical trials are looking promising. If they work, this can be combined with checkpoint inhibitors and other mRNA therapies (that also boost immune response against cancer) and it's bye-bye cancer. </p>
<p>Let's just say that it's the most promising thing I've seen in cancer therapy ever. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a treatment for stage 4 brain cancer that does this indirectly. Duke has modified the polio virus to attack cancer cells, and they inject it into the center of a brain tumor. While the polio virus is attacking the cells, the immune system starts going in to clean up the mess.  In turn, the immune system learns to recognize the cancer cells.  The whole process seems to last for months after just the one single injection.</p>
<p>You can google PVS-RIPO for further information.  The first few patients were treated in 2012-2013 and some are still alive without any further treatment. Those patients had recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme, which is perhaps the deadliest cancer situation that one can imagine.</p>
<p>While this would technically be considered virotherapy, the immune system plays a huge role in the outcome.</p>
<p>They are now in phase 2 trials, and still only for brain tumors, but I believe the assumption is that it could be widely used among many different solid tumors in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a really cool concept that frankesteins together mechanisms of action that we already use.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Making cancer cells visible to the immune system: PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors</p>
</li>
<li>Siccing T-cells on cancer: CAR-T cells, Allogenous stem cell transplantation, BiTE immunotherapy</li>
</ol>
<p>They then do this only locally, circumventing the problems that would arise if we did it systemically, i.e. death from immune system overdrive.</p>
<p>I'm interested in seeing how well it works in humans and reading about it made me slightly nervous about my job to be honest</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I worked on a project and helped publish a paper that also showed this exact effect (even showing it attacked tumors in other locations) several years ago (PMID: 25179345).</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues with directly translating this to therapy is that directly injecting a vaccine into a tumor cell is not necessarily a wise choice and not commonly done (I think, my clinical exposure to oncology isn't large). The main fear is something called &quot;tumor seeding&quot;, which can also happen when they aspirate or biopsy, or do something otherwise invasive with a tumor that could cause cancer cells to dislodge and make it to the blood or lymphatic systems. If the tumor is well-demarcated (ie. enclosed), you don't want to open up a channel to your blood supply for cancer cells to spread throughout your body (hematogenous spread). Clinically the chance of this is probably very low and this is a consideration when physicians consider how to biopsy a tumor, but if you start making it standard procedure, who knows what could happen. </p>
<p>Even if the cancer is metastatic, it is possible that it's in a compartment that is very well isolated from the rest of your body. For example when testicular cancer is suspected, a biopsy is almost never performed and the suspected testicle is straight up removed because it's in a very well-enclosed portion of the body (referring not to the skin scrotum, but another membrane separating it from the inside of your body). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
