		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound is effectively just waves of air moving at different speeds and sizes. While most of them are so small you can really only sense them with your ears, as you start to get really low, the waves start to get a lot bigger, to the point you can actually feel them. That feeling is the air physically vibrating your body, usually with what's called a ground sub. Some Front of House Engineers do this on purpose to get that &quot;concert feel&quot;, and the wavelengths that do it best are actually below your threshold of hearing, in terms of pitch, but can be powerful enough to knock even a grown person over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is infrasonics which are frequencies that hit your body like percussion waves and they are low enough in frequency that you feel as much as hear. Although in a rock concert situation it's more about the power than simply being a low note. </p>
<p>For instance firing a pistol also kicks you in the chest with the sound wave but that isn't an infrasonic sound, but it has infrasonics in it as it's noise IE a range of different frequencies. The lower the pitch the more energy it takes in order to make the sound travel. </p>
<p>To put it another way, high frequency sound are like feathers. It doesn't take much to make them float through the air. Lower notes are like bricks, you can make them fly through the air but it needs a lot more power to do so, and if you catch one in the chest, you're going to feel it. </p>
<p>Or to coin another analogy, when it comes to light you have infrared which are like the bass notes of light, and you have ultraviolet, which are like the high frequency sounds of light. While the high frequency can carry a lot of energy, like xrays and UV light, the lower frequencies can carry a lot of power, like getting burned from standing too close to a bon fire and the infrared radiation actually burns you from the light. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound is, quite simply, a wave of pressure traveling through a medium (typically through air or water).  What you're feeling are very large (low-pitch bass) pressure waves flowing through the air and through you.  Your chest has a lot of mass, therefore, will absorb a lot of the wave as it hits you compared to your ligaments.  The more you absorb, the more you feel.  These waves are literally jostling your insides!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
