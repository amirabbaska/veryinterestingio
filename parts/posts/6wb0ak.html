		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers here have been good for certain circumstances, but the integrity checksum and uncompressing are usually stream operations, so they can happen as the file is downloading.</p>
<p>Virus checking and moving the temporary file to it's finished location are block operations, so they would take time at the end of the download.  But those only happen in specific circumstances - many people don't have virus protection and the temporary file doesn't need to be moved across physical drives / partitions, and yet there is still a delay at 99%.</p>
<p>But there is an answer:</p>
<p><strong>File cache flush.</strong> When the file handle is closed by the browser, it asks the OS to ensure that the file is physically on the drive.  This causes the pipeline from the fast memory-based file cache to complete it's emptying out to the slower hard drive.  This mostly happens continuously, but because the hard drive is slower, it takes some time to catch up.</p>
<p>You can also see an opposite effect: for medium-sized files, the first few percent is much faster as the memory cache fills up, then it slows down  when the memory cache gets full or is flushed and has to wait for the hardware.</p>
<p>The size of the cache varies depending on your memory usage, hard drive speed and type, operating system and lots of other factors.  The hard drive flush speed also varies depending on what other programs are using the drive, so it's hard or impossible to roll this in to the download time estimate.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three possible reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1. File integrity verification:</strong> Your computer performs an operation on the data you downloaded and compares the result to a checksum. If answer and checksum do not match, the data is corrupt. This is how your computer tells if your file's data is a completely correct copy. </p>
<p><strong>2. Uncompressing:</strong> Some optimised downloaders or protocols (usually modern ones) have built-in compression. Compression reduces file size and helps with download duration. However, to extract the raw file from a compressed one, it needs to be decompressed first. The 1% is decompressing: you may notice the 1% takes longer for bigger files. </p>
<p><strong>3. Virus scan:</strong> Modern browsers also have in-built virus scanning. The process is similar to file integrity verification, but your computer actively looks and matches for malicious code checksums. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that your favorite cousin sent message to you</p>
<p>Here's the catch: the entire message doesn't come entirely at once. They come in a string of letters, and there are a lot of them, and there are 2-3 days between each letter arriving</p>
<p>So when you finally have the final letter, you start assembling the entire letters, THEN you can read the message again in its entirety, to make sure you don't misremember</p>
<p>Getting the letters is what the 99% shows, assembling and reading them is what 1% does</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
