		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi ... I am a general and emergency pediatrician ... the answer is absolutely, children's growth is affected by chronic illness.  The mechanisms aren't clear (to me) but probably include a change in calorie consumption.  Best examples: those kids with Chron's disease who are short, thin and have delayed puberty, or those infants with significant cardiac disease who develop &quot;cardiac cachexia&quot;).  Growth hormone metabolism may also be involved ... best example of this are those kids who are short following cranial radiation therapy, which may affect the pituitary gland products.  In fact, looking for poor growth and development is a key clinical activity in identifying significant chronic disease.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, energy that would go to growth is instead expended fighting disease. However, if the child recovers and thereafter has access to good nutrition, growth will proceed faster than normal for a time. This catch-up growth can erase some or even all of the deficit caused during the period of sickness. Catch up growth has been observed in children adopted from poor developing countries into wealthy societies, and was discovered from plantation records to occur to a remarkable degree in slaves (slave children were considered unproductive and fed inadequate protein, once they were capable of working their diets improved). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very complicated subject. I don't know specifically about cancer medication, but the human growth hormone (hGH), produced by the pituitary gland, is the responsible for children growth. In adulthood the production of hGH slows down greatly (unless there is a tumor in said gland). hGH production peaks mainly during rest/sleep periods. A boy that is sick with, typically, a fever will be in bed for several days, sleeping most of the time, and if he's well fed, he might actually end up being taller than his identical twin brother that didn't get sick.</p>
<p>So there are many factors to take into account: proper nutrition, resting, interaction of the drugs with hGH production.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
