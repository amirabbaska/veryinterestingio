		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're right in looking at venous pO2, but more important is arterial pO2 when considering consciousness. The most important factor in O2 dissolving into the blood is the concentration gradient between atmospheric O2 partial pressure and blood pO2. Venous blood coming to the lungs has a pO2 of around 40mmHg as you found, but this pO2 will quickly rise to around 100mmHg as oxygen from the atmosphere (pO2 at sea level being around 160mmHg) dissolves into the blood down its concentration gradient. As atmospheric pO2 drops, so does the delivery of oxygen into the blood. As a point of reference, oxygen deliver to the rest of the body begins to <a href="http://droualb.faculty.mjc.edu/Course%20Materials/Physiology%20101/Chapter%20Notes/Fall%202007/figure_17_08_labeled.jpg" target="_blank">significantly drop off</a> at an arterial pO2 of around 70-80mmHg due to reduced binding to hemoglobin. At high altitude (enough where atmospheric pO2 equals 40mmHg) this concentration gradient is gone, and there is no net movement of O2 into the blood from the lungs. If someone suddenly went from normal atmospheric pO2 to an atmospheric pO2 lower than 40mmHg, you would technically be losing oxygen as you attempted to breath, but this wouldn't necessarily last long since the venous pO2 would also drop (and you know, can't breath well when you're dead, so there's that too)</p>
<p>edit: I should correct myself a little. At an atmospheric pO2 of 40mmHg there will still be movement of oxygen into the blood (if the transition was gradual rather than immediate), this amount of oxygen is just not enough to sustain life for any long period of time. </p>
<p>edit 2: As /u/purplepatch pointed out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The partial pressure of oxygen at 10000m is 28% of sea level (about 6kPa). What you really want to know is the partial pressure in the alveoli. These are the little air filled sacs in the lungs where gas exchange with the blood takes place. The gas in the alveoli not the same as the atmosphere. There is saturated water vapour and CO2 all competing with the oxygen for space. The equation you need to calculate this is the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_gas_equation" target="_blank">alveolar gas equation</a>. If you plug the numbers in you get an partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli of near zero. Oxygen therefore diffuses down its concentration gradient from the venous blood which surrounds the alveoli into the gas filled part of the alveoli and out into the atmosphere as you breath.</p>

<p>this is the more important piece I forgot about in my original answer</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also consider that due to outside air pressure, holding your breath becomes very hard... It's effectively trying to suck the air out of your lungs. I even read something a while back saying that holding your breath during an explosive decompression event is especially dangerous as the pocket of air will attempt to explosively decompress from your lungs </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work as a freediving (skin/breath-hold diving) instructor and might be able to add some insight.</p>
<p>There is some connection to the partial pressure of oxygen in your blood. At sea level this pressure is 0.21 which goes down as you hold your breath; you lose consciousness when this reaches 0.1 (Note: these numbers are not percentages and is separate from saturation of oxygen).</p>
<p>At higher altitudes, because the total atmospheric pressure is lower, the partial pressure of oxygen in your blood starts lower and so you reach the 0.1 threshold sooner.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure how starting in a pressurized environment would affect this but the effect of low pressure is apparent in Mt Everest's &quot;death zone&quot;.</p>
<p>Interestingly, because the pressure increases when you dive underwater you can technically hold your breath longer (until you come back to the surface where the pressure returns to normal causing you to pass out).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When you hold your breath this process doesn’t happen and so oxygen loss is purely through the metabolism of oxygen and is much slower (about 250ml/min)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes your lungs will work “backwards” I think below a certain partial pressure and it’s probably just best not to breath.  The oxygen regulators on aircraft first increase the amount of oxygen (up to 100%) then can also increase the pressure of the flow as well.</p>
<p>This is from memory but I think in an emergency situation this can keep you conscious in an unpressurised cabin at altitudes just above 40,000’.</p>
<p>A few years back I lost cabin pressure at FL500, but thankfully it wasn’t a violent one - but you can definitely feel it happening.  It’s eerie.</p>
<p>Got a bit of the hypoxia effects in the descent which I tried to balance getting down quick with not putting the jet so nose low that if I passed out I wouldn’t be able to recover.  It ended up being uneventful.</p>
<p>The time of useful consciousness at high altitudes decreases to ~6-9 seconds which is basically the oxygen stored in your brain.  That’s without an oxygen regulator of course...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
