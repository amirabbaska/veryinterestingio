		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain actually needs to cool down in the evening to slow its activity and begin to rest.</p>
<p>Source: David Avery, MD. He's my doctor, who has specialized in the study of the effect of sleep on psychiatric disorders for many years. </p>
<p>Further detail on sleep. His recommendations to me have always been:</p>
<p>Sleep in a cold, dark room (I forget the ideal temperature)</p>
<p>No blue light an hour before bed (screens, daylight/full spectrum bulbs). Use lamps, not overheads in the evening if possible. </p>
<p>Get to sleep within 30 minutes of the same time every night - same for waking. Hormone production throughout the day depends on the diurnal cycle. </p>
<p>Wake gradually with a dawn simulator if you can. </p>
<p>Don't disrupt your routine on the weekends (social jetlag he calls it). </p>
<p>It's natural for your body clock to shift through the seasons, but as it shifts, maintain consistency in the amount of sleep you get and don't shift too far. It's tempting to sleep less in summer, but especially for people with bipolar disorder, lack of sleep is associated with the onset of mania.</p>
<p>Edit: I don't mean to dispense medical advice. I'm really just repeating some things my doctor told me, all of which seems like pretty common sense advice. It's what amounts to clean livin' - sleep enough, eat well and be active. It's all the stuff we know we <em>should</em> be doing. Also, made a sentence clearer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A cold room helps lower core body temperature, a signal for inducing sleep. Your circadian rhythm typically lowers body temperature at night, so this exacerbates the signal. But it typically is combined with high sleep pressure (accumulated levels of adenosine in the brain). During the day, your body temperature is closer to the peak regulated temperature and you have low sleep pressure. (There's also a midday dip, but I'm ignoring that.) So cold during the day isn't usually going to make you fall asleep. Probably people have the idea that jolting awake people with cold air will keep them alert.</p>
<p>This is all off the top of my head, so there might be some inaccuracies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually cold rooms lower productivity. I think the temperature for maximum productivity is like 71.5 or something, which since in an office you are wearing long sleeves and pants this will keep your body temperature relatively constant. Any temperature where your body has to work harder maintain homeostasis (98.6 f) will lower productivity. The reason cold rooms help us sleep is because your core temp has to drop for us to sleep</p>
<p>Edit: it should be noted that the temperature will be for different people in regards to gender and preference. But the productivity of a whole office is increased at that temp so for the majority it will be around there +- a few degrees</p>
<p>Edit 2: body temp</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can you provide evidence that cold rooms are used to increase productivity? I've only ever witnessed it have the opposite effects in schools and workplaces. Ideally I would think the aim is &quot;as an average, not hot, just cool enough that the workers remain at a good temperature.&quot;</p>
<p>Usually if you keep it cold in an office, or hot, workers will buy heaters or fans. A bank I worked at kept it ~70, which is not cold by any means, but since they had to sit around all day several of them did get chilly and would have small heaters beneath their desks. They couldn't stay productive if they were cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's low temperatures which help us sleep, it's a <em>fall</em> in temperature. If your home stayed the same low temperature all day and night, for instance, it wouldn't work. You are triggered to sleep by the temperature changing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
