		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First its important to note that so called feats of &quot;hysterical strength&quot; are not scientifically recognized, although they are well documented.  They clearly happen, but science has a hard time testing them, because its obviously very hard to reproduce in a lab. </p>
<p>However, they have given small tests, like testing grip strength, and then electrically stimulated the muscles and tested again, and found that people exhibit about 25% more strength under electroshock, which definitely verifies people are in general stronger than they're normally able to access.  Additionally, you may have heard of people being flung across an entire room after being electrocuted.  This isn't because of the electricity - electricity doesn't move things like that - its because the shock caused massive muscle contraction, and the people flung <em>themselves</em> across the room, jumping far further than they would have believed possible under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>So, because they can't test hysterical strength, we can only hypothesize why adrenaline causes it.  More than likely it is because your muscles are under several inhibitory systems, including pain as well as the neurological restriction of simply having not enough signaling at any given time to activate all the muscle fibers in a group.  Strength isn't just about raw strength, its about <em>timing</em>; you need one perfectly timed electrical burst to signal all fibers to work in concert when exerting force.  The more fibers activated simultaneously, the more strength you'll have. </p>
<p>Adrenaline most likely acts to remove several different limiter systems.  Your pain sensation is dulled or removed entirely, your blood vessels are dialated and your muscles are more heavily oxygenated, and your neural activity increases; more brain activity = increased signaling, which means you're better able to activate more muscle fibers at once. </p>
<p>The reason we can't do this all the time is fairly obvious - it puts much more strain on the body and consumes far more energy.  Since our bodies evolved in times of scarcity, our bodies evolved a logical mechanism for limiting the bodies ability to use its full strength and energy; only when the brain sensed certain stimuli (a tiger, a child in trouble), would it release its natural chemicals that overrode its own internal limiters, allowing for a brief state of higher muscle performance.  </p>
<p>EDIT:  Thought I'd throw this out there just 'cause: what people normally call &quot;adrenaline&quot; is actually called &quot;epinephrine&quot;.  The name &quot;adrenaline&quot; comes from a company that tried to patent a synthetic epinephrine compound, and then name stuck.  There's another hormone called &quot;norepinephrine&quot;, which some scientists theorize may actually be responsible for &quot;hysterical strength&quot;.  It operates much faster than epinephrine, and acts as a primer, which engages the body and officially switches it to &quot;fight or flight&quot; mode.  It can also cause the muscles to start dumping their glucose stores (your muscles store glucose for quick, instant feats of anaerobic strength, because aerobic energy doesn't engage instantly).  The fact that norepinephrine greatly increases brain activity, and causes a massive release of muscular energy, may be the contributing factor to huge bursts of extra-natural strength. </p>
<p>EDIT EDIT:  Some people have (correctly) indicated that &quot;adrenalin(e)&quot; and &quot;epinephrine&quot; are called different things in different countries.  True!  I mostly included the edit to point out that the common reactions of the body to adrenaline / epinephrine in the case of hysterical strength can actually be attributed to several molecules, and refer to &quot;epinephrine&quot; so that it can be seen in relation to &quot;norepinephrine.&quot;  I would just add that the &quot;proper&quot; name for the molecule is still under debate, and this site does an excellent job summarizing the conflicting nomenclatures and debating for a unified name: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127537/#__sec7title" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127537/#__sec7title</a>   </p>
<p>EDIT THE THIRD:  Wow, surprised and thankful for so many upvotes!  In honor, I thought I'd go a little deeper into an ELI-a-very-bright-fifteen-year-old explanation of the topic, for those who are interested, and talk about some of the things many people have brought up in the comments. </p>
<p>The brain controls muscles by sending impulses to &quot;motor units&quot;, which is a motor neuron and the various actual muscle fibers that are activated by that neuron.  This is called recruitment.   If you want to curl a 20lb dumbell, your brain has to &quot;recruit&quot; all the proper motor units in your arm, hand, and shoulder necessary to lift it, by sending the &quot;contract&quot; signal to them.  Humans have many, many motor units, which allows us for very intricate, refined movements.  You can play guitar, dextrously use tools, and figure skate!  </p>
<p>But it also means your brain has to work a lot harder, and disperse signals a lot farther and wider, to fully activate a muscle.  Comparatively, chimps have much fewer motor units, but the motor units they <em>do</em> have control many more fibers.  So a single &quot;contract&quot; signal now applies to a MUCH wider group of muscles, which makes them <em>appear</em> stronger. </p>
<p>No one is precisely sure, but on a given basis, for a given task for a large muscle like your bicep, you may only use as little as 25% of the <em>total muscle fibers</em>.  Even though it seems like you're trying your hardest, your brain simply isn't signalling all of the fibers inside that muscle. </p>
<p>But lets take a scenario of hysterical strength.  Adrenalin and norepinephrine activate your sympathetic nervous system, dialate your eyes, increase brain activity, and more importantly, <em>consolidate your focus</em>.  If you think about lifting a dumbell in a gym, your concentration is branching out in many directions.  You're thinking about your day, your surroundings, your hunger, aches and pains.  All of these detract from your brains ability to send recruitment signals to motor units.  But now, in a state of supremely focused motivation - rescue a loved one - <em>all</em> your focus is dedicated to a single task.  NOW when your brain sends a recruitment signal, its sending it to MANY more motor units - 80, 90, maybe even 100% of the total muscle fibers in a given muscle, across many muscles.  </p>
<p>In the moment, this may seem like superhuman strength, but in actuality, its only because we so rarely experience the full extent of our strength.  Athletes get to where they are by practicing specific and timed recruitment of specific motor units.  This study: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22351379" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22351379</a></p>
<p>Shows that in athletes, the physical volume of their cerebellum (the part of the brain responsible for sending the coordination &amp; motor recruitment signals) is larger than non-athletes; i.e, they can recruit <em>more</em> motor units, faster, while in a &quot;normal&quot; state than the average person.  By contrast, in a high-stress adrenal state, your brain has to divert processing power to recruiting motor neurons in order to achieve your greater state of strength, compromising things like external focus, logic, etc.  Athletes, because of a greater volume in their cerebellum, can achieve physically profound feats <em>without</em> compromising these functions, and don't need to rely on a sudden huge influx of Adrenalin to do so - they can summon it at will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a post or comment not long ago where a redditor was on a muscle relaxant, when the drug kicked in, he realised he could do so many things he never knew he could! He could touch his toes, do yoga positions he never could think of trying! Edit: The point of this part was to say that he woke up the next day and he had severely damaged his muscles, so just because you CAN do it, your body knows not to for painful reasons.</p>
<p>This is a similar thing that happens, when anything takes the &quot;don't hurt yourself&quot; out of the situation, your body can do amazing things, you could bite through your tongue or finger through relative ease, but your brain KNOWS it would hurt you, so it keeps It's self in check. Your body knows that if you successfully lifted a car, your muscles would rip and you would be in a LOT of pain, but the adrenaline would damper the instinct to protect yourself from this minimum in the long run pain, in order to do whatever you need to do in the moment.</p>
<p>I hope that made sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the reason I recall hearing about has to do with the evolution of fine-tuned motor skills in humans.</p>
<p>the first thing to note is that the raw power a given muscle in your body, if it contracted all its muscle cells in synchrony, is much greater than what you can ordinarily exert if you try to flex it as hard as you can. this has been demonstrated in lab settings. the human brain, and/or its complex neural network for coordinated muscle movement, actually inhibits the 100% coordinated contraction of all muscle fibres at one time. This is because there are so many processing and sub-processing junctions, kind of like an army base with many levels of decision-making commanders and sub-commanders. or better yet, like asking a federal government full of bureaucrats to fix a problem fast. the neural routes may be fine-tuned, but they won't all act in synchrony and the end result will not be enacted in a perfectly synchronized manner (on the cellular level). many staggered contractions rather than a single <em>contraction</em>, and this evening out on the large scale to a more tempered, even movement. this was a good thing, generally.</p>
<p>These neural processing junctions/feedback loops are highly useful for delicate, fine-tuned body motions, many of which we have needed through time, from deft delicate touches and manipulation to threading needles, making fine tools and using them, making fine weapons and using them, or anything that involves intricate thought and motion, etc. But they have the draw-back of interrupting the path of a single, coordinated muscle impulse. most of the time, that was fine. we humans got by without needing our full strength, trading it for a calculated delicate touch. and that has been instrumental in our development of powerful technologies from the Stone Age forward.</p>
<p><em>however</em>, even though we developed these fine-tuned movement abilities, our species retained the ability to call on brute strength when it was deathly necessary. obviously, there's a huge adaptive advantage to that. the fight-or-flight response is a special adrenaline-fuelled state when the body forgoes complexity and normal rules. it's not about due process or red tape, it's about sudden, unequivocal action to prevent death or tragedy. the spike of adrenaline overrides the complexity processing for our muscles' neural network, and allows burst signals to fire through, telling muscles to <em>contract</em> in a coordinated fashion, albeit with less finesse, giving power and speed in a burst. the power to rip the door off a car to save your baby, or stuff like that.</p>
<p>given that it's an emergency system only, our bodies are no longer adapted to handle the stress, and there can be injuries associated with the extreme forces. but that beat dying, so it was passed on. </p>
<p>as an interesting side-note, I also recall hearing that other ape species have better access to their full muscle power, which is why they are terrifyingly strong even though they seem similar in size to us. but the trade-off is they never developed the same level of delicate muscle control we did. who won that round? probably the species reading this via their smartphones and computers that we built with fine-tuned muscle control.</p>
<p>TL;DR adrenaline cuts through the red tape of our useful but complicated neural network and makes our muscles coordinate abnormally better to escape death with power and speed</p>
<p>(forgive me, I can't recall the source I heard this from, which makes this sound really unscientific. I believe I was watching a documentary)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adrenaline tends to come with the dulling of pain for obvious reasons; you don't want to worry about wounds when fighting for your life.</p>
<p>The application of your strength is also limited by pain so you don't hurt yourself in your exertions. Someone who is fit is able to tear their muscles apart or even break ligaments if they contract to their fullest but the body avoids this by governing it with pain.</p>
<p>By dulling pain the muscles can be used beyond safe bounds at the cost of potential damage. So it doesn't actually make the person stronger just more able to use what they have. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
