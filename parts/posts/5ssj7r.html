Same as if you see a text and look up the phone number, you now have the identity of the person who said it.  It is a courtesy to hide the identity of the person you took pictures of and protects you from implicating them in something they don't want to be seen doing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question has mostly shifted to &quot;How can I get personal information with only a license plate number?&quot; but I'll try to answer your original question. I'll assume you mean in the US.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, people block personally identifiable information from pictures out of respect for people it would help identify. When you post a picture on the Internet you have to assume it will be available for <strong>all to see</strong> for <strong>all eternity</strong> (an oversimplification but you get the point). And although a situation can seem very innocuous, the fact that a given vehicle can be identified as being at a specific location at even an approximate time can have a huge effect on some people's lives.</p>
<p>Governments can use this kind of information to track people. In (civil) court cases this can be used to prove a person's location at a given time - this could be used in divorce cases, for example. Just because it's not extremely easy for the average joe to identify someone from a license plate now does not mean it will not become easy in, say, 10 years time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's put it this way, a reddit user submits two types of content, their car in whatever sub it belongs, and their butthole in whatever sub it belongs.</p>
<p>Now lets say their boss or friends or family also browse car subs, or butthole subs, maybe one day they see said car and plate and think &quot;oh I wonder what else employee/friend/family likes to post about&quot;</p>
<p>Next thing you know you're at a family intervention or being fired because you like to post your butthole all over the internet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One day while in the car with my aunt, we were pulled over on the freeway.  About 6 cop cars were behind us, had made all traffic stop 50 yards behind us, and had their guns drawn. When they approached the car, they told us that our car was reported stolen. They hesitantly searched the car, during which they discovered the front and back license plate differed by one letter. </p>
<p>Someone had stole my aunts back license plate and replaced it with one that was reported stolen. They presumably put the one they stole on their car. how they found my aunts car I have no idea, but I guarantee you they knew how to find it</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
