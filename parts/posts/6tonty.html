		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hellen Keller for example, who was deafblind since age two, communicated with a modified form of sign language that involved touching the symbols to a persons hand. She also read lips by touch. My question is, how did she get there? I know many words can be taught by touch (sign &quot;Apple&quot;, have the person touch an apple), but what about more abstract stuff? Or the alphabet, for that matter? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a nurse that works with DeafBlind individuals, hopefully I can explain this well! </p>
<p>For most things, it's all about teaching the concept behind the idea.  And using all other available senses. Also, repetition. </p>
<p>For an apple, you can sign with AITSL (adapted interactive tactile sign language - hand over hand) the sign for apple. Have them eat an apple, sign it again. Smell apples, sign it again. Feel the apple, sign it again. Etc. </p>
<p>For more abstract concepts - for example, laundry - seems simple enough.  It's easy to teach someone the <em>skill</em> of doing laundry, but <em>why</em> do we do it. Because things are dirty, of course.  But if you cant see the dirt, or get the concept of the clothes being 'dirty', it seems silly as to why we put out clothes in this machine.  So we have to start with teaching 'dirty', go I. The garden, get messy, feel/smell the dirt on your clothes.  Then teach the concept of clean.  Then putting it all together, explaining that the machine takes the clothes from dirty to clean.  This is a painstakingly long process, and also relies alot on the DeafBlind individuals cognitive abilities. </p>
<p>Also, keep in mind, most DeafBlind folks have some residual hearing and vision.  One client I support just requires that we sign for her about 2-4 inches right in front of her left eye, as that's where her visual field is. </p>
<p>I hope that helps! </p>
<p>Edit: Gold?!?! Thank you, a hundred times over, kind strangers!!
Also I've had a lot of requests for an AMA, I'm totally going to do it, stay tuned! And thank you all for the overwhelming interest in what I have to say!! And especially to OP for asking the question that started all of this awesome dialogue :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a newer communication system, Protactile, which came from the Deafblind community. It involves signing in a tactile manner, as well as 'backchannelling&quot;, which is tapping on the speaker's body to indicate you are following, like a sighted person would nod or make noises like hmmmm to indicate being engaged in the conversation. This allows persons with Deafblindness to speak directly with one another. An awesome Deafblind writer, John Lee Clark has very interesting pieces on Tumblr, if you are interested in work by someone who lives this experience.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The documentary film by Weiner Herzog called Land of Silence and Darkness is about a woman who is deafblind teaching other deafblinds how to communicate. It is phenomenal. I wept tears of wonder and inspiration at the lengths to which humans are capable of going to help their fellow humans. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Helen Keller's autobiography covers this fairly well. She was deafblind from a pre-adolescent age and went on to be tremendously successful.</p>
<p>It's been a long time since i read that but it essentially involved a form of the tactile signing others have explained, plus a lot of repetition and exposure. She gave the example of being taught the signs to spell the word water, and having her hand placed under running water by her teacher. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Helen Keller's teacher would trace letters and words on Keller's hand with their fingers. </p>
<p>In one specific instance, the teacher placed a doll in one of Keller's hands, and then traced the letters D-O-L-L on the palm of her other hand. Eventually Keller would communicate &quot;doll&quot; back to her teacher.</p>
<p>This can be expanded upon to include other objects, verbs, and ideas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
