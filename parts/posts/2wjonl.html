		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can try my hand at the strong force.</p>
<p>Its most exotic characteristic is that, unlike with gravity or electromagnetism, the magnitude of the strong force is proportional to a <strong>positive</strong> power of the distance. That means that it gets stronger as distance increases. Because of this, everything subject to that force tends to clumps up (the technical term is confinement). If you tried to separate a pair of quarks, for example, you'd have to pump so much energy into the system that you'd create two more quarks to pair up with the ones that you've separated (here you would be transferring energy to mass as per Einstein's famous equation).</p>
<p>While gravity only has one charge and electromagnetism has two, the strong force has six. Strong force charge is called &quot;color&quot;. Fundamental units of strong charge are red, green or blue, while their anti-particles are anti-red, anti-green and anti-blue. To get something that is white, i.e. color neutral and not affected by the strong force, you need either all three colors, all three anti-colors or a color-anti-color pair. That's why hadrons are either made of three quarks (like protons and neutrons) or two (pions, for instance).</p>
<p>However, for any force you need a particle that will mediate it. For electromagnetism, that particle is the photon, which is massless and chargeless. For the strong force, that particle is the gluon. The gluon, however, has color, which means it is also affected by its own force. That's the main reason why strong force is way more complicated to treat than the two more mainstream ones, and can't have an equation derived from a potential.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the gold, now I get to figure out what it does!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To understand what each of the fundamental forces are, the first question we must answer is this: <em>What is a force?</em></p>
<p>In the most general sense, <strong>a force is any external interaction which changes the state of a particle</strong>.</p>
<p>From classical physics, we know that any particle which is left undisturbed will travel in a straight line with constant velocity forever. Nothing interacts with it, nothing changes.</p>
<p>Then <strong>gravity</strong> comes in. A particle which comes near anything with mass will have its momentum changed. The heavier the mass or the closer the object, the faster the momentum will change. The particle will speed up, slow down, change direction, or some combination of those.</p>
<p>How? Every object that has mass/energy effects space and time. The details don't matter, but what is important is that heavy objects tend to &quot;pull&quot; on space. Which makes space and time bend in weird ways. When sometimes encounters this bent spacetime, it will still follow a straight path through that bent spacetime, but its actual trajectory will seem curved, sped up or slowed down.</p>
<p>So far so good for objects with no charge. But sometimes particles have an <strong>electric</strong> charge through which they can affect each other's momentum. They don't simply attract, but can also repel. The two types of electric charge are labeled (+) and (-), opposites attract and likes repel. How strongly? Well, the stronger the charge the stronger the force, and the closer together they are, the stronger the force.</p>
<p>But that's not everything. If you carefully measure the forces from these electrically charged particles, you would see that something is &quot;off&quot; when they're moving. The forces are not <em>quite</em> what you'd expect. It turns out there is another effect in play, that of <strong>relativity</strong>. When objects move fast, weird things start happening like lengths that become shorter or timescales that become longer. Again, the details don't matter, but they have a measurable effect on the kind of forces that these electric charges exert on each other. We call the difference between the force we'd expect from a static picture, and the actually measured force <strong>magnetism</strong>.</p>
<p>But how does this work exactly? This is the point where we start looking at microscopic stuff and things get <strong>weird</strong>. Lets forget everything we know about particles and forces and start from scratch. A particle can be considered as a very small chunk of highly condensed energy. As we all know, energy is conserved, but can be changed from one form to another. A particle like an electron, which is a small chunk of condensed energy, can be split into two different chunks of energy: a new^1 electron with different kinetic energy and a photon.</p>
<p>e^- → e^- + γ</p>
<p>How often does this happen? All the time. Randomly^2. It just does, in every direction. But it averages out to zero, so we won't notice anything in a single particle. But this photon can be absorbed by another electron.</p>
<p>e^- + γ → e^-</p>
<p>Now the second electron has absorbed the momentum the photon was carrying, and the result is a force between the two electrons. Photons are massless and do not decay, so this charge can reach infinitely far. A bajigazillion (technical term) exchanges of photons produce a huge change in momentum, which we can easily see as a classical force. Furthermore, the photon has no electric charge, so doesn't interact with itself.</p>
<p>So much for the classical forces. But what about the others? We're getting into slightly unfamiliar territory, but the same principles still apply. Beyond electric charge, certain particles, called <strong>quarks</strong>, also have <strong>color charge</strong>. Instead of two, there are three types of color charge, labeled red, green and blue. These are the charges of the <strong>strong force</strong>. Obviously, these charges have nothing to do with actual colors, but they are named so because three of those charges are required to neutralize each other.</p>
<p>If you have a positive and negative electric charge and bring them close together, the effects you feel at long distance will be almost zero, because the effect of the two charges neutralize. The same happens with color charges, though you need three quarks of different color together to get <strong>neutral</strong>. Another option is having a quark/anti-quark pair with corresponding color/anti-color^3. You're probably wondering if this also works in terms of &quot;likes repel and opposites attract&quot;, but the situation is slightly more complex.</p>
<p>Just as the electromagnetic force is carried by photons, the strong force is carried by <strong>gluons</strong>. What does this interaction look like? Does it change the momentum of the particles like the photon does? Yes, but that's not the only thing. Gluons are not color neutral. They carry a color and an anti-color charge. Tt effectively allows them to change another particles color charge. So for example:</p>
<p>blue quark → red quark + blue/anti-red gluon</p>
<p>And if a red quark happens to be nearby, it can absorb the gluon:</p>
<p>red quark + blue/anti-red gluon → blue quark</p>
<p>But that's not all! The gluons can also couple to <em>each other</em>:</p>
<p>green/anti-blue gluon + red/anti-green gluon → red/anti-blue gluon</p>
<p>Gluons are massless, like photons, meaning they can reach infinitely far. But because they can interact with themselves, that also allows them to multiply as they travel (just reverse the interaction above). So that means that the further two quarks are apart, the more gluons they will be sending to each other. This results in the force getting <strong>stronger with distance</strong>. Luckily this doesn't spiral out of control, eventually the energy in the intermediate space will become so large, it will condense into a quark/anti-quark pair, forming new neutral particles with the ones that were interacting previously.</p>
<p>Three quarks can form a <strong>proton</strong> or a <strong>neutron</strong>, each having a neutral color charge. But sometimes gluons escape, allowing them to interact with each other. These &quot;leakages&quot; are what holds atomic nuclei together, but the specific interactions are fiendishly hard to calculate.</p>
<p>Now what determines whether three quarks will form a proton or a neutron? The answer is quark <strong>flavor</strong>. The only two relevant flavors^4 for us at this point are called up and down. The up quark has an electric charge^5 of +2/3, while the down quark has an electric charge of -1/3. A proton consists of <em>uud</em>; two ups and one down. This gives it a total charge of +1. The neutron is <em>udd</em>, with zero electric charge^6.</p>
<p>Why is this relevant, you ask? Because of the <strong>weak force</strong>. It is the third^7 interaction that governs the quarks in the protons/neutrons in the nuclei, alongside the electromagnetic and strong force. And the question is of course what it does. It affects momentum, just like the electromagnetic and strong force, but that is the least important of its effects.</p>
<p>Because the weak force is the only interaction that can <strong>change flavor</strong>. Now this works the same as the other two. The weak interaction has three force carriers. The W^+, the Z^0 and the W^-. Their electric charges are +1, 0 and -1 respectively, and the two W particles are each other's anti-particle. I won't go into detail about the Z, so lets consider the W's.</p>
<p>A quark will spontaneously emit W particles, just as it emits photons and gluons. This works in the following way:</p>
<p><em>u</em> → <em>d</em> + W^+</p>
<p>An up quark can emit a W^+ and change flavor to a down quark. If another down is nearby, it can absorb this W^+ and change itself into an up. This will have its usual contribution to change in momentum, but overall we will still have an up and a down.</p>
<p>But what if an up quark in a proton emits a W^+ and the W^+ escapes? Well, it will turn the proton into a neutron, because the total quark flavor will have changed from <em>uud</em> to <em>udd</em>.</p>
<p>p^+ → n^0 + W^+</p>
<p>Likewise, a neutron can change into a proton by emitting a W^- or absorbing a W^+.</p>
<p>You might ask what happens to the W now. These W particles are quite heavy, so they will quickly decay (break into smaller chunks of energy). Which ones, well...</p>
<p>W^+ → e^+ + ν_e</p>
<p>Okay, what happened here? The W broke up into an anti-electron and an electron <strong>neutrino</strong>. Neutrinos are nearly massless, neutral particles which only interact through the weak force. Although there are many interesting things about them, there isn't much to say about them in this context. They hardly interact at all with anything. They just kind of pass through everything.</p>
<p>This is the mechanism with which (beta) <strong>nuclear decay</strong> occurs. If an atomic nucleus would be more stable with a different proton/neutron ratio, a proton will change into a neutron or vice versa. Why specific ratios are more stable is then again determined by the electromagnetic and strong force.</p>
<p>I hope you at least understood some of that :)</p>
<p>^(1 How can we distinguish between a new electron and the same electron which simply bounced off a photon? It depends on your interpretation of &quot;same electron&quot;. In essence, all electrons are identical and indistinguishable. But every time an electron's state is changed, such as its momentum or any other feature, it could be considered a completely newly created particle while the old one is destroyed.)</p>
<p>^(2 The probability of this happening is actually tied to the amount of momentum and energy the photon is carrying but the details of this are very technical.)</p>
<p>^(3 Anti-quarks do not carry color, but anti-color. They are aptly named anti-red, anti-green and anti-blue.)</p>
<p>^(4 There are six of them. Up, strange &amp; top have electric charge +2/3; while down, charm &amp; bottom have charge -1/3. There are corresponding anti-quarks with anti-flavors and opposite charges.)</p>
<p>^(5 These are fractions of the elementary charge <em>e</em>. The charge of the electron is -1.)</p>
<p>^(6 There are some wonderful experiments that map the position of + and - charge within the neutron. It also has a significant magnetic moment because the quarks are not stationary.)</p>
<p>^(7 Gravity is irrelevant here)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't be sad!  We understand the fundamental forces perfectly well (err, except gravity..  We're working on that one).  At the classical (i.e. non-quantum / first-year-physics) level, we're taught to think about forces F = {some function of position and time}, and we're taught that forces act on particles causing them to accelerate.  More often, we talk about the potential of a force, which is just it's integral.  So for newtonian gravity and coulomb interaction we talk about a 1/r potential (which leads to a 1/r^2 force when you differentiate).</p>
<p>First, let me try to describe how a force is different from matter from the POV of modern theoretical physics, then I'll get to specific examples.  In the language of quantum field theory, which is how we currently talk about fundamental forces, a &quot;force field&quot; is a field which is introduced into your equations in order to impose that some symmetry of the matter fields holds true.  The procedure of introducing forces into your matter equations is known as &quot;gauging&quot; the matter.  The whole procedure is called &quot;gauge theory.&quot;  All of the forces that we understand well (i.e. everything but gravity) are described using gauge theory, and we don't know why it works so well.  But it does and we're big fans of that so we do it a lot.
Once you have a theory with &quot;matter fields&quot; and &quot;force fields,&quot; you can extract classical potentials (like 1/r potentials) from the quantum field theory.  But the full quantum field theory is capable of much crazier behavior which is all insignificant at the classical level but is very significant at the quantum level (things like vacuum polarization). </p>
<p>Specific example time.  The first force that we really understood properly was E&amp;M, so lets talk about that.  For brevity, I'm going to gloss over some details about the fact that electrons have spin.  If you write down the equation for electrons by themselves (with no forces), your electron field is a complex valued function of space and time.  I.e. your electrons are described by, </p>
<p>phi(x,y,z,t) = some complex number</p>
<p>Your equation for the electron field is something involving phi and derivatives of phi.   Something like</p>
<p>your equation = |phi|^2 + |grad phi|^2</p>
<p>(if this equation is confusing, don't worry about it.  I just wanted to throw it out there).  Now you notice that if you multiply phi(x,y,z,t) by a constant phase everywhere in space and time</p>
<p>phi(x,y,z,t) --&gt; phi(x,y,z,t)<em>exp(i</em>C)</p>
<p>your equations stay the same.  This is known as a global symmetry.  However, if you let that phase vary with position and time,</p>
<p>phi(x,y,z,t) --&gt; phi(x,y,z,t)<em>exp(i</em>C(x,y,z,t))</p>
<p>your equations won't look the same anymore because you'll have extra terms from taking derivatives of C.  If the equations looked the same for C(x,y,z,t), it would be called a &quot;local symmetry.&quot;
Here's the key point: in gauge theory, we INSIST (for no good reason!) that the local symmetry MUST hold.  In order to MAKE it hold, we introduce a new field which sucks up all the extra terms and makes our equations look the same as they did before the phase factor was introduced.  This extra field is a force field, by definition.  So a cute and kind of grandiose way to say it is &quot;the symmetry of the electron field necessitates the existence of the electromagnetic force (light).&quot;  The form of the electron equations and the symmetries therein determine everything about the electromagnetic force equations.</p>
<p>In a more complicated theory like the strong nuclear force, you start with a matter field, the &quot;quark field,&quot; which has a much more complicated global symmetry built into the equations.  Then, when you insist that the symmetry hold locally, you get a force field with a much different character from the E&amp;M field -- in this case, you get the gluon field of the strong nuclear force.  The different character of the force arises from the different character of the symmetry of the matter.  (Aside: The reason quarks of three colors is related to the global symmetry of the quark field.)</p>
<p>So that's what force fields are and where they come from, but now what about all that 1/r potential stuff from classical physics that we're familiar with.  As I said, once you have the quantum field theory for a force, you can extract the classical potential.  It turns out that the form of the classical potential has a lot to do with whether the force field has a mass.  It turns out that one can show that any force field which is massless will lead to a 1/r potential.  Photons (electromagnetic force), gravitons (gravity), and gluons (strong nuclear force) are all massless and so all lead to 1/r potentials.  The strong nuclear force has a peculiar feature that the next correction to the classical potential is linear, i.e.</p>
<p>V_strongnuclear = a/r + br + ...</p>
<p>So if you try to pull two quarks far apart, the 2nd term eventually kicks in and the force starts to get STRONGER rather than weaker (1/r falloff).  This leads to quark confinement (trapping quarks inside of protons/neutrons/etc) as mentioned below.  Caveat: unlike the e&amp;m and gravitational potentials, which work well at long distance, the strong nuclear potential above works well only at short distance (~radius of proton).</p>
<p>The weak nuclear force field has a rather large mass, and this leads to a different classical potential known as the Yukawa potential</p>
<p>V_weaknuclear = a<em>exp(-m</em>r)/r</p>
<p>This type of classical force has a much SHORTER range than 1/r potentials because of the exponential fall off due to the nonzero mass.  Here's a sort of ELI5 explanation of how the weak force / yukawa potential different from E&amp;M.  Particle A wants to communicate with particle B via some force.  He happens to have a friend, E&amp;M, who is an Olympic runner.  Because he's so &quot;light&quot; on his feet (get it?) he can deliver the message very far.  The force has a long range because the force carrier has a small mass (zero mass, really, for light).  In a different scenario, particle C wants to send a message to particle D, but particle C hasn't chosen his friends carefully in life and can only get his friend the weak force to deliver the message.  The weak force is a heavy guy who doesn't work out much, so he's not willing to carry the message more than a few blocks.  The force has a short range because the force carrier has a large mass.  </p>
<p>Some fun caveats about the weak force.  Matter particles actually have two &quot;pieces&quot; -- a left handed and a right handed piece (not the same as antiparticles).  The weak force actually only talks to the left handed part of the particle, but the right handed part doesn't know anything about the weak force.  This is a big part of the reason why it is interesting that neutrinos have mass.  Massless matter particles only have a left handed piece and no right handed piece, so -- since neutrino's only interact via the weak force (and gravity) it's impossible to learn anything about the right handed piece directly.  So originally we assumed they were massless and that the right handed piece didn't exist at all.  But now we know it's there, and it's a big mystery. We can't probe it directly because the weak force doesn't talk to that part of the particle.  We can only learn about it indirectly.
Another interesting caveat is that the weak force actually has three different aspects to it.  If you want to think about it in terms of particles, there is not one particle that mediates the weak force, but three.  The neat thing is that two of them have an electric charge (one is postive and one is negative, the W+ and W- bosons respectively).  Its interesting because a particle, through interacting with the weak force, can change into a different type of particle with different charge.  This is how beta decay works: roughtly speaking, a neutron interacts with the W field and is able to change charge from neutral to positive and become a proton!</p>
<p>An interesting note: even though it is not a &quot;fundamental&quot; theory, the interaction of neutrons and protons via the strong nuclear force can be modeled by an approximate force field called the pi-meson field (this is called Yukawa theory).  The pi-field has a mass and so the classical potential looks just like the weak nuclear force potential above.  This was one of the early models for the strong nuclear force before quarks were discovered.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So here's the deal: the weak and strong force are understood perfectly well, on a par with electromagnetism.  The xkcd is not reflecting the state of our knowledge, but rather the difficulty in explaining detailed scientific concepts in non-technical language.</p>
<p>One should realize that the descriptions of gravity and electromagnetism given in the xkcd are nowhere near the full picture of those forces; they are the little pieces of those forces that are easy to describe in simple algebraic terms.  But neither force is completely explained by those two inverse square laws.  At the classical (non-quantum) level, for gravity, we need the contributions of general relativity, and for electromagnetism, we need such things as magnetism and electromagnetic induction, things covered in any intro course.</p>
<p>In addition, because the weak and strong forces are short range, you can't really talk about them effectively, in terms of their behavior in the world, without quantum field theory, whereas electromagnetism and gravity have useful classical limits.  But explaining quantum electrodynamics is way more complicated than the inverse square law or the inverse square law plus magnetism and all that, and probably no easier than explaining the weak and strong forces; try to explain gravity at the quantum level, and we don't even have a technical answer, much less a non-technical explanation.</p>
<p>I know this doesn't answer your question directly, but I think the context is important.</p>
