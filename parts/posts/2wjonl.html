For goodness sake, I majored in Physics and got a masters in a related field, and I still couldn't give a better explanation than the one in that comic. (Except that I could explain Maxwell's equations.)</p>
<p>Can anyone here in /r/askcience do a better job? Can you give a simple explanation of the 4 fundamental forces that does NOT just gloss over the strong and weak forces?</p>
<p>(A reference to a good explanation, rather than explaining it here on reddit, is a perfectly acceptable answer.)</p></div></div>
