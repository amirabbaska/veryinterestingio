		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes they didn't. However for the most part it involved big flags and designs on the shields. Some armies were equipped totally different but others where similarly equipped there were special people called heralds who could tell whose design on a flag or shield were who and which side they were supposed to be on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) Even though there were no &quot;standard&quot; uniforms, armies would often have their soldiers marked with a specific symbol on their clothing, like a big cross or X or something.  You can see an example <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Schilling_murten_bern.jpg" target="_blank">in this old painting</a>.</p>
<p>2) Battles didn't descend into disorderly chaos very frequently.  Armies survive on discipline and cohesion, more than any other factor.  So for the most part, you would stick in a tight group with the rest of your unit, and it would be pretty obvious who was in your unit and who wasn't.</p>
<p>3) Simply yelling.  If a unit got separated, an officer might try to re-group it by yelling for his men to get back into formation.  The average soldier would also be yelling a battle cry, partly to induce fear in the enemy and partly as a unit identifier.  Language and accent would help identify who was who.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A couple of things could make this easier. If you for example are fighting a different cultural group they likely look different enough to distinguish at a glance, even though movies these days are generally going to be pulling extras from the same general ethnic group.</p>
<p>Another aspect is that soldiers are going into battle with their own unit. If you live with a group of people 24/7 you are going to start to be able to recognize them fairly easily, so when in battle you aren't going to suddenly forget who they are. At that point it is just up to the unit commanders not marching their troops on a different unit from the same army, which can be achieved simply by carrying a standard with the right colors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Battles used to be quite smaller in medieval times. Smaller units like viking raiders were small enough that everyone knew the face of everyone else on their side. These are people who travel together and live in the same camp together so they would be able to recognize each other, even if they did not remember everyones name. Just remember back to when you went to school with 3-400 other kids and would still be able to recognize people from your school if for example two schools were at the same sports event. This is the scale of most battles. Bigger battles were fought between mostly between different empires. So you would be able to tell people apart based on their gear. A polish knight would have a different style of armor then a french knight.</p>
<p>There were times throughout history when you would be able to gather enough men from similar regions to have a big battle. But this does require a lot of organization as you need to convince people though money or politics to take part in your war. It is easy to get people to the battlefield when the mongols or the crusades comes and invade your country, however it is much harder to summon people to the battlefield when the neighboring town stole your bucket. When you have an organized wealthy society that can manage such armies you would be able to equip your soldiers with some sort of uniform. Not all soldiers in an army would get the same uniform as they were often belonging to different mercenaries or independent lords. However remembering a few banners is much easier then a few thousand faces. The people under each banner were also kept away from each other for the most part.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of stories of friendly fires in medieval battles. Soldiers had a hard time recognizing allies in big battles and sometimes mistook their uniforms or banners. One such famous example happened in one of the battles in the war of the roses when a cavalry flanking charge were successful at driving an enemy to panic into opposing infantry forces. But this maneuver send the cavalry charging head on into friendly forces who did not recognize their banners. It was also not that uncommon for soldiers to stop and see if someone they did not know were a friend or foe would attack or not, sometimes even asking them directly. The movie Braveheart uses this as an element a few times and demonstrates how such confusion can happen in the heat of battle and how it can be resolved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Of course there are mistakes made. The Austrians once killed thousands of their own men mistaking them for Ottoman regiments and a battle between the two sides ensued. This was a minority though, as most armies evolved banners, uniforms, and other communication methods to reduce friendly fire. But there were occasional mistakes, especislly at night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
