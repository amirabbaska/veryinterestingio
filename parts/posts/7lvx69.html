		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no &quot;fixed, universal reference frame&quot;; it doesn't exist. But anyway, if your worldline only ever intersects events in the absolute future, you are by definition not moving FTL. Your worldline is timelike, which implies that your speed in any inertial frame is less than c. If your worldline is spacelike (impossible), then you can reach events outside of your absolute future, which means that you can move backwards in time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We already sort of have this in our universe, it’s just not faster than light. There’s no arbitrary limit to how fast you can get somewhere from your reference frame. If you accelerated at 50G for 2.1 years then decelerated at 50G for 2.1 years your trip to Alpha Centauri takes about 76 days from your perspective, but 4.23 years pass for Earth and Alpha Centauri while you make your transit of 4.2 light years. Nothing travels faster than light in this case, it’s just the way speeding up works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This would be correct. In particular, the whole reason you can send something backwards in time using a faster-than-light signal is because you can change reference frames - in particular, by relativity of simultaneity, two events separated by a space-like interval (that is, an interval which can only be traversed by an object moving with a speed faster than the speed of light) can be temporally reversed by boosting to another reference frame in suitable motion (namely it should be moving from the earlier event to the later one at suitably fast speed.). That is, two such reference frames will show two types of temporal ordering. If a faster-than-light signal is then invoked <em>between these two reference frames</em>, it is possible to arrange such signals to end up in the <em>own past</em> (that is, the past light cone) of one of the respective observers that define the two frames, which is where the causality problems appeal (&quot;grandfather paradox&quot; and other such paradoxes.).</p>
<p>If it were thus the case that there were some &quot;preferred&quot; frame <em>and</em> furthermore that any FTL signals had to go from past to future in this frame, then you are right, the scheme would be foiled, because while you could boost to a frame where the events' temporal ordering was inverted, the FTL signals you send will always travel with respect to the preferred frame, not your frame, and thus they will not see such inversion because that frame defines a fixed ordering. However it's also possible to imagine scenarios with a preferred frame where the &quot;coupling&quot; of signals to the frame nonetheless does allow for the situation to be maintained if, e.g. the frame-dependent physical property is something not connected with causality.</p>
<p>So yes it's coherent, and it would solve the problem. The difficulty is, of course, that we have seen no indication that any such preferred frames exist - all physical phenomena we have seen so far uphold <em>Lorentz invariance</em>, which basically says that they look the same in all reference frames, that is, Einstein's first postulate, which is the rule you have to violate to have the situation you're talking about happen because you want the FTL phenomena to look different in different reference frames (namely that they give a chronological ordering that may contradict that in a non-preferred frame.). There are some !speculative! theories about possible violations of Lorentz invariance in situations involving things like quantum gravity, but there has been zero empirical evidence any such thing exists, much less that there are also usable FTL processes implicated thereby. On the other hand, if such a preferred frame does exist, it may be that it would only show up when such FTL processes are involved so us not seeing any Lorentz violating processes does not rule it out, which then takes us back to the simple fact we have seen no FTL processes, which means that our universe <em>seems</em> to, as far as we can tell, be built to take the &quot;easy&quot;, albeit disappointing for some, way out of the causality conundrum: just not use the FTL sector at all. But that doesn't mean it couldn't have been built differently, it just doesn't seem to be that's the actual case for our universe. Nonetheless it's important to always speculate about these things and keep one's mind open as to what might break our existing theories because that's where new discoveries are made. That one prediction that our theories miss, could be the one that blows it all open. Even if it's not FTL, it could be something else just as profound.</p>
<p>And even with that aside, it is important from a purely pedagogical point of view, to properly understand the precise relationship between FTL, relativity, and causality and <em>why</em> it's &quot;pick two, but not three&quot;. In particular this situation as outlined in the OP corresponds to the option &quot;keep FTL and causality but give up relativity&quot; (<em>at least under some circumstances</em> - something that is often ignored and given as a reason to dismiss it: namely that somehow were this possible it would mean that <em>nothing</em> would behave relativistically and thus it is <em>trivially</em> untrue, which is not at all a logical conclusion to draw).</p>
<p>(The other situations are keep relativity and causality and give up FTL - which is what our real universe looks to be - and then keep relativity and FTL, but give up causality. That last case here is the &quot;Dr. Who&quot; scenario, with both space and time travel allowed and essentially any FTL spaceship is also a TARDIS. The problems with this scenario are that it requires a mechanism to avoid falling into logical inconsistencies like the grandfather paradox and - more importantly - empirical evidence: we have seen no messages or time travelers from the future, at least outside of &quot;paranormal&quot; anecdotes and the like which are impossible to verify or otherwise test scientifically and thus have no evidentiary value.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Could you have an FTL-&quot;</p>
<p>Pretty much at that point, you can throw all logic out the window. FTL travel is not scientific and therefore anything can happen. Unless you are within a sci-fi universe with fixed Laws, there is little point tackling the ethereal FTL. </p>
<p>&quot;Universal reference frame.&quot;</p>
<p>Again, not possible. Einstien and many experiments prove that there is no privileged or special frame of reference. Everything is relative to another frame of reference. Your car is relative to the Earth. Earth it moving relative to the sun. The sun is moving relative to all the stars around and the galactic core. All of these are correct, but they will give wildly different results of how fast that bouncey ball you have in your car is going. </p>
<p>Whose frame of reference is correct? According to Einstein, yes.</p>
<p>Same could be said for an event, because the speed of light is a slight misnomer. It is the speed of information. So, if you head out from a star at FTL and the star exploded, just after you left, you would never have any inclinations that it happened. If you jump out 1 ly instantly, all your instrament will show the star is there, gravity still pulling on nieghbors. If you accelerate away from Earth at near-but-not-quite light speed, you can look back and see your kids, grandkids, and great grandkids grow up and die while you have dinner. </p>
<p>Whose passage of time is real? According to Einstein, yes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
