		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, cosmic particles pass through the LHC all the time. They're not accelerated around the loop, since the configuration of the magnets has been finetuned specifically for the path taken by the particles inserted into the LHC by the experiment itself. Cosmic particles come in from a completely different direction and while they can be affected by the magnetic fields in the ring, this will only change their direction, it won't &quot;catch&quot; them into a circular path.</p>
<p>Cosmic particles may also interact with one of the detectors placed along the LHC ring. When this happens and the detector is turned on, the particle is registered very much in the same way that particles are registered during normal operation. </p>
<p>But there are important differences. Only part of the cosmic particles actually make it 100m into the ground to reach the detector. Part of the particle types are absorbed by the Earth before they can reach far enough into the ground. The next difference is due to the design of the detectors. They're designed to envelop the LHC beam and the most sensitive equipment is located very close to the beam. But cosmic particles come in from above and have to cross through the outer layers of the detector first.</p>
<p>So the impact of a cosmic particle on an active detector is quite different from a normal detection event. However, cosmic particles (or &quot;cosmics&quot; in short) have been very useful in helping scientists to benchmark and finetune the detector before normal operation.</p>
<p>Read more about this in the newspost from the CMS experiment (one of the large LHC detectors) from 2 years ago (when the LHC was on an extended break from normal operations):
