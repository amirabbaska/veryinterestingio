There are exemples on youtube of very dense and compacted wood, and some flamethrowers in front of it. Wood doesnt burn, even with long exposure (it is just turns black). Cut this wood, take the fine particle, bring a lighter and it will burn easily.</p>
<p>Edit: looks like i'm misleading / wrong. I will not delete, for next people to understand others comments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a particle of material becomes small enough the ignition temperature of the material decreases. This combined with the better access to oxygen like others have mentioned makes it easy for fine dust in the air to ignite into a fire ball. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Serious answer, fire has what is known as the fire triangle, if any corner of the triangle is lacking, the fire will go out (or never start)  The corners are heat, oxygen, and fuel.</p>
<p>So, you have a nice chunk of steel, but it just refuses to burn, why not? You know that iron will react with oxygen to make rust, so it should burn, but it just never seems to- the problem is heat.  A block of steel will wick heat away from where you are applying it, so it never gets hot enough to sustain its own burning.  When you get it hot enough to react with oxygen, it's still a slow process, and the heat is getting pulled in to the center of the block, starving the fire.</p>
<p>Another factor is that steel doesn't vaporize when it burns, it turns to rust.  If you have ever watched any videos of metal working and seen pieces of dark material falling away, that's actually steel that has oxidized (called scale) due to the heat and exposure to oxygen- but it also seals the steel inside away from more oxygen reaching it to react.</p>
<p>When you powder steel(or even just shred it in to steel wool), there is no longer a mass of steel to suck all the heat out of the reaction, and the oxidized steel can't get in the way of the oxygen getting in contact with the unburned steel.</p>
<p>TL;DR: if something doesn't burn, but does when powdered, something about its material properties normally blocks one or more of the legs of the fire triangle</p>
<p>As a side note, there is a method of cutting steel that works by getting it really hot and blowing oxygen at it so that it burns up- powdering isn't the only way to force something that is normally non-flammable to burn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
