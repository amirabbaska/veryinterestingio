		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The expansion of the universe is easiest to understand at cosmic scales. In that case you can take all the matter and energy and treat it like a homogeneous sheet with some average densities. You then use Einstein's field equations to see how much this tarp will stretch, i.e. expand. </p>
<p>However, locally the story is different. On smaller scales gravitational attraction can dominate, preventing objects from expanding away from each other. For example, that is the story in our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group" target="_blank">Local Group</a> that includes the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxies. In fact, in our cosmic neighborhood, the gravitational attraction is strong enough that eventually these two galaxies will collide. Of course, it will take another 4 billion years for this drawn out merger to kick in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you and a friend are standing on a floor that is slowly expanding so that each second, each foot of floor becomes 1.1 feet.</p>
<p>If you are standing 10 feet apart, a second later each foot between you will become 1.1 and you'll be 11 feet apart.  You separated at a rate of 1 foot per second.</p>
<p>But if you were 100 feet apart, each of those became 1.1 foot and you would be 110 feet apart after 1 second.  So by being 100 feet apart, you separated at a rate of 10 feet per second.  And if you were 1000 feet apart at the start, you'd be separating at 100 feet per second and so on.</p>
<p>So as you can see, if you're close together there is little growth between you and you could easily walk up to each other.  But if you were far apart, even running top speed you couldn't get to your friend, they would just be getting farther and farther apart.</p>
<p>This is an analogy to the expansion of the universe.  Things that are close enough together can be pulled together because the expansion between them isn't fast enough to overcome gravity.  As things get farther apart though, the expansion between them increases while the gravity between them decreases.  So expansion doesn't pull apart solar systems, galaxies, or even galaxy clusters.  But on larger scales expansion wins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can still go down an escalator the wrong way.  You're just slowed up a bit.</p>
<p>The expansion of the universe is tricky, because it seems to be expanding at all points.  So the further apart two objects are, the faster they're pushed apart.</p>
<p>Two objects are floating 1000 meters apart.  Let's divide that into 1000 1-meter squares.  Every 1000 second, each square expands and duplicates itself, and pushes the space apart.  After 1000 second, there will now be 2000 1-meter blocks between them.  So the objects are expanding apart at 1000 meters per 1000 seconds, or 1m/s.  Now at 2000 meters apart, there are 2000 blocks duplicating themselves.  So after 1000 more seconds, there will be 4000 blocks in between.  So the two objects are expanding apart at 2 m/s.</p>
<p>If the two objects started only 10 meters apart, then they'd be 20 meters apart after 1000 seconds, or be flying apart at .01m/s.</p>
<p>So the further apart two points in space are, the faster they're moving away from each other (due the expansion of space).</p>
<p>However, if two objects are moving towards each other at a speed greater than the space between them is expanding, they'll still close the gap.</p>
<p>This gives rise to an interesting phenomenon, where two objects separated by a lot of space will expand apart at a rate faster than the speed of light.  As a result, information between those two objects can never be received - no object or force will ever interact between them.  This can be said to be 'the edge of the observable universe' not because space ends at that point, but because we can never and will never see anything beyond that point.  It's basically an inverted black-hole.  It's an expansion, rather than an attraction, powerful enough that light cannot escape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply: They move faster towards each other than the universe expands.</p>
<p>Imagine the universe is a rubber band, and our galaxies are ants on said rubber band. So long as the rubber band stretches the distance between the ants slower than they can walk towards each other, they <em>can</em> still meet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Picture a loaf of raisin bread baking in an oven. As the bread expands, the raisins get farther apart from each other. </p>
<p>The ones that started 10cm are now 20cm apart, the ones 1cm apart are only 2cm apart. </p>
<p>So if each raisin is a galaxy, our raisins are still close to each other. Gravity, at such &quot;small&quot; distances, wins. </p>
<p>Everything exerts gravitational force on everything, but distance is a factor. Since we're &quot;close&quot; to such a massive object, gravity wins. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
