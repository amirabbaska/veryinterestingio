		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ellipsometry can do it! Throw in some polarised light, look at the reflection and see how the polarisation has changed - gold is slightly birefringent (it changes the polarisation of the light on transmission), and so by looking at the net change of polarisation you can work out the thickness! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Previously I have used a micrometer screw gauge and a bench mounted laser measurement device (For some reason the proper name for the device escapes me at the moment)</p>
<p>This is only good down to about 0.001mm though, if you want to go thinner than that you will need a different method.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That depends on how thick it is. But one way to precisely measure the thickness of a thin foil is to shoot radiation (for example alpha particles) through it. If you know the initial energy of the alpha particle, and you measure the final energy of it, after it's traveled through the foil, then you know how much energy it lost in the foil. We have a very good understanding of how heavy charged particles lose energy in matter, so using that we can calculate the thickness of the foil.</p>
<p>This is often done to measure target thicknesses for nuclear physics experiments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Idk about all these fancy methods everybody else is suggesting, but the way I would do it is to get a bunch of foil sheets together, measure the thickness, length, and width of the stack, then weigh it. Then compare it to the density of gold. Use the difference between your stack and gold to calculate the empty air between your gold sheets, and use that to determine the average thickness of the foil. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would have thought that simply measuring the volume of the foil using some kind of volume displacement measurement method and then dividing that volume by the area of the foil would give you the average thickness of the foil. </p>
<p>I am not sure the reason for the measurement but this would provide you with simple and quick measurements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
