They are inoculated then. Later other bacteria can be introduced when the baby ingests them as food or by putting things in their mouths.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of the bacteria (and archea!) get there through vaginal birth and breast feeding, but you also aquire more throughout your life. Research has shown that the endobacteria of humans varies a little by geography but more so by diet. As in, we contain the microbes we feed best. Some gut flora can get pretty messed up in individuals such as those contracting &quot;C. Dif&quot; (Clostridium difficilis) and in those cases sometimes a fecal transplant is prescribed! You literally get someone elses shit to help reregulate your micro flora! :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They come in with the whole foods you eat. When you move to a new part of the earth it takes a while for your flora to adapt, but it helps to eat local whole foods. </p>
<p>After a penicillin cure you should also reintroduce your flora, for instance by adding probiotics to your diet or eating local whole foods.</p>
<p>Some food allergies can be overcome by not eating those foods for 3 to 5 months and then slowly reintroducing them again with baby steps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
