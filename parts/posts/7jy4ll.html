Doesn't make the ant do things, more it changes the way the ant behaves.</p>
<p>EG. not make the ant climb, but make it really like the feel of sunlight so it goes and seeks that high place clear of shade.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something worth pointing out: The parasite isn't intentionally manipulating anything. Essentially it is just performing its normal function of consuming resources and trying to spread, and it happens to be that these processes also happen to affect the host's behavior in a way that is helpful to furthering its lifecycle. There was likely another very close relative to the parasite that would cause the ant to just start convulsing in place or whatever, but that didn't provide any advantage so it just died out. Rabies in dogs is another example. Rabies makes its host confused and scared and in a lot of pain, and so it is more likely to bite or attack things next to it. It also just happens that rabies is spread pretty efficiently via biting. Some version of rabies that made a host shy away from others and die alone somewhere didn't spread very well, so it probably didn't compete very well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coincidentally, I'm reading a book about parasites right now. The author mentions that scientists have proved that some parasites &quot;hack&quot; brain areas that produce the chemicals that cause the desired effect. For instance, some mice parasites force the mouse brain to produce dopamine, which in turn makes the mouse less fearful of cats and more prone to be killed by them. The parasite (in this case I think it was toxoplasmosis) needs a cat host to complete its life cycle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It manipulates the emotions and motivation centers of the host. It does this by releasing proteins which activate certain classes of neurons and inhibiting other classes on neurons. For the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nematomorpha#/Description_and_biology" target="_blank">horse-hair worm</a> it totally inhibits the &quot;OK we have enough water&quot; response. That way the grasshopper goes to the stream, drinks a ton, and the parasite releases itself into the water to begin the infection cycle anew. The rabies virus has the opposite effect, it inhibits the &quot;Oh boy are we ever thirsty&quot; response by infecting the neurons that sense thirst.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Im no expert and not sure if it's the same thing as what you're asking but I read that fungus that forces the ant to go to a high place, gestation, then explodes actually takes control of the muscles. Meaning the ant would be conscious the entire time with no control of its body. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
