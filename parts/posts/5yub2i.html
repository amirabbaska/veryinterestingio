		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two major reasons:</p>
<p>It gives them an opportunity to weed out applicants for a variety of reasons, both said and unsaid, while citing a polygraph failure as the official reason. When you've got 200 people applying for 3 openings, you want a quick way to whittle that down. Offering a subjective test that's masquerading as an objective test is a really convenient way to do that.</p>
<p>Second reason, and possibly the more important one; not everyone knows it's bullshit. The purpose of a polygraph isn't to detect lies. That isn't possible. It's to get you to admit to things you otherwise would not have, even if it's just admitting that you left something out of your pre-polygraph questionnaire. When a polygraph is administered, the first step is to give you a very long form with a series of yes or no questions. These questions ask all sorts of things like have you ever committed a crime against a person, have you ever stolen property, have you ever committed a traffic offense, have you ever used or sold drugs, etc. If you mark yes to any of these questions, there is usually a blank where you are required to fill out an explanation. Sometime later you are given the actual polygraph test. The examiner has a copy of your questionnaire in front of him. First he will ask you a bunch of preliminary questions that they say are calibrating the equipment. A common one is that they will write the numbers 1 through 5 on a piece of paper and then circle one of them. They will tell you to answer &quot;no&quot; to all five of the following questions and then ask you &quot;is the number one circled, is number two circled, and so on&quot;. </p>
<p>Then they will ask you roughly 10 to 20 questions about your actual past, all of these questions are yes or no. They will ask each question probably 3 or 4 times so while you might get asked fifty to a hundred questions, you might only get asked about 15 unique questions. They just repeat the same ones over and over in different orders, ostensibly measuring your body responses to those questions.</p>
<p>While they are are more than willing to use your answers to those questions as a reason to reject you, the real purpose of the test comes after that. This is called the &quot;post examination interview&quot;. They will make a big show about turning off the equipment, unhooking all the sensors and gear, probably talking to you a little bit about what you had for lunch or what football team you like, all to get you to relax. They will tell you that the test is over and that you are no longer being monitored. Here comes the important part. They then finish by asking you if there's anything you might have left out or any answers you might have wanted to clarify, anything that you may have forgotten to put on your pre-interview questionnaire, etc. They will tell you that it's far better for you to admit to things now since the test results haven't been submitted yet, that you don't want to be found out to be lying later, that it will look good if you would admit to things and that it will show that you're willing to work with them and that you want to be honest if you tell them the whole story about something that you may have not been clear on before or that you may have left out before. If you require a little prodding, the examiner will say something like &quot;I've got some indicators of deception on questions 3 and 7 regarding your possible past drug use. Are you sure there isn't anything you're not telling me?&quot; It's a lie, there are no indicators of deception. There is no such thing as an indicator of deception. It's a trick to get you to say something you would not have told them otherwise.</p>
<p>This is where they get you. The combination of feeling relaxed after the stressful examination, and the desire to appear honest and forthcoming gets a massive amount of people to admit to all sorts of things that they otherwise would not have. &quot;Oh yeah there was that one time in high school where I guess I sold a couple bags of weed to some of my brother's friends, but I didn't think it was a big deal and it's not like I'm a drug dealer or anything&quot;. &quot;I wasn't sure if I should put it on the form that I filled out because I didn't get charged or anything, but there was that time seven years ago where I did get arrested for domestic violence, but like I said I didn't get charged and nothing came of it so it's not like I actually committed a crime. I didn't think it was a big deal&quot;. </p>
<p>Thank you for your honesty. Rejected.</p>
<p>The true purpose of the polygraph is to get you to admit to things and basically disqualify yourself. Even if the things you're admitting to by themselves would not have been that big of a deal, the fact that you didn't include them in your questionnaire or you may have given one answer to a background detective previously but gave a different kind of answer to the polygraph examiner, etc. <em>They're trying to weed out applicants</em>. It's far easier to have you do it to yourself than it is to pay a background detective to research you, or possibly risk some kind of &quot;they didn't hire me because I'm black&quot; lawsuit. If they can show you said A on the form and B to the examiner, you're rejected for lying, it doesn't matter what the smoke and mirrors in the &quot;lie detector&quot; say.</p>
<p>EDIT: a number of people are responding with comments along the lines of &quot;this isn't true, the polygraph really does measure things&quot;. Yes, it does. Namely heart rate, blood pressure, and skin conductivity(perspiration). The hand-waving comes from where they use this data to imply that you're lying about something. There is no actual evidence those data points have anything to do with lying. A question about whether you've ever had sexual contact with a minor may elicit a response because you did, because you were the <em>victim</em> of child abuse, or because the question is just shocking. The data can't tell them which it is, or if you just happen to have a stomach ache. The data they collect does not detect lies. It detects stress (and more to the point, <em>possible</em> symptoms of <em>possible</em> stress). The underlying theory is that one who is lying is experiencing more stress during the lie than they are when they tell the truth, and that has never been proven to be true.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because many government agencies really, really want to believe they work, have polygraph operators on staff who swear up and down they work, and have created a culture where they ignore the science.  Or more cynically, they don't really care whether or not they work, they just want another tool they can use to punish people they &quot;know&quot; are guilty.</p>
<p>They only positive value is a lot of people still believe they work, and if they have something to hide, it might discourage them from seeking sensitive jobs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I think maybe the answers are similar? Like a cultural lie that we keep telling ourselves so it keeps being believed by many to have value even though we pretty easily prove otherwise.</p>
<p>Both are tools... just not with the purpose we say they have. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

His 20-year-old critique remains valid today. He wasn't explaining to 5-year-olds, but to U.S. senators who were not subject matter experts. See links to his testimony transcript and video below:</p>
