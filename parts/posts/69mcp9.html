I had to explain to her that &quot;alkaline&quot; (alkali) is not a &quot;thing,&quot; and all it'll do is react with her stomach acid and maybe cause some intense heat in her stomach.  Plus, if it all reacts with my stomach acid there will nothing left make it's way into my brain. </p>
<p>Am I correct? Can someone smarter than me tell me what would actually happen, so I can tell my my well-meaning, homeopathic uncle in simple terms why this is incorrect?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've had people try to sell me a 3k water filter machine that makes the water alkaline.  When I asked them what happens to the alkalinity of the water when it interacts with the acid in the stomach, their answer was &quot;Cancer cells do not thrive in an alkaline environment&quot;.   I told them I as aware of that...but how does the higher pH water directly interact with the cancer cells?  I would get pretty much the same answer. Eventually they just tried to sign me up to sells the damn machines. </p>
<p>It probably has been mentioned...but the alkaline water people are likely anti vaccine/big pharma/ contrail believing crowd...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your kidneys buffer the PH level of your blood. </p>
<p>Your stomach is acidic. Drinking slightly alkaline water will do nothing to blunt the acidity of your stomach, or what gets sent into the intestines. </p>
<p>Even IF magic water could make your blood alkaline, your kidneys would fix that in minutes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems like your primary concern is actually making sure your Grama isn't taken in by your uncle's snake oil treatments. From your other replies you are a fairly well educated and more than capable of addressing your Uncle.</p>
<p>You should probably address your Grama directly to find out what her health concerns are since she wants to try the magic water for generic bad stuff. That way you can point her in the direction of some proven remedies. You can probably even use the same excuses your uncle was using but with actual scientific background. E.g. a healthy diet to regulate the body's internal environment. </p>
<p>I am not sure what your health condition is but good luck with your treatment. It sounds like you have a supportive if slightly misguided family I hope they can be there for you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're body keeps it's pH levels very tight (7.35-7.45) as anything outside this range could damage the body. We have 3 main ways to regulate this: a buffer system using bicarbonate, our respiratory system (think co2) and our kidneys. Regardless of what the pH is of what you're drinking your body is going to react accordingly to keep the pH in the previously mentioned range. I think in stressful times such as yours people will try and find anything that may be helpful. Best of luck. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
