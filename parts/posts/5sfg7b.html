		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason why it is so stable is because the Si-O bond has a very high bond energy (glass is mainly silicon dioxide), around 600 KJ/Mol. This means it takes a large amount of energy for something to react with glass by breaking this bond. This is also why diatomic nitrogen is used as an inert gas, because the N-N (triple bond) has such a high bond energy (~900KJ/Mol).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lab glass is (from Wikipedia)Borosilicate glass. Borosilicate glass is a type of glass with silica and boron trioxide as the main glass-forming constituents. Borosilicate glasses are known for having very low coefficients of thermal expansion (~3 × 10−6 K−1 at 20 °C), making them resistant to thermal shock, more so than any other common glass. Such glass is less subject to thermal stress and is commonly used for the construction of reagent bottles. </p>
<p>Pyrex used to sell borosilicate glass in the consumer arena, but to dissuade (fatally injure?) home &quot;chemists&quot;, it's now just regular glass, that you can get to shatter if you subject it to thermal shock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The silicon-oxygen bond is incredibly stable so it won't react with other things very well.  It is also a solid and therefore not in solution.  Glass will dissolve in extremely strong base like a base bath.  HF will also react with glass, the silicon-fluorine bond is even stronger than Si-O.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As plastic has become pretty good alternative for a lot of materials nowadays, it has replaced some of the laboratory equipment. Overall, theres not much to it actually.

-it's non-reactive, so you can mix just about anything in it.
-it's relatively durable, considering how thin it is.
-it's completely smooth, so it's easy to clean and less susceptible to contamination.
-and, most importantly, it's cheap!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
