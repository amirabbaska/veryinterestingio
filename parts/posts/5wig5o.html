		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is something that is still debated. First, some people insist they only need 5 or 6 hours of sleep a night and then survive off sugar and coffee to stay awake. Very few people can actually do this healthily, but some can. Scientists have linked a gene to most of the people who survive on extremely little sleep, but it's still unsure what exactly does. But ignoring extremes, its probably mostly a matter of efficiency. </p>
<p>For example. Given the exact same lifestyle otherwise, some people need around 2000 calories a day while another needs 2500 for the same lifestyle. So that is a matter of how efficiently their body processes calories. The same can be true of sleep. Someone whose body falls into deeper sleep more quickly and who has fewer periods of wakefulness might need less sleep than someone whose body needs a while longer to achieve the same depth of sleep. It also could be their brain just more effectively using the sleep. Some may be caused by personal sleep habits and some genetics. It would be more strange if everyone needed identical amounts of sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As is the simple answer for most questions pertaining to biology: genetics. </p>
<p>Sleep has a number of hypothesized functions, but it is clearly intended as a restorative period for the body to recover from stress, injury, and exertion. </p>
<p>Your tissues heal quicker.  There is evidence that sleep literally cleans your brains of toxins accumulated during the day: <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/10/18/236211811/brains-sweep-themselves-clean-of-toxins-during-sleep" target="_blank">http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/10/18/236211811/brains-sweep-themselves-clean-of-toxins-during-sleep</a></p>
<p>The reasons for why someone may need less sleep than someone else are myriad.  Perhaps they produce <em>less</em> toxins while awake, and thus need less sleep to recover.  Or perhaps they produce the same amount of toxins, but are simply <em>more efficient at clearing them out</em>.  </p>
<p>As it goes with genetics, there is likely no single &quot;right answer&quot;.  Two people who both only need 4 hours of sleep per night may have very different genetic reasons for only needing 4 hours of sleep. </p>
<p>One man, Dean Karnazes (<a href="http://www.storypick.com/the-man-who-can-run-forever/" target="_blank">http://www.storypick.com/the-man-who-can-run-forever/</a>) has a rare genetic mutation that essentially gives him abnormally fast healing, so fast, in fact, that he can run and his body <em>recovers faster that it breaks down while running</em>. </p>
<p>Life is full of these little quirks.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The long and short of it is mental discipline allows a sleep deprived person to perform better than a less disciplined tired person. They do not perform 'the same' as a person who got good sleep, but they can minimize the problems the lack of sleep can cause so their performance suffers less than it could have if they were not disciplined. </p>
<p>I sleep on average 4 to 5 hours a night for most of my adult life. When I was younger I would need 12-16 hours on the weekend in order to make up the sleep debt of doing that during the week. I'm in my early 40's now and I only need 8 hours of sleep on the weekends to feel refreshed with 4-6 hours typical during the week. </p>
<p>I feel as tired I think as anyone else who slept only a few hours over several days so it's not that I don't need the sleep, it's just that sometimes I can't, and by sometimes I mean most of the time. However, my ability to be productive even being so tired is a learned ability that took time to develop. So for me it has less to do with me not needing the sleep, because I do, and more to do with me being able to stay productive even dead on my feet, which is a learned skill and not a physical attribute. </p>
<p>I am a bright person in general, and I can cruise control my way through most demanding situations so this helps a lot. When I am tired I am not thinking very clearly, but because things tend to come easy for me, it helps make up for this so that I'm just average on very little sleep instead of a zombie. When I get really good sleep for a few days by comparison, I feel like life takes on a clarity I seldom see and it feels like I'm finally awake and thinking clearly. IE normal, but I'm abnormal so much, normal seems weird. </p>
<p>There are some tricks to being productive when you're tired. The first and foremost is strong mental stamina. You have to have enough self control to not drift or doze off while driving, when bored, when listening to a lecture or attending a meeting. You have to force yourself to concentrate, and catch yourself when you begin to drift and mentally slap yourself awake. This is probably the skill I have the most development in. I can sleep 4 hours a night for a week straight, yet read boring technical articles at my desk without falling asleep at work. I have different thought exercises I do to maintain focus and re-invigorate my mind. Sometimes I do allow myself a few minutes to day dream say during a break or lunch. This re-invigorates me for the next few hours. </p>
<p>Ironically the less I sleep, the harder it is for me to sleep. I am tired, but wide awake, and falling asleep is difficult. However, the better rested I am, the easier it is to rest. So if I am not careful, I tend to get worse and worse, sleeping less and less, until I reach a crisis point where my performance degrades too far and I am exhausted yet still unable to sleep. And alternatively if I'm on vacation or something, and allow myself to sleep as much as I want, I could literally sleep the day away as the more rested I become, the more drowsy and sleepy I am. </p>
<p>I work in a demanding technical field and my ability to recognize and troubleshoot problems, and to communicate and reason in clear and articulate ways is important. I enjoy a frappacino every morning, but otherwise do not drink coffee or soda. I don't use stimulants to wake up or stay alert as they would make me jittery which I don't like. I tend to be awake at all hours of the night which has lead  to some people wondering if I ever sleep since they see facebook and reddit comments from me all through the night and day. I am able to sleep soundly and stay asleep most of the time even if woken. But I have struggled to fall asleep most of my life. My ability to sleep and hold a sleep schedule is my biggest challenge in life and the one that has the greatest impact on my quality of life and happiness. It's a problem I struggle with continuously. I don't really drink other than a cider every so often, and I don't do drugs. I'm also not an energetic and hyper person. I'm laid back and kind of introverted but friendly socially. I am just this way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Practice plays a big part in this. We are programmed to sleep 8-10 hours a night.
With various stages occurring during sleep. </p>
<p>Evolutionarily, it is highly advantageous for us to be asleep, immobile all night long so that we would not be out wandering with the wolves, and other such predators which we likely will be unable to see before it's too late. Therefore, the long period of darkness allowed this to occur at a slow leisurely rate.</p>
<p>Our natural sleep habits reflect this. However, for the same reasons it is pretty inefficient, and with enough practice, you can acclimate your body to function on less sleep, through a concept known as sleep compression. How much compression can occur varies, dependant on genetics. For some, little can occur-perhaps they have a more wild genome. For a lucky few, it can be compressed down to 2 hours a night. Generally, the limit is around 6.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine for a moment that no matter how long you slept, you did not feel refreshed after sleeping. Instead you felt like you only slept about an hour. Yet, you still have to get up and go to work and do all the other things you would do.</p>
<p>This was the case for me. I had fibromyalgia and didn't know it. Basically I never get into REM sleep where recovery of the mind and body happen. So no matter how much I sleep, I never feel rested. 2 hours, or 12 hours of sleep feel exactly the same to me. So I spent 5 years only sleeping 5-6 hours a night, followed by 10 years of only sleeping 2-3 hours a night.</p>
<p>All the while I worked as an Electrician and Electrical contractor. while playing in band and coaching little league football. To say I was burning the candle at both ends really don't describe it, it was more like I threw my candle into a blast furnace.</p>
<p>In 2002 I started suffering from severe anxiety and felt my body getting weaker and weaker all the while. By mid June it was all I could do to go to work and lay down on my couch. I stopped going to the kids practices and games for sports. Stopped visiting people. Pretty much just laid on my couch and worked.</p>
<p>In November of that year after jillions of tests, I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and told my working career was over. Three years later I had a heart attack at age 44. I have high blood pressure, liver disease, diabetes, asthma, and widespread pain, every day of my life.</p>
<p>So my answer is, while some people can apparently get by with very little sleep, it can have long term consequences beyond just feeling tired at work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
