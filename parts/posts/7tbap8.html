<blockquote>
<p>Scientific testing reveals that the surface of the sword contains chromium, with a thickness of 10 to 15 micron, which acted as a protective coating against corrosion. The chrome-plating technology was invented by the Germans, Americans in 1937 and 1950, but it had emerged in China 2,200 years before. How amazing it is!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In China, museums and exhibitions often have nationalistic language, so I take them with a grain of salt. I tried finding information for myself, but I couldn't find much about it.</p>
<p>How was the chrome plating done? Is it similar to the process we have now? Is there evidence that the chrome plating of the blades was done intentionally to protect against corrosion?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting one. There are a few research articles (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1557/opl.2011.796" target="_blank">like this</a>) that I don't have full-text access to. The original paper seems to be in Chinese, too. ( in Daxue Huaxue 3(3):57â€“60) But from what I can gather we're talking about chromium oxides/chromates and dichromate compounds, not metallic chrome. Metallic chrome would indeed be sensational since as far as anyone knows that wasn't produced until Vauquelin did it in 1798, but this wasn't that. </p>
<p>So you can't call this &quot;chrome plating&quot; in any meaningful relation to how that term is used, since that refers to coating something with <em>metallic</em> chrome. It's also done electrolytically, and there's no evidence the ancient Chinese had either of those things in any form. </p>
<p>From what I've been able to glean we're also talking about <em>bronze</em> weapons here, which don't need protection from rust. Bronze tarnishes (typically forming green malachite; copper carbonate) but does not rust, and in the right conditions (e.g. not much chloride around) can keep very well. There are many well-preserved 2000-year old Roman bronzes, for instance. But how well bronze keeps depends strongly on the alloy as well. (<a href="https://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/ancientmetals2.pdf" target="_blank">more on that</a>) The first article's summary talks about tin oxide formation protecting against corrosion, which is also in the previous link. So given that you can achieve corrosion resistance with the correct treatment and alloy of the bronze, one might wonder: Why involve chromium at all?</p>
<p>So I don't know what (if anything) historic sources say, but it's not obvious they'd even have thought corrosion protection was important here. The article summary claims that weapons in all states of corrosion have been found.</p>
<p>I can only speculate on how it got there, but there are many ways, both intentional and not, with you could end up with this chrome layer.. If it was intentional and for corrosion-resistance, they could've treated the things with chromic acid for instance to achieve this. It's also possible they did a process like that, but for looks rather than for corrosion protection. Or they could've been <em>painted</em> with a pigment made from one of the many colored chromium-containing minerals, and undergone chemical reactions to their present state as well. The terracotta warriors themselves were originally painted with several different metal-oxide mineral pigments (although as far as I can tell, no chrome based ones) They exist though; Cr2O3 is used as a pigment (&quot;chrome green&quot;) and occurs in mineral form, albeit rarely. </p>
<p>Speculation aside though, it's surely not &quot;chrome plating&quot; in any meaningful sense, and the intent and purpose if intentional are at least non-obvious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Present-day chrome plating is performed by electrolysis. The item to be plated is immersed in a solution containing chromium, and electricity.  So you'd need some very specific solution, and an method to deliver an electric current, and an electrical source.  My guess is they were using &quot;chrome plating&quot; in a very loose sense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern day chrome plating isn't actual chrome plating. It's a thin layer of chrome (~.01 mil) deposited on top of nickel plating. So, saying that there's a layer of chrome with a thickness of 0.4 mil on top of bronze is pretty much bullshit. Furthermore, this type of surface treatment is more for wear resistance rather than corrosion protection.</p>
<p>The other surface treatment involving chrome (which is used for temporary corrosion protection) that could possible, is conversion coating. It's typically applied to metal lower on the galvanic series like aluminum, zinc, and cadmium. You can't apply this treatment to bronze alloys, because copper prevents the formation of this coating. (it's a pretty big problem in conversion coatings of high Cu alloys like 2024 Al) So, that possibility is ruled out as well. </p>
<p>After digging deeper, I found this interesting phrase describing the process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The discovery indicates that during the sword-smithing process, ancient Qin workmen consciously added Chromate and Dichromate to the bronze weapons, producing a light grey or dark gray sheen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/123047.htm" target="_blank">http://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/123047.htm</a></p>
<p>So, it's possible that the chromates found were literately hammered in, rather than by some plating process, or conversion coating process. Chromate comes in a powder, so it would be possible to literately hammer it in during forging.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We use electrolysis to plate things. I remember reading that I think ancient Iraq or Iran, so Persia, they actually had some kind of chemical battery back then and that could have done this possibly. I'm on mobile but that can probably be looked up easily. So there's the potential that the method could have been performed by ancient peoples.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Here it is, the Baghdad battery. One of its theorised uses is electroplating.</p>
