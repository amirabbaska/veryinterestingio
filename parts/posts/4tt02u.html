		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My wife works for USGS and calculates wild animal populations. </p>
<p>First, they map historically where the animal has been seen. Then they collect reports from the public, universities, and other government agencies that have seen the animal. Then they make a computer model of where they think the animal should be, based on environment, plant cover, etc. A simple one for butterflies I've seen her do is Butterfly X eats plant Y. Plant Y has this thermographic signature, pull up satellite data, I bet that butterfly is around areas where I think that plant is. Then you send people to look, and test your model to see how good it is.</p>
<p>If the animal is really endangered, they do a survey, go everywhere they think it is and survey. If there is too many to realistically survey they do a random sample. This is just like the polling used to predict elections. There is 1,000 acres we think it could be at, we randomly select 20 and go. Now there is a ton of spacial statistics that goes into that, but that is the basic idea. Also, they might do &quot;block&quot; polling to make sure they go to different areas, or areas they think will help them model better in the future.</p>
<p>A team of biologists goes out to the survey cites, and looks for them. Ideally you send the same people to the same place at the same time every year, so you have an good idea what is happening with the population. Due to lack of funding (sequester ruined--put a huge hole in 100's of years of scientific data collection), fires, changes in administrations, that doesn't always happen.  It is never perfect, some land is private, military, impossible to access, or too sensitive to send people into every year. But, especially with new drone technology and satellite data, they have gotten extremely accurate in their predictions in the last 10 years. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL:DR</strong> Both wild bees and honeybees face different challenges and both are critical to us, but the situation is not as dire as sensationalist media would have you assume. </p>
<p>In order to better understand the situation and the problems associated with bee extinction we need to better understand bees. Bees are a really diverse group of insects, consisting of tens of thousands of species that live in just about every ecosystem on this planet. For humans we can classify bees into two main categories - the bees we use to pollinate our crops (e.g. honeybees), and the wild bees that pollinate wildflowers, flowering trees, and other flowering plants found in nature.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>European Honeybees:</strong> The non-native species to North America that we use pollinate our crops. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_bee" target="_blank">Honeybees</a> face a number of challenges to their continued survival, including but not limited to: colony collapse disorder, inbreeding, parasites (diseases), and poor diet. One solution would be to improve management. Think of honeybees as a domesticated animal, one that we have unfortunately mismanaged (e.g. like certain dog breeds). We have the power and knowledge to improve their care and husbandry. Without these guys we wouldn't have easy cheap access to many of the fruits &amp; vegetables we know and love. But as others have pointed out we wouldn't see a <em>complete</em> collapse of our food system, plenty of food is <em>wind</em> or <em>self</em> pollinated (e.g. wheat, rice). Because honeybees don't come from North America their hives often outcompete native wild bees, and therefore are considered invasive in certain areas. These guys are true colonial nesters, with a hive consisting of one queen and thousands of female worker bees. </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Wild bees:</strong> These native species come in all shapes and sizes. Some are solitary and some are semi-colonial nesters, thus their &quot;hives&quot; consist of a female queen and maybe a dozen or so female workers (if any). Wild bees are critical to maintaining a functioning ecosystem and are responsible for pollinating the <em>vast majority</em> of the flowering plants we see in nature. They face a number of challenges including: habitat loss &amp; degradation, loss of flower forage diversity, loss of nesting sites, climate change, pesticides-herbicides, and over competition by invasive honeybees. Examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee" target="_blank">bumblebees</a>, alfalfa bees, mason bees, orchard bees, &amp; solitary bees. Bumblebees are generally less aggressive and don't sting. Some wild bees lack stingers altogether (e.g. many of the solitary bees). Some bumble bees are parasitic and simply live to attack other bees or insects.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How would losing wild bees impact our ecosystems?</strong></p>
<p>The important thing is that many wild bees species have established themselves the only pollinator for a particular plant species. If that bee species goes extinct, so does the plant. Its not enough to just introduce different wild bee species or rely on honeybees to pollinate those flower patches...because they tend to either mess up the pollination process or f*ck up the flower so it can't develop. That is why each specific bee species tends to be so critical. Perhaps one or two missing from any given ecosystem would be ok, but as you start to lose more bee species the whole structure of the ecosystem will unravel. </p>
<p>Wild cees are integral to ecosystems, collectively they are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species" target="_blank">keystone species</a>. Without them the whole functioning of the food web as we know it would crumble. The reason why they have become so integral to the functioning of healthly ecosystems is because  we are literally living in the &quot;age of the flower&quot;. To put this in perspective there are more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowering_plant" target="_blank">flowering plant</a> species (~350,000 species) than non-flowering plant species (~1000 gymnosperms, ferns ~12,000...) put together. Many flowers can self-pollinate (e.g. with wind), but many also pollinate using pollinators. There are many different kinds of pollinators like flies, butterflies, moths bats, mammals - but bees are really the specialists here. They are the most abundant and diverse group of pollinators. Some bees are generalists and can visit many different flowering species. Other bees are more specific, and can only pollinate one kind of flower. These relationships are very specific - the plant relies on the bee as much as the bee relies on the plant. Without one, the other cannot exist. Thus it is critical to understand each species and its role in their local environment. If one bee species is threatened with extinction, it could set off a domino effect whereby the plants that it pollinates also become extinct. </p>
<p>Its unlikely that we would lose <em>all</em> species of bee to extinction. None the less we are seeing the beginnings of some significant species loss as we move deeper into this century. Some wild bee species are already endangered and are facing critical losses. Its a difficult situation because we are talking about thousands of species, some being affected more than others, and each being affected in different ways. For example, some wild bees seem to be more affected by habitat loss and degradation, whereas others can survive in more urban environments. For others, climate change is seriously impacting their survival. There isn't a clear single solution because wild bee population are being impacted by so many different things. </p>

<p><strong>How would losing honey bees impact our crops and food?</strong></p>
<p>Most of our food comes from wind-pollinated crops (e.g. cereals and grains). While we would se the disappearance of some fruits we would be able to hand pollinate some crops...they would be very expensive but they wouldn't disappear altogether. Generally, I would think we would increase the production of wind-pollinated crops to compensate.</p>
<p>From: u/TDawgUK91 from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4fxfo2/eli5_if_honey_bees_went_extinct_why_would_humans/" target="_blank">this post</a>...</p>
<p><em>&quot;Only a very small proportion of our food depends on honey bees. To give some numbers: Crops which benefit to any extent from animal pollination account for 35% of total food production by volume. This means that yields of those crops would be lower in the abscence of animal pollination.</em></p>
<p><em>However, yields for most of them would not be zero. It is estimated that animal pollination is directly responsible for between 5 and 8% of current global agricultural production by volume. So if you lost all animal pollinators overnight, that is how much less food there would be. Clearly this is not going to wipe out humanity, although the impact wouldn't be equally distributed - some people would no doubt face severe problems, and farmers whose crops happen to be among those most dependent on pollination would lose their livlihoods. We could probably also replace some of this by other means.</em></p>
<p><em>Furthermore, honey bees are only two species out of many thousands of pollinators - including 20,000 other species of wild bee alone, and also some species of flies, butterflies, moths, wasps, beetles, thrips, birds, bats and other vertebrates. I couldn't find an exact figure on the relative importance, but &quot;both wild and managed pollinators have globally significant roles in crop pollination, although their relative contributions differ according to crop and location.&quot; Note that in this context, 'managed pollinators' includes both honey bees and a few other species of bee. So if honey bees went extinct, the impact would be even less still.</em></p>
<p><em>So, overall, it's quite clear that honey bees going extinct wouldn't kill off humans. It would probably be very bad for some people, but to the average Western consumer the only noticable difference would be some fruits and nuts become more expensive [or non-existant].

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Full Time Beekeeper here:</p>
<p>We send in state and nationally sponsored surveys every year to help track losses.  </p>
<p>The PA State Beekeepers ran a survey last year, along with National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) and The Bee Informed Partnership (BIP).  These surveys usually come in the form of &quot;How many colonies did you start with at X time of year? How many did you have by Y Time of year?&quot;  This helps us determine if we are losing more bees in the winter (cold being the main stressor) or, say, in the summer (parasitic mites being the suspected main stressor). The main issue with these surveys is that they are voluntary.  I believe PA had one of the best turn outs at.20% response. </p>
<p>We also require you to register your colonies here whether you have 1 or 10,001 hives.  Since that covers the majority of beekeepers in the state, the state inspectors have been asking the questions directly at each apiary they inspect. The only problem is that the budget only has enough money to pay for 7 state apiary inspectors, so there is no way they can get to every beekeeper every year.</p>
<p><a href="https://beeinformed.org/2016/05/19/interpreting-and-understanding-the-differences-in-honey-bee-colony-loss-numbers-from-different-national-surveys/" target="_blank">Relevent Article regarding National Surveys</a></p>
<p>Wild colonies are much more difficult to asses for obvious reasons.  I can say anecdotally that the honey bee colonies we remove from houses and trees tend to do much better than the ones we purchase.</p>
