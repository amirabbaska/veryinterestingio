		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would say this is as much social as it is biological. There are always social factors determining how one ought to laugh in a given situation, and social sanctions (&quot;his laugh is so weird&quot;) are in place to punish and discourage laughs that are outside what a culture says is okay at any moment. </p>
<p>There's a biological response to laugh in certain situations as ways to defuse fear, or to express emotion to listeners, etc. but HOW someone laughs is social,  even moment to moment (&quot;God that was funny. Oh man am I really laughing this loud during Aunt Janet's fancy dinner party? That's so awkward, but i can't help it. Everyone is looking at me! Ah fuck it.&quot; =like 7 different laughs).</p>
<p>Ultimately, our brain is very very good at picking up on and internalizing social cues because we're social animals. We learn what works and what doesn't in many different situations when we laugh and it becomes a part of how we express ourselves. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I went from an automatic &quot;heheheh&quot; to a more deeper   &quot;Hohahaha&quot;. Now everyone compliments me on my jolly laugh... which makes me self conscious about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
