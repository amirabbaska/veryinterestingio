So, if I give you $10 to run a lemonade stand per year, but it turns out you only need $8 to run it, next year I'll only give you $8. So, to avoid losing money that you might want to use next year, you spend that $2 at the end of the year to make it appear that it costs $10 each year to run the lemonade stand, and your budget is not reduced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The people doing this are spending other peoples' money, not their own. Business owners don't &quot;dump money&quot; at the end of the year; employees may do that, to &quot;use up&quot; funds already allocated. Governments don't have any money of their own, and don't get to keep money they don't spend, so there is no incentive to not spend. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way: you have $50 in hand and you go to buy $50 worth of goods. Lets say for the sake of argument that the goods hold their value. After you've made the purchase you still have $50 worth of stuff, before the purchase it was US currency now its some physical items. </p>
<p>The way this applies to a business is the following: In your business you have your income vs your costs, the difference is your net profit. The government only taxes you on this amount, so if you made $100 and spent $50 to do it your net is $50. </p>
<p>Here's the key, if you keep this money as currency the government is going to tax it, so out of those $50 you will lose 30% or so. However, if you &quot;dump&quot; the money into physical goods like I said earlier you end up with $50 worth of stuff, on your taxes you write off the purchase as a business expense and at the end of the day you end up with $0 net to be taxed on, thus you will pay $0 taxes. </p>
<p>To finish the picture lets expand the definition of what that money can be spent on: basically anything, including just giving it out as a bonus to the executives in the company. So if my company made 200k this year, on my taxes I'd write that it made $0 and I was given a 200k &quot;performance bonus&quot;. If I'm a small company and I'm not greedy I might decide to buy stuff I can see myself needing anyway, like new computers, company vehicles, etc.  but, either way, my goal is to get that number as close to 0 as possible. In certain circumstances the number can even be negative which allows me to pay 0 taxes this year and be untaxed on whatever money I &quot;lost&quot; the following year. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
