		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ads are normally from ad networks and require the end user's browser to pull the information from that network's servers - the main website references that ad network. Adblock stops your browser from retrieving the ad, so
you instead see the part of the website that is normally covered by the ad, which they have put the note on. The reason they can't just put the ad there is that they wouldn't get revenue from doing so - the ad network needs to count your browser hitting the ad and doesn't trust the hosting website to count for them. If they did, adblock would need to find a different way to block ads. If adblock becomes too much of a revenue issue for ad networks, they will likely see them find a way for the host website to provide the ads directly.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I didn't see an answer for the <em>how</em>, so here goes:</p>
<p>One way websites actually test for the presence of adblock is to have a &quot;dummy&quot; file called something like <code>advertisement.js</code> that will have just a little bit of code in it, say, one variable called <code>isAdblockOff</code> set to true. Most AdBlocks will filter based on file name as well, so if there are any ad-related keywords, AdBlock will decide it's an ad. </p>
<p>If the dummy file gets blocked, it won't load, so when some other bit of code checks <code>isAdblockOff</code>, it comes up as false, so they display another message, like &quot;Hey, our ads aren't bad, we need them to make money, please don't block them!&quot; or whatever you see there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How do ad blockers know what is an ad they should block, and how to block them?</p>
<p>Some really cool people browse the most popular websites and manually create instructions in a special syntax that ad blockers understand. Your ad blocker likely downloads a bunch of filters, which are simply text files with thousands of these instructions, so most of the websites you visit will be ad-free.</p>
<p><a href="https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist.txt" target="_blank">This is what the most common filter looks like</a>.</p>
<p>These lists are regularly maintained to add instructions on how to block new types of ads and how to block ads on pages that bypass ad blockers.</p>
<p>Web sites do try to bypass ad blockers all the time, but someone simply makes a new instruction to block the updated ad and pushes an update to one of these filters. Your ad blocker downloads it seamlessly and if you didn't visit the website during a very specific time frame, you won't even noticed the website has tried to bypass your ad blocker.</p>
<p>If the website simply adds a message that says &quot;hey, you're using ad blocker, please don't :(&quot; whenever you're using it, the filter maintainers will generally not push an update to remove the message, since it's not an ad.</p>
<p>These filters work for things other than ads. For example, there are filters that block tracking code, social media buttons, and even filters that block annoying &quot;don't use ad block&quot; messages. The most robust ad blockers have settings so you can add the custom filters you find on the internet.</p>
<p>edit: Just so you can see how often these things are updated: EasyList was updated while I was writing this post. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
