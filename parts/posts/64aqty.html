		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking about how when I read silently to myself, I &quot;hear&quot; the words I'm reading in my head. When I read the word &quot;window&quot; I &quot;hear&quot; it, know what it is, and continue on. I don't &quot;see&quot; in my mind's eye a picture of a window unless I need to (e.g. to solve a puzzle I might picture various kinds of windows).</p>
<p>Then I wondered, for someone who has never heard the the pronunciation of the word or know what it sounds like, what happens when they read the word &quot;window&quot;? Do they picture it in their mind's eye or does something else entirely different take place?</p></div></div>

<p>I recall hearing that deaf schizophrenics experience sign hallucinations rather than voices in their heads. Would this be in the same relative area as to what would be happening here with deaf people reading?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Humans as a species are drawn to symbols and imagery - rock paintings, car insignia, flag emblems, you name it.
You don't need to speak to be able to learn. You need to understand how to read. Deaf people learn sign language and use it to learn English (as an example) literature.
Instead of teaching kids 'A', 'apple', and the sound of the word, replace vocals with a sign for apple. It's all just learned associations. Deaf people will probably visualise the literature and are able to distinguish by the differences in spelling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this is related, one method for speed reading is to stop reading to yourself, that's it, you don't have to &quot;speak&quot; the words on you brain if you already saw them, just by sight you brain recognizes the word, the sound is just a pointless repetition that we all do just because we get used, it comes from how we learn how to read because others read to us and we learn that way and we just keep doing it, reading to ourselves, so in a way, what they do is what everyone should do when reading, just watching the words and ignoring the sounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is known from research on people with congenital blindness is that the cells in &quot;visual cortex&quot; (the back of the brain) adapt to other input. If I recall correctly, the visual cortex would process tactile information. This can be taken as evidence that cells in specific brain areas are not specialized and very specific (as perhaps Broadmann's research would imply). The argument is perhaps more difficult to make from what we today know about pluripotent stemcells (although that would be more elegant); these findings were simply based on information on the anatomical and cognitive level.</p>
<p>It is possible that this principle applies to the brains of people with congenital deafness too. However, deafness from birth may be due to multiple causes. For example, deafness can be caused at any point of the auditory pathway (inner ear, cochlea, afferent fibres, brain stem, mid brain, thalamus), including damage to the brain itself (i.e. auditory cortex). If the brain remains intact, the &quot;principle&quot; of compensatory neuroplasticity suggests that all neurons will be used for something.</p>
<p>I have only addressed the third-person perspective here. I am not sure &quot;what it is like&quot; for people with this condition, subjectively. Perhaps it varies depending on the nature of the condition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
