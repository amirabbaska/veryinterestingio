Would that at some point affect brain functions of really large people?</p>
<p>And if you get fat, would that mean more nerves and information with the added skin and tissue? Your brain still stays the same.</p></div></div>

<p>Everyone has the same <em>general</em> layout of nerves. All nerves arise either from the spinal cord or from the brainstem. What you have to remember is that each area of the body on the outside is innervated (roughly) by a particular nerve. These are called <a href="http://tlccrx.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Dermatome.jpg" target="_blank">dermatomes</a>.</p>
<p>But that's at the macro level. Big nerves that arise from the spinal cord branch off into smaller and smaller branches until they send neuronal processes to every place they are supposed to be. When you get fat, you add more tissue, and the existing nerves branch out to innervate the new tissue.</p>
<p>This wouldn't effect brain function because it's taking place in the Peripheral Nervous System (nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.) New innervation doesn't change the way the brain works, at least not on the sensory side of things. Motor output (i.e. the brain telling the muscles to do stuff) from the brain is tweaked in the cerebellum and several other places. </p>
<p>Sensory nerves are just there to keep the brain informed of what's going on in the peripheral tissues. If you have more tissue, your nerves branch to innervate that tissue so there isn't a numb place on your body. </p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>So TL;DR, no. everyone has (mostly) the same BIG nerves, any new tissue would be innervated by branching of existing nerves. </p>

<p>The trends I spoke of prior are relevant to one's genetically-encoded body size and brain size.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm tired of medical students speaking out of their ass.</p>
<p>** edit: sorry for the aggression, I misread /r/statellitedoomcannon 's comments and was thinking of population / genetic trends ... not for body size changes and the corresponding nerve changes for an individual.  I apologize, and am embarrassed for the misread.</p>

<p>/r/satellitedoomcannon 's conclusion is not that shared by most scientists</p>
<p>Short answer - yes.</p>
<p>Long answer - this is a complicated aspect of our biology that appears to be highly variable from person to person.</p>
<p>/r/satellitedoomcannon has most of the details correct; however, is wrong about the conclusion.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>He is correct that the architecture of the central nervous system (CNS) is highly constant between individuals; however, this has little to do with nerve number nor neuron number.</p>
<p>The constancy of the architecture of our CNS does not force a constancy on the number of nerves/neurons.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the same &quot;sensory resolution&quot; on the skin (for example), a larger person <strong>would</strong> need more nerves than a smaller person.  In order to effectively process that information, the brain (according to what we know) would require more nuerons to process the input.</p>
<p>It has not been directly proven, but is strongly believed that more sensory input requires a larger brain.</p>
<p>Here are some supportive links:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982209015978" target="_blank">link 1</a></p>

<p><a href="http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/8/1/90" target="_blank">link 3</a></p>
<p>Here is key text from link 3 - summarizing evidence which indicates larger eyes correlate with having a larger section of the brain responsible for processing vision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We demonstrate a significant positive relationship between absolute latitude and human orbital volume, an index of eyeball size. Owing to tight scaling between visual system components, this will translate into enlarged visual cortices at higher latitudes. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>if you want more in-depth literature, I'll be happy to go through and find it for you.  Just let me know.</p>
<p>if you want to be put in-touch with an expert in this field, I know several neurobiologists.  Just let me know.</p>
<p>**edit - this is also purported as the best explanation for why men and women have equal intelligence, even though women tend to have smaller brains.  The larger brain in males is thought to be a result of needing more neurons to process sensory input from a larger body.  This is believed to be the reason why our cognitive abilities are essentially equal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
