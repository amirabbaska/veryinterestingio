I can't wrap my head around the fact that something happens for no reason with no trigger, it makes more sense to think that the reason is just unknown at our present level of understanding.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Thanks for the answers. To others coming here looking for a concise answer, I found this post the most useful to help me intuitively understand some of it:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/72oipy/why_do_we_consider_it_certain_that_radioactive/dnk9sjq/?context=3" target="_blank">This post</a> explains that the theories that seem to be the most accurate when tested describes quantum mechanics as inherently random/probabilistic. The idea that &quot;if 95% fits, then the last 5% probably fits too&quot; is
very intuitively easy to understand. It also took me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_variable_theory" target="_blank">this</a> page on wikipedia which seems almost made for the question I asked. So I think everyone else wondering the same thing I did will find it useful!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't really say that &quot;this is definitively the rule how physics works.&quot; We say that &quot;this is definitively the rule describing what we observe.&quot; Quantum mechanics perfectly describes what we observe. Nobody considers it complete. </p>
<p>In fact, it is fundamentally incomplete as it can not describe the domain of quantum gravity. There is consideration of theories within the domain of string/m theory that reproduce the axioms of quantum mechanics as emergent results. So there is expectation that &quot;it's random&quot; is merely the result of some more fundamental mathematical structure. </p>
<p>But as of now, it's been almost a hundred years and nobody has moved progress a centimeter beyond &quot;it's random.&quot; So we just say it's random and if you ask further, we explain it like this!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I can't speak to radioactive decay in particular, but I don't think your question is specific to it anyway. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem#Overview" target="_blank">Bell's theorem</a> addresses this more generally. Basically what it does is make testable the claim &quot;there might be hidden variables&quot;, which have been tested numerous times in numerous ways. Modern physics has shown, experimentally, that &quot;hidden variable&quot; theories fail and quantum mechanics is <em>fundamentally</em> random. I'm not sure what the scope of this is, and there's a chance that radioactive decay in particular doesn't have to be random, but physics in general is.</p>
<p>My understanding of Bell's theorem basically stops at what it claims, not why it makes sense, so I can't do much better than link that wikipedia article about it, but hopefully that helps?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of top level comments here from physicists giving complicated answers so I'll drop something short here as a radiochemist. There's some extra detail below the tldr but the tldr is a short/sweet practical answer to your question.</p>
<p>TLDR</p>
<p>We know you don't need a hidden energy source for radioactive decay because it still happens in extremely cold environments. We know you don't need hidden reactants for decay because it happens in a vacuum. We know you don't need a special unknown particle within the nucleus for decay because a single neutron flying alone though space will decay into a proton+electron+antielectron neutrino.</p>
<p>The difference in mass-energy between the parent/daughters in radioactive decay is exactly equal to the energy released by the decay. If another particle was involved the total energy released would be less than the difference in mass energy between the parent/daughters</p>
<hr />
<p>The reason radioactive decay happens spontaneously is the same reason anything happens spontaneously. It is (in <em>every</em> case) thermodynamically favorable and there exists a kinetic pathway by which the decay can occur.</p>
<p>I can answer your question explicitly in the case of alpha decay. There exists an energy barrier in alpha decay that the alpha particle must overcome to leave the nucleus. In no case does the alpha particle <em>ever</em> have this energy. The alpha particle leaves the nucleus solely through the effects of quantum tunneling, and the half life of its decay can be calculated based on only this assumption. No further information is necessary. No further reactants or sources of energy are necessary. Tunneling is a random event.</p>
<p>Radioactive decay is known to be first order kinetically. This means the kinetics of decay is dependent solely
upon the amount of the nucleus present and the decay constant. Experimentally we confirm and reconfirm every day that the rate at which something decays is dependent only upon how much of the nucleus is there. There are no chemical environments which can alter the properties of decay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of responses going into bell inequalities and quantum stuff. Keeping just to the radioactive decay from your question, if you look at radioactive decay over time it follows an exponential curve, with a half-life that characterises the time it takes for the activity to halve. Sometimes in physics real-world exponential 'tails' don't really go to infinity but get truncated at very small values due to some secondary effect, but not here. As close as we can tell, radioactive decay is exponential.</p>
<p>An exponential curve has no scale. You can zoom in or out on any part of the curve, and it will still look like an exponential. In that sense, the decay has no 'features'. There is nothing that makes an atom decay faster at one speed, no peaks or changes in the curve. The only variable is the half life. This implies there is no 'reason' for the decays besides the half life. It follows a random Gaussian probability distribution, as best we can tell.</p>
<p>This isn't proof of course, physics isn't in the business of proof, but fitting observations to theory. Generally where you get true exponential distributions you find random events.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
