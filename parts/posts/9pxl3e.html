		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Boiling it in the lye water, sugar water, or salt water depending on the type of bagel is what gives it the unique skin that you find in no other kind of bread. Without doing so it would just be a hoop of normal bread and would have few of the characteristics that define a bagel. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's ALL about that smooth, chewy crust.  Boiling sets the exterior before baking and it keeps the bagel from rising too much while in the oven so you wind up getting that dense inner bread texture.  They're only boiled for about 30-60 seconds before they get time in the oven.  The longer the boil, the more dense and chewy it gets.   </p>
<p>No boiling, and like it's been said, you get a ring of bread without all that chewy texture you get with a bagel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Boiling the bagel changes the surface of the dough, mostly through gelatinization.</p>
<p>The heat of the boiling water breaks down the starch and allows it to dissolve and reform into a gel. This gelled surface acts reacts differently to the heat of the oven, resulting in a smoother, chewier outside of your bagel. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>to WHY it is done in the first place there are some theories: </p>
<p>back in the days in East prussia Jews weren't allowed to eat bread or to bake bread. a clever jewish walkaround was to cook the dough and then toast it, so the process could not be considered as baking or the product as bread.  </p>
<p>another theory: according to jewish dietary laws you have to wash your hands before eating bread. if you are in the jewish business of going from house to house and sell trinkets you don't have always the time and opportunity to wash your hands. so what to do when you hungry? there comes the bagel, because it is cooked and then toasted it differs from bread and therefore you can eat it without washing your hands before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
