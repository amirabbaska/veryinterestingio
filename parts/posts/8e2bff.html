		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not about being so hard as to stop the bullet. It's about reducing the amount of energy the bullet is carrying. Transferring that energy into the ceramic and distributing it throughout lessens the energy. As stated above cars are made to crumple at the hood forward. That way the energy of the impact is spread into the front of the vehicle instead of in your body. It's like a stuntman coming off a high jump. If he lands directly on his feet he will snap his legs. If he rolls he distributes the energy and doesn't get injured.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It is a sandwich, consisting of a metal composite plate, woven kevlar, and relatively brittle ceramic.

<p>Lightweight high threat protection  usually has ceramic plates in their construction. These ceramics are specialized and will help shatter a bullet traveling at rifle speeds so that the Kevlar or other ballistic materials behind it can stop then fragments.  Ceramics like dinner plates are very hard but also brittle and will break if dropped or other wise subjected to heavy shock. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its a ceramic plate wraped on kevlar. If you drop it, it can crack which weakens it. If a bullet hits the crack it can go through. They only guarantee the 1st shot wont penetrate. If shot in the same 3 inch radius it might go through. Thats why the vests have another layer of kevlar inside the vest itself.
They know it is an issue and tried to run &quot;dragon skin&quot; but it was wayyy to heavy. Best advice i ever got was from Patches Ohulahan &quot;dip,duck,dive and dodge&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Materials have different properties and are selected based on the usage scenario. The ceramic is designed to shatter on impact to disperse the energy of the bullet. If you've already shattered it by dropping it, it's next to useless in a combat environment. </p>
<p>tl;dr, The reason it's effective for its designed use is exactly why it would shatter upon being dropped. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
