		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our brain reinforces pathways we take more than once.  Often what happens when we forget what we wanted to do while starting to do something is that a more reinforced brain pathway is triggered when we start the action, causing us to forget the rest once it leaves short term memory.</p>
<p>Sort of like the challenge of patting your head while rubbing your stomach.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Related, but only applicable in certain cases, the doorway effect is a real thing, and probably why you spend so much time looking in the fridge not remembering what you came to get. </p>
<p>The short version is that doorways are memory erasers. This comes from the idea your brain works event based timeline, the specific idea being that doorways(both real and imagined) serve as a marker for when one event ends and a new one begins, so you brain dumps the buffer and starts loading the new event. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another explanation is the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model which is not very relevant to your specific situation but attempts to explain how short and long term memories are formed. There's rehearsal, a sensory buffer and basically a flowchart that describes how we form memories and how they can decay. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
