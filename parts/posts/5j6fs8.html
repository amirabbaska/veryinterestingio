Making it easier for mutations to hit genes that make (for example) butterflies be attracted to different flowers, but not genes that are important for them wanting nutrition.</p>
<p>He said (if I remember correctly) that there was no real evidence for this, but that it could be possible.</p>
<p>Has anything been found on this since then?</p></div></div>
