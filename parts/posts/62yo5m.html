<p>But im fairly certain it was at least already in the talks, maybe even had a few people working on it before that and then after they saw interest they put more resources into it.. It definetly showed Rockstar that there was a market though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth we had a very popular petition here in Germany a few months ago.
VGWort (essentially the organisation responsible for the copyright of all written stuff, sort of like GEMA for books) and the German universities couldn't come to an agreement regarding the payment of royalties. For years the universities payed VGWort in bulk to distribute material to students, but now they made unreasonable request that would have kept professors from distributing pretty much anything and setting us all back to the pre-digital age.
We got emails from the student body telling us to download everything we could while we still had the chance, and we were all scared that we would no longer get the course materials necessary to study properly.
Well, pretty much every student in Germany signed the petition and VGWort finally budged, for a while at least.</p>
<p>EDIT: corrected WortVG to VGWort</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It basically just shows that there are numbers of people interested and supporting this or that idea. Much depends upon the idea or the problem itself: you can't just make the country government retire because there are 50 millions virtual signs on a webpage. But you can for example get the city mayor  to know about an old house without ramps for wheelchairs and there are disabled people living in who need it. Or hospital refusing supplying ill people with vital preparates. Stuff like that is what I mostly seen being successful here in Russia.</p>
<p>It also depends on the insistence, assertiveness and activity of petition starter. Things won't just happen because there are people who signed the petition, you have to make the officials know about it and convince them that there are actual people, not bots signed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
