		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking about large trucks or buses, they use an air brake system.</p>
<p>The &quot;Emergency Brake&quot; is also the parking brake on most of the large vehicles you see with air brakes as opposed to hydraulic ones.</p>
<p>Air brake systems have both an active and passive system- the regular braking system used in normal operation and the &quot;spring brake&quot;.</p>
<p>The system works by building up air in a tank fed by an air compressor (there's other parts but those are the basic elements) and when it has a full load of compressed air (90-150 psi in most buses, not sure about large trucks) you can press the foot brake, which uses some of that compressed air to send power to the brakes at the wheels, thereby slowing the vehicle.</p>
<p>The spring brakes are the opposite- they're <em>always</em> pushing, using- you guessed it- big springs. When the system charges with air and the parking brake is released, the air pressure in the system overcomes the springs and holds them back, allowing normal operation.</p>
<p>When you pull the parking/emergency brake, it removes air from the lines and the spring brakes clamp on. If you have an air leak, the system is also designed that if pressure drops too low, the emergency/parking brake will snap on automatically (usually around 40 psi in a bus), thereby forcing the vehicle to stop.</p>
<p>The parking/emergency brakes are very powerful but won't stop a bus in a four-wheel slide. It's more of a very hard braking action.</p>
<p>Same thing when you press the foot brake hard enough- you can put a <em>lot</em> of pressure to the brakes. However, this is not a good idea to do often- the brakes heat up fast and if they get too hot you'll lose braking power.</p>
<p>Drivers of air-brake equipped vehicles require special training and certification in order to operate them under US law.</p>
<p>Edit: The action shown in the video is due to several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Well-adjusted braking systems.</li>
<li>An alert and very well-trained driver.</li>
<li>Probable lighter load than normal.</li>
<li>Optimal road conditions for a rapid stop.</li>
</ul></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The following is true in some but not all cases. For example if the road has something on it like ice, water, oil that forms a thin layer between the tires and road. It is much easier to drive my 5000 pound bus on ice than my toyota. However in the case of a solid nondeformable smooth surface extra mass linearly scales with force of friction and thus cancels out the mass that linearly scales in the inertial term. </p>
<p>The equation is <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Friction" target="_blank">F^(friction)=μ⋅N</a>
where</p>
<p>F^(friction), is the force of friction exerted by each surface on the other. It is parallel to the surface, in a direction opposite to the net applied force.</p>
<p>μ, is the coefficient of friction, which is an empirical property of the contacting materials,</p>
<p>N, is the normal force exerted by each surface on the other, directed perpendicular (normal) to the surface.</p>
<p>N = mg</p>
<p>In this equation, N refers to the normal force, m refers to the object's mass, and g refers to the acceleration of gravity. For an object sitting on a flat surface.</p>
<p>The force required to stop the truck on a flat surface is </p>
<p>F^(stop) = m⋅a</p>
<p>m is mass and a is the acceleration. Because we want to stop as quickly as possible we want to maximise a, but F^(stop) must be ≤ F^(friction). So we can say that they are equal at the best possible stopping distance.
so we combine them to get </p>
<p>μ⋅(m⋅g)=m⋅a, dividing both sides by m and rearranging we get </p>
<p>a = μ⋅g</p>
<p>notice that the mass of the truck canceled out perfectly.</p>
<p>When you are dealing with a decline the Normal force is equal to <a href="http://thecraftycanvas.com/library/files/2013/02/free-body-force-diagram-block-on-frictionless-incline.png" target="_blank">N =mg⋅cos( θ )</a></p>
<p>The force to stop while going down hill is higher because gravity is pulling you down hill so you must counter that acceleration with even more force in the opposite direction. here is a neat little video that explains the trig needed to calculate the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/forces-newtons-laws/inclined-planes-friction/v/inclined-plane-force-components" target="_blank">Inclined plane force components</a>.   </p>
<p>F^(gravity) = m⋅g ⋅ sin(θ)</p>
<p>So we combine this to get F^(stop) = (ma)+(m⋅g ⋅ sin(θ))</p>
<p>once again we set  F^(stop) to = F^(friction) and get </p>
<p>μ⋅(mg⋅cos( θ )) = (ma)+(m⋅g ⋅ sin(θ))</p>
<p>or simply </p>
<p>a= (μ⋅(mg⋅cos( θ )) - (m⋅g ⋅ sin(θ)))/m</p>
<p>once more magicly the mass variable cancels out.</p>
<p>I made this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10jnT_xdBlavyKafyjlcL832WeF0W2o98UK-Uua0dI6w/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">google sheet</a> with all the math and a few graphs and such.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that this all assumes the braking system was properly designed and maintained so it can absorb the kinetic energy required to perform a perfect static braking maneuver. Namely applying the maximum breaking force without slipping, on perfectly clean smooth dry concrete. Perfect trucks driven by perfect drivers, on perfect roads don't exist. </p>
<p>TLDR - the mass of a truck does not affect braking time or distance under ideal conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trucks use a different braking system than cars. Most use an air system that releases pressure on the breaks when the pedal is depressed. The release in pressure allows strong springs to push pads or shoes against a drum or caliber creating mass friction and slowing or stoping the wheel from spinning. Each wheel, including the trailer, have brakes which helps reduce speed. Heavy loads also help to stop rather than light loads, by creating more force to help the tire grab the ground below.</p>
<p>The more tires, the more stopping friction there is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
