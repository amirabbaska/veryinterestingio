Sometimes it's blue and black, sometimes it's gold and white. We've heard that it's even &quot;switched&quot; for some people. </p>
<p>We've had our experts working on this, and it's surprisingly difficult to come up with a definitive answer! Our panelists are here to offer their thoughts. </p>
<p>These are possible explanations from experts in their fields. We will not be allowing anecdotes or layman speculation; we'll be moderating the thread as always and removing comments that do not follow our guidelines. </p>
