<p>The bladder is a muscular bag and it is not difficult to imagine that a bag of muscle will have difficulty contracting till its internal volume is zero. </p>
<p>The amount of urine left after peeing is called the PVR or postvoid residual urine (voiding being the technical word for peeing), and we know it is a thing because researchers have catheterized subjects after peeing and measured the amount left. Nowadays we can show there is urine left behind after voiding much more comfortably, using ultrasound. A PVR of less than 100ml may be quite normal.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/alesserweevil answered this pretty well. One thing to add is that incomplete emptying can be a problem. As was mentioned, a normal PVR (Post Void Residual AKA amount left in your bladder after you pee) should be &lt; 100 ccs. It can be very near zero. Anywhere in that range is generally fine. If your PVR is significantly higher, it can be signs of bladder problems, urethra problems or spinal cord dysfunction to name a few issues.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: your bladder tries to get rid of everything, but somewhere between 0 and 100ccs of urine are usually left behind. Significantly more than that = medical problem.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
