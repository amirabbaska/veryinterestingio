UNLESS you know the secret encryption method (I think they are called &quot;keys&quot;).</p>
<p>So I envision two people saying: &quot;Hey, let's talk in secret by replacing every letter in the alphabet with its corresponding number times three minus five&quot;
&quot;uh, brilliant, nobody will ever figure this out!&quot;</p>
<p>Except of course if somebody listened to the first bit of their conversation.</p>
<p>From what I have learned this initial exchanging of encryption methods is called the handshake.</p>
<p>Seems like once the handshake is intercepted, the whole encryption breaks down. </p>
<p>So how is the handshake kept secret?</p></div></div>
