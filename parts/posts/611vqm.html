<p>Edit: thanks for all the input.  I've seen a lot of thought provoking and intelligent answers here. My apologies if I answer late as I didn't expect so many people would be interested in something like this. Keep the answers coming guys :) </p>
<p>Edit2: I'd really appreciate if someone can compile all the sources and links in this post into comment so that so that everyone can benefit from them easily (I'd do it myself but I'm currently on mobile without a computer, doing my best to answer all these comments and it would be very hard for for me to collect all sources) also if a mod could stickey it that would be even better. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't just our emotions we're not aware of.  There is very little of our mind, our motivations, or our decisions that we are able to know clearly real-time.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for this, and depending on the context I chose, I could find different ways to answer.  One very interesting reason for our unawareness is the relationship between the hemispheres of our brain.</p>
<p>Our right brain works with pictures and is responsible for various ways of interaction in life.   The left brain however is a storyteller, explaining reality so quickly, we don't even notice it.  It is the maker of all meanings and it never shuts up.  It is incessantly trying to make sense of the world and is more concerned with instant explanation than with correct explanations. </p>
<p>Case in point:  In his book, The Language Instinct, Stephen Pinker talks about a famous study that worked with people who had specific split brain injuries that made it so their brains were separated into two distinct hemispheres;  This made it so that neither the left nor the right brain was aware of/able to interact with the other side.  </p>
<p>The researchers conducted an experiment where they would flash the person's right brain ( I don't know how exactly they did this) a signal to go get a Coke.   After the person had gone to get the Coke, they would flash a signal to the left brain that said, &quot;Why did you go get a Coke?&quot;  </p>
<p>The person would always respond with something like, &quot;I was thirsty&quot; or &quot;I love Coke.&quot;  The left brain didn't know about being told to go get the Coke, but it still, instantly, made up an explanation that seemed made sense.</p>
<p>Our brain makes up an instant explanation for our feelings and everything else.  When we question our feelings we are often attached to and at least partially blinded by our initial explanation.  </p>
<p>It is also the case that it is often this instant interpretation that triggers emotional states, as our brain is hardwired to respond to certain thoughts with certain emotions - like, [&quot;I'm in danger&quot;-Anger or Fear, &quot;I love her.&quot;  - Happiness, etc.].  This hardwiring is culturally influenced, but somewhat uniquely manufactured in people over time.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Your brain is a meaning making machine, and it moves so quick, that it's hard to notice what's actually happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Meditation teaches us to increase awareness of emotion by consciously and openly identifying them. For instance learning to say &quot;I FEEL sad&quot; vs &quot;I AM sad&quot; or &quot;I FEEL angry&quot; vs &quot;I'm fucking pissed off&quot;. Creating the distinction between the self and the emotion allows us to evaluate our thoughts without judgment. There are no bad feelings. Emotions do not define us. (I am not an anxious person, but I do feel anxious sometimes.) It's subtle but huge. Once we accept this and begin to change our thought pattern, we can begin to search for why we are experiencing this emotion. What individual experiences have lead us to react to our current situation this way? Is this emotion beneficial or a hindrance to who we are and desire to be? </p>
<p>Negative emotions are our subconscious trying to communicate that something isn't aligning with our core values, beliefs and/or self vision. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh I'd really appreciate you taking the time to do so. And you're right, what originally triggered this thread was sadness, but also the aftermath of it. </p>
<p>I recently received a bad grade which could be detrimental a few years down the road (although that's the anxiety talking). After I received this grade I was very upset with that mark and so I couldn't even study at all. I simply had no will or motivation to study. The problem is that that was also the reason that I got a bad grade in the first place (that I didn't study the first time). I kept asking myself why I couldn't study, and I answered &quot;because I'm not in the mood to&quot;. Well why am I not in the mood to, I asked again &quot;because I just am&quot; Usually I am aware of my thoughts and emotions but the true reason for my feelings completely blindsided me and I figured it out by accident only through a fight with my mother; it was because I was afraid I wouldn't get good marks even if I did) Now this really shook me because I thought that I had lost all control of myself and am no longer &quot;aware&quot; of my values and purpose. Had I been aware of the true reason of my sadness (the fear of failure) I could've easily tackled it which was what inspired me to make this post. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why aren't we always aware of the reasons for our emotions?</p>
<p>I'm a Buddhist, this is how I think about it.</p>
<p><strong>We are born with a monkey mind. Without taming it, it will always run wild. To tame it, you have to first become aware of it at all times.</strong></p>
<p>Right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the monkey seeing?</li>
<li>What is the monkey hearing?</li>
<li>What is the monkey feeling?</li>
<li>What mental image does the monkey have?</li>
<li>What thoughts does the monkey have?</li>
<li>What emotions does the monkey have?</li>
</ul>
<p>With right concentration, you can answer these questions at a rate of about <strong>ten times per second</strong>.</p>
<p>Don't believe me?</p>
<p>Try this (1 min):</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Sit down and place one index finger firmly on each knee. </li>
<li>Step 2: Concentrate the feeling of each finger contacting your knee.</li>
<li>Step 3: Try to concentrate on both feelings at the same time</li>
<li>Step 4: You will notice your mind bouncing between feeling the right knee, or the left knee, but not both at the same time</li>
<li>Step 5: Measure the speed your mind bounces between feeling each knee</li>
<li>Step 6: Concentrate and try to increase the speed</li>
</ul>
<p>Now expand this idea of feeling your body, to feeling your emotions, to hearing your thoughts, to seeing outwards, and also to seeing inwards.</p>
<p>Understand that the mind bounces between these senses like a rude monkey. Until the monkey is trained you will be at its will. And this fate is horrible because I can't think of anything more important than being aware of your own mind. </p>
<p>Now with a firm insight into how your thoughts and emotions work, let's get back to the original question.</p>
<p>Why aren't we always aware of the reasons for our emotions?</p>
<p>Answer: <strong>Because your monkey is dominating you</strong>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
