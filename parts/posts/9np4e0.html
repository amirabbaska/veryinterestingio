<li>Coated in a radar-absorbing paint mixture.</li>
<li>Shaped in a way that bounces radar waves off in a different direction than their source, which works because most radar devices have the transmitter and receiver in the same place.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radar is a series of electromagnetic waves sent out, when they hit something those waves return to the source and register. Usually aircraft don't just become invisible, but if it's a &quot;stealth&quot; aircraft, such as a F-117 Nighthawk, the angles of the aircraft are made to deflect those waves in other directions, either making the radar signiture significantly smaller or unseeable all together. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radar basically works by shooting out radio waves at the sky.  The radio waves bounce off stuff in the sky and sometimes, they bounce in such a way that they come back to the place where you shot off the original radio waves.  You can do some fancy math and calculate some information (distance, velocity, direction) about the thing that the radio waves hit based on how many of the radio waves you get back and how long it took for them to bounce back.</p>
<p>If you are an object and you'd like to not be seen by radar, you shape yourself so that you deflect radio waves off in different directions (but not back at the thing that shot the radio waves in your direction).  Also, you can use special materials that absorb the energy of the radio waves so that even if they do bounce back, the radio waves do not have enough energy to be detected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplistically, radar works sort of like a bat/dolphins detection system. It sends a pulse out, and listens for what bounces back. Large flat surfaces will bounce more back.
So the aim of an 'invisible' plane design is to dilute, capture or distort the radar so it doesn't return to thr origin point and give away it's position or shape.
This is also where the term 'under the radar comes from' as planes used to attempt to fly so low that the radar was scanning the air above them, they could hide behind objects that would block the radar and remain hidden for longer before detection.
Hope that explains? Let me know if you'd like more :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason you can see light things and not dark things is because they reflect the light back at you. Ordinary objects do the same with radar. If they absorb the radar rather than reflect it, we don't know it's there.</p>
<p>Same with black holes. Light goes in, but never reflects back out. We have no idea what they look like. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
