		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.sfn.org/Press-Room/News-Release-Archives/2008/One-Sleepless-Night-Increases-Dopamine-in-the-Human-Brain" target="_blank">a paper published in the The Journal of Neuroscience</a>, one sleepless night increases dopamine in the human brain. An increase of the neurotransmitter was found in the striatum, involved in reward/motivation, and the thalamus, involved in alertness. The researchers concluded :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rise in dopamine following sleep deprivation may promote wakefulness to compensate for sleep loss. “However, the concurrent decline in cognitive performance, which is associated with the dopamine increases, suggests that the adaptation is not sufficient to overcome the cognitive deterioration induced by sleep deprivation and may even contribute to it,” said study author Volkow. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would serve an evolutionary advantage to early humans who felt they needed to stay awake for extended periods of time, e.g. for hunting food. This contrasts with exercise-induced tiredness because, as we'll see, exercise does not necessarily cause cognitive impairment.</p>
<p><a href="http://pms.sagepub.com/content/84/1/291.full.pdf+html" target="_blank">Another study in <em>Perceptual and Motor Skills</em></a> sought to establish the effects of physical exhaustion on cognitive functioning. They had 13 fit men pedal on stationary bikes at different intensities, and had them perform a series of short-term memory tests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It appears from our findings that the extent to which physical effort affected cognition depended
on the intensity of the session and on the set size of the decision task.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also referenced other papers that addressed neurochemical changes within the brain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally it may be worth considering our results in the context of the biochemical changes
brought about by physical exercise. Indeed, it has been argued that these changes may interact
with cortical activity during strenuous effort (Hebb, 1955). Peyrin, Pequignot, Lacour, and
Fourcade (1987) reported an activation of the catecholamine system resulting from strong physical
work and suggested the existence of a positive relationship between adrenomedullary activation
and mental performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So sleep deprivation-induced exhaustion and physical exercise-induced exhaustion are similar in the sense that they cause an increase in catecholamines (i.e. dopamine, norepinephrine, etc.).</p>
<p>However, with physical exercise, it appears that an increase in mental performance is possible, whereas we already saw sleep deprivation can be cognitively impairing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comparative discussions of the present results with those of previous studies are daicdt
because of the different operarionahzarion of fatigue across studies and the specific interpretation
of results. Nevertheless, it has been already reported that treadmill exercise conducted at
high physiological activation (94% of maximum heart rate) significantly enhanced mental performance
(McGlynn, Laughlin, &amp; Rowe, 1979)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: <a href="http://www.bd.com/us/diabetes/page.aspx?cat=7001&amp;id=7516" target="_blank">Also understand that exercise uses up glucose stores in the muscles</a> and your body begins to burn fats as fuels, which can contribute to the feeling of overall fatigue if too much glucose is used up. This is a problem particularly in diabetics. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3315761" target="_blank">Here</a> is a paper that establishes the relationship between hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and levels of alertness.. <del>I do say anecdotally that I don't think sleep deprivation has much effect on blood glucose levels. But let me look for a source on that.</del></p>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1991337/" target="_blank">This paper</a> evaluates the effect of sleep deprivation on glucose metabolism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The research reviewed here suggests that chronic partial sleep loss may increase the risk of obesity and diabetes via multiple pathways, including an adverse effect on parameters of glucose regulation, including insulin resistance, a dysregulation of the neuroendocrine control of appetite leading to excessive food intake and decreased energy expenditure. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a different mechanism than by physical exercise-induced alterations in glucose metabolism. While your body knowns when to use glucose as energy while exercising, it appears that sleep deprivation results in dysregulation of neuroendocrine control of appetite and insulin resistance. In other words, tiredness from sleep deprivation is different from tiredness from physical exercise because sleep deprivation essentially results in bodily malfunction. Yet another reason to get enough sleep at night!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: Increased clarity and tried to point out more differences. Perhaps someone with more expertise in physiology can chime in?</p>
<p><strong>Edit 4</strong>: Thank you /u/whatthefat for the input:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that sleep deprivation specifically causes a reduction in ATP stores of neurons.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>TL;DR</em></strong></p>
<p>Tiredness from strenuous physical activity appears to be from your body using up its glucose and ATP energy stores. Tiredness from sleep deprivation is a result of your body going into overdrive mode: there are anomalies in the amount of neurotransmitters in the brain such as dopamine, and it has adverse effects on glucose metabolism and energy expenditure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tiredness from no sleep is mediated by hormonal changes due to changing brain waves:</p>
<ul>
<li>changes in the timing of the growth hormone secretory profile</li>
<li>decreased leptin levels (adipocyte-derived hormone that suppresses appetite)</li>
<li>increased ghrelin (predominantly a stomach-derived peptide that stimulates appetite)</li>
<li>activation of inflammatory C-reactive protein (CRP) </li>
</ul>
<p>Tiredness from exertion is:</p>
<ul>
<li>from the buildup of lactic acid in the muscles</li>
<li>loss of glycogen in the muscle</li>
<li>low blood glucose</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is mental and physical fatigue. Physical fatigue is the physical lack of muscles to be able to perform optimally. This onset comes about dependent on every individual's level of fitness. It also is effected by health as well as sleep deprivation. Hence sleep deprivation and physical exertion are both causes of the same physical fatigue. Mental fatigue on the other hand is typically more connected with lack of sleep and to a lesser degree overall health. </p>
