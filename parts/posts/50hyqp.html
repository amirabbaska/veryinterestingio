Below are pictures of a large tank with goldfish in, the tank had openings in the side where people could put their hands into the tank and touch the fish. </p>

<p>What stopped the water from spilling out of the openings? Surely the gravity and weight of the water should push it out and all over the aquarium floor?</p></div></div>
