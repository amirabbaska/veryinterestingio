		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water acts as a 'dummy load' when you have it in the microwave with bread. So it reduces the amount of energy going to the bread. Think of it in terms of cranking down an energy knob. The higher the energy the faster it heats up which means it gets soggy. If you have less energy and cook it slowly and evenly it won't get soggy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Edit: Some additional details. Happy to see all the interest in this.</strong></p>
<p>It's assumed the bread is frozen.
<strong>Why is the bread frozen?</strong> <em>It stays fresher longer. Good for when you're living by yourself and don't go through food as fast. As a poor graduate student who knows the struggle lol.</em></p>
<p><strong>Can I lower the power for the same effect?</strong> <em>Yes, basically it will do the same thing. Lowering the amount of energy reduces the amount of 'work' used to heat the bread. You'll have a lower temperature and this will allow for the heat to dissipate evenly throughout the bread.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wait a minute, what happens if I heat room temperature bread?</strong> <em>If you heat it the moisture from the bread will be released and moisten the bread. If you do this with water that water will be 'added' to the atmosphere in the microwave and may condense to make the bread wet on the outside. Of course if you heat it long enough it will dry out or burn.</em></p>
<p><strong>Edit 2: Why does bread get soggy?</strong> <em>At room temperature for example the bread is saturated with moisture, kind of like a damp sponge that has been sitting out for a couple hours. If you heat it up it softens the pores of the material and you get that 'soggyness'. When heating frozen bread at high temperatures it can be concentrated in certain areas and the heat may not be able to spread out. If you lower that temperature the heat can spread out and let the vapor escape.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>I worked in a bioenergy lab for a year with some people who studied pyrolysis with domestic and industrial microwaves. We had a metal 'mixer' to mix up the wood pellets or other biomass. We used water as a dummy load so that the microwaves would not be reflected back and damage the magnetron.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Learned this trick from a french baker who used to make crispy croissants by placing a bowl of water in fire brick oven. Moisture and starch chemistry at different temperature plays an important role in making glutenous bread soft inside and crusty on outside.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of starch, short clumpy ones (amylose, 70% of bread starch) and long brachy ones (amylopectin, 30%). The short clumpy ones absorb moisture and melt at about 100ºC and dry inside the porous bread making it firm, the long branchy ones 'unwind and stretch' and make it fluffier — this is what probably happens in microwave. More discussion <a href="http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/deliciousnessw09/2010/02/24/bread-firming-its-a-chemistry-thing/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Similar but extended process happens when bread is baked the first time. At 82ºC the surface of bread soaks up a lot of moisture and explodes into gooey gel which dries out to become a hard shell. At 135ºC sugars caramelize giving out fresh bread smell and the taste of crust. Between 140-200ºC, sugars and amino acids react to give the dark brown color (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction" target="_blank">Malliard</a> reaction).

He put a glass of water in with a slice of pizza and the pizza (if memory serves) came out even soggier than it normally would. If anyone else has tried it, does it work with only certain types of bread?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Use the defrost setting. Works great on frozen items. Wrap bread/bagel/roll or whatever in a paper towel and set for 1 min on defrost. Flipping it over after 30 seconds works best. Remove from MW and wrap in foil and put in toaster oven for ten min on 250 degrees.  Comes out bakery fresh!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
