		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other materials that are shaped like a semi-rigid sheet will make similar amounts of noise when crumpled:  aluminum foil, thin sheets of plastic, etc.</p>
<p>Each bend that you make in the sheet causes vibrations in it, and the vibrations are amplified similarly to how the (paper) cone of a speaker in your stereo makes loud sounds:  the large surface moves more air as it vibrates.</p>
<p>Start crumpling the paper from a corner and you'll see it vibrate and push air around as you do the crumpling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was quite a bit of research on this topic a while back: <a href="http://www.honeylocust.com/crumpling/" target="_blank">http://www.honeylocust.com/crumpling/</a>  I can't summarize it for you but if you're interested you might be able to get something from the links provided there.</p>
<p>Here's one paper: <a href="http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.54.278" target="_blank">http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.54.278</a></p>
<p>Here's the abstract:</p>
<p>From magnetic systems to the crust of the earth, many physical systems that exhibit a multiplicity of metastable states emit pulses with a broad power law distribution in energy. Digital audio recordings reveal that paper being crumpled, which can be easily held in hand, is such a system. Crumpling paper both using the traditional hand method and a cylindrical geometry uncovered a power law distribution of pulse energies spanning over two decades: p(E)=
E
α
, α=1.3-1.6, with clearly nonexponential distribution over three decades. Crumpling initially flat sheets into a compact ball (strong crumpling), we found little or no evidence that the energy distribution varied systematically over time or the size of the sheet. When we applied repetitive small deformations (weak crumpling) to sheets which had been previously folded along a regular grid, we found no systematic dependence on the grid spacing. Our results suggest that the pulse energy depends only weakly on the size of paper regions responsible for sound production.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
