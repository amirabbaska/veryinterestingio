<p>There's a little bit of misinformation going on in this thread. This may sound unintuitive, but that's physics for you.</p>
<p>The mass of an object does <em>not</em> affect a shock wave's &quot;strength&quot; (i.e. pressure differential across the shock boundary, which directly correlates to how loud the shock wave is). Larger objects will give you a larger shock wave in terms of size (i.e. Mach angle), but a baseball the size of a bullet and a baseball the size of a baseball will have shock waves that sound similar. </p>
<p>However, the shape of the object <em>does</em> affect &quot;strength.&quot; It often causes a higher number of shockwaves because of, say, multiple supersonic regimes on an aircraft, which gives you multiple shock waves that are very closely spaced apart, so the whole stackup sounds louder. So what you're hearing isn't a stronger shock driven by size, but more than one shock driven by shape. An F-22 the size of an F-22 and an F-22 the size of an SUV will sound similar, and these sound different compared to an SUV-sized baseball. </p>
<p>Also, the length of an object (i.e. along the direction of travel) could also cause something called boundary layer separation, which could cause another shock wave to form somewhere along the object. That's how you get a double shock wave (i.e. two cracks, which will usually sound different from each other because of, again, different characteristic shapes). </p>
<p>Note: The reason I keep putting &quot;strength&quot; in quotes is because that word not technically accurate. The only time strong vs. weak shocks are considered in aerodynamics are for oblique shocks, which are outside the scope of this conversation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Think of a shock wave like the wake of a boat. They don't just occur when you pass the sonic line - objects moving faster than the speed of sound continue to create shocks indefinitely.</p>
<p>A blunt object will create a bow shock in front of it - similar to a boat - hence the name. The pressure upstream of the shock is that of the undisturbed air. The pressure behind the shock depends primarily on the shape and speed of the object - but in both cases the pressure goes up. </p>
<p>The pressure upstream of the &quot;normal&quot; (perpendicular) part of the shock will be larger than the &quot;oblique&quot; (angled) part of the shock. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on multiple variables. The shape of the object, the area orthogonal (right angle) to its direction of travel. Also you can go faster than the speed of sound.... so speed and acceleration also impact the boom. So yes, size does matter... but it's not the only thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! But you have to remember that sonic booms are 3D fields of pressure in a gas medium, they are not 2D shapes. So the shape of the surface making the shockwave plays a major roll in how much observed &quot;force&quot; is behind the shockwave. I believe nasa is currently working on a project for an aircraft frame that is specifically designed to reduce the perceived amplitude of a sonic boom as experienced from the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
