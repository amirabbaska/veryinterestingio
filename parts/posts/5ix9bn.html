It gives you a nice graph of when you were in light sleep, deep REM sleep and awake.
How does it, and other similar fitness wristbands do this? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually work in that field, but for a medical device manufacturer. All these 'wellness' products will use their own proprietary algorithm to stage sleep based on heart rate variations and movements patterns. They will all claim some level of accuracy based on their own validation...Some may have a couple of published peer reviewed paper linked from their website to explain their validation results. The thing is, all these 'wellness' product manufacturers take great care to NOT be considered a medical device...They will have disclaimers written in their IFU (stands for 'indications for use'..not the reddit 'I F'ed Up') for that purpose. That way, they are not bound to any specific standard of performance...</p>
<p>I have tried a couple and was not impressed at all...real sleep staging is extremely difficult without the EEG signals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a Fitbit wearer and insomniac, I'd say they don't. My Fitbit awards me plenty of sleep when I'm just lying still and trying to rest. My sleep period usually starts when I'm reading before bed (not actually in the bed). It's almost midnight right now so it probably thinks I'm sleeping as I type this. It also will occasionally grant me an hour of sleep from 6:30-7:30 pm - while eating dinner with my family.  I have two teen boys so that's really not something I can sleep through. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They monitor heart rate, movement and light level (more specialised, due to battery concerns)</p>
<p>Phone ones tend to just measure movement (through mattress movement) which obviously has its issues. Most fitness bands measure Heart rate and Movement, which is more useful. And specialised bands with high quality recording systems (and long like batteries) use Heart Rate, Movement and Light level to give a doctor a view into your bedroom. The light level can be useful for improving your sleep environment, or showing generalized time scales, although obviously if you put your arm under the covers its done for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't.</p>
<p>The only reliable way to detect sleep levels is with an EEG.  Sitting still and being quiet will fool any device that relies on motion sensing and sounds.  Relaxing will fool anything that uses heart rate and breathing.   Hell, I had a polygraph machine saying that I was asleep, while the examiner was conversing with me.  Anything short of an EEG is just guesswork.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep staging is actually quite predictable.  Normal human sleep is broken into ultradian rhythms - The predictable pattern we progress through sleep stages.  For example, we enter REM every 90-120 minutes.  The first periods of REM are short and get longer as each ultradian cycle repeats.  Furthermore, breathing becomes irregular in REM.    Slow wave sleep (N3) is also predominant in the first part of the night, and conversely has very regular respiration.    </p>
<p>Part of the &quot;secret&quot; algorithms take this into account, and hedge their readings with what research already knows.</p>
