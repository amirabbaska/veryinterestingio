		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants produce a hormone called auxin. It is produced in the top of the stem and moves downwards. Auxin has the ability to promote elongation of cells (stretching).</p>
<p>The area that sunlight hits on a plant blocks the flow of auxin, causing an imbalance that results in one side having elongating cells whilst the others remain the same. As one side elongates, it causes the stem to bend, pointing towards the light.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants move by elongating the cells on the opposite side of where the light is, which bends them towards the light source. As for how they know where the light is, that's a bit more complicated. They have various molecules that can sense light and thus prompt a response to make them move around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants move all of the time even if it's not to face the sun. I put a web cam on my indoor hydroponic garden for a few months to take a time lapse. It was scary how much plants like mint explode outwards and wrap around everything around it. The plants also move to a rhythm like a beating heart, rising up, and relaxing down at regular intervals in time with day and night cycles of the lamps. </p>
<p>The way that plants move is actually kind of cool. They use hydraulics! An increase in pressure forces movement over time much like squeezing a tube of toothpaste causes it to move. Not all plants follow the sun exactly but some do orient themselves east or west in order to maximize their exposure throughout the day. Other plants are shade loving and avoid direct sunlight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is more in response to the second question, though I'm not sure of it quite gets to the heart of it. Sped up videos of plants show that they actually move around a lot; the following video shows how they pull off more complex movement, like climbing.</p>
