		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A person who is transgender seems to have no biological proof that they are one sex trapped in another sexes body. It seems to be that a transgender person can simply say &quot;This is how I feel, how I have always felt.&quot; Yet there is scientific evidence that they are in fact their original gender...eg genitalia, sex hormones etc etc.</p>
<p>If someone suffers from hallucinations for example, doctors say that the hallucinations are not real. The person suffering hallucinations is considered to have a mental illness because they are experiencing something (hallucinations) despite evidence to the contrary (reality).
Is a transgender person experiencing a condition where they perceive themselves as the opposite gender DESPITE all evidence to the contrary and no scientific evidence? </p>
<p>This is a genuine question</p></div></div>
