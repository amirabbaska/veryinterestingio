		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was watching an old SciShow episode and Hank Green said something to the effect that the Nâ‰¡N triple bond is so strong, it can't usually be broken except by lightning or a comparably powerful force. Yet nitrogen is arguably one of the very most prevalent and important components of nutrition for most organisms on the planet (in my understanding?). </p>
<p>So how do organisms break that triple bond in order to render nitrogen reactive enough to bond with other elements? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that certain soil bacteria break N2 down using an enzyme called nitrogenase.  It catalyzes the reaction:</p>
<p>N2 + 6 e^- + 6 H^+ --&gt; 2 NH3</p>
<p>This is a thermodynamically favorable reaction, but it is very slow due to the strength of the nitrogen triple bond, which has to break on the way to forming ammonia.  The active site of nitrogenase contains a large iron sulfur cluster that serves as a powerful and fast source of electrons to make this reaction happen.  At the same time, to maintain charge balance, amino acids near the N2 binding site quickly deliver the hydrogen ions that name up the rest of the reaction.  Overall, we call reactions like these proton coupled electron transfer, or PCET.</p>
<p>The trick in this reaction is that every time you give an electron to N2, its bond gets weaker.  This is due to the increasing population of electrons in what are called antibonding orbitals.  Consequently, if you add 6 electrons to N2, the bond gets completely negated.  Maintaining charge balance through proton delivery makes the injection of additional electrons much easier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up: Is there some reason that only a few plants (legumes mostly?) have figured out how to take advantage of these nitrogen fixing bacteria? It would seem that it's a very advantageous thing to be able to fix one's own nitrogen. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Organisms do not use N2 directly. It needs to be in a bioavailable form such as NH3, which as already mentioned, can be created by some bacteria. The other way is through lightning but it's not nearly enough to support the amount of people and food we grow now. The Haber-Bosch process converts atmospheric N2 with hydrogen to generate ammonia for large-scale fertilizer production. This allowed us to dramatically increase the productivity of land to grow more food and populations. Now some 80% of nitrogen in the human body originated from this process. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work with a species of filamentous cyanobacteria, <em>Nostoc punctiforme</em>, that has the ability to fix nitrogen through the differentiation of regular vegetative cells into nitrogen-fixing heterocysts. These cells are specialised for only nitrogen fixation as the nitrogenases involved are sensitive to oxygen, which is used for cellular respiration.</p>
<p>They're known to form symbiotic relationships with plant species, in which the host plant is able to use the fixed nitrogen from cyanobacteria.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a very important chemical reaction in biology and a highly documented case of symbiosis! Nitrogen is one the most abundant molecules in the atmosphere and necessary for plant metabolism, yet most plants are incapable of obtaining usable nitrogen due to its diatomic state. In a given environment, you'll more often than not find a fungi/plant mutualistic relationship where the fungi (most often rhizobium) will be living at the roots of a plant. The fungi will break down the nitrogen and exchange it with the plants' roots for sugar!</p>
<p>Without this nitrogen&lt;-&gt;sugar exchange, plants as we know it would not have survived and thrived as extensively as they do!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
