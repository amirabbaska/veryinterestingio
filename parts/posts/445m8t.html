		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you are talking about is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockoon" target="_blank">Rockoon</a> and yes - it has been done in past, but so far only for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sounding_rocket" target="_blank">sounding rockets</a>.</p>
<p>There's a Spanish company called <a href="http://www.0ll00.com/" target="_blank">zero2infinity</a> planning to use that concept for <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/zero2infinity-balloon-rocket-launch/34315/" target="_blank">launching</a> nanosatellites in a rocket called <a href="http://bloostar.com/" target="_blank">Bloostar</a>.</p>
<p>The major advantage of this method is that you can use engines with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine_nozzle" target="_blank">nozzle</a> suitable for vacuum right off the bat - no need to have a stage for initial takeoff in dense atmosphere. You also don't have to worry too much about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Q" target="_blank">Max Q</a> cause atmosphere is already very rare at this altitude, so you can have a light fairing and (basically) as high acceleration rate as you want. That makes rocket more efficient, saving fuel and reducing mass. Obviously though - you still need to accelerate to keep your spacecraft in orbit, which is where most of the energy from launch goes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, you would need a very large amount of balloons, which would make things quite complicated on the ground already. And in the air, when you detach the balloons and ignite the rocket, you'll have to do it in such a way that the balloons and all the components used for the connection don't get in the way.</p>
<p>Next issue is the fact that balloons are hard to control. The rocket can end up pretty much anywhere depending on which direction the wind feels like blowing. The actual destination of the rocket is often rather precise, so additional effort has to be put in getting the rocket back in the right direction.</p>
<p>But the biggest issue of all is the fact that getting to space is really quite simple and cheap. The problem is staying in space. In order to get to space and stay there, you have to fly rather high, but mostly really fast to avoid falling back to Earth. The balloons will help somewhat with flying high once you've overcome the issues I mentioned before, but by far the most energy goes into flying really fast and the balloons don't do anything there.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Balloons wouldn't be very effective, for reasons already discussed in this thread. However, we do have a reliable and stable way to get rockets above the thickest part of the atmosphere: airplanes.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_%28rocket%29" target="_blank">Pegasus rocket</a> is drop-launched from a Lockheed L-1011 at 40,000 feet, replacing a large and costly first stage. Although the carrier aircraft only takes the rocket to about 4% of its orbital altitude and 3% of necessary speed, launching the rocket completely out of the troposphere allows for lighter payload fairings (max dynamic pressure is far lower at altitude), cheaper and more efficient rocket nozzles (rockets work more efficiently in lower pressures, and the Pegasus uses fins to steer its first stage instead of a more complex gimbal system), and essentially eliminates the problem of weather delaying launches (the carrier aircraft, which can deal with bad weather far better than a rocket, flies above weather systems before launch).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Source, my wife worked on NASA's LDSD test platform.</p>
<p>Yes, it is more fuel efficient, and for certain applications balloons are excellent at getting payloads quite high up.  When LDSD is tested they balloon it up from a military facility on Kauai to 120,000 feet, then activate spin stabilizing motors, then fire the main engine, pushing it up to 180,000 feet, then fire reverse-spin motors to stop the spin, then test the parachutes in an environment similar to Mars' atmosphere.  This mission was constructed to be as inexpensive as possible while still achieving the goal.</p>
<p>The problem is for larger payloads that have to go higher they simply can't balloon-lift enough mass.  A 1930s Zeppelin like the Hindenburg had an effective cargo capacity of around sixteen tons.  The Apollo Command Service Module <em>by itself</em> weighs over eighteen tons, without any of the rest of the launch vehicle in mind.</p>
<p>It might make more sense to launch from high altitude terrestrial facilities, but few space-capable nations hold territory at low latitude that's also high altitude, and getting supplies to high altitude poses its own challenges, and as the issues in Hawaii with the new telescope show, projects on high altitude peaks often face stiff local opposition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A similar but much more powerful idea is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_loop" target="_blank">launch loop</a>, also known as the <a href="http://launchloop.com/LaunchLoop?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=isdc2002loop.pdf" target="_blank">Lofstrom loop</a> after one of its proponents.</p>
<p>Think about holding a garden hose in your hand while letting it flop.  Then you turn on the water and the hose rears up from the force of the water passing through it.  The launch loop works the same way, only the water is actually iron balls, the faucet is a magnetic accelerator, and the hose is a closed loop with a vacuum inside to minimize energy loss.</p>
<p>The advantage of this is you've gotten past the dense lower atmosphere and most of the way to orbit very efficiently.  You lift payloads up the guy wires.  Then you can launch payloads from the top of the loop with a steam/magnetic catapult (like a carrier) and/or rocket.  Then all you need is a tiny rocket to kick you into a circular orbit.</p>
<p>The cool thing is that unlike other mega-structures it doesn't require any exotic materials.  It would be a huge feat of engineering/construction but all the problems are pretty straightforward and within the reach of today's science.  We could start building one tomorrow if we wanted.  </p>
<p>Lofstrom calculates that a system operating at 300MW would cost about $10 billion up front (less than the cost to develop the SLS rocket system) and at $300/kg it would pay itself back in 1 year.  At 20GW it would cost $30 billion and at $3/kg it would pay itself back in 5 years.  Most rockets are something on the order of $3000/kg, so it would massively decrease the cost of getting stuff into space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
