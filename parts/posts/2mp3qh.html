		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really huge question, but I'll try and be brief. There are a couple of things to keep in mind about Germany; it is one of the largest and most populated states in Western Europe, and it has had a very strong industrial base for many many years.</p>
<p>After WWI, Germany was in pretty bad shape. It owed a ton of money in war reperations. This issue was dealt with by the Nazis basically just refusing to pay them.</p>
<p>More importantly though, Germany might have lost the war, but even the winners were in really rough shape. No one was willing to stand up to the Nazis until it was too late. When they started to remilitarize, no one stepped up because they either thought that the lot they were dealt in WW1 was too harsh, or because they were too war-weary to care. When Germany started to absorb parts of its neighbors, it was justified by claiming that it was done either to protect German nationals, or because the Germans had been invited to do it (which is partly true in some cases). </p>
<p>Further, once WW2 started, the Germans had a couple big benefits. Most of their immediate neighbors were too weak to do much, France and Britain wanted to avoid bloodshed. When they invaded Poland, they got help from the Soviet Union. Once the war really got underway, France folded almost immediately, and the British were pushed off of the continent not long after. France was gone, Britain was technically still at war but couldn't mount an offensive, Italy was an ally, America, Spain, and the USSR were neutral, and much of Central Europe was already under Nazi control. They were able to take most of Europe without much of a fight. </p>
<p>Helping matters even more, Germany benefited from having some pretty revoltionary tactics, scientists, and equipment. In particular, the Germans wrote the book on blitzkrieg and tank warfare, which proved instrumental.</p>
<p>After they lost the war, the country was split into four administrative zones, occupied by the Americans, British, Soviets, and French. The American, British, and French zones were evnetually consolidated to become the country of West Germany, while the Soviet zone became East Germany. The Western Powers poured a ton of resources into rebuilding West Germany and getting them back up to speed (so that they could help fight the Soviets in the event of WW3). Since they're still one of the biggest and most industrial states in Europe, it's only natural that they've had a strong economy ever sense.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, I didn't expect this to blow up. RIP Inbox. Thanks for the gold!</p>
<p>Edit 2: I'm glad that I could help out so many people who had questions on the topic. That said, while I do have a fair bit of knowledge on the subject, I'm hardly an expert. If you want some more in depth and accurate answers, you should go check out r/history. Or bug your teachers/professors for resources on the subject (they love this sort of thing, so it'll probably help your grade too). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of factors mate.</p>
<p>1) World War One did not destroy German infrastructure as it was not fought on German soil. The civilian government surrendered due to food shortage, they had nothing left to eat.</p>
<p>2) The intact infrastructure allowed them to produce. This production was co-opted and secret deals were made with the soviets. Soviets got German experience and the Germans built and sold weapons on Soviet soil which was outside of the jurisdiction of the treaty of Versailles.  </p>
<p>3) Germany has a lot of resources critical to steel production, mainly high quality coal. This is why France wanted some of their coal fields as reparations. The soviet union was going under massive industrialization, including building a huge steel industry which required you guessed it high quality coal to provide the carbon for steel production and of course to fuel the blast furnaces.  The Germans sold and traded the coal  to the Soviets.</p>
<p>4) France was rebuilding itself as it was the battlefield and required German materials to rebuild itself. This need is what allowed German production to continue in the civilian sector, if they had been completely coopted then the French would be screwed as there would be no one to produce for them as they were broke.</p>
<p>5) In the interwar period China was aligned with Germany. This meant that Germany had access to huge deposits of tungsten a metal critical to technology in the first half of the 20th century. The Germans traded tactical, technological and engineering knowledge to the Chinese for tungsten. They then sold said tungsten. The major European supplier of tungsten was Spain which was extremely unstable politically at the time. The Germans then abandoned the Chinese for the Japanese once they had what they needed.</p>
<p>So that lead us up to ww2!</p>
<p>Now they were pummelled in ww2 so what changed? </p>
<p>The soviets again, they became the enemy. The plans were abandoned to turn Germany into an agrarian state and the US invested massive amounts of capital in Germany as a bulwark against to the Soviets and a fear of sovietisation of all of Europe. France still needed coal and steel but this time they formed the European coal and steel community- the precursor to the EU. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am late and this will be buried, but...<br />
ITT everybody talks about german work ethics.</p>
<p>And it is true that from my experience Germans work different to other people.</p>
<p>When we work, we work.</p>
<p>The water-cooler discussions or hanging out at the coffee machine isn't something that happens here. You don't check your phone at work, unless your wife is about to give birth or it is work related.</p>
<p>It's those little things that make a difference.<br />
But this is not because germans are somehow less lazy or less social with their colleagues.</p>
<p>I think it is because we (through our language and education) have a different mentality towards work.<br />
In german we call it Beruf. What you do is your Beruf. Beruf is a short form of the word Berufung which literally means vocation or calling.<br />
So Germans have (through their language) a more personal relationship to what they do.  </p>
<p>There is a big emphasis on being useful. Not necessarily in a pressuring way, more in a way that teaches people to define themselves by what they do and if they do it well.  </p>
<p>Also we are a nation of specialists. We make specialized things with highly trained workers, who don't have to take out huge loans to get the education they need to be the specialized workers the german economy needs.</p>
<p>For example I am an Systemadministrator. In other countries you would have to go to university to get a associates degree or something comparable and have to take out a loan. And when you have finished your degree you still haven't worked with systems in the real world.  </p>
<p>The german educational system works very differently.
I learned my &quot;Beruf&quot; in the german dual apprenticeship system.
That means I as a high school graduate (its a bit different here to but close enough) and university dropout asked for a job as an apprentice in my chosen field.</p>
<p>Those fields have standardized categories and tests. My category is &quot;Fachinformatiker für Systemintegration&quot; (IT-Professional for system-integration)  </p>
<p>I work at the company that took me in and get paid (not much because it is assumed that I live with my parents and some other stuff). Every two weeks I have a week of classes at a trade school for my vocation.</p>
<p>All of this accumulates in a big exam and final project by the Industry- and Trade-chamber.
All of this takes about 3 years.
So Germany gets a highly specialized worker that has work experience and a centralized certificate without being burdened by a lot of debt.</p>
<p>That means that worker can start right into the industry and spend or save his money in the german economy.</p>
<p>I could write a lot more about this but since nobody will read this ill stop here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
