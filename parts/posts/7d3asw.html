		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wormholes can be described by General Relativity. This suggests that a wormhole could exist. However, since the conditions needed for a wormhole to be created are hugely difficult to create - it needs things like 'exotic matter', matter with negative mass or pressure - they are not expected to exist in the universe. If they did, they would be detectable, and this is what this paper is exploring. The paper is not reporting on a detection of a wormhole, rather it is describing a method by which a wormhole, if it did exist, could be detected</p>
<p>When light passes by a massive object, the gravity of the object (or more accurately, the warping of the space around the object) bends the path of the light. The resulting distortion, and the bending itself, is known as gravitational lensing. When light is travelling from a background object to us and is bent by a massive object, the amount by which, and the way in which, the light is lensed tells us about the intervening object. This paper explores what you would see when the lensing object is a wormhole, and describes the tell-tale signature that would result. Should we see such a signal, then this would be proof that wormholes do exist, but it has not yet been observed.</p>
<p>Also, it should be noted that this article is not from Cornell. It is hosted on the Arxiv, a website run by Cornell, where scientists can upload papers for others to view before they are officially published. The authors of this paper work at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to general relativity gravity can be described as a distortion in spacetime. You can kind of imagine it as objects with mass creating  three-dimensional valleys in spacetime that other objects gravitate into.</p>
<p><a href="http://m.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2015/09/spacetime_curvature/15576375-1-eng-GB/Spacetime_curvature_article_mob.jpg" target="_blank">These pictures</a> you often see associated with relativity are a two-dimensional representation of this (since it's impossible to illustrate full four dimensional space on paper)</p>
<p>Now, a really interesting thing happens if you take those formulas of general relativity and introduce objects with negative mass to them. </p>
<p>Those objects (called exotic matter or negative energy) would create a &quot;hill&quot; instead of a &quot;valley&quot; and by having hills and valleys interact you can suddenly create all kinds of interesting spacetime distortions that would allow for stuff like warp drives or wormholes.</p>
<p>The trouble is that no one really knows whether it is possible for exotic matter to exist in first place. There is nothing in science to suggest it can't exist, but there is also nothing to suggest it can either. </p>
<p>Basically there are three possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Someone discovers exotic matter, and we get all kinds of exciting FTL travel (barring practical problems that might or might not arise)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some new discoveries in how mass and energy work show that exotic matter cannot possibly exist.</p>
</li>
<li>Neither of the two happens, and we'll stay in the dark forever.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physicists often investigate wormholes to better understand certain mathematical features of the theory of General Relativity (GR). While GR can be used to describe wormholes, there is no direct observational or experimental evidence to suggest their existence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, GR requires lots ofexotic matter in order to support the existence of wormholes that you can go through. There is no evidence that exotic matter exists, and there are strong arguments against the existence of exotic matter.</p>
<p>Wormholes help physicists to better understand certain mathematical and conceptual features of GR and other speculative theories of gravity, which is why you find them discussed often in the literature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was an article in Scientific American a year or two ago that suggested that the mechanism of quantum entanglement, the reason that spins of particles may be related and necessarily inverse even if separated over great distances is because of a persistent communication through exceptionally tiny interdimensional bridges across spacetime, essentially infinitessimally small wormholes. It would be one plausible explanation of such a phenomenon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They appear in the equations.</p>
<p>The thought process goes like this:</p>
<p>There's stuff and pehnomena that we observe and detect and we want to explain them.</p>
<p>A theory is created of which its mathematical models and equations fit and explain to perfection (sometimes almost to perfection) said phenomena. </p>
<p>Now, the Mathematics in the theory also spew stuff that nobody was looking for or even thought existed (for example black holes or neutrinos or whatever).</p>
<p>So you have a theory that you know it works and is also telling you there's more out there, so you start looking for it. In the case of black holes you know you can't see them (because the physical laws in this Universe don't allow it), but the Mathematics also show that there are signs, hints or footprints you can look for that if detected would mean that there indeed exist blackholes. These have been detected that's how we know now that black holes are real and out there.</p>
<p>Now, in the case of wormholes, they show up in the Mathematics, unfortunately all of them are (apparently) behind an event horizon.</p>
<p>So this means that they should be real, because they appear in a sound and solid theory that has predicted every other thing &quot;without&quot; problem; but as of now there aren't any methods or ways we would be able to observe or detect one, and I don't know (honestly, my knowledge stops here) if any &quot;hints&quot; or &quot;footrpints&quot; have been defined that would demonstrate their physical reality, so we can start looking for them.</p>
<p>EDIT: And then there's string theory which is just mental masturbation. Actually is such good masturbation that almost every theoretical physicist is doing it, and have been going on for around 40 years lol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
