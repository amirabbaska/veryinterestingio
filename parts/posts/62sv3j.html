		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe they're just not very smart. By comparison, ravens and crows not only know what cars are, they know what cars can do. They'll hop a few steps out of the way of that dead squirrel roadkill, wait for the car to drive by, and hop right back to dinner. No fear, no feathery escape, just a casual &quot;Hey Bob, car's coming. Let's move.&quot; </p>
<p>They also understand tire tracks on the highways and will move nuts they can't crack onto the highway so a car can run it over and crack the shells. </p>
<p>They've also been known to follow roads in search of food, knowing that there's probably roadkill along the way.</p>
<p>My guess is, they're also hunting down the squirrels that seem smarter so they don't become a challenger :) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but I think I've once seen a documentary about deer. Apparently they are not really able to estimate the size of something approaching, so for example if a car is so far away that it appears to be as big as a coin, they think it is as big as a coin, so they underestimate the danger and are startled by the sudden growth of the vehicle and also stunned by looking at the headlights so instead of moving on they freeze on their path. Don't know about squirrels though, maybe it could have the same cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
