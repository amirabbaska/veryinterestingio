It begins to occur when the partial pressure of oxygen being breathed is greater than 1.6 atmospheres. Because the pressure at sea level is only 1 atmosphere, even a pure oxygen atmosphere would be breathable to humans on Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the oxygen bleed on my submarine was in the bow compartment. If you paused there and took a big breath on the way by, you would be wide awake before you got to the hatch.<br />
If, on the other hand, you stuck your nose against it and drew a long deep breath, you might go black, your head might spin, and you might have to hang on to the bunks to move about.<br />
Doing the latter too often would eventually result in nosebleeds. But once a day was a bonus for living in the nose. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>35% by what? Weight? Volume? Mole?</p>
<p>Assuming it's by mole, our current atmosphere is only about 21% (by mole) O2, so 35% is definitely breathable. Extremely high oxygen percentages can have a detrimental effect on the human body, but 35% shouldn't be too bad compared to our current atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Patients at the hospital are placed on lower levels of supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula, a pronged device that sits in the nares (nostrils).  It's the plastic thing you see on every patient's nose in TV shows.</p>
<p>The conversion is as follows:
1 liter per minute (lowest whole # value of supplemental O2 by nasal cannula, and the lowest typically used for adult patients) = 24% FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen)</p>
<ul>
<li>2lpm = 27% FiO2</li>
<li>3lpm = 30% FiO2</li>
<li>4lpm = 33% FiO2</li>
<li>5lpm = 35% FiO2</li>
<li>6lpm = 38% FiO2</li>
</ul>
<p>So, an atmosphere of 35% oxygen is approximated today by 5 liters per minute of supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal cannula. To put this in perspective, this is a rather significant amount of oxygen support and is what a patient with very severe COPD might walk around with chronically on out in the community, without ill effects. In the ED or ICU setting, it's just a bit below the level where you would definitely escalate to nonrebreather-level O2 support (a face-mask system delivering ~70% FiO2 and up) or to positive pressure ventilation with BiPAP or intubation, which can deliver a 100% oxygen atmosphere to the patient.  </p>
<p>With 100% O2 and even well below that, you can experience oxygen toxicity, but as noted above there are people with chronic lung disease on 5L per NC (35% FiO2) for years without problems.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are other concerns involved than just oxygen.
What was the atmospheric pressure overall?
What were the balances of other gasses than oxygen, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and carbon monoxide?
By all rights, atmospheric pressures were about four times what they are today. Ouch. Death would occur from vast pressures and toxic levels of gasses that are present only as trace amounts right now.
At current level of 21% oxygen, things don't oxidize nearly as fast as at 35%.
Carbon dioxide, methane, and carbon monoxide  are poisons to us and the environment. It may have been twenty times what it is now. They were a lot more available but were sequestered into things like oil, coal, natural gas. Now that we have let that genie out of the bottle, as those levels rise, limestone and coral are dissolving.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
