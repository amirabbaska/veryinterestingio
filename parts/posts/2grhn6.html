		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It follow the formula for the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1-v^(2)/c^(2)). At 86% the speed of light, you age one year for every two years on Earth, at 99% the speed of light you age one year for every seven years on Earth.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thin you're misunderstanding something here, at near light speed earth will see you moving at near light speed, but looking through a window into the spaceships cabin earth would see that time moved very slowly for the travelers. The closest star systems are 4.5 Ly away, the next closest about 6, but after that you end up with hundreds of stars before you get to 20 light years. Going to these places at near light speed you will get to any of these stars in just above 20 years or less, well within undilated human lifespans on earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
