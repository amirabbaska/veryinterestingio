		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I dont know if anyone actually answered, but here is the real answer. Source: I audit transactions between oilfield companies. I know what they are selling, who they are selling to, and for how much.</p>
<p>When an oil producer begins to drill a new well they have their distributors and clients lined up for that well and they sign contracts and agreements that last the life of that well.</p>
<p>If a well is drilled and oil is $100 a barrel, that price is locked in for the life of that well. It could be 6 months, or 6 years.</p>
<p>Every major producer is still selling to their distributors for well over $100 a barrel. Only a few smaller players have began opening wells at a lower price point.</p>
<p>What happens is when prices are high producers drill more wells than are really needed to meet demand and lock those wells in at a high price. When prices drop drilling stops and they produce from only their high priced wells.</p>
<p>The day to day price of oil is only really relevant to futures traders. Prices need to stay low for several years before any meaningful impact at the pump.</p>
<p>When a politician says they will lower oil prices they are lying. It cant be done in a 4 year term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of &quot;yes, it has gone down&quot;, and &quot;There's a lot of other factors at work&quot;.  Crude Oil is currently around $55 for WTI (West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark price for oil used in the US.), compared with about $140 at its peak.  A barrel of oil is 42 gallons (which, when refined, includes both gasoline as well as petrodiesel, kerosene, heating oil, etc.), so each $1 change in the price of Crude Oil is expected to change gasoline &amp; other refined products by about 2 cents per gallon.</p>
<p>There's been about $80 decrease in the price of oil, so, all things equal, the price of gasoline should have decreased by about $1.60.  It actually has decreased by about $1.20 (Two years ago, I remember paying $3.60 / gallon, and right now, it's $2.35 here - I live in one of the cheapest markets for gasoline, though, so it's likely higher elsewhere).</p>
<p>Why the offset between $1.20 and $1.60?  Well, part of it is that gasoline is pretty inelastic in its demand - a big fancy term that means that we don't change our consumption much when prices change.  People are willing to pay more than $2.00 / gallon, so oil companies can raise their prices without losing too much demand (technically quantity demanded, as demand is the curve).</p>
<p>Another reason is that refineries sometimes go offline, which has the effect of lowering the price of crude (less crude is being used to produce refined products) while raising that of gasoline (less gasoline being produced from crude). Right now, we have a ton of oil being drilled out of the ground, but the amount of refining capacity hasn't gone up by nearly as much.  When oil prices decrease, that lowers the cost for refineries to buy the raw material to process.  But ultimately, what consumers demand is not crude oil - it's gasoline, and the demand for gasoline hasn't decreased nearly as much.  Refineries are going to charge the price that they can on the refined goods side, which need not perfectly correlate with the price for crude oil - the raw material.  This tends to make you really happy if you're a refinery.  But it makes you wonder what's going on to see $55 crude and high gas prices. Oil prices do affect the supply curve for gasoline, as oil is a cost in the production of gasoline.  But the demand side of gasoline also plays into consideration, and people are still buying at [price in your area], so that's what gets charged. </p>
<p>There's also the phenomenon that when prices fall, gasoline prices at the retail level don't fall as quickly or as hard - there's a saying that prices tend to shoot up like a rocket and fall like a feather.  From the perspective of a retailer, you don't want to charge so little that you lose money, so you raise prices quickly when your costs increase.  But when costs fall, consumers are going to be happy with any price decrease, so you don't lower prices by as much, and your margins increase.</p>
<p>So, where does the rest of the cost of gasoline come from?</p>
<p>Mostly the cost to ship the oil, refine &amp; process it, and then distribute it to wholesalers and then to retail (and remember, those refiners are enjoying fat margins right now because their costs are low and their consumers will pay).  There's also going to be 30-60 cents of gasoline tax, depending on which state you live in.  Surprisingly, the retail markup is usually just a couple of percent - it's a very thin margin product designed to get you into the store and buy the overpriced items in the &quot;convenience&quot; store.</p>
<p>TL; DR version: Crude Oil Prices are only one part of the picture.  Taxes &amp; Refinery costs are other big portions of the cost of gasoline, and refineries can charge more for gas despite lower prices for crude oil and increase their profit margins because consumers will pay for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't. <a href="http://www.GasBuddy.com/gb_retail_price_chart.aspx?city1=USA%20Average&amp;city2=&amp;city3=&amp;crude=y&amp;tme=60&amp;units=us" target="_blank">The difference between $140/barrel (~$3.90) and $55/barrel (~$2.75) is $1.15 per gallon.</a> That is a 29% difference. This means that each dollar change in crude price affects the price of gas by about 1.35 cents.</p>
<p>This is because crude price is only part of the end cost of gas. There is the cost to refine, transport, taxes (in the <a href="http://www.californiagasprices.com/tax_info.aspx" target="_blank">US, 23.8 cents per gallon is just tax on average</a>), company profits, etc. Those things do not change with the price of crude. There is a common misconception that the price of materials should be directly related to the end price of a product. It is only part of the equation. Every time you hear someone say &quot;The iPhone costs 10 cents to make but we pay $600. Why?&quot;, you know this person knows little about the economics of business and should probably take a micro-econ class.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="http://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=oil_refining" target="_blank">Based on the numbers here</a>, the cost of crude when gas was $3.90 was about 3.18 per gallon (margin of 48.2 cents after tax). When it was $2.75, the cost for the crude used was about $1.25 (about $1.26 margin after taxes). <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-31/exxon-profit-rises-as-refining-boosted-by-lower-crude" target="_blank">Refineries make more money when oil is cheap</a> even though consumer prices are low. We don't pay the same price, but we possibly could pay less if the market would demand it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are offering some very reasonable explanations, and I don't want to undermine them (because many commenters are smarter and more familiar with the industry than I am). But I will say this because I think it's important: Oil companies don't charge what's &quot;fair,&quot; as if they do the work on a calculator and determine the price that way. They charge what they can get. They determine the price based on how high they can make it before returns start to taper off. Because of government and market controls, there isn't always a lot of wiggle room there... but you need to know that part of the reason prices don't go down when oil costs do is because they know consumers will keep paying the higher price. And while there are many factors at play, that's really the bottom line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure I can explain it like I would to a 5 year old, but I'll do my best to simplify.</p>
<p>First of all, there's a large disconnect in the price of gasoline to the price of crude.  It trades hands through many companies by the time you put it into your car.  Sure, crude is the base cost, but there are many other factors, the major one being gasoline has it's own supply and demand market separate from crude.  It's very possible gasoline can go up while crude goes down.</p>
<p>Also, there are multiple hands in the pie by the time you buy the gasoline.  It's true that there are Exxon/BP/Chevron stations around, so it is logical they would extract the product, refine it, transport it, and then sell it at the stations.  However, this isn't really the case.  Most of their gas stations are branding agreements but they are privately owned.  </p>
<p>Aside from them, the most typical way you get gasoline, is some company you have never heard of pulls it from the ground, sells it to someone who will refine it, who then ships it somewhere else on a pipeline, where someone else will buy it and then either sell it to a gas station, or take it to their own gas station and sell it there.  Three or four different companies are touching the product.</p>
<p>You also have to factor in that a LOT of these companies are hedging the product, so when prices are high they are locking in higher prices for a longer period of time, so even though the spot price of crude may drop, they will try to sell it as high as possible to prevent cutting into their profits (although this also works in reverse).</p>
<p>Source: Work in the industry.  I sell about 15 thousand barrels of gasoline a day.</p>
<p>tl;dr So yeah, its very disconnected from crude, has it's own supply/demand markets, and usually passes through many companies.  Gasoline typically isn't a very high margin product for oil companies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
