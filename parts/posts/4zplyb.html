		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: so from what I understood from the large amounts of well composed and explained responses, is that aircraft manufacturers build the plane, and it's then sold to airline companies. Said company can adjust the space in between seats because they are on rails and it allows them to trade leg room for more seats and vice versa. More seats equals more profit, while more space means more comfort for passengers. </p>
<p>Thanks for the replies, guys!</p></div></div>
