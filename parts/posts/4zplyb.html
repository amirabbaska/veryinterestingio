		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: so from what I understood from the large amounts of well composed and explained responses, is that aircraft manufacturers build the plane, and it's then sold to airline companies. Said company can adjust the space in between seats because they are on rails and it allows them to trade leg room for more seats and vice versa. More seats equals more profit, while more space means more comfort for passengers. </p>
<p>Thanks for the replies, guys!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://airchive.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/EVERETT-2013-777-RAW-FUSELAGE-1024x680.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is an image of a piece of Boeing 777 fuselage. Those holes are the windows, and the circular ribs are structural elements. As you can see, the windows and the reinforcement around them take up pretty much all the space between ribs.</p>
<p>That's why they won't line up. The seat placement is done by the airline, and the seats are on rails. The window placement is dictated by the aircraft structure, and changing it would be time-consuming and expensive (both to do in the first place and to get regulatory approval for the variant). An airline can no more specify window spacing than they can specify wingspan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The seats are not designed in at the factory. They are movable and installed on rails; their position changes over time, but the airlines tries to squeeze in as many as possible. Meanwhile, window positions are predetermined by the design of the plane's structure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The fusilage and general structure of the aircraft will be decided before the interior is finalised. Windows are a potential structural weakpoint so they will not be changed to match the seat layout as the aircraft would be heavier or weaker while carrying more people as well as this it is not a legal requirement to change the windows to match the seats. While features such as the emergency oxygen are legally mandated so this aspect of a redesigned cabin will match seats.</p>
<p>During one of my projects where I had to design a passenger aircraft cabin to maximise passenger comfort for 150 passengers. I designed multiple layouts, becasue to be honest in the modern airline industry passenger comfort is not a concern, so the aircraft I designed could carry 150 people in the lap of luxury, all first class, with 20 cabin crew and 6 toilets on board (cabin crew and toilets are features often overlooked while having great effect on passenger comfort, and for the latter they are simply too small, especially for people in wheelchairs). The same aircraft design could carry up to 350 people in 'sardine mode' where there were only 3 crew and 2 toilets, which is roughtly equivalent to the current budget airline numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
