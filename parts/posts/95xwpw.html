		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tl;dr: If you're near Earth's orbit, you're already way too close. You'd need to drift outward quite a bit.</p>
<p>On Earth, if you leave something lying in the sun indefinitely, it will heat up until the heat it loses to the surrounding air (and the ground) is balanced with the heat it absorbs from the sun. In space, it works the same way, except that without air, the only way for an object to lose heat is by radiation (infrared, at normal body temperatures).</p>
<p>If we want to keep our body temperature roughly constant, the heat we radiate needs to balance out the heat we absorb from the sun plus the heat generated by our own metabolism.</p>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.physlink.com/education/askexperts/ae420.cfm" target="_blank">a page estimating our own power output as 100W</a>. Let's say we are a perfect blackbody radiator with a surface area of 2m^2 and our skin were to be 307K - we're in &quot;spherical cow&quot; territory here, but this should be the right order of magnitude.</p>
<p>The power our skin radiates is then given by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law" target="_blank">Stefan-Boltzman law</a> as 5.67e-8 Wm^(-2)K^(-4), or 5.67e-8 <em> 2 </em> 307^4 W = about 1000W. (So the good news is, we're losing more heat than we produce on our own, even without air-cooling. Without the sun, we'd freeze instead of overheating.)</p>
<p>So how much sun do we need? This one is a bit more complicated, because it depends on how we're oriented. The bigger our cross-section facing the sun, the more we absorb.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_luminosity" target="_blank">total power output of the sun is 3.828e26 W</a>. To get around 1000W of that, we need to capture 1 part in 3.828e23. So if we present a cross-section of about 1m^2, then our distance should be the radius of a sphere with a surface area of 3.828e23 m^2.</p>
<p>Result: 1.75e11 meters, or about 9.7 light minutes. To give you a picture, Earth's and Mars's orbits are about 8.3 and 12.5 light minutes from the sun on average, so we'd have to go (very, very roughly) a third of the way from Earth to Mars orbit to feel comfortable.</p>
<p>(Not double-checked; it's entirely possible there's a massive error in the above calculation, on top of all the ballpark guessing.)</p>
<p>Edit: Mind you, the ballpark guessing already introduces some <em>wild</em> inaccuracy. If we drop the cross section to 0.5m^2, suddenly we're closer to 6.9 light minutes. And we're not perfect blackbody radiators, anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The unsatisfying answer is &quot;it depends.&quot; Here on Earth, the temperature you experience is largely determined by the ambient temperature of the matter (air) around you. But in space, you would be in near vacuum. The random particles around you might have some temperature, but there simply won't be enough of them to transfer a meaningful amount of energy to or from you. </p>
<p>Instead, your temperature will be determined by radiation: how much sunlight are you absorbing, and how much infrared are you radiating away from yourself. When the magnitude of both of these are equal, that will be your equilibrium temperature. These will be determined by your albedo (e.g. what color are you wearing), your geometry (e.g. how fat are you), how well heat is conducted within your body, and how much heat are you generating yourself. In other words, it's complicated. But, to give you some idea, an astronaut in a normal space suit in Earth orbit can't spend much time in direct sunlight without getting cooked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Over at <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar\_1/" target="_blank">NASA</a>, they mention that the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>temperature of the orbiting Space Station's Sun-facing side would soar to 250 degrees F (121 C),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so I guess if you have a clear view of the sun, you'd need to be further away than the Earth is.</p>
<p>I also <a href="https://www.space.com/14719-spacekids-temperature-outer-space.html" target="_blank">found this</a>, which states</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the Earth's distance from the sun, a space thermometer with roughly half its surface is absorbing sunlightwould register 45 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So temperature doesn't quite work the same way in space that it does on Earth because space is a vacuum with few particles floating around bumping into things, transferring energy that we feel as a temperature.</p>
<p>When people design spacecraft they actually have to account for temperature differences between parts that are illuminated and parts that are shaded, because parts in shadow get quite cold. So if you were floating toward the sun, at some point the front of you would be at Earth temperature, but the back of you would still be ~ interplanetary space temperature, depending on how good your body tissue is at conducting heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energy density of photons can be converted to temperature using E = 4/c sigma T\^4, where c is speed of light and sigma is the Stephan-Boltzmann constant.</p>
<p>For T = 300 K (about room temperature) this is about 6e-6 J/m\^3</p>
<p>The total energy released by the sun per second is 3.8*10\^26 J/s</p>
<p>so at a distance of R from the sun, the energy per square meter is:</p>
<p>3.8*10\^26/4pi R\^2</p>
<p>To go from radiant flux to energy density we divide by c (3*10\^8 m/s) \~= 1e17/R\^2 J/m\^3</p>
<p>6 R\^2 = 1e23 gives R = 1.29*10\^11 meters, or 0.86 AU.  This is not surprisingly close to the distance of the Earth from the Sun (1 AU).  We are hotter than our distance would suggest due to greenhouse effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
