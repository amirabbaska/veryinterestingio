<p>I know the iron lung is an outdated and generally obsolete piece of medical equipment, so why can't we feasibly remove someone from it and simply hook them up to a normal positive pressure ventillator?</p>
<p>Is it like the 'car-crash-victim-pinned-against-a-tree' kinda scenario wherein removing them would immediately kill them? Or is it just lack of money on their part?</p>
<p>I have no medical knowledge so apologies if this a simple question</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having worked with people in iron lungs, it can easily be done by switching that person to NIPPV. The issue would be one of comfort, because they would have to wear a mask to ventilate. There is still negative pressure equipment that can be used, and is less bulky than the iron lung. Maintenance of the iron lung is difficult because of the lack of parts available. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Negative pressure ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as central hypoventilation syndrome, in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no autonomic control of breathing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Negative pressure is normal way of lung inflation. Positive airway pressure interferes with heart function by reducing venous return which limits the operating range. Also, a mask must be used which interferes with speech.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow. I had no idea this was going on. Given the duration those folks have been on this device, their ability to use respiratory muscles independently is probably nearly nil. Imagine they'd need invasive ventilation--I'd guess a tracheostomy with ventilator--in order to maintain respiratory health. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
