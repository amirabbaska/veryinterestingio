<p>A sonic boom is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave" target="_blank">shock wave</a> that travels outward from the plane.  It follows the plane wherever it goes.  When the plane flies by a person on the ground, the shock wave will hit that person (and be heard as a &quot;boom&quot;) shortly after.  Since the boom moves at the speed of sound, and the plane is moving faster than that, a cone shape develops, with the plane at the point of the cone.  <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Sonic_boom.svg" target="_blank">Here's an example image.</a></p>
<p>As for speed vs. loudness, it's actually the opposite of what you'd expect.  The faster the plane, the skinnier and pointier the cone.  As a result, the energy of the shock wave gets spread out over a longer distance.  Additionally, super-fast aircraft tend to fly at much higher altitudes, meaning the boom travels through a lot more air before it reaches the ground, dissipating it.  So sonic booms actually get <em>quieter</em> the faster the plane flies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is something I was actually wondering about a couple of weeks ago.  I did a bunch of google searches that helped, but I'm certainly no scientist.</p>
<p>Basically, the way I understand it is that when an object is moving through the air, it sends ripples of outward pressure in all directions traveling at the speed of sound. So when a plane (or anything else) travels faster than the speed of sound, or Mach 1, the pressure ripples that are being pushed out by the front of the plane are now traveling behind the plane creating a pressure that pushes away from the back of the plane.  Also, planes moving below the sound barrier have positive pressure pushing out from the front of the plane that is being met with positive pressure from the plane's previous pressure waves.  The shockwave comes from a sudden change of pressure.  This happens in any speed after Mach 1 (speed of sound) because the air in front of the plane is neutral and the front of plane has high positive pressure which is a sudden change pressure.  This is actually just one of two shockwaves though.  The second wave comes from the back of the plane having, I think, neutral pressure and the air behind it having high negative pressure.  We hear it as one boom instead of two because they are both so sudden.  </p>
<p>This sudden pressure difference will exist for any speed over Mach1.  It is constant, but we hear it as one sudden boom, because the shockwave being emitted from the plane passes us.  I've read that if a plane were travel at a speed greater than Mach1 towards a spot that you were standing on the ground and then swoop up before kamikazeing itsslf into you, you would hear a continuous boom.  Additionally, the pressure diffenence is going to increase at higher speeds so, holding all else fixed, the shockwave will be more powerful and louder the greater the speed.  However, planes moving faster are also going to most likely be traveling at altitudes further away from the ground in thinner air which would diminish the effect.   Additionally, the shockwave occupies a cone-shaped area that becomes a thinner and more conenctrated cone the faster the plane travels.</p>
<p>I apologize if that isn't what you were looking for.  The last part is not something I understand perfectly, but I feel like I got a pretty good idea about the other stuff.  I hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

And an observer on shore sees a big splash after the boat passes, but another observer just a little ways down the shoreline will see it at another instance after the boat passes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound travels in all directions. When an object is moving it tends to compress the sound waves in front of it so they arrive closer together to an observer; IE the doppler shift or raising and dropping in pitch of a sound as something speeds past you. </p>
<p>As the speed of sound is approached, the sound waves become so compressed that they arrive at the same time as the object creating the sound. In other words, the object is traveling as fast as the sound is, and the sound waves all arrive stacked one on top of the other and hit the observer all at once. </p>
<p>If the object were to be going faster than the speed of sound, then it would arrive before the sound did, and the sound waves would start spreading apart again, but in the opposite direction they did as it approached the speed of sound. The maximum volume and impact is reached when as many of the sound waves are compressed together as possible. </p>
<p>When it breaks the sound barrier the sound ahead and the sound behind end up in the same place in the air and BAM it hits you all at once. As it kept going faster and faster eventually the sound would stretch out behind the object with no sound in front of the object. IE the sound wouldn't all arrive at once again but this makes little difference to an observer though as it is still quite loud.</p>
