		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first clocks were sun dials, and originally the duration of a day was divided into 12 equal segments by the Egyptians.  These became hours, and obviously over time we discovered ways of counting the hours during night time as well.</p>
<p>The Babylonians divided the hour in 60 minutes, but it took a long time before minutes could be accurately measured.</p>
<p>In Medieval times in Europe a wide variety of mechanical devices were created that mimicked the sun dial (which is what decided which direction clockwise was). The mechanical clocks started to measure out minutes, although they were frequently inaccurate especially at this level of precision.</p>
<p>In the 1600s Christiaan Huygens invented the pendulum clock, and this was the first device that could accurately and reliably measure minutes.</p>
<p>Over time the pendulum clocks were improved and made more accurate, <strong>it was only at this point that we were able to measure seconds</strong>.</p>
<p>Around this time we began to redefine time. Previously time was based on the Earth rotation, the passage of the sun across the sky, as reflected by the sun dials of old.  With these new mechanical devices we were able to have a more accurate way of measuring time.</p>
<p>For a while a second was defined as a fraction of a year,  1/31,556,925.9747</p>
<p>It wasnt until the invention of atomic clocks that we settled upon the now standard length of time elapsed by a second.  Technically a second is defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We chose the caesium-133 atom because it has an extremely regular periods.  And we chose that 9.1 billion number because it was extremely close to the accepted length of a second at the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the invention and initial spread of the second is what you are asking about, seconds minutes and hours were invented as timekeeping units by ancient Babylonian mathematicians.  The reason there are 60 minutes and 60 seconds is because Babylon's numbering system used a base of 60 instead of a base of 10.  This is also why we have 360 degrees for a circle.  </p>
<p>Babylon was one of the first empires to attempt to standardize measurements in history.  The staying power of the second has much to do with the fact that it is just a very old concept that no one saw fit to replace.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The definition of 1 second is &quot;the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom&quot;.</p>
<p>With the development of the atomic clock in the early 1960s, it was decided to use atomic time as the basis of the definition of the second, rather than the revolution of the Earth around the Sun.</p>
<p>Following several years of work, Louis Essen from the National Physical Laboratory (Teddington, England) and William Markowitz from the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) determined the relationship between the hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium atom and the ephemeris second. Using a common-view measurement method based on the received signals from radio station WWV, they determined the orbital motion of the Moon about the Earth, from which the apparent motion of the Sun could be inferred, in terms of time as measured by an atomic clock. They found that the second of ephemeris time (ET) had the duration of 9,192,631,770 Â± 20 cycles of the chosen caesium frequency. As a result, in 1967 the Thirteenth General Conference on Weights and Measures defined the SI second of atomic time as stated above.</p>
<p>This SI second, referred to atomic time, was later verified to be in agreement, within 1 part in 1010, with the second of ephemeris time as determined from lunar observations (the previous SI for 1 second)</p>
<p>Although, for specialized purposes, a second may be used as a unit of time in time scales where the precise length differs slightly from the SI definition. One such time scale is UT1, a form of universal time. The SI second is not the 'legal standard' for timekeeping throughout the world, only that &quot;over the years UTC [which ticks SI seconds] has become either the basis for legal time of many countries, or accepted as the de facto basis for standard civil time </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding differs slightly from others posters. The Sumerians (predecessors to the Babylonians) had a numerical system based on 60 as opposed to ours based on 100 (tens, decimals, whatever you want to call it).</p>
<p>Their system of 60 naturally resulted in their measuring of time based on 60.</p>
<p>Their system originated in using one hand to count to 12, so I doubt the claims that it was based on breaths or heartbeats.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The convention for hours and minutes started with Sumerians, Akkadians, Assyrians, Babylonians, and Egyptians in Mesopotamia. These peoples ruled most of Asia Minor and the Mediterranean ring until the Greeks, followed by the Romans. The Greeks absorbed it readily and furthered the reach of these conventions in their trade routes, including the Vedic spread into India. The Romans spread that even further, and then Christiandom after that spread it further yet.</p>
<p>In the ninth century, after Islam had been established, religious reformers reincorporated many of the ideas from the Greek traditions, which now firmly was based on hours and minutes. Probably the last Eurasian cultures to absorb the convention of hours and minutes were in the Far East, assisted by trade routes through India. </p>
<p>Once the world was firmly established with hours and minutes, the rest was coasting. The second was introduced more or less as an afterthought, though it had been used sporadically throughout the previous centuries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
