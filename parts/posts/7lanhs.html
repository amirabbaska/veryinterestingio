That's what freedom is all about - the ability to (within legality) do and say what you want - but also the responsibility of the consequences of those actions regardless of whether you think you deserve them or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're mixing up public reaction and legal issues.</p>
<p>Both physical businesses &amp; online businesses are <strong>legally</strong> allowed to refuse service for &quot;any or no reason&quot; (with the exception of legally protected things like race or religion).</p>
<p>When Twitter bans some white supremacist, they're <em>in no legal trouble</em> for it, they're simply facing <strong>negative public opinion</strong>.  There are no legal consequences of this act.  A local business could easily face the same sort of backlash, the Internet just creates a way for the small minority of people who care to be very vocal.</p>
<p>You need to remember that your whole idea of what's &quot;popular&quot; is broken by the scale of the Internet.  When you're in a school of 500 kids, 20 people doing something is a lot of people.  If you're in a city of 1,000,000 people, those same 20 are easily ignored - you'd need hundreds, if not thousands, of people to show up at a protest for it to make any sort of impact.  When you scale up to the hundreds of millions of people online, 5-10 thousand people is a <em>completely insignificant group</em> - even if you instinctively think it's a lot of people that really care (add in the fact that retweeting something takes a <em>lot</em> less effort and commitment than actually showing up at a protest).</p>
<p>So, the online outrage machine you see in action when Twitter bans some neo-nazi is really the equivalent to 2-3 angry guys sitting outside a restaurant in your home town with signs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physical businesses can be subject to significant backlash (= lawsuits that go to the Supreme Court) if they deny services to people for illegal reasons.  You are incorrect in your presumption that a sign saying &quot;We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone&quot; actually means that doing that is legal.  It's just a sign, and signs can say untrue things in a free speech country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, physical businesses CAN'T deny service &quot;for any reason&quot;, at least not legally. Second, they often do receive public backlash for their decisions and policies, including who they do and do not wish to serve. Public backlash is not unique to online services or restricted to them in any way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many legal reasons to deny service to somebody... like harassing other users. Both Reddit and restaurants/bars/stores ban people for &quot;uncivil&quot; behavior all the time. Or the person has a history of non-payment/theft or there's suspicion that the person is using a stolen credit card, fake ID, or doing something else &quot;sketchy&quot;. Steam and other gaming sites ban people for this sort of thing (which is sometimes controversial), physical stores can and do this as well.</p>
<p>It is illegal to refuse service based on race, gender, age, religion, and a few other protected aspects of the person's identity-- in the United States at least. It's controversial right now whether homosexuality is one of the items you <em>can't</em> deny people service for.</p>
<p>The uproar is closely related to who is the victim and how motivated they are to make a big deal out of it.</p>
<p>I'd say most gay people who are denied service because they're gay are happy to not give their money to the business, and never go there again. But every once in a while they want to correct the injustice that exists, and you get a court case.</p>
<p>The internet is a great venue for loud, widespread (but not always very effective) outrage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
