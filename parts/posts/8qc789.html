		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a relatively sudden shift. </p>
<p>When hydrogen in the core runs out, the radiative pressure that's keeping the star puffed up disappears, and it starts collapsing under it's own gravity. </p>
<p>This creates tremendous heat and pressure in the core, allowing the fusion of helium. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This doesn’t happen all at once.  Just because the core is starting to burn helium doesn’t meant the star is “out” of hydrogen.  It just doesn’t have enough left in its core to fully resist gravity.  But most of the star’s outer layers are still made of hydrogen, and the burst of heat from the helium burning core can cause fusion to occur in a hydrogen “shell” around the core which wouldn’t be able to normally.  Stars actually build up layers of burning elements this way all the way outwards, with each layer fusing lighter elements at progressively lower temperatures and pressures.  Silicon, oxygen, neon, carbon, etc.  Even supergiant stars starting to fuse iron in their cores, with only minutes to live, are still burning hydrogen in their outer layers at the moment they die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In some stars there's a <em>helium flash</em>. For a few minutes the helium fusion in the core releases as much energy as an entire galaxy. (This energy is absorbed and dispersed by the star's outer layers so it's not visible from outside, unlike a supernova.)</p>
<p>This occurs because the core is degenerate matter, supported by quantum mechanical effects, and not by thermal pressure. This means that helium fusion initiates and the star's core heats up but doesn't at first expand, which makes the fusion go even faster. Only once it heats up enough that thermal pressure causes the core to expand does the fusion rate slow due to lower density and the helium flash ends.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
