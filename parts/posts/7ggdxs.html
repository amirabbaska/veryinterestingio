		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most lip balms (Chapstick is actually a specific brand name) have two or three functions.</p>
<p>The first and main function is to create  a hydrophobic (waterproof) barrier on your lips to prevent evaporative loss of water from the exposed cells. Usually petrolatum or beeswax is used. That water loss kills cells while changing their shape and size which creates the hardening, cracking, bleeding, and pain of chapped lips.</p>
<p>All lip balms will provide some UV light protection and many modern brands can provide very significant protection (SPF 50+). This simply helps keep those exposed cells healthy and stops what could be a secondary danger to those cells.</p>
<p>Some lip balms which are usually labeled as &quot;medicated&quot; contain mild analgesics. These can be effective in reducing the pain of chapped lips but some physicians and researchers are concerned that preventing the pain may cause people to not notice when damage is increasing. Also, the analgesic effect will run out well before your lips heal leading to a simple &quot;dependence&quot; on constant reapplication to avoid pain. It may be wise to avoid these balms unless your chapped lips have reached the point where pain is affecting your life.</p>
<p>Bonus trivia: lip balms are not compatible with latex condoms. Take care when the two may come in contact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water is a polar molecule. Lipids (fats) in chapsticks are non-polar. Polar and non-polar don’t mix so applying a non-polar layer on top of the cells in your lips prevents water from leaving your cells. This keeps your lips from drying out and becomming chapped. </p>
