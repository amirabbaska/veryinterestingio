<li>Your organs are in your torso, which are critical to keep warm. </li>
<li>Your legs are doing more work than your torso, so they will keep warm naturally. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surviving cold weather is just a factor of heat loss vs heat production. Your body is always producing heat, and it loses heat through the surface area of your skin. If you are exercising, you generate more heat, and you can tolerate a net heat loss for a period of time before it becomes an issue depending how fast you lose it. So, if you think of your surface area of your skin and decide to insulate 50% of it, you might reduce heat loss in that 50% by 80%. This could increase the amount of time you can spend outside in 30F weather from &lt; 5 min to over a hour. It's a huge change because only the net heat change matters.</p>
<p>So, it just comes down to convenience. It's super convenient to put a coat on, but it's a lot of work to put on thermals over your legs, feet, hands, head, etc... If you look at people who have to spend an extended amount of time in cold weather, they always layer up everything because even a paper thin insulative layer can reduce heat loss by 30-50%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
