		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With most laundry detergents today advertising new and better formulas all the time, how much progress has there really been in the long term? Is it a lot easier to get clothes clean and stain-free today than it was, for example, in the sixties or the eighties?</p>
<p>The reason I'm asking, is that I rarely see any unremovable stains or other problems with my clothes after a single wash in a 40C cycle - perhaps I see a problematic stain only once or twice a year. (This is with the exception of old clothes I use for yard work or car repair, which I don't expect to get clean at all). Yet, all the ads make it seem like stains are a huge issue - so is this just marketing BS, or is it something that would have been the case some time ago?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much the detergent. It's the fabrics. Our clothing material is so much better at preventing stains. It's also why colors don't run nearly as much as they used to. The fabrics are better at holding color and preventing new colors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are now able to go to really cold environments, pull out the microbes, sequence their DNA, and search for better detergents that they make that work in cold water.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern detergents are actually weaker now than they have been previously.</p>
<p>There was a very strong detergent in the 80s that was far more effective than they are now. The issue however is that detergents also damage the fabric they are cleaning. As this detergent was so strong it kept creating holes in the clothes it was cleaning and was ultimately pulled from sale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
