These are known as bunch grasses. So the answer to your question is sort of, &quot;it's both!&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept of individual gets kind of fuzzy when talking about grass.  The very word means &quot;not dividable&quot;... but grass can often be easily divided, since many kinds of grass grow as clumps which send out runners that form new clumps.</p>
<p>Some useful terms for dealing with this problem are &quot;genet&quot;, which refer to the whole genetically identical plant that spread by asexual propagation from one original seed, and &quot;ramet&quot; which refers to one complete plant unit, eg a single clump of grass with roots and leaves.</p>
<p>In your lawn you probably have a lot of genets..you could test by genetic testing...and each group of leaves emerging from a single cluster in the ground is a ramet</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Then there are cultivars of creeping grass. Bermuda grass in particular has genetically distinct, superior cultivars. You can buy whole rolls of the stuff that is genetically the same. Aaaand it will be the same as the golf course, hoa, or park that also purchased the superior cultivar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the grass species. </p>
<p>Some grasses are individual plants grown close together (annual rye grass, for example).</p>
<p>Some grasses spread through rhizomes (roots that spread below the soil surface that can generate leaves that extend to the surface), and stolons (shoots that spread above the soil surface that send leaves up to gather sunlight and roots below the soil surface to gather nutrients and water).</p>
<p>At golf courses that have Bermuda grass greens/tees/and/or fairways, verticutting is used frequently to boost turf density.</p>
<p>Verticutting is the act of using blades to cut downward into the soil/turf coverage profile in order to lift organic matter (grass clippings) that have been absorbed beneath the surface of the ground up and out, to improve drainage, water and nutrient percolation, and  gas exchanges. This increases the health of the turf that is there already, but...</p>
<p>Verticutting makes many new plants from one plant.</p>
<p>Let's break it down. Hypothetically, let's say one bermuda grass plant can spread 2 feet. If you verticut that one 2' plant, you can generate 24-32 new individual plants that can also spread 2 feet (depending on how close the blades are).</p>
<p>Now, one plant that covers 80-90 square inches is now  enough plants to cover almost 2400 square inches.</p>
<p>If you are using an annual blue/bentgrass mix for your greens (depending on the bentgrass variety), the only way to increase turf density is to add more seed, to grow more plants in the specified area.</p>
<p>TL/Dr: It depends on the grass species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer the second question: I assume you mean &quot;they were once the same organism but then were separated&quot; versus &quot;they originated from different seeds&quot;. To answer this, you need to know something about their genetics: the former are genetically identical, the latter not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
