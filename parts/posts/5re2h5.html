		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's not too much to prove, 2 is practically defined to be 1+1. Define zero, define the successor function, define 1, define 2, define addition and compute directly. </p>
<p>Eg: One of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms" target="_blank">Peano Axioms</a> is that 0 is a natural number. Another is that there is a function S(n) so that if n is a number, then S(n) is also a number. We define 1=S(0) and 2=S(1). Addition is another couple axioms, which give it inductively as n+0=n and n+S(m)=S(n+m). 1+1=1+S(0)=S(1+0)=S(1)=2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It doesn't have to be.  Instead of a counting system: 1, 2, 3, etc., you could have 1, 1+1, 1+1+1, etc.  Thinking about this is at the start of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(philosophy_of_mathematics\)" target="_blank">mathematical formalism</a> and has applications such as how we can prove that a computer algorithm or even a computer system does what we specified it to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Math is nothing more than a set of definitions. That is to say: it is completely <em>a priori</em>; you don't need experiences of the world to prove claims.</p>
<p>Whatever 1 may be, I define 2 as being 1+1. If I then define 4 as 2+2, it follows undoubtedly that 4 also equals 1+1+1+1.</p>
<p>If I then define 3 as being equal to 1+1+1, it follows just as certainly that 3 also equals 1+2, and that 4 equals 2+1+1 and 3+1.</p>
<p>The real questions are: what is 1, and what is +? That is to say: math is an exercise of <em>deductive</em> reasoning: we first establish rules, we then establish input, and then we follow the lead and see where it goes (deduction).</p>
<p>More technically put:</p>
<p>If we experience a lot of facts (&quot;I've only ever seen white swans&quot;) and from that (falsely) conclude a general rule (&quot;All swans are white&quot;), then we have <em>induced</em> this general rule from a collection of facts. (This is faulty because generalisations are faulty by default, but that's a story for another time.)</p>
<p>Maths does not do this: it would require experiences. Instead of <em>inducing</em>, what Maths does is assume <em>axioms</em>—it assumes general rules arbitrarily, and works with those until better axioms are provided (this is a department of philosophy, incidentally, called logic, and logicians spend lifetimes (dis)proving axioms of maths).</p>
<p>From these axioms (such as the definition of +, the definition of 1, and the fact that 1+1=2, etc.), all else follows. All you have to do is follow the lead.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Maths is <em>a priori</em>, and thus does not work based on experiences but rather on arbitrary definitions called <em>axioms</em>, from which you <em>deduce</em> the next steps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This reminded me of a post on r/math where a question was posed on whether there was a case where 2+2=5. </p>
<p>There was an answer that I found brilliant in a way that it really conveyed that math is,as people already pointed out in this thread, just a set of definitions upon which we agree in order to better understand the behaviour and the relations within our surroundings. Maybe you should tackle your students' imagination with something similar.</p>
<p>Quoting the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let 2 := | | | because it has two gaps in it, and + be concatenation.</p>
<p>Then 2 + 2 = | | | | | |, which has five gaps.</p>
<p>Therefore, 2 + 2 = 5.</p>
