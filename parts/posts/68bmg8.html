		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no concept of 'more hydrating'. Why? Because hydrating means provide your body with water, and it happens either way whether you're drinking bottled water, sea water or even piss. It's just marketing language. </p>
<p>However, sports drinks come in various electrolyte concentrations that can help your body depending on when you want to drink:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>hypotonic drinks have a lower electrolyte concentration than your blood. Since the electrolyte concentration in the cells is higher than the blood/sports drink and water always flows to the compartment with the highest salt concentration (osmosis), the water goes into the cells and the body is most efficiently hydrated. Hypotonic drinks work the best before an event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>isotonic drinks have the same electrolyte concentration as the blood, which is ideal during/after exercise. You want to replace the fluids/electrolytes that you've lost by sweating. Most of the time isotonic drinks also contain carbohydrates to provide the body some extra fuel and absorb the electrolytes more efficiently (electrolyte/water transport channels in the small intestine work better in presence of glucose).</p>
</li>
<li>hypertonic drinks contain high glucose/high electrolytes(/protein). The goal isn't necessarily rehydrating the body, but replenish glycogen stores (a form of glucose stores in muscle tissue) and electrolyte levels. Works best after an intense workout.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>edit</strong> I got some flak for my explanations not being 100% correct, which is true. When explaining the human body as simplistic as possible you can't have anything right, people forget it's an ELI5 and sometimes you have to leave certain parts out in order to make the subject comprehensive for someone who doesn't know much about the human body. If you want an explanation that covers everything I suggest you should post a question over at r/askscience or r/physiology. There are simply too many different systems in the body that interact/counteract with each other depending how healthy the body is and/or the state of the body during rest/exercise. But I'll try to adress the most common responses here (still in ELI5). Sorry for formatting or spelling, I'm on mobile. Also, English is my third language.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>is Gatorade/Powerade/G-Fuel hypo-, iso-, or hypertonic? It depends what kind of drink you buy, each brand has specialized sports drinks series designed for your type of exercise and preferred moment of hydration in the flavor that you like. By the way, tonicity refers to the sodium concentration in the beverage, not the glucose content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dehydration vs. hypovolemia vs. hypernatremia. Dehydration is when the total body water (cells, blood, spaces between cells) is less than normal. Hypovolemia is when the blood volume is less than normal (about 5L). Hypernatremia is when the salt concentration in the blood is higher than normal. Some simple examples: you just donated blood? Hypovolemia. Exercised for a long period in the heat without drinking? Dehydration and possible hypernatremia. Did you drink a 2 liters of sea water? Hypernatremia and hypervolemia. They all trigger thirst response, but the underlying mechanisms are different.
Make sure you drink 1.5-2 liters of water per day to keep your body hydrated and filter out unwanted chemicals whether you're exercising or not regardless of outside temperatures. Don't chug it all in once but drink it throughout the day. If you're thirsty, it's already too late. Check your pee: if it's clear, you're good to go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>point of hypotonic beverages (and water). The premise is that the hypotonic water flows into the cells, plus you're overfilling your cardiovascular system. When exercising, water leaves the blood compartment first due to sweating before 'using' the water that in in the cells. This acts like a sort of buffer before you feel the effects of hypernatremia. That's the marketing part, but you could drink water as well. You don't have to go to the store to buy this stuff and it's saves you money.
<em>But you're overfilling the system! Don't the kidneys filter excess water out of the system?</em> Yes they do. The primary jobs of the kidneys are regulating blood pressure and sodium content, filtering metabolites out of the blood etc. First response is: 'Fuck! Sodium concentration is too low, too much water and the blood pressure is too high!' What happens is that the kidneys excrete water, but don't <strong>re</strong>absorb while retaining electrolyes. Result: pissing. But not during exercise. During exercise the sympathetic nervous system activity is elevated (responsible for fight/flight), causing the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). This cascade is designed to prevent blood pressure from dropping too low by releasing agents in the blood stream that cause the arteries to constrict and the kidneys to recollect more water that already has been excreted. An example of the power this system can be found in people with heart failure and hypertension (high blood pressure), where the sympathetic nervous system is overactive all the time, and the RAAS as well.
<em>But how can you properly exercise when all the arteries are constricted? Shouldn't the arteries to the exercising muscles stay open to provide blood?</em> Yes they do, it's a process called functional sympatholysis and is a phenomenon where the local environment overrides the sympathetic signals coming from the body. This enables the main arteries to the exercising muscles to dilate under influence of local nitric oxide (NO) release. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>best cure for a hangover? There is no cure, only prevention. Alternate between water and your preferred alcoholic beverage of choice as much as possible. Alcohol counteracts the effect of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the kidneys, also known as anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), which makes you pee more than you drink. Drink 1-2 glasses of water before you go to sleep. Don't expect miracles the next morning but the headache should be a bit more bearable.</p>
</li>
<li>better explanation of the point of adding glucose and sodium to drinks. When you're healthy, it doesn't matter how you ingest sodium, glucose and water. The body is capable of transporting sodium ions through the intestinal border, causing water to follow it. But drinking tap water or water without added electrolytes also works well. Another way to get water into the body is the so called GLUT transporter. It is a protein that transports glucose and sodium from the gut into the body, causing the water to follow. This protein never fails and is one of the reasons why sports drinks also contain glucose, in addition to flavor and provide a bit of extra energy. For diarrhea, IV rehydration works the best but an oral rehydration solution is the next best alternative. It's super rich in electrolytes and glucose, and if you don't have it in your arsenal when you're sick you can make one yourself as well. Sports drinks also help as a last resort but they don't have the stopping power that ORS has. If you want to know more about this topic, u/Dex2Dex can provide a more detailed answer down below.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No no. All of these posts are missing the main reason why glucose and sodium are added to rehydrating drinks.</p>
<p>Its not just about osmotic gradients. It's about glucose and sodium channels being coupled with the gates that allow water absorption in your GI tract. (By coupled I mean triggering one will trigger the other.) If you want to maximize absorption of water after whatever balance your body thinks it has achieved you facilitate the process by adding glucose and sodium to activate these coupled transport gates. That is why WHO rehydration packs have these additives... otherwise if it was purely about osmotic gradients you wouldnt need glucose, only salt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually there is one thing I know of that is truly more hydrating than just drinking water alone. But it's not a special ingredient or any of that salt electrolyte bullshit. Consuming chia seeds that have been soaked in water overnight will continuously keep you hydrated throuought the day. The seeds are covered my a membrane that, when soaked, it expands and absorbs. They can hold 10 times their weight in water. And after consuming, as your body digests the seeds, the membranes slowly absorb into your system releasing all the water that has been absorbed. They keep you more hydrated than anything else and give you incredible energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone with DI, allow me to explain. Diabetes insipidus is an issue with your kidneys (or nerves) having problems flushing out electrolytes in the right concentration. Essentially, you urinate more than you should and excrete more water than you should. In my case, I take electrolytes to retain water. Without something with electrolytes, such as just plain water, I excrete 90% of the fluids within 30 minutes of drinking. Because your body needs these electrolytes to function and to hold water, an electrolyte balance must be maintained. Hydration without electrolytes in the case of DI leads to severe dehydration, as your body can't hold water without the right electrolytes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drinks like gatorade contain electrolytes which are basically salts, which help your body absorb the water you put into it faster. Thats why salt makes you thirsty. So those drinks arent giving you any more hydratiom than water, but simply allowing the water you take it to hydrate your more efficiently. Usually sports drinks are intended to be consumed along with additional water to better support an active body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
