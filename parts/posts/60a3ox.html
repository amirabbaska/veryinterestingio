		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not quite, but close.</p>
<p>For a detonation to occur, you need a nuclear bomb, which is a very complex and precise machine. This is probably too complex to be assembled by random natural processes. The closest which happens naturally is when Uranium ore deposits form, and then reach a supercritical concentration of fissile isotopes, which is rare. Then, you get a runaway fission reaction. It doesn't go &quot;Boom&quot;, but it releases a lot of heat and radiation, as well as daughter isotopes.</p>
<p>The best known examples occur in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor" target="_blank">Oklo</a>, in Gabon.</p>
<p>It has been discussed in previous posts:</p>

<h2>UPDATE:</h2>
<p>We're getting a lot of posts in the thread along the lines of &quot;How is it possible that the formation of a nuclear bomb by natural processes is impossible when the formation by natural processes of complex intellects such as our own has occurred?&quot;  </p>
<p>This is a false equivalency. In simplest possible terms: both examples are not under the action of the same processes. The concentration or fissile material in ore deposits is under control of the laws of inorganic chemistry, while our own existence is the product of organic &amp; inorganic chemistry, plus Evolution by natural selection. Different processes obtain different results; and different degrees of complexity ensue.</p>
<p>That being said, the current discussion is about natural fission and whether it may or not achieve detonation by its own means. Any posts about the brain/bomb equivalency will be ruled off-topic and removed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A detonation is not physically possible. Going critical and super critical, which is what happened at Oklo, yes but a detonation as a nuclear bomb, no. You may have a mechanical explosion caused by an expanding heated fluid due to the heat generated by a fission event and that is about it.</p>
<p>The method of implosion, at our scale, is not a natural process, it is man made. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can have ongoing fission, but not a proper nuclear explosion. Naturally occuring conditions on earth are unable to create supercriticalities - you dont get a proper fissile mass compression, and fissile mass will not be homogenous, nor will it have proper isotope composition (for uranium weapon grade fuel, think 93-98% U235 purity. For comparison, reactor grade is ~3-5% enrichment, and natural ore that is deemed economically viable, is within 0,01 - 0,1%).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is talking about supercritical and critical reactions.  But for a nuclear explosion to occur, it requires prompt criticality (special case of super criticality) where all the energy is released almost immediately.  This requires a very high density of fissionable material that will not occur naturally and a controlled environment that will initiate the nuclear reaction to prompt criticality.  I wish I could explain more but it's been almost 15 years since I learned this stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Statistically so improbable it's ok to say it's impossible. EDIT: On Earth specifically</p>
<p>You'd need concentrations and masses of fissile material which are so distant from natural ranges that it just isn't going to happen. Even if there was a concentrated mass of fissile material by some miracle, you need need another one in a position to impact it in just the right way to go supercritical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
