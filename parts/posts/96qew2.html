<p>How is that figure determined? I know that it is not likely that some scientist tried to try and kill as many people as possible. So how is it done? How do we tell if something is lethal? And how do we tell how many people it can kill?</p>
<p>What about a completely foreign substance? The effects of which on humans is relatively undocumented?</p></div></div>

<p>Apply carefully measured doses to a series of rats until half of your sample dies. Consult prior research where lethality in rats was compared to more analogous animals such as pigs. From this you determine the LD50, the lethal dose for half of a given population. Then it is just a matter of comparing how much venom the animal typically injects vs the LD50 amount.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there is something called the median lethal dose, or LD50 for short. It basically refers to the dose required to kill 50% of the population within a certain timeframe. The units are typically mg/kg (mass of toxin/mass of animal). So with this data, scientists can extrapolate how many animals it would kill within that time frame by working out the total mass of the animals and then dividing by the average mass of that animal.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose#Examples" target="_blank">here</a> are a list of some LD50s, and from that list, you can see that most of the experimentation is done on rats and mice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A more accurate definition is it entirely depends on who decides what is unethical. There's been tons of human experimentation done that you would probably consider unethical, but people like the Nazis, China, N. Korea, Russia, the US military, the British military, the Japanese military did not. Similarly vertebrate experimentation as mentioned by Phage0070 isn't considered ethical, is often freakishly cruel to animals and would be considered animal cruelty if you did it. But vertebrate experimentation is considered necessary to get results similar to what we would expect in humans, which is why you can get required permits to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They keep giving incrementally larger doses to animals like rats and rabbits until they find a dose that kills the majority of the population. Called LD50 Then they use this information to find the chemical reaction that killed the animals, and determine how it worked. This is called Method of Action. Then they find the same or similar system in humans, usually from hospital data, and do the hard chemistry and physics to find a rough estimate as to the rate at which a human can take in a substance without dieing. They use similar methods to determine if a drug works, and how much. </p>
<p>As far as I know, there really is not &quot;totally ethical&quot; way that this can be done. Unless we start finding a way to make people volunteer to do the hard work of finding the method of action and lethal dose for the majority, we have limited options. </p>
<p>Good news, there has been some advances in making tissue sample systems that can clue us into important information in light of sacrificing animals directly. </p>
<p>If you want to hurt less animals, go study cell biology and biomolecular science so that we can find new methods of determining the level of a lethal dose, and a theraputic dose. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
