		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, broadleaf trees (as opposed to needleleaf trees) tend to have higher maximum photosynthetic capacities. If they are not resource limited, they can sequester more carbon. </p>
<p>What is also important to consider is how long carbon will be sequestered from the atmosphere (carbon residence time). Needleleaf trees tend to decompose more slowly due to their nitrogen content and carbon stability in the tree tissues, making them less degradable. They also tend to be longer lived, but it really depends on the environment that the tree is in. The boreal forests (northern latitudes) are dominated by needleleaf trees because it is colder. Most of the carbon is stored in soils because there is less microbial decomposition. In the tropics, there is a lot more primary productivity (growth), and there are no needleleafs in the tropics, but it is warm and rapid nutrient cycling, so much less carbon stored in soils in most locations. There are exceptions... a peat bog was discovered in the Congo and it stores a lot of carbon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The earliest form of photosynthesizing life would by far be the best to utilize for reducing CO2 and temperature. I'm talking about cyanobacteria. They were responsible for the first long freeze of the Earth, when they came into existence during Earth's hot, carbon dioxide-rich environment. They could be easily cultivated and used to begin undoing the damage we've done, and as a preventative measure against future excessive heat and/or CO2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While I do not have my flair showing my degree, I am pursuing  a plant breeding degree with my topic dealing with photosynthesis. There are actually several different subtypes of photosynthesis and the one most efficient is called c4 (which also has several subtypes but we will ignore it for now). Photosynthesis is also dependent on humidity, temperature, plant health and of course light quality and amount. The ideal photosynthetic tree I would say would have broad leaves, be a c4 plant, not be under drought stress and is getting the right wavelengths of light and not too much of it. Though in reality photosynthesis is very very inefficient, I believe one of my professors say that maybe 3% of light is actually used to do photosynthesis while the rest is reflected off as heat or is accounted for in other pathways. I'm on my phone so I currently cannot link materials here but I would be glad to send links to anyone curious</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People think that trees convert CO<em><em>2</em></em> into oxygen, like they are factories that take carbon dioxide as an input and generate oxygen as an output.  They don't, this is a myth.</p>
<p>Trees don't <em>convert</em> CO<em><em>2</em></em>, they just <em>sequester</em> carbon, in their leaves and wood.  That is to say, so long as the tree is growing, sure, it consumes CO<em><em>2</em></em>.  But when a tree matures or is constrained (by oh, I don't know, that concrete slab right next to the soil in your urban environment) in it's growth, it stops sequestering carbon.  And when that tree dies?  It decomposes and returns all it's carbon back to the atmosphere as CO<em><em>2</em></em>.  So sure, trees do sequester carbon, though there seems to be little point in going out of our way to plant them in cities where space is at a premium when you can just plant them rural areas where it <em>is not</em>.</p>
<p>But if we ignore all that, I would imagine the best trees for your purposes might be ones that grow very very tall but stay narrow.  You're going to be constrained in how far it can grow outward by it's environment, but for most cities at least the roots can grow <em>downward</em>.  (NYC is an exception: Subways.)  Maybe bamboo?  Bamboo is so hardy it's considered an invasive species in many states.  Grows fast as hell, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
