<p>For example, later the article says that a portion of the caldera moved 1.5&quot; per year between 2004 and 2008.  How can you tell?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After following the reference bread crumbs for a while (curse Wikipedia editors who cite science journalists who in turn don't link to the actual paper!), the source of the uplift rate numbers comes from this <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/318/5852/952.full" target="_blank">2007 paper in Science</a> that found an acceleration of rates up to ~7 cm/yr since 2004, but present a record of surface uplift rates going back to 1923. To construct this record, they use all three of the common techniques to detect vertical surface deformation: InSAR, GPS, and leveling data. I'll describe each method below, but an additional resource to look through is this <a href="https://www.unavco.org/education/resources/modules-and-activities/gps-yellowstone/module-materials/activity-files-yellowstone/ground-deformation-w-notes.pdf" target="_blank">presentation produced by UNAVCO (pdf)</a> designed for high school students to understand how we measure the changes in surface deformation of Yellowstone.</p>
<p><strong>InSAR</strong>, or interferometric synthetic aperture radar, uses differences in phase of radar pulses bounced off the surface of the Earth between multiple passes of a satellite to measure vertical deformation (in actuality, what the satellite can measure is changes in distance in the line of sight of the satellite so if using just radar images from the same look direction of a satellite, it may not be strictly vertical deformation). <a href="http://www.geo.cornell.edu/eas/PeoplePlaces/Faculty/matt/vol59no7p68_69.pdf" target="_blank">Here is a write up of how InSAR works that is sort of pitched to the laymen</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_synthetic-aperture_radar" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> page also provides a decent amount of information for how InSAR works and its uses, and if you really want information overload, check out the <a href="http://vldb.gsi.go.jp/sokuchi/sar/qanda/qanda-e.html" target="_blank">FAQ page from GSI, the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan</a>. InSAR is used extensively to measure vertical surface deformation related to earthquakes, volcanoes, and groundwater extraction. Under good conditions, InSAR can measure vertical changes on the order of millimeters, but with atmospheric disturbances and changes in ground cover between satellite passes, the precision is usually centimeters at worst. The precision can improve when doing long time series of successive radar images (as with the Yellowstone data).</p>
<p><strong>GPS</strong>, or Global Positioning System (now that everyone has one in their phone, not as much need to explain that acronym). Geologists and geodesists use GPS systems to measure movement of the surface of the Earth (these are not your run of the mill GPS units like you have to go hiking, these <a href="http://kb.unavco.org/kb/article.php?id=55" target="_blank">are pretty expensive and very sensitive pieces of equipment</a>). Geologists often focus on what these data tell us about horizontal motions, but a GPS station is recording its position in X, Y, and Z at all times so you can extract information about changes in a position in all three directions. GPS stations/measurements come in two flavors 'campaign' and 'continuous'. A campaign survey is where you install a series of benchmarks (i.e. put some semi-permanent marker in a spot, some concrete, rebar, etc) and you 'occupy' these benchmarks for a few days with a GPS unit maybe once a year over several years and use the change in position between successive surveys to calculate the movement of that spot. Continuous surveys, as the name implies, is where you instead set up a GPS receiver and leave it there to log its position semi-continuously. In the case of continuous receivers, you can develop time series of the stations position like <a href="https://sideshow.jpl.nasa.gov/post/tables/GPS_Time_Series.pdf" target="_blank">this (scroll to the last page of this pdf for an example)</a>. You can see the change in the position of this station in latitude (Y), longitude (X), and height (Z). It's common for height to have seasonal variations like you see in this data set related to changes in groundwater, so if you're interested in the longer term vertical change you need to remove this seasonal signal / average across the time series. You can look at the time series for the <a href="http://www.uusatrg.utah.edu/ts_ysrp.html" target="_blank">continuous stations in Yellowstone (click on a station to see its data)</a> for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Leveling</strong>. While we have technologically impressive ways to relatively quickly measure vertical deformations on either very short time intervals (GPS) or over large areas (InSAR) the tried and true method of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levelling" target="_blank">leveling surveys</a> still provides quite robust data. This also has the advantage of having been around (and the precision hasn't gotten that much better) for decades so it can provide longer term datasets (this is how they have a record going back to 1923 in Yellowstone). Leveling surveys were basically the earliest data to allow us to look at surface deformation on short time scales and there are numerous examples of it being used before wide spread availability or application of GPS or InSAR, like this <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/92GL01638/pdf" target="_blank">classic example from the Himalaya</a>, but it is still used today, like this <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JB008242/full" target="_blank">paper looking at surface deformation in Taiwan from a recent(ish) leveling survey along with  GPS</a>. While laborious, leveling surveys can produce comparable results to GPS and InSAR in terms of precision and are cheaper and don't require sophisticated equipment (beyond the survey gear) to capture or analyze the data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
