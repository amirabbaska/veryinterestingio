		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an effect of activating your sympathetic nervous system. Basically, your nerves have two settings: sympathetic (fight or flight) and parasympathetic (rest and digest). Both systems are active harmoniously, but the balance can be shifted in response to the environment.</p>
<p>When you're just sitting there chilling, the parasympathetic nervous system is dominant. This emphasizes functions such as digestion.</p>
<p>When something triggers it, such as seeing your crush, or being chased by a bear, or trying to kill a wasp that flew into your car when you rolled the windows down and now you're flailing for dear life, a hormone surge and the sympathetic nervous system becomes dominant. The physiological effects of this are what someone might describe as an adrenaline rush.</p>
<p>Some physiological effects of the sympathetic system are pupil dilation, increase in heart rate and contractility, and  dilation of blood vessels in your skeletal muscles and extremities which diverts blood flow away from your gut, slowing digestion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a neuroscience student, my first response was &quot;nobody knows&quot;. Then I read lots of answers just saying &quot;it's the sympathetic nervous system&quot;. After a few years in academia you tend to forget that most people are satisfied with the vaguest of answers. To me it's same as asking &quot;How am I able to walk?&quot; and answering &quot;Because you have muscles&quot;.</p>
<p>When you question your most basic assumptions, remember that scientists don't know how we coordinate our muscles to do something as mundane as keeping ourselves upright. Roboticists can tell you it's no easy task.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>TL:DR - dopamine goes up, seratonin goes down, and if youre in love with someone then nerve factor growth accompanies this. Perhaps some adrenaline too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
