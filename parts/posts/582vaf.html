		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, we can do nuclear fusion just fine. There are numerous research experiments already doing it. Heck, there's even a small, but dedicated amateur community setting up experiments. A while ago there was some highschool kid who made the news by creating a small fusion device in his living room.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that maintaining a fusion reaction requires a lot of energy, because the fusion plasma has to be kept at very high temperature in order for the reaction to take place. In current experiments, the amount of energy required to maintain the reaction is considerably higher than the amount of energy produced by the reaction.</p>
<p>But, as it turns out, the amount of energy produced by the reaction scales up more rapidly with size than the amount of energy required. So by simply making the reactor bigger, we can increase the efficiency (the so-called Q factor). But simply making the reactor bigger also makes the reaction harder to control, so scaling up the process is not a quick and easy job.</p>
<p>Scientists and engineers are currently working on the first reactor to have a Q factor larger than 1. That is, a reactor that produces more energy than it uses. This is the ITER project currently being constructed in France.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, nuclear fusion is quite possible.  The challenge is getting more energy out than is put into it.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Wilson" target="_blank">Taylor Wilson</a> was the kid who successfully but a fusion reactor at the age of 14.  He is a colleague of mine and a good friend.  His small reactor fused very small quantities of deuterium ions together to form He-4. A small fraction of the free deuterium in the chamber captures a neutron and becomes tritium. Tritium and deuterium quite easily fuse together to form He-4 plus a fast neutron.  Here is a <a href="http://imgur.com/g1LjFal" target="_blank">short video</a> of his reactor starting up.  We placed my (no longer operating) iPhone in front of the reactor window to try and capture video of the fusion process.  At the beginning, you can clearly see the x-rays saturating individual pixels (the snow effect) but it quickly diminishes as the energy rises above that which can be capture by the CCD.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've worked on nuclear fusion as an engineer in maths and physics modelling. Fusion works, the real question is can we harvest energy in a sustainable ways: is it possible to scale it up so much that we actually get energy out of it, and yet be able to hold it working for many months/years to a point it start being possible to sell the energy.</p>
<p>There is many school of though:</p>
<p>Continuous fusion, as in &quot;let's build a sun&quot;. The idea is to have a permanent plasma and have continuous fusion in it. Hard part being: plasma is hot (250M degrees hot, hotter than the sun since inside the sun the pressure is tremendous, therefore to achieve fusion on earth without the pressure the temperature need to go up). So containing a plasma is hard. Very powerful magnetite fields plus very specific materials should be able to do so, but many other parameters influence the resistance of the whole thingy. Latest tries in this direction (I may forget some) are in France (ITER) and Germany (can't remember the name).</p>
<p>Punctual fusion, as in &quot;let's spam H bombs&quot;. This idea is currently used to simulate H bombs (France is building one, called &quot;Laser Mega Joule&quot;, USA already got one but I may be wrong). The idea is to fire a shitstorm of laser into a very small pellet made of hydrogen and other stuff, to get a powerful shock-wave that  compress the hydrogen up to a fusion point. The fusion is there a combination of heat and pressure, much like in a H bomb. Hard part is: laser going that high in energy are hard to focus, because the mirrors and lenses used heat up and deform, resulting in a loss of power (or even damage to installation). So hard to really get a fire rate high enough to harvest continuously energy. Also mostly military uses but I may be wrong.</p>
<p>Last one, which is really the same as the previous one, but using a magnetic wave to compress (instead of light). A perfectly symmetrical magnetic wave is sent toward a finite point in space where some hydrogen encapsulated in a metallic shell stand. Hard part: powerful yet perfect magnetic waves are hard to obtain, also no metal inside the facility when firing (you should get why).</p>
<p>I've worked a bit for ITER, which will try to reach the minute of working, and demonstrate the possibility to generate more energy than it uses. So far best ever done is less than few sec.</p>
<p>We may prove that it's simply not possible one day, but if it ever works, man we would be blessed with infinite electricity (as water is all it takes to get it to work (more or less)). So it's more or less the golden egg goose chase. It is considered as the most ambitious research project ever done by the humanity, and commercial results are not expected before ~2050-2100. The researches started ~40-50 years ago.</p>
<p>Some people probably already said what I just wrote, but couldnt get to read all 200 coms, and I wanted to contribute ;) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well yes, because if it wasn't possible the Sun would not shine.<br />
What we haven't conclusively proven but we think (by all best evidence so far) is possible, is to create an economically viable fusion power station. It's quite possible we could prove the technology and then still not build a power station because either it is too risky a financial venture, or because other power sources have come online.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes on three accounts:</p>
<p>Theoretically it is true because there is a large amount of energy released from Fusion, which is more than equal to the activation energy.</p>
<p>Two, Fusion definitely exists because that's what the Sun operates on.  It's not just theoretical, but known to be the case.</p>
<p>Three, Humans have generating significantly energy-positive instances of fusion.  Fusion is what gives the massive Hydrogen bombs yields 1000x bigger than the Hiroshima bomb.</p>
<p>But doing it in a sustained, constant, controlled amount rather than in a destructive liberation driven by the pressures and temperatures of a fission bomb, is going to be very difficult.</p>
<p>Technically, we could just repeatedly detonate hydrogen bombs at the bottom of a lake and use the steam from the lake to spin turbines.  Technically that'd be fusion power.  It would also be an utterly horrible way of going about it - but the potential is there.  Consider it a Fusion-Pulse Power Plant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
