		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First and foremost I would like to preface the fact that I am not a racist bigot, and that inspite of me voting <strong><em>LEAVE</em></strong> I am still very much in favour of free movement etc </p>
<p>Infact, my girlfriend is Polish my ex was from Italy, and another from Ireland, I enjoy drinking Polish beer, eating Italian salamis and driving my German car.</p>
<p>I live and work in one of the poorer areas of Leeds, one of the biggest cities in the UK, and frankly I could have told you a brexit was on the cards weeks ago, and it isn't only about the <strong><em>immigration</em></strong> problem that the uneducated right wing have cited as their reason for voting out.</p>
<p>Britain right now has a HUGE disparity problem, the working class have simply been ignored for too long, and this became appallingly apparent today when the political elite were dumbfounded that a leave vote had actually prevailed, the banks didn't see it coming, the news didn't see it coming, infact it seems that anyone who isn't white working and poor were shocked, me? not in the slightest.</p>
<p>The average joe has been ignored for simply too long, stagnating wages, zero hour contracts, housing prices through the roof, taxation at an all time high, the list is quite sadly endless.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the wealth and gold quite literally runs south, it seeps through the foundations of the M25 and disappears off into the distance, leaving the rest of the country to take the 1970s London  tube trains to work everyday, and to top off the humiliation of all of this, not only do we then have politicians in the UK, we have the overly and increasingly bureaucratic politicians of Brussels to also dictate our daily lives, people the commoner quite frankly could not give two shits about.</p>
<p>Politics in Europe is slowly but surely seeping to a select elite few, and I for one am proud that the British have voted against this totalitarian mindset, we the people need <strong><em>LOCAL</em></strong> politics at street level, we need to put the power back into the public hands at local level as opposed to allowing the power to slowly but surely run from one single source, what works for a small town in France mayn't work for a small village in Yorkshire, this is a fundamentally real reason that I see the voters choosing leave, but if you watch any mainstream media they will have you believe it was Vicky from number 6 who has 4 kids with 4 men and no job, chain smokes 20 L&amp;B a day and watches Jeremy kyle as if he was God (looking at you BBC)</p>
<p>-TLDR-</p>
<p>The common man in the UK has been ignored far too long, this has blown up in the out of touch politicians faces and now we are all paying the price.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Copypasting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/46qul7/eli5_uk_vote_on_leaving_the_eu_brexit/d0777j8" target="_blank">an older comment I made:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>What is a referendum?</li>
</ul>
<p>A referendum is when the electorate (general public who can vote), or the parliament (although usually MPs can't vote, but not in this specific referendum), vote on a specific issue, such as, for example, a law. </p>
<p>Usually, it's basically that you choose &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; on a particular law, for example, but sometimes there can be multiple choices as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the European Union?</li>
</ul>
<p>A political and economic union (or actually the economic part is the European Economic Area) between multiple countries, and most of them are usually located within Europe. Currently, there are 28 member countries. The idea of it is that basically those countries can work together, make laws which apply to all or most of them, have a unified trading market, have the same currency (the euro, of which 19 member countries currently use), etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is going to be asked in this UK referendum?</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact question is &quot;<em>Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?</em>&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the parliament only the people who can vote on that question?</li>
</ul>
<p>Nope, if you're a UK citizen who's over 18 years old, or you're a UK citizen who's living abroad but have done so for less than 15 years, or a commonwealth citizen residing in the UK, then you are able to vote.</p>
<ul>
<li>Should the UK leave the European Union?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people say that yes, it should, because they say that the European Union has too many rules for businesses, and they also say that even though the UK pays membership fees, they don't get much stuff in return. Another point raised is that the borders need to be controlled better in regards to immigrants, etc.</p>
<p>Some people say that no, it shouldn't, because then it might be easier to trade between other member countries, and also that the immigrants actually help to boost the economy, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, should the UK leave or not?</li>
</ul>
<p>It depends, as there are arguments on either side saying yes, it should, and no, it shouldn't.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am not an expert, and as a result could be completely wrong in what I said above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, I guarantee 90% of the reason we left is immigration.</p>
<p>I can also guarantee that leaving won't reduce immigration figures, other than the fact that our economy is going to be shagged so we won't look as tempting.</p>
<p>No way in hell are we leaving the single market, and any conditions for remaining in the single market will have to contain clauses protecting the right of EU citizens to live and work here. Not to mention there will still be plenty of EU laws we will have to follow</p>
<p>So all in all, we're exactly where we were before, just poorer with less bright prospects, and less influence </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
