		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two causes from what I understand. </p>
<p>1.) Muscle spasm. Muscle feels pain in the area and spasms to protect/splint itself and gets stuck in the pain-spasm-pain cycle. Spasming to protect the area will cause pain and the cycle repeats. You can stop it by putting direct pressure over the area and causing some pain which will fatigue it out and cause it to relax (elbow/thumb/tennis ball against wall/ground). You can also foam roll the area focusing on sitting on the spasm to relax it out.</p>
<p>2.) Myofascial adhesions. Your muscles are covered in a thin layer of tissue called fascia (picture thin translucent tissue you've probably seen over raw chicken/beef). The fascia can get stuck together or &quot;knotted up&quot; and cause pain and a tight feeling. It's the equivalent to pulling a single string on a sweater, the whole surrounding area can start to feel tight and sore. Best approach to loosen this is massage or foam rolling the area. What a lot of people neglect in foam rolling is that when you find a sore/painful spot you should sit on it for 8-12 seconds and then roll over the whole area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

That being said there seem to be a couple of different prevailing theoretical camps: In the first camp, experts believe that they are contractions within the muscle caused by muscles tensing repeatedly. The second camp disputes this citing lack of ability to see these contractions on a scan. This camp believes that the cause is neural and a product of irritated nerve endings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscle fibers run in all different directions in our body and muscles are layered on top of each other from our heads to our toes. This is a good thing and the reason why we can bend, twist, dance, and play sports. Our muscles are meant to be pliable, strong, and challenged. However, when we sit at a computer all day in the same position and if we injure ourselves, or if we are chronically dehydrated, we can lose our mobility and flexibility. The various muscle fibers start to stick to each other and become adhered. This new hard and lumpy feeling is a muscle ‘knot’.</p>

<p>It's true that no one really knows what a knot is but there are better explanations than it being a myospasm. </p>
<p>A simple explanation is that when a muscle learns a repetitive action in an already over stretched position  (typing at the computer let's say) then what you get is a stretch response in the tendon tissue causing some motor amnesia (this response is commonly called a spasm) which can ONLY be fully released with active range of motion coupled with prioproreceptive techniques that target the nerve clusters within the muscle belly and tendon junctions. In short, you CANNOT just &quot;rub out&quot; a knot and most who try to with foam rolling only do more damage as a result. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The knot can be many things, but it has two root causes: neurophysiological causes , and  mechanical causes. Either you're too tight because your nervous system wants it to be tight, or you're tight because of direct trauma.  Different causes will cause different kinds of build up of scar tissue. </p>
<p>The muscles you have have tiny, microscopic bridge-like proteins called actin and myosin.  If the bridge is too overlapped, you get muscle tightness. If the bridge is too weak, they don't like to overlap, making it hard to contract properly. If it's too tight, then you end up with bunched up tissues overtime, including connective tissues like fascia that like to stick. </p>
<p>You can get this tightness from poor diet, bad posture, nerve impingement, or direct trauma like getting punched. Over time scar tissue can form, creating an even more pronounced 'knot'  in the muscle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
