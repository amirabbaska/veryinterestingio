		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To give you an idea of how heavily scheduled Hubble is, imagine you wanted to borrow your friend's car, and he let you use it the way NASA lets scientists use Hubble.</p>
<p>A year in advance, your friend would make you write a 10-page essay where you clearly explain what you need the car for, exactly what stops you're going to make, and why you need to use his car rather than walking.  A thousand of his other friends also write essays.  He'd collect them all and ask other friends who don't need the car to compare them, so there's no favoritism.  The panel of friends would spend a week debating whether Joe needs to go to the grocery store more than Jane needs to visit her grandmother, and decide who gets to actually use the car.  About one in eight people are selected, the others have to wait until next year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any large telescope is always being used, weather conditions permitting of course. Telescope time is very expensive and highly sought after so the only down time is typically for maintenance. Otherwise, ground-based optical telescopes observe all night, and all other telescopes observe 24-7, including space telescopes as well as radio telescopes.</p>
<p>As an example for a radio telescope, here's the <a href="https://dss.gb.nrao.edu/schedule/public#" target="_blank">public schedule</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bank_Telescope" target="_blank">Green Bank Telescope</a>, the world's largest fully steerable radio telescope. You can see that over the next few days, there are 7.5 hrs on Sunday allocated for maintenance but otherwise, the telescope observes night and day, every day. The only circumstances that will stop the GBT from observing are high wind and snow.</p>
