		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You won't always find them. But... the female side (the wall outlet) has little 'keepers', or, little bumps that press themselves into these holes that help keep the plug in the socket. Pure tension is not enough.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From the how stuff works page it lists three reasons, one is to get a better connection with a lower chance of a heavy plug being pulled loose. It says there are small copper contacts attached to springs in the wall socket. These would push into the holes and help keep it in. </p>
<p>Another reason was to attach safety tags with instructions eg &quot;Make sure X before plugging in appliance&quot; This would be for safety concerns, perhaps the appliance may spark if its switched on before being plugged in. </p>
<p>The last would be for cost savings, every bit if (of)* material counts. </p>
