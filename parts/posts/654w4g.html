		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on u/shibboreth's comment, <em>M.A.S.H.</em>, the T.V. show and the film, are set in the Korean War but were used to satirize the U.S.'s involvement in Vietnam. It's also mentioned in the Clint Eastwood film <em>Heartbreak Ridge</em>, as <em>Heartbreak Ridge</em> was a battle during the Korean War. There was also the film <em>Porkchop Hill</em> about one of the final engagements of the war. It doesn't have a huge place in popular culture even in the years following it. </p>
<p>We U.S. only lost about 4,000 less soldiers and marines in Korea than in Vietnam even though the war was only three years long. I think a big part of the war being &quot;forgotten&quot; is that it was essentially a loss. After the landings at Inchon, the Marines pushed the North Koreans all the way into China. Then at the Chosin Reservoir the 1st Marine Division was surrounded by the Chinese and butchered, prompting Lt. Gen Chesty Puller to make the famous statement &quot;They are in front of us, behind us, and we are flanked on both sides by an enemy that outnumbers us 29:1. They can’t get away from us now!”</p>
<p>All of the ground gained by U.S. forces was lost quite quickly. South Korea was defended but at a high price. There wasn't really anything to celebrate except the soldiers going home. It was a stalemate, and it was arguably an American strategic defeat. The United States Army has never been defeated, but it's lots plenty of battles and a few wars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact; its also known as &quot;the forgotten war&quot;.</p>
<p>The Korean war is wedged between WW2 and Vietnam, but didn't affect America nearly as much as either. WW2 and Vietnam defined their generations, so it makes sense that they would be remembered. WW2 was on a much grander scale and the whole country was part of the war effort, and it's outcome was highly relevant to most people on earth. The Korean war had an impact mainly on the Korean peninsula. The Korean war didn't drag on like the Vietnam war, and it wasn't nearly as controversial. </p>
<p>I wrote that assuming you're American. If you aren't, then the answer is even simpler. It had UN backing, but if you're not American, Korean, or Chinese, then your county probably didn't contribute much to the war effort. A war on foreign land, where the outcome doesn't affect you, and the war effort doesn't involve you, is sure to be forgotten. </p>
<p>Basically, it has an extreme version of middle child syndrome. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's somewhat ironic that it's forgotten, because it was one of the first major acts of the Cold War. I think the main reasons it is overlooked include:<br />
1 This was the first modern war that the US didn't really win. It ended in a stalemate, which technically still hasn't ended since a peace treaty was never signed.<br />
2 It was one of many &quot;holding actions&quot; during the Cold War, which was dramatic but indecisive, and didn't have much impact on people's lives.<br />
3 Korea wasn't really well known by Americans, and wasn't important until decades after the war.<br />
4 Many actors and directors joined the Army for WWII and came back home and told their stories again and again. Not as many went to the Korean War, and their stories were not told nearly as often (though the Manchurian Candidate, for example, featured a Korean War vet).<br />
5 It didn't have the dramatic stories that WWII did. Just like it's hard to dramatize the dirty brutality of trench warfare in WWI (another overlooked war), the stalemate of the Korean War makes it hard to find heroic stories to tell.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Korean War happened between the World War II, the most widely known war in the world, and the Vietnam War, US' longest war to date. The impact on the world is also relatively small in comparison. </p>
<p>It is simply overshadowed by its bigger and louder timeline neighbors.</p>
<p>Edit: Seems like many people think I am oblivious to the fact that US is still in Afghanistan. I am fully aware that USA leaves military bases in every area they fight a war in. I know USA still has a strong military presence in Middle East and there is still fighting. All I am saying is that, officially, the USA is no longer &quot;at war&quot; in Afghanistan since December 31st.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
