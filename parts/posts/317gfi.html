		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We've all heard the facts about plastic water bottles, that they take many thousands of years to degrade, etc. But given that the ability to metabolize ubiquitous plastic products would confer a distinct evolutionary advantage to any organism that could do so, is it possible that such a bacterium could evolve to do so within a shorter amount of time than the physical degradation rate of plastics?</p>
<p>Similarly, could scientists direct the evolution of these organisms by, for example, placing a bacteria culture in a dish in the presence of polymers with enough natural media to get a sufficiently large level of variation, so that once the natural nutrients are expended the bacteria will have to evolve to digest the polymers to survive?</p>
<p>EDIT: Is this process akin to what happened when plants first started producing cellulose? And if this evolutionary feature does not happen, will the plastics that make their way into the earth's crust turn back into oil?</p></div></div>
