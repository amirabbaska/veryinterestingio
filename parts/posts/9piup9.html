		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our main method to detect planets orbiting distant stars is by observing the star when the planet moves in front of it. This briefly makes the star appear dimmer as the planet blocks part of the light of the star. If this happens on a regular interval, we assume that this dimming is caused by a planet and its periodic orbit.</p>
<p>An additional planet in our solar system can't be detected this way, since such an object would never come between the Earth and the Sun. Since this hypothetical planet would be far away from the Sun, it would only receive and reflect a small amount of light, making it very hard to detect. Detecting a very dim speck of light amidst a sky full of objects that are much brighter, without any idea about where to start looking, is worse than finding a needle in a haystack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An analogy would be a lamp that is standing 100m from you in the night. You can see it clearly and if an insect flies in front of it you notice dimming of the light. These will probably be planets.The 9th planet is the opposite, you are standing near the lamp and far away is an insect flying around in the dark. Even if other closer objects seem to be affected by the gravitational pull of this 9th planet. It's still not clear where it is to be able to point telescopes at it (as far as I know).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>If I put you in a desert at night and told you to find any grain of sand, it would be easy. If I told you to find one <em>specific</em> grain of sand that I placed within arms reach of you, you'd spend the rest of your life looking. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general it is easier to find a thing of which millions exist than to proof the non-existence of a specific thing. For one, proving non-existence is generally not so easy because you have to check every possible place very carefully. If you fail to check a single place, you can't claim non-existence. Everything has to be done correctly. In contrast when you want to find just any instance of a common thing, you can be much more sloppy and still succeed. Our telescopes aren't perfect but they're good enough to find at least some exo-planets. We can't detect most of them, but that's ok. It's enough if our telescopes work at least sometimes. This would not be enough in the case of proving the non-existence of a ninth planet.</p>
<p>So you see: one task is fundamentally easier than the other.</p>
<p>Think about how much easier it is to find just any store that sells lemon drops than to prove that there are absolutely no lemon drops hidden in your apartment right now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>well it's not like we've exhaustively identified every planet in a million-light-year radius.  </p>
<p>We have techniques which <em>can</em> allow us to identify planets at extreme distances, from theings like regular dimming of a star's light (as the planet passes between us &amp; it)  </p>
<p>The hypothetical 9th planet would never pass between us &amp; the sun, so we can't find it that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
