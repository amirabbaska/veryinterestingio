		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is caused by  bad <a href="https://sleepfoundation.org/ask-the-expert/sleep-hygiene" target="_blank">sleep hygiene</a> which can just generally throw off your sleep cycles.</p>
<p>Essentially, you are over-tired. There is a &quot;sweet spot&quot; for everyone regarding the time they should go to bed (just the right level of drowsy). Once you get past that, your brain thinks there must be an important reason for you to continue to stay awake, so it sends you a surge of adrenaline. When you lay down, your body just isn't able to relax that quickly.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're probably not doing enough physical exercise every day. I used to have insomnia, but I started swimming every day and now I am able to get to sleep much easier.  </p>
<p>Also, like others have said, TV and mobile devices, smart phones and tablets are too bright. I turn on the blue light filter and the brightness way down. And generally avoid any bright lights for at least an hour before bed. The best way to fall asleep is to simply read a paper book with a dim reading light with warm light color (more orange than blue).  </p>
<p>Also, don't consume any caffeine 8 hours before bed time. Personally, I only get caffeine from tea and only during the morning. Coffee has way too much caffeine and so do soda drinks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Looking at back lit devices at night before bed (I.e. Phone, iPad etc) may cause a 'phase delay' in your sleeping patterns-tricking your brain into thinking it is daytime when it's not. Using artificial light like this can be used by travellers to help get over the effects of jet lag. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>During the day, most do not have the chance to entertain themselves as they do at home, thus tend to procrastinate and entertain themselves with their leisure time which for most is at night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
