		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Among other reasons, tobacco companies suppress knowledge on the toxic stuff in cigarettes.</p>
<p>Take polonium-210, an isotope in the radium decay chain. It's been known to be a major carcinogen in cigarette smoke since the 1960s. Tobacco growers failed to clean the stuff from the tobacco leaves, partially because the washing process removed the flavor and partially because it was not effective in general. They then tried to filter it out, but that, too, was ineffective and introduced its own problems. They then tried to genetically engineer plants that wouldn't absorb the Po-210, but funding kept being cut right before results were analyzed, so no data could ever be published. In the end, instead of continuing to try to remove the Po-210, tobacco companies stopped publication on the problem to avoid lawsuits.</p>
<p>It's one of those things that seems like a crazy conspiracy theory, but here it is in the NIH archives: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2509609/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2509609/</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do E-Cigarettes/Vaping not come close? - Most of the time the only chemical they retain from a standard cigarette is the active ingredient nicotine, which is the main source of the addiction.</p>
<p>Nicotine is not entirely safe on its own, but without tar and CO, vaping is considered <em>better</em> for you than traditional cigarettes.</p>
<p>There are still studies being performed to figure out the long term effects of vaping, and so far nothing is conclusive, based on a quick search.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: I'd also like to add, in order for a cigarette to be a cigarette, it has to maintain the addiction element for the user, nicotine. So as it stands a nicotine-free cigarette cannot really be described as a cigarette at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to take into account that you smolder organic material and inhale the resulting smoke, if you smoke a cigarette.</p>
<p>The nicotine that is contained in a cigarette isn't the worst ingredient, by far. The smoldering itself produces a horrible mixture of all kinds of poisons. Even CO is among a cigarette's exhaust.</p>
<p>Vaping might unhealthy, but it isn't as bad as cigarettes. It can't be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>American Spirit claims an additive free cigarette.  does not make it any safer though, infact it might be worse.</p>
<p>Then theres the question of whether smokers <em>want</em> a pure tobacco leaf cigarette?  Your entering into the world of pipes and cigars then, which is a rather different experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking about just being cigarettes free from additives, they do make that.  Native American Spirit is one brand I can think of.  Just 100% plain organic tobacco (and paper and a filter, which I don't know anything about the content or sourcing on). </p>
<p>They're not like crafted to remove any of the things that would harmful in the tobacco itself that are naturally occurring. So they're in no way a safe cigarette at all.  But if you're a smoker looking for one that has fewer ingredients, you might look into them.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
