		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is quite a bit of knowledge regarding ancient flora - possibly it's less well-known because it's less exciting compared to, say, velociraptors.</p>
<p>The start of the <strong>Carboniferous period</strong> marks the time in which ancient flora evolved to use <em>lignin</em> (and more of other fibres like cellulose), one of the main fibrous constituents of wood. This was a remarkable event; due to this, <strong>lignin-containing plants could, for the first time, grow taller and start to resemble trees</strong>. They could grow as tall as today's trees, but were actually more like <strong>massive ferns with shallow roots</strong> as they were only just developing strength.</p>
<p>There was nothing, at least not yet, that could digest and decompose these early &quot;prototrees&quot; as they fell over in droves and grew and fell (being extremely tall with weak foundations). This is important; <em>wood-digesting fungi and bacteria return the CO₂ that plants consumed.</em> Without this, a massive surplus of undigested carbon littered the ground and O₂ concentrations rose to their highest in history (35% then vs 21% today, allowing for dragonflies and insects the size of seagulls). Massive, alien (to us) rainforests dominated the Earth, stretching unbroken as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p>The rise of such decomposers and their effects created the massive coal and peat deposits we have today, and decreased O₂ to normal levels. The ancient rainforests disappeared and/or fragmented in the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse due to cooler climates, and resurged only in places such as today's China. <em>As the long Carboniferous ended and the Permian era began, rainforests were rarer, trees smaller due to the Collapse, and conifers appeared to begin their long evolutionary journey to what they are now.</em></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trees were one of the most disruptive life forms to ever appear, and the defining characteristic of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboniferous" target="_blank">Carboniferous era</a>. There was about a 100 million year gap between when trees first appeared, and when a fungus capable of breaking them down appeared. Before that, trees would lie where they fell indefinitely, until they were either buried or burned.</p>
<p>This led to enormous carbon sequestration, and the rich coal seams throughout the world. It also brought global oxygen levels past 35% (vs 20% today), which allowed the largest dinosaurs to evolve. Most of those would asphyxiate in today's atmosphere.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While not quite as old as the carboniferous period, one species you might be interested in is the Dawn Redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides). This species is unique because it was thought to be extinct, as only fossils of it were known until its discovery in 1944. Its existence can be dated back to the late cretaceous period. </p>
