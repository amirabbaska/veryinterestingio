		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually learned this the other day! According to my Latin American studies prof, one of the kings of France wanted to create a  stronger connection in the minds of people between those countries and France. He was essentially trying to undermine the influence that Spain and portugal had there because of their colonies. He accomplished this by creating a college that studied and termed the area &quot;latin america&quot;, and it took off from there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America#Origin" target="_blank">a good explanation from Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea that a part of the Americas has a linguistic affinity with the Romance cultures as a whole can be traced back to the 1830s, in the writing of the French Saint-Simonian Michel Chevalier, who postulated that this part of the Americas was inhabited by people of a &quot;Latin race&quot;, and that it could, therefore, ally itself with &quot;Latin Europe&quot; in a struggle with &quot;Teutonic Europe&quot;, &quot;Anglo-Saxon America&quot; and &quot;Slavic Europe&quot;. A further investigation of the concept of Latin America is by Michel Gobat in the American Historical Review.</p>
<p>The idea was later taken up by Latin American intellectuals and political leaders of the mid- and late-nineteenth century, who no longer looked to Spain or Portugal as cultural models, but rather to France. The term was first used in Paris in an 1856 conference by the Chilean politician Francisco Bilbao and the same year by the Colombian writer José María Torres Caicedo in his poem &quot;Two Americas&quot;.</p>
<p>The term Latin America was supported by the French Empire of Napoleon III during the French invasion of Mexico as a way to include France among countries with influence in the Americas and to exclude Anglophone countries. It played a role in his campaign to imply cultural kinship of the region with France, transform France into a cultural and political leader of the area, and install Maximilian of Habsburg as emperor of the Second Mexican Empire. This term was also used in 1861 by French scholars in La revue des races Latines, a magazine dedicated to the Pan-Latinism movement.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spain, Portugal, France and Italy(and a few other minor countries) make up Latin Europe. The all speak romance languages which evolved from Latin after the fall of the Roman Empire. Since as you mentioned Spain and Portugal had the biggest influence on them they are subsequently known as the Latin America similar to their European counterpart. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Romanian languages are the languages descended from Latin. Because of this they are called the Latinate, or Romance languages. </p>
<p>So to answer your question, it is specifically because Spain and Portugal were the large European Influences of the region that they are called Latin America. Hispanic is the term specifically for the subset influenced by Spain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
