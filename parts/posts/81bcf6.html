		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things that played a huge role were the timing of it and the amount of people affected by it.
First, the Korean war lasted around three years from 1950 to 1953. Not only was it relatively short, but it wasn't able to be documented as well. Cameras were big and heavy. The Vietnam war lasted from 1955 to 1975.  By the end of it they had videos of the war on the news so it was highly publicised. Which brings me to my second point. More people were affected by it. Military alone, 9 million people were involved in the Vietnam war while around 5.7 million fought in the Korean war. You're more likely to be interested in a movie if you were somewhat affected by what the movie is about, whether it be fighting in it or just seeing clips of it on the news.</p>
<p>Edit: military involvement in north korea was grossly off, don't trust Wikipedia without looking at sources</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Korean War isn’t very well covered in school either. Everything I learned about the war was either from my grandfather or MASH. As Clint Eastwood said in Heartbreak ridge, Korea was a draw. Technically it is still an ongoing conflict. I think some people just consider it an afterthought to WW2 and the fact that the “bad guys” weren’t the Nazis that everyone loves to hate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can't say about movies in particular, but the whole thing is often called &quot;The Forgotten War&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War#Names" target="_blank">In the U.S., the war was initially described by President Harry S. Truman as a &quot;police action&quot; as it was an undeclared military action, conducted under the auspices of the United Nations.[54] It has been referred to in the English-speaking world as &quot;The Forgotten War&quot; or &quot;The Unknown War&quot; because of the lack of public attention it received both during and after the war, and in relation to the global scale of World War II, which preceded it, and the subsequent angst of the Vietnam War, which succeeded it.[55][56]</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because Korea was a much shorter conflict, and it's resolution was much more favorable for the USA, than Vietnam ended up being.   What was essentially a lost cause in Vietnam is a far more compelling subject.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
