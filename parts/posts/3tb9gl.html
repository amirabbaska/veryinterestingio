		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was a 'journo' I'd use sources like <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/" target="_blank">http://www.eurekalert.org/</a> to find nice stories that I could rewrite so they were unique and then promote them on social media sites.</p>
<p>Eurekalert is already Buzzfeedy in its headlines, and you can tell when you read a little deeper into the article that the research was not as groundbreaking as the headline makes it appear. It might be a mouse model, it might be just a survey of 2000 people, it might be a study involving 20 people. </p>
<p>Then when I wrote it up, I would purposefully try to avoid anything that highlighted how meaningless the study was, and I'd try to write something even more Buzzfeedy than the actual article. AIDS cure 'around the corner', 'Study: AIDS can be cured by bananas'. If I put some of the headline in 'snatch quotes', i.e. apostrophes, or put a colon indicating that someone had said something, i.e. 'Cameron: Fuck Daesh', then I would have covered my ass from misrepresenting the topic, provided I didn't totally misrepresent it.</p>
<p>And I was churning out 5,000 words a day, often researching and spinning a 200-word article in 20 minutes. I would honestly just skimread the original source, I'd only actually read it to fully understand it if I was personally interested in the research. Furthermore, my understanding of complicated science is nowhere near good enough to be able to criticise a scientific study, all I'd do is 'spin' it. Churnalism, it's called.</p>
<p>Shockingly, one of my skills is being able to push things to the top of Google search results. Quite often, when writing something more meaty, my research would be reading whatever was at the top of Google search results, which I know full well is written by someone who's just as big a moron as me and who's just as pressed for time as me.</p>
<p>tldr, the internet is a tapestry of bullshit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Billy has always been a fan of baseball. One day, he discovers a strange lightweight metal rod that he believes would make a great baseball bat. He begs his parents to get some money so he can get some grip and other materials to turn the metal bar into a bat. His parents, convinced that this is a decent idea that will keep Billy distracted, agree.</p>
<p>Now Billy has a prototype bat with the metal that he found. He tests the bat against other bats and shows all his friends that it performs much better. The local baseball coach sees Billy using the bat and wonders if it can be sold as a commercial product.</p>
<p>But now, any number of issues could prevent the bat from commercial success:</p>
<p><strong>Possible effects on people</strong>: The metal Billy found may actually be harmful to humans with long exposure despite the nice performance properties.</p>
<p><strong>Sourcing</strong>: Maybe the metal was a scrap piece of extremely expensive metal. It would cost too much to get this metal and make them into affordable metal bats.</p>
<p><strong>Manufacturing costs</strong>: Billy may have been a fanatic at handcrafting his bat but trying to make them on a large scale would cost too much money per bat.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong>: Billy may not have used the bat long enough to realize that the metal becomes brittle after a few uses which can cause the bat to perform worse over time or even break.</p>
<p><strong>Regulations</strong>: The little leagues may ban the bat because it is too different (in terms of weight, size, etc.) compared to the standard bats.</p>
<p><strong>Company buyout</strong>: Another company may purchase their bat invention in order to stop it from being manufactured. This prevents it from going on the market so there is no additional competition that would force companies to lower prices.</p>
<p><strong>Management problems</strong>: Having a startup to sell the bat means hiring additional people in addition to just Billy and the coach. It's possible to hire the wrong person or hire people that do not get along which would could cause the startup to fail.</p>
<p>EDIT: Added a few more issues and fixed formatting</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Basically this is how medical research works:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Basic scientist discovers interesting finding- posts about it on Reddit. </li>
<li>Basic scientist tries to get funding to explore further, animal model research, etc (about 90% of discoveries die at this stage due to lack of funding, 10% left).</li>
<li>Discovery is confirmed and scientist looks to find backing to do clinical trials (99.99% of discoveries are dead at this stage, 0.001% of discoveries proceed to clinical trials)</li>
<li>Drug goes through clinical trials, is shown to be effective in humans and is released to public (0.0002% of discoveries make it past this stage, or 2 drugs for every 100,000 discoveries)</li>
<li>Drug is released for sale, 1 person out of 20,000 users gets a sick from it due to unknown reasons, media panics, drug is withdrawn and no one gets it (this part is an exaggeration, but the reality is that plenty of treatments that historically saved millions, like smallpox vaccine, would never be approved today due to modern tolerances for side effects being so low)</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Total time and money spent: ~12 years and ~$1.4 billion.</em></p>
<p>The sad part is that because this process is so time consuming and expensive, only discoveries that could end up very profitable end up ever being explored further. It's entirely possible that among the millions of discoveries that were never explored, a cure for a major disease was lost. A great example of this is with the ebola outbreaks last year. The new experimental drugs companies are rushing to test aren't new compounds. Most have been known about since the mid 1990's but no one bothered to fund a clinical trial to test them until it became a major issue (ie profitable).</p>
<p>Media rarely covers scientific discoveries at stage 1-3 above. At that point, already 99.99% of discoveries are weeded out. </p>
<p><strong>TL:DR For every 100,000 discoveries you hear about, only 2 actually become a drug or treatment. This process takes 12 years on average and costs ~$1.4 billion so only discoveries that can lead to super profitable treatments ever get explored. Media usually only covers these 2 that actual are successful and ignores the 99,998 that aren't.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why possible cures often don't come to much:</p>
<p>Finding something that kills cancer cells <em>might</em> be the start of something good, but more often than not, it isn't. Why? Well look at it this way, put some cancer cells in a petri dish along with a grenade and pull the pin out. When you come back, the cancer cells will be very very dead. However this is not a particularly useful treatment for cancer, as it turns out, it is pretty good at killing non cancerous cells (and any lab assistants that you forgot to tell to duck)</p>
<p>In real life the possible treatments are less black and white (e.g. it happily kills cancer cells, is harmless to almost all the other cells in the body - except one particular type - like liver cells)</p>
<p>That's also why it takes so long for a drug to come to market. First they test it in test-tubes on cell cultures, then they test it on white mice; then chimpanzees and then the human trials can begin. At any of the se points they might discover something that makes it non-viable</p>
<p>Why you see them on the front page:</p>
<p>&quot;Miracle cure for cancer&quot; attracts more upvotes than &quot;Limited trial in-vitro indicates that this chemical has a small chance, at some point way down the line of contributing to a treatment for some cancers&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever you hear that something kills cancer in research / in a petri dish... just remember that a gun kills cancer in a petri dish, too.  </p>
<p>Often times the most promising ground-breaking research doesn't pan out farther down the line when they start trying to apply it to full grown humans.  Maybe it breaks down in our biology (e.g. in our stomachs or when injected), before it can do what it needs to do? Perhaps it has major side effects? Perhaps it works well in rats and pigs in testing, but does nothing for humans?  </p>
<p>Any number of things can, and often do, go wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
