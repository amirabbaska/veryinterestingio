<p>Yes in that in an idealized two-body system, you can have a photon orbit another body of sufficient mass (in this case, a black hole). A two-body system is required, in an <em>idealized universe</em>, otherwise the orbits would be incredibly chaotic and decay instantly. Idealized in that you also cannot have sporadic particle generation (such as that which results in Hawking Radiation) as the force of even those particles would be sufficient to disrupt the photon's orbit.</p>
<p>No in that, as said, their orbits are far too chaotic to exist in the real universe in any situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
