<p>The bacteria in your mouth aren't &quot;attacking&quot; your teeth. They just live there. </p>
<p>You need 3 things to get a cavity.
1) a place for bacteria to hide out and around (teeth)
2) food for them to eat up (the crap you leave on your teeth)
3) bacteria</p>
<p>Any one of those things missing, and you can't get a cavity. </p>
<p>The bacteria are just hiding out in your mouth (and your teeth are one of the places they hide out). They're happily just chillin' and eating the crap you forgot to brush and floss off. And they take a big dump and leave it there. It just so happens the bacteria create acid.  When they take a dump on your tooth, they leave acid behind. It's that that causes your cavities. </p>
<p>All that acidic byproduct is what causes tiny holes in your teeth that turn into bigger holes. </p>
<p>Next thing you know they're like- &quot;holy crap, I just built myself a nice condo and that muthafucka isn't brushing! Hells yes! It's the muthafuckin' Golden Corral up in this biz&quot;</p>
<p>So, yeah. That pretty much sums it up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not really true. There can be bacteria residing in any part of your body that can become a problem given the chance. There's something called 'dysbiosis' when the normal structure of the bacterial communities in or on your body is out of whack. Maybe one kind of bacteria that is not usually a problem will bloom, causing inflammation and disease. These are called opportunistic pathogens. For example, Staph aureus is a 'commensal' (a bacteria that normally is found in the human microbiome) and most people have it in their nostrils and on their skin. MRSA is a drug resistant strain of Staph aureus, but in people who are vulnerable it can cause nasty skin ulcers, osteomyelitis, or sepsis. I work with MRSA all the time and probably have tracked it onto my skin at some point, but I have never been infected because my immune system works normally, it hasn't encountered open wounds, and I take proper clean up and containment measures. Another example: Candida albicans is a yeast that causes the common female yeast infection. It's also a commensal, meaning that most women have it in their vaginal area at low levels. If given the chance, it can bloom into a full blown infection but by no means is it a infectious transmitted disease like HIV. In short, the bacteria in your mouth in normal cases shouldn't be any more virulent than the bacteria in other parts of your body. In a healthy state bacterial populations are overall stable and avirulent. But if conditions allow a virulent strain to do much much better than its competitors then by god it will take over and wreak havoc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bacteria in your mouth are like junkyard dogs. They are there because they are good at breaking down things that are coming into your body, but they are also aggressive and not well-trained. They'll stop someone from stealing stuff from you, but they might also bite your friend they've never met before.</p>
<p>Also, there are other bacteria in your body that are even worse. The stuff that lives in your intestines is like a pack of wolves. As long as they're contained in your guts, they are great at breaking down almost anything that comes through. If they ever get out, though, they'll try to eat everything they come across.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dental student here. Like most have said before bacteria have evolved along side us for millions of years to foster a mutually beneficial relationship (symbiosis), harmful relationship (parasitism) or neither beneficial/harmful relationship (commensalism) with us humans. Now with that in mind, bacteria in your mouth are quite comfortable where they are and under normal circumstances, in a healthy adult with good oral hygiene, they do us no harm and are just along for the ride. </p>
<p>However, if a change in environment presents itself, such as excessive sugar consumption coupled with improper oral hygiene, they can become what is called opportunistic pathogens. They take this excess sugar and eat it for energy and release acid as the waste product. This acid is what destroys your teeth, and cause cavities. </p>
<p>Many of the species of bacteria that reside inside/on us present this ability to do harm if displaced to another body cavity or their immediate surroundings change in condition (acidity, nutrient supply, less competition etc)</p>
<p>More like an explain like I'm 12 but you get the point.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cavities are caused by the waste products of sugar-consuming bacteria. It wasn't normal, during our evolution, for humans to consume sugar-dense foods day after day. The occasional bounty of fruit or honey might feed those bacteria for a day or so, but that usually wasn't enough time to allow cavities to develop. Cavities are mainly a modern problem caused by modern diets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
