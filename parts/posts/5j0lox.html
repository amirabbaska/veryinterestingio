		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I currently work at a UPS store so I can add a bit as far as UPS goes. Ground is the &quot;unguaranteed&quot; shipping service. 3 Day Select, 2nd Day Air, and Next Day Air all have &quot;guaranteed&quot; delivery dates. Both Ground and 3 Day Select typically travel by ground, usually by large bulk transport from one hub to the next, then the smaller delivery trucks from the hub to the destination. 2nd Day Air and Next Day Air typically travel by air, of course, taking a plane from one hub to the next and then a delivery truck from the hub to the house for delivery. Since both Ground and 3 Day Select travel by ground, what do you imagine happens, say, during this holiday season when UPS is bogged down by boxes? If they have more boxes than they can handle, the 3 Day Select all get loaded before the Ground does. If they can't fit all the Ground, that is considered acceptable. All Air parcels are guaranteed, so the extra you pay for is sometimes just profit for UPS, sometimes the extra you pay goes into buying space on another plane for just a few packages. There may be only, say 100 air packages remaining for a day that go on a plane that can fit 5000 packages. The extra you pay for on the Air service helps keep Air shipping profitable. Another difference is that 3 Day Select, 2nd Day Air, and Next Day Air can all have claims be paid on the shipment if they are simply late to arrive. If a Ground shipment arrives late, you'll simply be told that Ground is not guaranteed. Sorry, that was kind of long-winded. Hopefully that answers your question at least. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each company handles their logics differently. But usually a guaranteed delivery date means faster which often means putting it in a plane instead of a semi-truck. Once The air shipment is delivered near your home city a guaranteed package is sorted in a smaller pile of guaranteed deliveries as opposed to the ground. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Fedex Ground and Fedex Express are actually two different companies. When sending something time sensitive they give it to express. Express tags it more and scans it more and has more &quot;eyes on your package. They also put it on a plane to avoid traffic back ups and other typical ground problems. Ground also has a knack for not tracking your package as much. AND they often don't scan a whole lot and often miss certain scan checkpoints. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes they only have one plane going from the shipping spot to the delivery spot. If there are two planes worth of packages, half don't get on that plane, and end up delayed. Paying for the guarantee makes sure that yours is in the half that gets onto the plane. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
