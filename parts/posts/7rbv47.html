		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your mouth makes saliva, which is mostly water (which takes a lot of energy to heat) and at your body's temperature.  Mixing 10 mL (2 tsp) of very hot liquid and perhaps 20 mL of saliva, means that the very hot liquid is quickly cooled.  </p>
<p>Your skin has no saliva, so the heat from your coffee transfers to a small part of your body, dramatically raising the temperature of the affected area and giving you a burn.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people have good points but I'd like to add something on. When you have a cup of hot coffee, it's not all uniform in temperature. The top of the coffee loses heat to the air making it a bit cool. When you take a small sip, your typically just drinking this slightly cooler part of the coffee. You can probably stick the tip of your finger in just the top of your coffee and be fine too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you get burned, it is because heat energy is absorbed into the body and rises to a level where tissues become irritated or damaged. How quickly heat is absorbed, and how long it stays in place depend on what part of the body. </p>
<p>In an automobile you have the engine, which creates a lot of heat, but you have channels of water running through the engine that carry that heat outwards to the radiator. This is similar to what blood vessels in the body do. The more blood vessels and blood flow to a body part, and the greater it's ability to absorb and distribute heat is. </p>
<p>The tongue is very vascular, it is packed with blood vessels and muscles so while it absorbs heat very quickly, it also dissipates it quickly. </p>
<p>The fingers by comparison are mostly bone and cartilage with very little blood flow. So heat going into the fingers, or back of the hand, tends to linger. Or consider hot water on the back of your arm, where the heat is absorbed by subcutaneous fat, but again, the blood flow isn't as great so it tends to linger. </p>
<p>The other thing is that while the tongue, lips, and gums can become damaged, they also heal very quickly. Sores in the mouth and tongue can heal in days, where as ones on the skin may take weeks. </p>
<p>Lastly, when water evaporates it carries heat with it, and as we breath, swallow, cough, suck air in our mouths, etc, we lose a lot of heat from evaporative cooling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
