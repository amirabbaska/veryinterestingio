		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In chronological order: </p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the French surrendered twice: First in 1814, after which Napoleon was sent into exile at Elba. Then again after he came back in early 1815 and was defeated at Waterloo. </li>
<li>During the Franco-Prussian War, the entire French Army was surrounded by the Germans at Sedan and surrendered. This defeat was catastrophic and cost them the war. </li>
<li>During World War I, the French Army mutinied and refused to attack anymore. (They still fought defensively) They decided to wait over a year until tanks and American soldiers arrived before they would go on the offense again. In perhaps the greatest intelligence failure of all time, the Germans failed to learn of the strike. </li>
<li>During World War II, the French surrendered after the German blitzkrieg had overrun the Allied armies in Belgium. </li>
<li>During the First Indo-China War, the French (who fought the entire war with a succession of terrible commanders, little political commitment, and no long-term planning) decided to try to sever the Vietminh supply lines using an airbase situated in the middle of a bunch of hills at Dien Bein Phu. Instead, the Vietminh surrounded them and shelled them for weeks until they gave up. The defeat was catastrophic and cost them the war. </li>
<li>EDIT: I'll also add that in 1759 the French were defeated at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (just outside of Quebec) and surrendered. This defeat was catastrophic and cost them the French and Indian War (that's the 7 Years War to you Europeans)  </li>
</ul>
<p>Fun fact: During Vietnam, American commadner William Westmooreland was asked if they could learn anything from the french experience. His reply was (paraphrasing) &quot;Why would we try to learn anything from the French? They haven't won a battle since the age of Napoleon.&quot; - which is both historically inaccurate (they won both battles of the Marne and Verdun during World War I, just to name two very important counter-examples) and indicative of Westmooreland's incompetency. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Broadcast
21st October 1940 by Winston Churchill</p>
<p>Frenchmen! For more than 30 years in peace and war I have marched with you.</p>
<p>I am marching still along the same road. Tonight I speak to you at your firesides, wherever you may be, or whatever your fortunes are: I repeat the  prayer that upon the louis d'or, &quot;Dieu protege la France&quot;</p>
<p>Here at home in England, under the the fire of the Bosche we do not forget the ties and links that unite us to France . . .</p>
<p>Here in London, which Her Hitler says he will reduce to ashes, and which his aeroplanes are now bombarding, our people are bearing up unflinchingly. Our Air Force has more than held its own.  We are waiting for the long promised invasion.  So are the fishes . . .</p>
<p>Frenchmen - rearm your spirits before it is too late. Remember how Napoleon said before one of his battles:î   These same Prussians who are so boastful today were three to one at Jena, and six to one at Montmirailî</p>
<p>Never will I believe that the soul of France is dead! Never will I believe that her place amongst the greatest nations of the world has been lost forever.</p>
<p>Remember that we shall never stop,  never weary, and never give in . . . We seek to beat the life and soul out of Hitler and Hitlerism. That alone - that all the time - that to the end. Those French who are in the French Empire, and those who are in the so-called unoccupied France, may see their way from time to time to useful action, I will not go into details  . . hostile ears are listening . . .</p>
<p>Good night then: Sleep to gather strength for the morning.  For the morning will come. brightly it will shine on the brave and true, kindly upon all who suffer for the cause, glorious upon the tombs of heroes. Thus will shine the dawn.</p>
<p>VIVE LA FRANCE!
Long live also the forward march of the common people in all lands towards their just and true inheritance, and towards the broader and fuller age.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The French kind of got a bum rap.  It mainly due to WW2 after the German Occupied France, also they had a little issue in Vietnam that went real bad for them, I mean real bad. </p>
<p>Huge part of it is the rivaly with England and France, Napoleonic wars and 100 year war kept that rivalry up.  Also note during the Imperial Age British by the start of WW1  they controlled 25% of the world population and so it not a surprise they would use propaganda to make themselves look better. That little culture war is it own story, so I will stick with military.</p>
<p>In reality France army is no laughing joke. Heavy Calvary during medieval times where unmatched, and feared.  WW! they held their own for a long time, long before us Yank go in the fight.  Just look up Verdun, which was the benchmark for crazy until Stalingrad.  During WW2 they actually had more tanks which where more advance then the German Panzers at the time.  The issue was they where spread them out across Maginot Line.  Which kept them from spear attack of the German Bliz.  This did not just catch the French off guard but also the British allies.  Look up Battle of Dunkirk.  Even though the French government surrendered, The military and French people kept fighting a lot of time out gunned with no reinforcements for years, they don't sound like quitters to me.</p>
<p>Then the Indochina wars or when as we Americans join in the Vietnam war, well that was clusterfuck nobody did well in that. </p>
<p>Also  us silly Americans would not of won our little spat with England over our Independence.  They recognized us as a Nation, supplied us with guns, tanning, and at a critical moment their Navy. Yeah the French cock block the British and we knew it.  It why good old 100 dollar Benny when to France to have a talk.  Now I just list some of really big stuff that effect the whole world but the smaller engagements are really show their strength.  The French commanders are brilliant and most of time they actually show it. Which is why you heard of Napoleon. The issue with that brilliants is when it all go wrong, it like a giant spot light pointing at the mistake, and history only remember the failures more often then the success.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly it comes down to historical ignorance. Many people in America only know very recent history.  In World War 2 France was overwhelmed by the German onslaught and surrendered very quickly.  Allied troops then had to invade Europe and liberate France so it be became sort of a joke that the French were weak militarily.  Fast forward to 2003 when the French refused to back the US invasion of Iraq and this joke became even deeply more rooted as people viewed the French as weak or not willing to help the US like the US helped the French.</p>
<p>All of this ignores the facts that France has an illustrious military history and that the United States wouldn't exist without French help.  The French fought tenaciously and suffered immensely during World War 1.  Their casualty numbers are staggering.  Anyone who makes fun of French military history basically doesn't know history. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A two-third overall rate of victory in battles is pretty insane.</p>
