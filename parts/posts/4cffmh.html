		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The average life expectancy in Indonesia is about 70 to 71 years, according to Google.
Also, according to google, the average age of diagnosing Cancer is about 70. Also, 2 out of 3 People that are diagnosed with lung cancer are above 65 years old, according to google.</p>
<p>People in Indonesia just die earlier, before they get lung cancer.</p>
<p>Edit:
As many people said, they don't die before they get lung cancer, they die before they are diagnosed with lung cancer, a bad wording on my part. Of course there are many factors that come into play, like the actual rate of diagnosing lung cancer. But much of it simply comes down to the age of death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Who said in Indonesia, lung cancer rate is low?I am Indonesian, despite im not smoking, actually in here, so many people got lung cancer, especially when they hit 50 age+, average smokers took about 1-2 dozens pack of cigar. The only difference is, indonesia people so easily to got diabetes, stroke, uric acid, so yeah like some top comment above, most of us die not because we have low rate cancer. diabetes is the most dangerous deadly sick on our country</p>
<p>And seems you got little wrong info about our country, our country is not poor, what are true is the difference of poor and rich is so big, and so many small town in here, infrastructure and tall building are concentrated only on java and bali island, leave a bad impressions about poor town in other island, and our GDP gap os big too, lets say you work in jakarta (capital) as english interpreter on medium company with 2 years experience, u can got 1000$ permonth, where on surabaya city, with same skill, experience, u may got 400$ only. So, yeah our wage is so different, even on same island and same skill </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Credit to /u/Turtleton</p>
<p>Some good answers here but to me the most obvious one is that people don't live long enough to develop lung cancer.</p>
<p>Some statistics:</p>
<p>Average life expectancy of Indonesia: 70.61 years (source: <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN/countries/ID-4E-XN?display=graph" target="_blank">http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN/countries/ID-4E-XN?display=graph</a>)</p>
<p>Average age of lung cancer diagnosis: 70 (source: <a href="http://www.cancer.org/cancer/lungcancer-non-smallcell/detailedguide/non-small-cell-lung-cancer-key-statistics" target="_blank">http://www.cancer.org/cancer/lungcancer-non-smallcell/detailedguide/non-small-cell-lung-cancer-key-statistics</a>)</p>
<p>Therefore in developed countries where the risk of other life threatening diseases is lower people are more likely to live long enough to develop lung cancer. In poorer countries such as Indonesia there are other more life threatening illnesses that lower the life expectancy and prevent people from living long enough to develop lung cancer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
