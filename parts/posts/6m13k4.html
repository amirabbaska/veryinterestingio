		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so I'm not sure if this actually fits here, and I understand if it doesn't. I just can't find an answer to this question no matter how many times I look.</p>
<p>So for some context, I myself am a burn survivor; having survived 30-36% coverage at 15 months old. There are a few things I've always noticed that are distinctly different about me because of my burns than, say my family (who were my reference point while trying to figure this stuff out).</p>
<p>First, I overheat extremely quickly (within 30 minutes when temperatures hit 90F) and I know this is due to me lacking upward of 70% of my sweat glands.</p>
<p>The second and third I feel are pretty closely tied together; they are I'm almost always thirsty and if I'm not it generally doesn't last long. I also &quot;run out of water&quot;, so to speak, at an alarming rate when sweating. At least for the relatively little sweating I do.</p>
<p>Now, I've been trying to find an answer to this specific query for YEARS and haven't found anything relating to post recovery, only in hospital treatment. As such, as a burn survivor am I more prone to dehydration because of my burns?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a link between kidney damage and burns- it can be fatal and/or cause renal failure. Burns and tissue damage flood your flowing blood with &quot;exploded&quot; cells, infection, dirt, general debris and gunk. The kidneys filter the blood of ions and water, and this mixture of  &quot;gunk&quot; can damage kidneys.
I am not a medical doctor- I only studied biomedical science so speak with your own doctor about this but it may be that you have some scarring and damage to your kidneys.
