<p>Guy A has a 2 inch penis when flaccid. Guy B has a 6 inch penis when flaccid. When Guy A is aroused, his penis grows to 6 inches. When Guy B is aroused, it basically stay the same size but only gets hard.</p>
<p>What is happening with Guy A's penis? Like.. Where does Guy A's length go when he is soft? Sorry if the question was unclear.. Just was curious and having a hard time explaining in words what I am trying to ask. lol    </p>
<p>Edit: Umm.. I didn't expect this question to be so popular. </p></div></div>
