<p>I believe it's because of a conflict in the moment; you want to possibly fight (or somehow contribute), but can't. You instinctively bring your hands up, but can do nothing. So you show your helplessness by placing your hands on your head.</p>
<p>It is literally what you are told to do when being approached to be arrested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it is just a cultural thing. Kind of like saying &quot;ouch&quot;. When I went to Portugal, whenever I saw someone get hurt, instead of saying &quot;ouch&quot;, they would instead say &quot;ayee&quot; really loudly. In India, instead of putting their hands on their head, they put four fingers on their forehead and move it around. I thought this was kind of weird because my parents never do this (I am Indian), but my dad said that when he came to America and got used to the mannerisms here, he picked up the whole putting hands on the head thing. It came naturally after witnessing others do it so often.</p>
<p>I do not believe it is an evolutionary trait, however, I believe that it is more of a &quot;monkey-see, monkey-do&quot; effect on humans. When we spend a lot of time with others who behave a certain way, we pick up those behaviors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's comforting/a form of self control. Think of it like having a headache, holding your head might not make it feel better, but we're drawn to comfort it. In the case of self control, if you <del>fucked</del> h*cked up (forgot about 5 yr old) real bad sometimes hurting yourself makes the person feel in control and relaxes them. When they hold their head in that instance, it's more like pushing against their head/pulling hair to give that pain-control feeling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
