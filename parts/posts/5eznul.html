From your frame you calculate the kinetic energy of all this particles.</p>
<p>Then Neil pushes you while grabbing the spaceship, giving you the same speed and direction as this particles. From your new frame of reference all this stuff is standing still. The kinetic energy you can measure now is from the spaceship and from Neil which is less than the original. </p>
<p><strong>What happened with the energy? Where does it go? Or is energy relative?</strong></p>
<p>...You then remember Neil has just double-crossed you and curse him at the top of your lounges  while you descend into deep space</p></div></div>
