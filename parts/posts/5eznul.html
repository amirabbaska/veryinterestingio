From your frame you calculate the kinetic energy of all this particles.</p>
<p>Then Neil pushes you while grabbing the spaceship, giving you the same speed and direction as this particles. From your new frame of reference all this stuff is standing still. The kinetic energy you can measure now is from the spaceship and from Neil which is less than the original. </p>
<p><strong>What happened with the energy? Where does it go? Or is energy relative?</strong></p>
<p>...You then remember Neil has just double-crossed you and curse him at the top of your lounges  while you descend into deep space</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's right, the kinetic energy (KE) you measure for a system depends on your frame of reference. This idea is both true in classical  mechanics (i.e. the kinetic energy is not Galilean invariant) as well as in special relativity (the kinetic energy is not Lorentz invariant). The simplest example is a ball sitting on the floor of a bus. In the frame of reference of someone sitting on the bus, the ball is standing still and can be said to have zero kinetic energy. On the other hand, for a bystander on the ground, the ball is moving at the same speed as the bus (v) and so its kinetic energy will be 1/2mv^(2). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like y'all are overthinking this. The energy didn't change, the system did. The kinetic energy exists in the first system, and it doesn't exist in the second system. The energy in the first system was defined about a static point, and about that static point the kinetic energy of those particles has not changed. Some people are wondering if it's now potential energy in the second system, i's not, the particles have kinetic energy in the first system, and they have no kinetic energy in the second system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another way of seeing this is that while <em>total</em> energy is constant, kinetic vs potential has to do with your frame of reference. Once that smug bastard shoved you off into space, your frame changed. You and all those particles are now headed into oblivion at the same rate, so they look still.</p>
<p>Measuring the kinetic energy of the laughing and receding Neil et. al, however should give you the same answer that Neil gets as he giggles, watches you receding and measures <em>your</em> kinetic energy. </p>
<p>Note that this <em>will</em>  be different from the total kinetic energy Neil observes, as in your example he did not impart any to the particles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're going to be a purest about your frame of reference being absolute, then you have to introduce a law of physics that says your velocity must always be zero. This new physics would then need other laws introduced to make it consistent. One such law would say that whenever you are pushed, a force is exerted to accelerate every object in the universe that isn't attached to you. </p>
<p>You would observe this force as Niel pushes you and notice its effect of decelerating all of your aforementioned particles to zero.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Einstein's relativity gives pretty nice answer to this:</p>
<p>Energy is zero component of four-momentum. Four-momentum is a four-vector. Four-vectors depends on the reference frame you are in. They must be transformed if you go from one reference frame to the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
