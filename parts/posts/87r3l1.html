		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cell membranes are made up of different types of fatty acids. Some fatty acids can be packed more than others, therefore affecting their melting point. Think of butter and oils; butters are mainly solid (compact, saturated fats), while oils are mainly liquid (less compact, unsaturated fats). Now our cell membranes must maintain a proper fluidity to function, so they have the ability to change the types of fatty acids over time. When it is cold, the cell membrane is consists of more fatty acids that compact less. Think of how hard butter is when it is cold; now imagine your cell membranes are too hard! When it is hot, less compact fatty acids create a membrane that is too fluid. This would cause an improper shape, so the membrane begins to incorporate the compact fatty acids. So basically, hot —&gt; more compact fatty acids; cold—&gt; less compact fatty acids. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At altitudes over 3,000 meters, people are exposed to hypoxia, a condition in which the body is exposed to air with low levels of oxygen. To counteract this deficit, the heart and breathing rates get faster. This alone is sufficient to increase the amount of oxygen in the body for a short period of time. For longer amounts of time, this adaptation is not sufficient and the increased work rates start posing significant risks.</p>
<p>Acclimatization is a biological process to create more red blood cells and increase the flow of oxygen in the blood.  This makes it possible to normalize the heart rate and regulate hyperventilation to a certain extent.  If a person spends several weeks above 4,500 meters, the percentage of red blood cells in the blood can more than double. </p>
