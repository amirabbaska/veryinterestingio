		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>it mentioned that Jupiter has a core of mostly hydrogen and helium that's 96% of the planet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So first a little clarification - if you reread the article carefully, that's not what's described, nor what scientists think:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The mission has also produced a partial answer to the question of whether the planet has a core, showing that the inner 96% of the planet rotates “as a solid body”, even though technically it is composed of an extraordinarily dense mixture of hydrogen and helium gas.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a little ambiguous from the above statement, but those are separate clauses about the core and the solid-body-rotation portion. The core is relatively small (some ~20 Earth-masses compared to the planet's entire mass of 318 Earth-masses), and made of rock and exotic high-pressure ice. Surrounding that is a mantle of liquid metallic hydrogen that makes up the bulk of the planet's mass.</p>
<p>Now to your question: this isn't about the core being asymmetrical, but rather the overlying layers.</p>
<p>There's been a raging scientific debate for decades about how deep the jets go, the same ones that we see from typical images of the cloud-tops (by &quot;jets&quot;, I mean the bands of wind, just like the jet stream on Earth). Are the jets just a shallow &quot;surface&quot; phenomenon in the upper atmosphere, with solid-body rotation just below them? Or are they produced down deep in the planet, and extend upwards to the cloud layer? Or maybe only the equatorial jet is a deep one, and the other ones are shallow?</p>
<p>It turns out that any layer where you have jets, there's going to be some kind of asymmetric mass distribution. This is because of something known as the &quot;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/fDm4jga.jpg" target="_blank">geostrophic wind</a>&quot; - imagine there's high pressure at one latitude and low pressure at another latitude. As gas tries to flow in the north-south direction from high pressure to low pressure, it gets caught up in the Coriolis force (which is very strong on Jupiter thanks to its very fast rotation). This ends up diverting the gas sideways into east-west motion, and producing a jet in the process. </p>
<p>This also means the difference in pressure is maintained by the jet - the pressure difference across latitude can't resolve, and the jet acts like a fence between the high-pressure and low-pressure latitudes. This also means that there's going to be a mass difference between those two regions, since high-pressure also means more mass in this case. Since we don't see the exact same jets in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, we also expect some north-south asymmetry in mass.</p>
<p>In order to determine how deep the jets actually extend, Juno precisely measured the gravitational anomalies of the planet - if we can measure there are mass differences across latitudes down deep, that must mean there are jets down there, too. The point of the research here is that those mass differences (and thus the jets) extend about 4% of the way down. That lies somewhere in the middle of what most folks though about this debate: deeper than the shallow-jet folks though, but shallower than the deep-jet folks thought.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Jets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Earth's gravitational field isn't perfectly symmetric either due to the presence of surface and internal mass anomalies that are not distributed evenly (e.g. cold dense subducting slabs).  The following link shows an exaggerated image of the Earth's geoid but you get the idea.</p>

The tiny fluctuations they <em>do</em> pick up are caused by fluctuations like denser clouds in one spot, or the iron-rich remnants of a planet it sucked up a billion years ago. This works on Earth <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/new-gravity-mapping-climate-predicting-satellite-set-to-launch-from-russia.html" target="_blank">too</a>. But even on earth, these variations are negligible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>High pressure physicist here to throw in what I know. The majority of the hydrogen in Jupiter is supposed to be solid metallic hydrogen, not actually a gas, which is partially based on theory and on experimentalists findings such as Ike Sylvera from the Harvard high pressure physics group. This solid hydrogen is supposed to be a super conductor, super conductors expel their magnetic fields which is known as the Meissner effect. There's bound to be a radius of the planet that's right on the border of this transition pressure, and you have a mix of different states going through transitions. This could certainly account for variations in the fields.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
