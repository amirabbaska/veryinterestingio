		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, you'd feel very little. This is is actually a fairly common situation that is encountered when sailing. When running with the wind (ie the wind is to the back, and pushing the boat forward), the crew will feel very little breeze. </p>
<p>In the sailing world, though, this is actually when a lot of things can go wrong. Crews become complacent because it feels like there is no wind, but the boat is actually under a lot of strain.. Gybes under that kind of power can seriously damage the rigging.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, my highest rated comment ever, and just about an observation from sailing. Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, there is a range (determined by how strong a cyclists you are) where you can estimate the speed of the  (tail)wind by matching your cycling speed until you feel no breeze. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Riding in a balloon has this effect, too. Since the balloon is driven by the wind with no resistance, it moves exactly with the wind and therefore the passengers experience no wind at all, at least if the wind is rather continuous. You'd still feel gusts of wind, because the balloon's inertia prevents it from following every gust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe from the tires and road interaction (like a dynamotmeter), but in perfect physics land you wouldnt feel any airflow. The air and car would be stationery with respect to each other in that frame of reference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Wherever it is green, you're basically not going to feel the difference but inside the car and at the front/back you will. You might feel a slight perturbation outside the car but not much simply due to boundary layer effects and shedding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
