		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT:  i am amazed and humbled by the kind words and beautiful stories shared here.  they are treasures.  please write them down so your sons and daughters can read them.  I threw this list together really fast and posted it.  imagine my surprise when i saw my in box and almost fell over.  so i made some changes, mainly in explaining more thoroughly and in more detail to &quot;explain like i am five&quot;.  i also added a few, that i had forgotten.</p>
<p>the list was very errr, cold and clinical and i did not convey my love for this work.  some of your responses reminded me i need to address this.  we live in a &quot;youth worship&quot; western country, often where the wise elders are forgotten, death and dying are hidden, not discussed, taboo, whereas at one time in our past, death was as normal as birth, with the working close to the land and animals, we knew and were familiar with the natural swing of life and death.  we run from death, we do everything we can to make ourselves younger, and to avoid that inevitable experience we will all have.  working for hospice allows me to become a part of an elder's life, to bring my support to them when it may be needed most.  i consider it a calling to bring more awareness of the normal reality of death.  and more awareness of the incredible sweetness of being able to support a loved one through their passage.  i cannot convey to you the blessing of being able to walk with a patient from the beginning of their journey, to the end of their life.  it is the most vulnerable, most tender of mercies to be able to have the privilege to witness that passage.  if you have the opportunity to be present for an elder during this journey, please try to.  It may change you forever in a good way.  It is the most spiritual of moments I have had in my lifetime.  You may want to even volunteer for hospice to be able to serve our wise elderly and walk with them through this time, to acompany them at a time they may be abandoned (it happens).   You will be rewarded greatly.</p>

<ol>
<li>Withdrawing from interaction.</li>
<li>No interest in food or water (beware, pt can aspirate at this point if forced to eat or drink).</li>
<li>02 (oxygen blood saturation level often called &quot;sats&quot; or &quot;sat level&quot;) levels dropping (70 and below),  Normal is 90s.  I find using the oximeter is very helpful.</li>
<li>Color changes.. skin can go very pasty and grey</li>
<li>Mottling of knees, elbows.  Mottling is a kind of blue/ white effect on the skin that may look a bit like bruising.</li>
<li>Blueness of fingernail beds, slight facial blueness around nose, mouth.  Blank staring at ceiling or corner and or talking to a family member long deceased.</li>
<li>Muscle wasting at temples and eyes sinking into boney orbits</li>
<li>Apneic and or shallow respiration.  Near the end a patient will often start to breathe irregularly.  This is called apnea and or cheyne stokes respiration.  what you will see is the patient breathes, then pauses.  then breathes again.  this can go on for a while or it can be near the end.  as the patient gets closer to passing, the pauses will start to be longer than the breathing.  i.e. starting... 10 seconds of pause, 50 seconds of respiration.  then 20 second pause, 40 seconds of respirations (i use the second hand of my watch to count).  As the time passes, the pauses become longer and longer.  This is the place of truly near death.. as the pauses become longer and longer, the pauses will gently last until the patient gently passes.  it can be an almost seamless and very peaceful thing to watch.  they drift into death, and you wait for the next breath, and it just doesn't come.  these are the deaths one hopes for, the good deaths with family around the bed, as the patient literally just slips away.</li>
<li>Sweaty, hot skin and or clammy cold skin.</li>
<li>Small dove like sounds on exhalation.</li>
<li>Inability to interact verbally.
Remember the sense of hearing lingers .. your loved one will hear you to the very very end despite showing no outward signs or inability to move or respond verbally.</li>
<li>Cooling of extremities (hands and feet).</li>
<li>Phlegmy sounds.  This is what is commonly called the &quot;death rattle&quot;.  Pt cannot swallow their oral secretions at end of life and these may build up in the throat.  The sound you hear is the sound of the inhalation and exhalation air going over around and through those secretions in the throat.  Lay the patient on their side and the secretions can come out.  There is also a medication that can be used to help with this (drops) (can't remember name of it sorry) but the medication can take a while to take effect.  I have been told that though this is difficultf for us to hear, it is not painful for the patient.  This can be hard.  Sometimes the nurse can drain the mucousy secretions with a machine, but it is said that the more the machine is used, the more secretions are manufactured.</li>
<li>
<p>There is a type of respiration that is often seen near the end, and it is best described as breathing &quot;like a fish out of water&quot;.  Patient will often use auxillary muscles (like their shoulders and upper torso) to try to breathe.  </p>
</li>
<li>Pain.<br />
A)     Physical pain.   What I have found is that it is very very difficult to die if you are in intractable pain.  the muscles are tense and hard, the body is wracked, the pain becomes all encompassing.  the goal is to make the patient comfortable and to ease pain.  this could mean trying differrent medications to assist with pain reduction.  I cannot tell you the many times that finally, once the patient is relieved of physical pain, they can RELAX and let go. </li>
</ol>
<p>B)    MYTH.. we do NOT kill our patients with medications.  this is ILLEGAL.  What we try to do is find the balance of pain relievers that will allow the patient to be pain free, and also allow them to still carry on with their normal activities and at the end, be able to speak or communicate if they are able.  example:  some patients are in so much pain when they come to us, they are unable to do anything.  with the right meds, one lady was able to take her crafts to her regular craft fair out of state with her hubby in their RV, for the last time, to say goodbye to all her craft fair colleagues she had known and worked with for 30 years.  another man was able to go spend a last visit at the cabin he built up in the mountains.   Another patient was able to go to disneyland with her family, one last time.  Medications are a wondrous thing.  We learn what the patient would like to do and we try to find the medications that will allow them to do that.  We will often pay for a final wish like this.</p>
<p>C)     Emotional Pain.  Sometimes called spiritual pain.  releasing emotional pain can come with counseling with spiritual counselors and social workers (both available through hospice).   At end of life there may be issues that are unresolved with family members that have caused patient deep regret and grief.  EMOTIONAL PAIN CAN TURN INTO PHSYSICAL PAIN THAT NO PHARMACOLOGICAL MEDICATION CAN TOUCH.  Although sometimes resolution may be impossible, our counselors do their best to help patient resolve conflicts and issues that are a burden to patient and a burden to the family members.  NOTE:  these resolutions could mean the diffference between a peaceful death and a difficult death.  </p>
<p>There is something we can see, a definite change of pallor, expression, something hard to explain, that can tell an experienced eye that it is soon.</p>
<p>It is very hard to tell you exactly when it will happen but the above are some     things to watch for.</p>

<p>Many of your comments were around hearing at end of life.  Here's just one article.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ER nurse:
I usually see people die more quickly but we do have a lot of older folks whose family brings them in close to death ( keep your parents at home and let them die in comfort people I promise you dont want to see CPR on your 87 yr old grandma)
When are people going to die:
1: When they tell you. Never take this lightly they know! Get ahold of family quickly.
2: If they have been sick and suddenly they feel better. They are going to die soon.
3: Its hard to explain but their breathing changes. It become more shallow. Their 02 stats slowly drop. Aka death rattle
4: Their color changes. Becomes more grey.
5: Cold extremeties
6: If they ask you to hold their hand bc they are scared. Hold it no matter how many other patients you have. Hold it. No one should die alone.
7: If some one comes in with chest pain and they tell you they have to poop really bad. DONT LET THEM they are gonna die.
Clearly these are not scientific just little things i have learned over the years </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In hospitals at least, patients seem to know. They often say &quot;I'm going to die&quot; or they will ask to contact a relative. You do not take these requests lightly; dying people know when they're getting close.</p>
<p>Also, experience. People can look really really ill for weeks or months, but one day you'll look at someone and they'll look different from an hour ago. More grey in colour, or a different facial expression, or... you just <em>know</em>. </p>
<p>All this of course aside from clinical findings, respiratory rate, BP, blood tests if you're still doing that stuff by this point, etc etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Experience from taking care of my 98 year old great grandmother: </p>
<p>She died slowly and totally of old age. She was on hospice for over a year (very tough lady). The biggest signs were her oxygen levels going down, lack of appetite and refusal to urinate. That’s what happens when you die strictly of old age, though. She had zero medical issues throughout her life and more or less just “shut down”. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a GP dealing with a primarily elderly population, and a good rule of thumb is this:</p>
<p>If they're clearly getting worse over the course of months, they likely have months. If there's a clear decline over the course of weeks, they likely have weeks. If it's days, they have days. </p>
<p>Occasionally, I'll get surprised, and a person who seems to have been stable dies in their sleep. Interestingly, though, the people in these cases frequently seemed to have known that their time was coming in the weeks beforehand, and often may have asked to speak with a priest, or get their affairs in order otherwise. </p>
<p>It mainly boils down to experience, trajectory, and listening to your patients. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
