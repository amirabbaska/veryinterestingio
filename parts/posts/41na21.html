		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You open yourself up to more diseases eating human flesh.</p>
<p>Viruses tend to be very specific to a species, and it is rare for them to jump.  So if you are eating beef meat contaminated with some virus that is affecting the cow, chances are you won't catch it.  But if you are eating human flesh, that is contaminated with HIV, you now have a very good chance of contracting it. </p>
<p>Kuru is a disease that spreads almost exclusively by cannibalism.  It is a mutated prion (protein) that can spread to surrounding brain matter.  Resulting in a loss of motor control, impaired cognitive abilities, uncontrolled laughing, swelling in joints, and eventually death.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I get the feeling that most answers are overly negative. The risk is not very high and cannibalism isn't inherently detrimental to the body.
It is true that the risk to consume human-specific diseases is higher, but most of these don't survive cooking temperatures. As for prion diseases, unless you develop it spontaneously --which thus doesn't make eating people the cause-- you have to eat someone who already has the disease to me contaminated. Plus CJD and brain-degenerative prion diseases become a huge risk only if you consume the brain.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is, this is less detrimental to the body than you think, find someone healthy far away from hospitals and nursing homes, don't eat your family, cook them well and, just in case, don't eat the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your own species meat is infected with diseases that can also infect you, by definition.  (Conversely with other animals, some but not all diseases can be spread by under-cooked meat.) There are also some degenerative diseases that are spread by mis-shaped proteins, which you can generally only get by eating a human brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

She said &quot;that's what you get from eating people's brain&quot;.  It's a prion based disease called <del>Kiri Kiri</del> Kuru - related to mad cow disease.</p>
<p>So that is literally my experience as a five year old with Cannibalism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're not eating the brains, its actually safe (cook the meat like any other animal to be safe) and don't eat people with diseases once again like any other animal but cannibalism is generally seen as bad because we've developed a disgust to it. This is likely because its easier for a society to flourish if the people aren't eating each other.</p>
<p>To get messed up here, it would probably be really good meat, exact amino acids necessary to build human muscles and a lot of good minerals as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
