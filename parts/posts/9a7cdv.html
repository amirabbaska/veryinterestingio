		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an optician. There a couple of answers that are close, but not quite there. What makes your glasses &quot;work&quot; is the difference in curvature between the front surface of the lens and the rear surface. This bends the light to focus properly. Depending on your prescription, the curvature can be either concave or convex. For example, people who have had cataract surgery without an implant (which is rather rare now) will use what are called lenticular lenses. These have a very noticeable half-dome protruding from the lens. People that are extremely myopic (near-sighted) can have lenses that are double concave, or bowl shaped on both sides (again, this is quite unusual). The majority of lenses are mostly convex on the front surface and concave on the rear (due to something we call base curvature), but there are many exceptions. It's the difference in degree between these curvatures that gives the desired effect.</p>
<p>There are other factors, especially when it comes to materials and their refractive index (how much they slow, or bend, light), but the difference in curvature is the basic reason that the lenses in your glasses work the way they do.</p>
<p>Car windows and the like tend to have nearly identical curvature on the front and rear surfaces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The curved glass of a car has the same curve on both sides, cancelling out almost all of its effect. </p>
<p>Glasses curve inward towards your eye on one side and outwards on the other (which is which depends on what they're meant to correct). </p>
<p>Also, my glasses are made of a type of plastic with a very high refractive index, while car windows are generally made of tempered glass with no special refractive properties aside from being as transparent as practical. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well which window?</p>
<p>the windshild?</p>
<p>That would be the layer of vinyl or plastic sandwiched between the two layers of glass. The plastic sandwich is is why they don't break into sharp shards. The thickness, angles and how they're formed differ as well.</p>
<p>The windows? again aside from the thickness and how they're formed? the glass has  been heated to 1200'F and suddenly chilled to increase the strengths the glass sixfold and to change its break pattern.</p>
