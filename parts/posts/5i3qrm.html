		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is another factor, lake turnover. </p>
<p>Water is its densest at 4 degrees C, or 39.2 degrees F. After that, it gets less dense until it freezes. When the surface of the water cools down to that temperature, it sinks down to the bottom of the lake, and the lake 'turns over'. </p>
<p>This takes the dissolved oxygen from the top of the lake to the bottom, and the water that was on the bottom that is normally low oxygen gets a chance to get more oxygen from the air before the surface freezes over. This can actually be pretty beneficial, because if lakes don't turnover and freeze, the bottom is just always low oxygen and the ecosystem is less dynamic. I was told this is why lakes up north tend to have better fishing than ones that don't freeze over down south.</p>
<p>This was all taken from my Environmental Science and Biology classes, but you can also google lake turnover to get many more details.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ice acts to insulate a body of water, when the top layer of a lake or pond is frozen, the water below stays at a somewhat constant temperature above freezing, and freezes exceptionally slow after the first few inches of ice form. In most cases, especially a flowing river, it'll never have time to freeze completely through before the seasons change again. Additionally, besides the oxygen already dissolved into the water pre-freezing, air is often trapped beneath ice, supplying enough oxygen/CO2 to dissolve into the lake to keep the fish and plant life &quot;breathing.&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Time to reread Catcher in the Rye. Holden Caulfield asks the same question. The other answers are correct but incomplete in that they don't mention winter torpor. When a cold blooded animal, such as a fish, gets cold it becomes torpid; its metabolism slows way down meaning it needs less oxygen and less nutrition to survive. It's almost like hibernation in mammals, but less asleep and more just slowed way down. Fish, frogs, snakes, and most critters that slither or crawl enter a state of torpor during the winter months. Some frogs even freeze solid in their mud nests and then thaw out in the spring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>But they don't always recover.  Certain shallow lakes can have massive amounts of fish die during harsh/long winter,  It's referred to as winterkill. To my understanding when these shallow lakes get cut off from sunlight (via snowfall/ice that isn't clear) the vegetation from the bottom of the lake starts to use up the oxygen from the lake causing fish to die. I'm from northern Minnesota and know of a few lakes that are susceptible to this</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
