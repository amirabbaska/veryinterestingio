		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the last 3-ish million years we've been in an ice age with a cycle of 100,000-year glacial periods and 10,000-year interglacials. So we're still in an ice age, just a warmer period. For most of the last half-billion years the Earth has been warmer with no ice caps, but there were a few other ice ages, notably during the Ordovician and Permian.</p>
<p>It's been more than 10,000 years since the start of this interglacial, so you'd suspect we were due for another glacial, but the timing of these periods isn't that precise, and obviously human influence has caused us to dramatically deviate from the natural climate cycle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had the privilege of meeting NASA climatologist Dr. James Hansen about a decade ago and he gave a presentation on the natural climatic cycles of the earth. The modeling they do accounts for so many details from carbon/methane releases tracked through ice core and fossil samples to the gravitational influence of Jupiter. There is a relatively regular climate cycle over many hundreds of thousands of years. While technically in the foreseeable future we would be due for another ice age based on this trend, instead of a gradual transition with declining temperatures we've exponentially gone in the other direction thanks to the emissions of fossil fuels. So don't expect to chase down acorns in the glaciers anytime soon...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
