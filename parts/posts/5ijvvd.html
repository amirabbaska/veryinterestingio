		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Contrary to the popular belief, neurons do not &quot;fire&quot; by using electrical currents in the traditional sense (electrons moving through a conductor). Instead neurons fire by self propagating action potentials traveling down axons, and causing the depolarization of the next neuron via neurotransmitters and triggering the same self propagating action potential in the next neuron until they reach the effector organ. This &quot;membrane potential&quot; is caused by the difference of the concentrations of ions and charged molecules inside and outside the cell, with the membrane separating them. </p>
<p>Typically, to generate an action potential the membrane potential has to be depolarized down to -70 to -90 mV (These values may differ for different cells). The membrane's depolarization and repolarization is dependent on Na+ and K+ ion movement across the membrane, so it's caused by the movement of charged particles, however I don't think this can be called an electrical current. While really fast, action potentials move much slower compared to electrical currents. </p>
<p>If you don't have any experience in cell biology or physiology, this explanation might not make much sense, but I'd be happy to explain it more in depth if you want me to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a tricky question.</p>
<p>You are correct that when neurons fire, current does flow, but it flows <em>perpendicular</em> to the direction the impulse (or 'spike') is traveling.  In a way, you could think of a neural 'spike' as being a transverse wave, like the wave that propagates when you grab one end of a slinky and shake it side to side.</p>
<p>When you grab one end of a stretched-out slinky and create a transverse wave (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJzxzhv_rgU" target="_blank">this</a>), the slinky doesn't really move in the direction that the wave is traveling.  </p>
<p>Likewise, when a spike travels down a neuron's axon (which is basically like a neuron's cable to connect to other neurons) there is <em>no actual overall flow of current down the axon</em>.  Take a look at <a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol141/Propagation_of_Action_Potential.jpg" target="_blank">this figure</a>, and hopefully you'll see what I mean.  </p>
<p>So, the only current flowing is not actually traveling down the axon, it's squirting out of the axon and then right back in.</p>
<p>Now, there are some numbers to be had.</p>
<p>Individual ion channels generally produce currents of a few pA (picoamperes, 10^-12 amps) when open.  An individual neuron has a great many of these channels, but very few channels are open at a given time, and the number of open channels will change drastically depending on what the neuron is doing. </p>
<p>Here's a slightly better question, perhaps, though.  What is the <em>wattage</em> of the human nervous system?</p>
<p>According to this <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/thinking-hard-calories/" target="_blank">article</a> in Scientific American, which seems like a reasonable ballpark estimate to me, the human brain consumes an estimated 1.09 megajoules per day, or 12.6 joules per second (AKA 12.6 watts).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question. I like /u/Optrode approach of expressing things in joules per second. I just want to check that 13 joules per second seems plausible.</p>
<p>13 joules per second = 1123200 joules per day = 1123 kJ per day. You need to eat around 9000 kJ per day, so that number seems very plausible to me.</p>
<p>I work with a lot of electronics, so I'm very tempted to do a power = volts * current to try to estimate the power loss of a neuron. But I think it would be more sensible to go through the biochemical system. Prof David Attwell calculates that most energy used by the brain is expended during synaptic transmission, and that each synaptic event costs 1.5 x 10^5 ATP molecules. ATP -&gt; ADP releases 30.5 kJ molâˆ’1 so all those ATP molecules release 7.6x10^-15 joules.</p>
<p>So if each synaptic event burns 7.6x10^-15 joules, and the total brain burns 13 joules per second, that then suggests that there are around 1.7 x 10^15 synaptic events per second in the brain. Does that number makes sense? Well there are about 1x10^11 neurons in the brain, which suggests that each neuron must be receiving around 17000 synaptic inputs per second. To me, that number seems a little high, but perhaps only by an order of magnitude. Given that neurons burn energy just to maintain the resting membrane potential, to generate action potentials, and numerous other metabolic processes, we were wrong to assume all the energy expenditure of the brain is due to synaptic transmission.</p>
<p>But if instead of POWER, we were really interested in CURRENT (amperage), then we should go in a different direction. It is undoubtably the case that the highest charge transfer during an event in the brain is the generation of the action potential. Though because neurons are large, and this current takes place spread throughout the cell, it is a little difficult to produce a single number of &quot;what is the total current passed by a cell during an action potential&quot;. That said however, an answer of 1 x 10^-9 A per action potential seems pretty reasonable. If there are 1*10^11 neurons, and we say that must neurons fire about once a second, then every second we have 1x10^11 action potentials, meaning a total of 100 Amps.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, what happens if we used the electronic, power = voltage * current? if we have 100 Amps, with a voltage of around 50 mV (mean difference between sodium reversal potential of the membrane voltage during an AP), that should mean the power output is 5 joules / second. Which is very close to the 13 joules/second we started with, which is quite nice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
