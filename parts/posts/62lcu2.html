		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I don't think it would stop anything.</p>
<p>I have been pissed off about the recent developments though and as a programmer with time on his hands I was thinking of ways I might contribute to subversion of this bullshit.</p>
<p>I think one prong of a multi-pronged solution for the people would be to devalue the data by essentially corrupting it.</p>
<p>Developers would create &quot;pseudo-browsers&quot; or &quot;distorters&quot;. You would load these with personally identifiable info that you are looking to devalue.</p>
<p>These automated browser processes would then bumble about the web using various scripts and redirects architected to basically trash the economic value of the associated 'profile' by intentionally making requests that make the data look suspect/fake and making it difficult to separate &quot;real&quot; user requests from those of their &quot;browser-history distorter&quot;.</p>
<p>IE:
NRA: We'd like to buy a list of users who are into guns.
ISP: $XXXXX.XX, thanks!
NRA: Hey wait, all of these gun lovers seem to be into Hillary Clinton??? And sites about cross-dressing? WTF?</p>
<p>These subversive browsers would really only need to accomplish the goal of making all their users' histories appear more or less the same by making their history more puff than real stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You just made that argument so of course it can be made. I doubt it would hold up in any court though. You might equally say that the ISP isn't selling your list of websites, but only selling the list of the tasks they completed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could make that argument, but it would never fly. Your browser history is just a record of what you have done. It is you making a request of the ISP to get certain data and send certain data out. You can't claim that your request of someone else is somehow intellectual property that you created, since you didn't actually create anything. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
