		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way a solid object stays together as one solid object is because of the forces between the atoms and molecules inside the object. If you push or pull one end of it, that pushes or pulls the bit next to it, which pushes or pulls the bit next to that, and so on and so on until the whole object appears to move together.</p>
<p>However, it actually takes some time for a push or pull on one side of an object to reach the other side. This is actually much slower than the speed of light - it's the speed of sound. This means there's no need for the entire object to get pulled in at once - one part could cross the event horizon before the other end even knows what's happening.</p>
<p>Also, this strength is of course not infinite - if the strength of the bonds in the solid object are weaker than the tidal forces of the black hole, the object will get ripped apart.</p>
<p>So the short answer is that it would break down whatever is falling into it.</p>
<p>The black hole would also expand a bit, just because it's gaining extra mass. But it's not like it's opening its mouth to suck in something bigger than its diameter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of good info here, but nothing I saw that addresses what I'm assuming is the crux of your question. First off, black holes are not &quot;holes&quot;, so something merging with the black hole does not need to &quot;fit into a hole&quot;. A black hole is just any mass in a small enough space that creates enough density that light cannot escape from it. So whatever might fall into the influence of the black holes gravity, whatever the size, will join its mass with that of the black &quot;hole&quot; and expand its radius accordingly. There are no holes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anything approaching a black hole's event horizon is torn apart by truly titanic tidal forces, resulting in a phenomenon charmingly known as 'spaghettification' as the parts nearest the horizon get stretched by the gravity. So, AFAIK, no normal matter could resist this tidal taffy-pulling and retain its structure sufficiently to <em>be</em> bigger than the hole in any meaningful sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If the matter that is about to enter the black hole is bigger than the black hole... THEN IT's ALREADY ANOTHER BLACK HOLE!</p>
<p>Unless the mass is so disperse (greater than its own Schwartzchild radius) that it's no longer a black hole, perhaps a very very big nebula or gas cloud.</p>
<p>But in that scenario, the black hole will suck whatever it encounters, while the rest of the cloud floats (with a hole in the middle). Unless there's enough time for the cloud to stay within the accretion distance of the black hole and it gets sucked whole.</p>
<p>But we cannot think of an star-like object thousands of times bigger than a black hole, because then its only another black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The black hole would expand, of course, because any black hole's size scales up proportionally to its mass. Add more mass to a black hole, it gets more massive and grows in size.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to grow large enough to swallow the original object that is 'fed' into it, though. Rather, the object's constituent material is compressed by the extreme gravity (potentially ripping the object apart in the process) until it fits into the black hole.</p>
<p>Imagine a dry sponge. Floating around in space, the sponge would tend to rest at a particular size. But if you laid the sponge on the ground, it would tend to flatten out a little (particularly at the bottom), becoming smaller than its 'default' size, because the Earth's gravity is pulling it against the ground. What the black hole does is similar, but much, <em>much</em> stronger. It would be able to not only squeeze the sponge into a solid block of plastic, but even squeeze the atoms in the plastic until they get crunched together and stop being atoms, and then squeeze the little particles that atoms are made of until they stop being particles too. Anything that falls into the black hole keeps getting squeezed down like this towards a single point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
