<p>Edit: Thanks for all the responses and the robust discussion! I guess my additional question would be if it is so difficult to switch from imperial to metric, how did most of the world (outside the US) manage to do it?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the reasons do not apply today.</p>
<p>Historically, it's simple to come up with units of measurement based on the imperial system that are 'good enough' - the average of the length of a bunch of average height men's feet = a foot. No scientific tools are necessary, just gather a bunch of dudes in a room, pick the ones that look average (you can eyeball this), then make a mark on a piece of string.</p>
<p>A mile was a thousand paces (which iirc were a full two step stride, not a single step, which is why it's a little over 5000 feet; an average pace is roughly 5 feet). This used a good number for the Roman empire - 1000 - and combined it with stuff based on the average of a troop of soldiers.</p>
<p>measuring horses in hands - more of the same.</p>
<p>fahrenheit is based on the freezing temperature of distilled water combined with salt until the salt precipitates - this brine was relatively easy to produce (sure salt was expensive, but  and to get similar results from, while regular ground water could be polluted - and the boiling point of water, all at a low elevation relative to the ocean. human's body temperature, and thus acceptable temperatures for us to experience, will be roughly in the middle and lower of this range (we're pretty OK at water freezing temperatures, but brine freezing temperatures suck significantly more).</p>
<p>anyway, like i said, the reasons were relevant when we did not have easy infrastructure across the country for trade and such, but they are not relevant anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. The only difference between imperial and metric system is the base units for the elementary physical quantities and that imperial system uses more units with &quot;non-base-ten positional system&quot;. That doesn't make measurements any different. /u/functor7's comment says that imperial system is more &quot;precise&quot; because some rational numbers have nicer/shorter represention which is thanks to them not being &quot;base-ten positional system&quot; and thier &quot;base&quot; having more dividors than 10, but this doesn't really affect the measurements in any way. Precise division of integers isn't really something you deal with when doing measurments because after some significant digit any measurment is not precise. The actual reason you don't want to mix two unit systems is that using both of them can lead to incompatibility such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter#Cause_of_failure" target="_blank">the failure of the Mars Climate Orbiter worth $327.6 million.</a></p>
<p>PS. There are other ways you can represent 1/3 precisely in decimal notation, for example &quot;0,(3)&quot; or &quot;0,33...&quot; or 0,3 with a dash over the 3.</p>
<p>EDIT: Imperial system technically uses base 10 positional notation, but in contrast to *metric they have multiple units for the same quantities such as feet and inches. If you were to divide a feet in three you would have 0,33.. feet, but since there is another unit that equals 1/12 of a feet you can say it's 4 inches. You could make up additional units in metric such as splork that equals 1/360 of a meter and make even more &quot;precise&quot; calculations.</p>
<p>*Except for prefixed units such as decimeter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that in the US, the one of the main reasons why they do not want to switch to metric (probably after their life threatening fear of change) is the shear cost of changing road signalisation.</p>
<p>If 1 speed Sign cost around 50us to replace (after being stolen for instance) how much do you think is will cost them to change them all over the country?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ask any country that has switched. Eg. New Zealand. Do you miss the imperial units? The answer is no.</p>
<p>The way to switch is: you announce you will do it. Then you do it. All of the obstacles get addressed, because they have to be addressed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a whole system of units metric is a lot more consistent, but when certain units are used in isolation, it doesn't really matter. If you're a carpenter and you're building a bookcase, it is completely irrelevant as to whether you use centimeters or inches in your measurements.</p>
<p>Some people think that Fahrenheit is better for daily weather forecasts as its degrees are more tightly granulated than those of Celsius. People commonly use phrases like, &quot;it will be in the low 70s today&quot; with Fahrenheit, but a phrase like &quot;it will be in the low 20s today&quot; in Celsius covers a much greater range of temperatures and is a less practical statement to make.</p>
<p>There are also certain cases where non-metric units are logically superior. One example is air and maritime navigation, which typically uses a nautical mile as the standard unit of length rather than e.g. the kilometer, due to the way coordinates on Earth have been chosen.</p>
