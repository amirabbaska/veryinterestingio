		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are tons of articles out there describing how brain wave patterns change, neurotransmitters regroup and memories consolidate, MRI's do exciting things and REM sleep oscillates.  </p>
<p>In truth, we don't know for sure and there is no complete &quot;theory of sleep&quot;. Neither are we sure why we sleep, or even what the sleep actually is.<br />
We know that we die if we don't sleep for too long, so it is necessary, but why?<br />
We also know that animals sleep including insects and worms. Plants and even bacteria experience states of periodic dormancy that are as close to sleep as you can get without a nervous system, but we have no clue why they are doing it.<br />
Your guess is as good as any.  </p>
<p>Oops. Thank you, whoever that was!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
