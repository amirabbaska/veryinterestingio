What it boils down to is the strength of the equipment used to magnetize the cards. A stronger device magnetizing the card means you'd need a stronger magnet to wipe it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Magnetic strips are classified by their <em>coercivity</em> (their ability to withstand an external magnetic field demagnetizing the strip). </p>
<p>There are two types of these strips in the card industry, often called HiCo and LoCo cards. High-coercivity cards are typically around 10-15 times stronger resisting the magnetic force than a low-coercivity card.</p>
<p>Because they take less energy to produce and to encode data onto, they're a cheaper card overall, and for a high-turnover application like temporary access control (be it your Metrocard or a hotel keycard), cost savings is important.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What /u/wizer900 said. The strips are much weaker. To expand, they're weaker because they will change the codes often. My dorm in college was a remodeled hotel bought by the school so we dealt with these often. Any card could be rewritten to any door if you just used the machine. Doors and cards get their information changed frequently for security reasons. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
