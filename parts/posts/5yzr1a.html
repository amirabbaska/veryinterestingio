		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you are walking down the street and dropped your keys.  They might have landed in the gutter, or gone down the sewer.  Where do you look?</p>
<p>You look in the gutter because if they are down sewer, you won't be able to find them.</p>
<p>That's the approach organizations searching for life are taking.  We know a <em>lot</em> about earth like life, and have very good ideas what it might look like from light years away.  We know nothing about other forms of life, and might not be able to detect it in our own solar system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because exept for a few very strange occurances, mankind has not observed any form of &quot;life&quot; that is able to survive in environments unlike our own. The only thing we know are carbon based lifeforms and we're pretty good at telling how well we can survive our own evironment. We can't be sure of anything that is off planet until we directly observe evidence of the contrary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are referring to the goldilocks zone the definition does not mean that conditions are ideal for human life. The definition is that conditions will allow for liquid water. The reason for this is that all life that we are aware of requires liquid water at some level.</p>
<p>While it is possible for life to exist without liquid water it is all theoretical as far as I know. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We call &quot;life&quot; what we see in this planet. Not necessarily what humans need. There are bacteria that thrive on sulphuric acid. That we know, and if we found a planet that offered the adequate conditions it would be labeled as such.</p>
<p>But life (as we know it, human or not) requires ranges of  temperatures and pressures that are usually not found &quot;out there&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't assume that, it's just a lot easier to search for planets that have ideal conditions for life that we know of then to search for lifeforms we have no knowledge about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
