		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your car stereo uses active echo cancellation. It know what signal it's sending out of the speakers so it compares the signal it's picking up on the mic to the signal it's send out the speakers and tries to remove anything that is the same in both.</p>
<p>This is the same technology that works on your cell phone and on modern table stop speaker phones. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems that some people in the comments are mixing up two technologies.</p>
<p>Acoustic Echo Cancellation is the technology that the OP is referring to. This records the incoming audio before it's played from the speakers, and then removes the <em>echo</em> after the microphone picks it up before sending it back to the other party.</p>
<p>Active Noise Cancellation is the technology used in noise-cancelling headphones. This uses a microphone to pick up background noise and then plays back the inverted sound which effectively cancels it out for the listener.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Countless times I've been working on a car and been inadvertently listening to someone's entire telephone conversation over their car stereo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm in customer service, we can tell when you're using car audio. There's a bad echo and loud background noise. We have to patiently ask you to repeat everything and often say it's hard to hear you. When you switch to your headset or handset, we usually say OMG I can hear you now!  </p>
<p>I just wish my older co-workers would realize that shouting into their microphones doesn't help them hear better. Every day... &quot;I CAN'T HEAR YOU&quot; OMG Karen the microphone is 2 inches from your mouth, you need to adjust the volume in your ear, not your voice...</p>
<p>Also, if you're using car audio in the parking lot, everyone can hear everything from outside, Tammy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
