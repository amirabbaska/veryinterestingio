		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/26/6/2563/1754140/Discrete-Neural-Signatures-of-Basic-Emotions" target="_blank">paper</a> using machine learning classification techniques on fMRI data, and they were able to distinguish the 6 basic emotions (disgust, fear, happiness,sadness, anger and surprise), based on neural activation patterns in several midline cortical regions. Therefore, it does seem like there are different neural signatures for the different emotions that can be derived from fMRI data.</p>
<p>That said, application to animals could be harder. Firstly, there are controversies regarding the universality of emotions, and it is unclear if we can actually generalize human emotions to animals.
Secondly, to utilize a similar technique used in the paper, we would need some form of 'label' to indicate (or induce) what emotion a specific brain state corresponds to. As the animal would not be able to provide some form of subjective report, this could also be a challenge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
