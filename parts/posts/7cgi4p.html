		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's tough to remember smells, much less describe them, but growing up in Hawaii I've smelled lava several times.  It doesn't have a really strong odor on its own, it's like ... well, hot rocks.  A bit like hot metal, say a soldering iron or a hot stove, a bit like regular stone, say a pile of dry gravel or concrete mix.</p>
<p>Sometimes, especially right near the vent, there's sulfur gases mixed into the lava, in which case there's a strong sulfur smell, like overcooked hard-boiled eggs.  But most of the time I've been near a lava flow, it's just a clean hot stone smell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
