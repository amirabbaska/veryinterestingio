<p>Very, very weird stuff - a combination of a supernova event and just the right alignment of Einsteinian gravitational lensing let astronomers view multiple different stages of a single supernova event.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yes, I can actually spell supernova...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you are describing gravitational lensing. Something as large as a galaxy can definitely bend light around itself in such a way that we can see multiple &quot;copies&quot; of whatever is behind it. The light may travel further around one side than it does around the other, so in theory yes we can see the same object as it appeared at two different times. Look up &quot;Einstein Cross&quot; for a great example. As for how large the difference is, I'm not 100% sure, it could vary pretty wildly based on the size and distance of the objects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_Cross" target="_blank">Einstein Cross</a>. I think this is what you are asking about. It's an imagine of a quasar repeated 4 times by gravitational lensing around a closer galaxy. </p>
<p>Also check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_echo" target="_blank">light echos</a>. Sometimes we can see light reflected off of dust to see an event that happened earlier. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
