		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might want to ask this is r/neuroscience. I'm an undergraduate student with a very limited understanding of this topic, but nobody else seems to be giving you a good answer, so I'll give it a shot. </p>
<p>From what I understand, you have down-regulation of serotonin and norepinephrine receptors after chronic antidepressant use, but this isn't necessarily a negative thing, it's just evidence that those receptors have been particularly active lately. However, this increase in activation actually causes changes to happen in the cell that are hypothesized by some to treat the underlying cause of depression. The most important change is an upregulation of proteins in the cyclic-AMP pathway, including the transcription factor CREB, and its gene products such as BDNF, a cell-growth and synapse-stability-promoting protein, and it's receptor, TrkB. This is particularly important in the hippocampus, because it's implicated in increasing the number of synapses, the strength of synapses, and possibly promoting neurogenesis, and hippocampal volume reduction is associated with depression. The hippocampus does a lot of things, and is an important player in how your brain responds to stress. Basically, the hippocampus provides negative feedback to the stress circuit, but chronic stress can reduce hippocampal size and make it worse at its job. The stress circuit involves many other brain areas that contribute to depressive symptoms, such as the hypothalamus, which regulates sleep and hunger, for instance. Anyway, depression is really complicated and not perfectly understood, but if you want to learn more, I suggest looking up cAMP hypothesis of depression. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Talks about tremor in patients receiving fluoxetine, a common antidepressant, which persisted in 11 of 21 patients for more than 450days after treatment had stopped.</p>
<p>This is obviously a small sample size study but aligns with reports I got from colleagues who prescribed it to patients. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This article discusses the long term effects of common antidepressants <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3334530/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3334530/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apoptotic effects are not limited to neoplastic tissue. Antidepressants have been found to
cause cell death in non-cancerous hippocampal neurons in vitro
(Post et al., 2000; Bartholoma et al., 2002) and in vivo (Sairanen et al., 2005). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(apoptosis = programmed cell death).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Antidepressants increase the brainâ€™s susceptibility to future
episodes of depression (Andrews et al., 2011). They cause neuronal
damage (Kalia et al., 2000), apoptosis (Post et al., 2000; Bartholoma
et al., 2002; Sairanen et al., 2005), and dematuration (Kobayashi
et al., 2010). The evidence that antidepressants directly promote
neurogenesis is equivocal. It is quite possible that any neurogenesis that does take place is a compensatory response of the brain to
antidepressant-induced apoptosis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also emerging evidence of a condition named &quot;post-SSRI sexual dysfunction&quot; (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28778697" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28778697</a>). I am not sure if it is thought to be mediated through peripheral changes or changes in the brain.</p>
<p>The subject of long term damage is not uncontroversial - and not easily studied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several related and important questions to ask including: Does long-term depression lead to long-term changes in the brain?
What treatments have shown some level of improvement, without the negative effects?</p>
<p>I remember at least one study from a few years ago, possibly this one which suggested depression may cause some long term effects. Possibly the Hickie et al (2005) paper. Not my area of expertise though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
