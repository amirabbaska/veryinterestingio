<p>Then how come we can do it in a fusion reactor, on a much more extreme scale? I realize the vacuum helps, but that would be the case in space too. Meanwhile the plasma is hotter than the sun, and the magnets are cooler than the inside of a spaceship would have to be. What am I missing?</p></div></div>

We can have huge tanks of liquid N2 just sitting in the parking lot and get them refilled when we run out. We can use heat rejection to the atmosphere or a giant lake to help cool the active coolent lines. In space you can only get rid of heat via radiation which isn't the quickest way to get rid of things. Sure you can hold the heat with phasr change materials like wax but it's only a matter of time before you need to get rid of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They never come into contact. Also there's really little plasma, just a couple of grams at a time. When the plasma touches the walls it cools down significantly which is undesirable so the magnetic field is really shielding the plasma from the walls more than the other way around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll take my example from the experimental ITER reactor being built in France, which is the largest and most sophisticated fusion experiment to date.</p>
<p>In the case of magnetic confinement fusion, the plasma itself is quite rarefied, though pressures may approach atmospheric pressure in the hottest central parts of the plasma. Moreover the purpose of magnetic confinement is to prevent fuel atoms from ever colliding with the walls of the reactor, except rarely, so near the edges of the walls a high vacuum is still maintained. </p>
<p>Note that the extremely high magnetic field exerts a net force on the plasma pushing it back from the walls and causing it's pressure to increase as you reach the center of the discharge.</p>
<p>When the confinement is working properly, most of the heating of the interior of the reactor is due to thermal radiation emitted by the plasma (generally in the range of ultraviolet and x-rays.)  This heat input is quite substantial, but manageable from an engineering standpoint.</p>
<p>Instabilities with the magnetic field may cause atoms in the plasma to impinge on the shielding at a far higher rate which can cause rapid erosion of the material through the process of <em>Sputtering.</em> This also contaminates the fuel with impurities which poses it's own problems.</p>
<p>Probably the greatest technical challenge for magnetic confinement is  controlling plasma instabilities, that may cause loss of confinement.</p>
<p>Most of the interior of the reactor is composed of thermal shielding which is liquid cooled, by water or nitrogen for example. Beneath the shielding blanket are typically secondary field coils used to manipulate the plasma in various ways. These are ordinary copper. Heating effects beneath the shielding blanket tend to not be severe unless there is a total failure of one or more of the shielding blocks. </p>
<p>Beneath that are the structural support walls of the reaction chamber.</p>
<p>In the case of the ITER reactor. The reaction chamber is, in turn, surrounded by what amounts to a huge, sophisticated vacuum chamber. That is, a Dewar Flask. This is known as the Cryostat.  The cryostat contains the superconducting primary field coil assemblies. There produce the more-or-less permanent high magnetic field that is needed for a reasonable confinement efficiency. </p>
<p>Note that a high vacuum is an extremely good insulator, one merely needs to block thermal radiation, conduction and convection heat transfer doesn't happen.</p>
<p>In ITER, the primary magnetic field coils are square tubes filled with liquid helium cooled to about 4 kelvin, and containing the superconducting windings. The vacuum of the cryostat acts as effective insulation for the helium filled coils.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>On earth we have heatsinks. We can easily use a lake as a heatsink. In space you do not have efficient heatsinks. Instead, all the energy has to be either reflected or radiated away. This is far more difficult than cooling say a few tens of megawatts with evoparative cooling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The plasma is created in a vacuum chamber, which has chamber walls to maintain vacuum and prevent the plasma from interacting with the outside environment where the magnets are.  In a full-scale operational magnetic confinement fusion reactor, there will also be specifically designed plasma facing materials and shielding to prevent interactions between the plasma and the vacuum chamber walls.   Additonally, the plasma is confined by the magnetic field so that very little of the plasma will actually touch the walls.</p>
<p>The first working fusion power plants will be designed very carefully to direct energy away from sensitive components and put that energy to good use for boiling water to turn the electric turbines (if we don't perfect direct energy conversion first).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
