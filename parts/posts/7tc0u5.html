		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, something known as &quot;optical depth&quot; is used. Optical depth is (more or less) the ratio between how much light is incident upon a barrier vs how much light actually gets through. The &quot;surface&quot; of the star is defined as the radius where that optical density reaches a certain value, typically 2/3.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is still a degree of uncertainty about the precise size of the sun. This came up during last year's eclipse because there were cities along the margins of the path of totality, and some reporting emerged that the totality maps might be inaccurate because of the imprecision of the sun's measurements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason the maps are slightly off has nothing to do with mistakes, all agree. Wright explained that eclipse maps are made based on what is known about the relative sizes and positions of the moon and the sun.</p>
<p>“We have really good information about the orbit of the moon, the positions of the sun, the positions of the Earth. All of that is really well nailed down,” Wright said. “In order to get more accuracy, we need to take into account the mountains and valleys on the moon, and the elevations on the Earth. And we’re starting to do that, as well.”</p>
<p>The size of the moon, in fact, has been measured to within a meter, and its position in the heavens has been measured to within a centimeter.</p>
<p>“But the last sort of uncertainty might surprise you,” Wright said. “It’s the size of the sun.”</p>
<p>It’s a roiling ball of gas. “It doesn’t have a solid surface,” he said, making its size hard to pin down.</p>
<p>Scientists have calculated the sun’s radius at roughly 696,000 kilometers (about 432,500 miles) from edge to center, but they do not know its size with precision.</p>

The one you are looking for is part of his outward bound colonization series about the sun. He explains that the sun is essentially progressively denser areas of gas and there is no perfect edge to it like the crust of the earth.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The radius question has been answered but here's a further note: The corona (the top layer of the Sun) doesn't have an edge, it just slowly dissipates as it's density reduces the further out it gets. This extends so far that it can be said the entire solar system is &quot;inside&quot; the Sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
