		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about you guys, but when I talk aloud there's not a whole lot of planning going on upstairs. I'm not visualizing any words, yet coherent sentences come flowing out of my mouth. How does this happen? Who is calling the shots up there? This seems completely opposite to how I communicate through text, where I'm visualizing the words on my keyboard and screen as I think and type them out.</p>
<p>I feel like <a href="https://vimeo.com/groups/38186/videos/25841379" target="_blank">this</a> Michael Scott quotes demonstrates this phenomenon best.</p>
<p>Edit: It would appear as if I didn't visualize long enough for the title. Truly embarrassing. If anyone needs me, I'll be out in the garden digging up worms.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something similar came up in another thread. I would advise you to look at an actual linguistic transcript of everyday conversational speech. We’re not nearly as coherent as we think we are. We often have to reformulate sentences on the go, mess up grammatically, lose our train of thought mid-sentence, use tonnes of verbal and non-verbal pauses, say little of value, repeat quotes or other people’s words in lieu of unique phrasing and take all manner of other shortcuts when talking. </p>
<p>Not to say that the brain isn’t amazing at being able to come up with full sentences, but we’re rarely as eloquent as we remember ourselves to be. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain is complicated, and we understand very little about <em>how</em> it works, though we generally know what different areas of the brain do.</p>
<p>It’s known that the frontal lobe does most of the high level functions in the brain, including creating and forming concepts. It’s also known that Broca’s area in the brain is linked to speech production, and Wernicke’s area is linked to understanding and processing speech. So it’s reasonable to assume that it’s a combination of the three areas working together to take information, process it and produce concepts for a response, then form those concepts into words and
sentences that you then speak aloud.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Wernicke-Geschwind model goes some way to explaining language processing in the brain. Baciscally language comes in as auditory or visual information, processed by wernickes area and sent to Brocas area to articulate the words you want to say into motor areas associated with the mouth.
This model is still not without faults and doesnt account for the frontal lobes &quot;emotional colouring&quot; of language or the temporal lobes incorporation of memory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain's ability to use its lexicon and the associated semantic information as well as the syntactic rules associated with language and the pragmatic 'rules' of speech to formulate a statement, question, response etc. at speed is phenomenal. I'm currently studying to become a Speech and Language Therapist in the UK and it's astounding how complex the whole system of expressive and receptive communication is.</p>
<p>It may be worth looking at '<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Speech-Chain-Physics-Biology-Language/dp/1258407752" target="_blank">The Speech Chain</a>' by Peter Denes. Although the book focusses on the physiology of speech production (initiation, phonation, articulation, motor execution, auditory reception and so on), the concept of the 'pre-linguistic phase' is discussed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Heuristics are mental shortcuts for the brain that captures what is at hand, or most recent in our memory to quickly output information.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is how you can prime individuals into saying things, or even changing their physical behavior just by using certain terms, or presenting ideas.</p>
