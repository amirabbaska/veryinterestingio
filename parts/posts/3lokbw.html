		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am an engineer designing vacuum chambers and stuff for a particle accelerator lab.  The same conditions in space exist in a vacuum chamber (ok not exactly but it's similar).  So we have to deal with this issue but it's not really like a lot of people imagine.  It's not like you take two pieces of steel and touch them together in space and suddenly you will have one solid piece of metal, or a welded piece of metal.  There have to be a lot of specific conditions and even then parts mostly just stick together, not really weld.  For one thing the parts have to be ultra clean, if there's a film of dust or oil, even a little bit, they aren't going to bond together well.  Also you have to have parts that are <em>extremely</em> smooth and flat, at an atomic level.  So if there are like ridges and grooves, say from machining, they aren't going to bond together well.</p>
<p>Just as an example of where this is actually an issue; usually in a vacuum chamber we use a lot of stainless steel, and all the parts in vacuum are ultra clean.  We have to be very careful with fasteners.  A stainless steel screw in a stainless steel plate will bond, or seize, whatever you want to call it, so that it cannot be removed without destroying the fastener.  To get around this we use silver plated fasteners or dissimilar metals.  On the other hand a stainless steel plate against another stainless steel plate is unlikely to bond.  Unless they are both extremely smooth and flat, and extremely clean, with a decent amount of force pressing them together.  Then it might happen, <em>maybe</em>.</p>
<p>tldr; cold welding is real but it is not at all like most people portray it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In earths atmosphere, as soon as a piece of metal is split open, the surfaces are exposed to oxygen. This causes the surfaces to oxidize slightly. Because of this slight oxidization, they will not weld together. Think of it like tape that has fuzz stuck to it.</p>
<p>In outer space there is no atmosphere present to oxidize the metal surfaces. If you split metal in space, the atoms will bind like two pieces of fresh tape.</p>
<p>However, if we have two pieces of fuzzy tape in outer space, they still will not stick to each other. The metal has to be separated with no atmosphere (or in vacuum conditions) to weld properly on contact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called cold welding. The premise is that when two <em>unoxidized</em> pieces of metal contact each other in a vacuum they bond to each other because the atoms have no way of 'knowing' that they're two separate pieces. It's a problem that's taken into account when designing space vehicles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the off-chance anyone sees this:</p>
<p>I think everyone is missing the fact that just because they are &quot;welded together&quot; does not mean they form a strong bond. Unless the pieces are extremely polished, on the atomic scale, all surfaces have gigantic peaks and valleys. These peaks/valleys are what cause scratches when two metals rub against each other... literally the mountain of harder object ploughing through the other object. (Also the reason lubrication exists, to create a cushion so the peaks can't touch each other.)</p>
<p>So all of that being said, imagine two mountain tips touching together. The slightest rotation would snap them apart.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can cold welding occur without vacuum, in our atmosphere? I know someone who wouldn't make steel-on-steel joints from freshly milled surfaces to avoid cold welding. Seems like joints would be fucking up left and right if that were true, but idk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
