		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our sensation of being cold (or hot) is strongly affected by the rate at which we exchange heat with the environment. When we're wet, the water is almost always colder than the 37 C of our body. That means that heat flows from our body into the water on our skin. And since water has a considerably higher heat conductivity than air, the body loses heat more rapidly when it's covered in water.</p>
<p>Next, the water will evaporate, which lowers the average temperature of the water that remains, causing further heat flow from the body to the water on the skin. Essentially, this is the same as sweating, except that sweating is a beneficial process that the body initiates when it is too hot.</p>
<p>So when we're wet, we lose heat more rapidly than when we're dry. This causes a stronger sensation of feeling cold, even though the water on our skin may be warmer than the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, humans don't really feel absolute temperature but instead you feel heat transfer.  Heat energy coming off you makes you cold, heat energy coming into you makes you hot.  The concept of wind chill and the various &quot;real feel&quot; temperatures from various weather sites are an effort to approximate heat transfer rates as temperatures (I.e. a wind chill of 15 F is the same heat transfer rate as an actual temperature of 15 F with no wind.)</p>
<p>What happens when you are wet is that you are suddenly able to transfer heat to your exterior much more rapidly.  The transfer from you to the water happens via conduction and convection at that point, plus the water has a much higher heat capacity so it can absorb more energy before it warms up.  The result is that even when the water is the same temperature as the air, it pulls more heat away from you making you feel colder.  Evaporation further exaggerates the ability of water to pull heat energy out of your body and further improves the heat transfer rate.</p>
<p>There is an easy demonstration/intuition check you can do at home to help understand that heat transfer concept.  If you put a metal fork in the freezer overnight then take it out the next morning the fork will feel much colder than the air in the freezer.  That isn't because the fork is a different temperature but because air doesn't transfer heat very well but metal does.  Similarly when you open an oven door you are exposing your face to 400+ degree (F) air, you can even safely reach your hand inside to check or move things with no problem.  Compare that to boiling water or steam coming off a pot.  The water is much cooler (212 F) than the oven is, but if you touch it you'll burn your hand almost immediately.</p>
<p>A lot of times people focus on absolute temperature, but in most cases heat transfer matters much more.  Absolute temperature definitely influences that transfer rate, but the material in question and the ambient conditions (flowing water/stagnant air etc) are often more important. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Air has a lower thermal conductivity than water and is used as an insulator. Insulating materials like styrofoam and fiberglass are mostly air, the material itself is structured to hold pockets of air and prevent it from moving. As you sit still you lose body heat to the air near your skin, but as long as that air is undisturbed it heats up and stays there like an insulating blanket (incidentally this is how blankets, clothing, and hair work: trapping the air warmed by your body so that it stays near your body). When a breeze blows you feel cold because the air near your skin that has been warmed by you is pushed away and colder air then contacts your skin.</p>
<p>Water on the other hand is a relatively good thermal conductor, as you lose body heat to the water near your skin it is conducted away to adjacent water molecules... the heat doesn't stay near your skin to form an insulating blanket like it does with undisturbed air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Two things are essentially drawing heat from your body when you are wet.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Evaporative cooling. A few others mentioned it but it's how your AC is cold on the evaporator (clever name), it's why it feels cool outside when it's raining, and it's one of the benefits of sweating. When a substance changes from its liquid state to a gas, it absorbs energy around it, typically this is thermal energy.</p>
</li>
<li>Water is a much more efficient means of transferring heat from/to your body than air. This is why you can put your hand in a 212 degree oven briefly and be ok, but if you put your hand in 212 degree water, you will be burned. The reverse is also true. In most instances where a person is wet (rain, swimming, etc) the water temperature is less than our own body temperature. Typically we lose body heat to the air, which is inefficient, now we cover our skin in water and boom, the heat loss is more efficient and we feel cold because we are literally colder on the outside.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of evaporative cooling. When substance changes phase from a liquid to a vapor - it takes quite a bit of energy to get a low energy state(liquid) to a high energy state(vapor). When you have water on your skin and this water evaporates it takes that energy from your skin causing the skin to lose energy and become colder. If the water on your skin does not vaporize, you do not have this cooling effect. This is primarily why people always say that they prefer &quot;dry heat&quot; to &quot;hot and humid&quot;. In a humid environment, the air is already saturated with water vapor and cannot take much more water into it so water on the skin doesn't vaporize easily, leaving you hot. In a dry heat, however, water vaporizes easily which means this cooling effect of evaporative cooling can be used to keep you cool. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
