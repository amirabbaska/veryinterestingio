		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Question is basically the title plus a little extra. So I've learned in school that if we use a telescope to observe something that's 1 lightyear away, then what we observe is not the thing as it is today but rather how it was 1 year ago. So the farther away the object of observation is, the older the image we observe of it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is true, and please correct me if I'm wrong, then given that the universe is 13.8 billion years old and infinitely wide (because it's constantly expanding right?) then what happens if we theoretically try to observe something that's 13.9 billion lightyears away or farther? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the universe didn't exist before 13.8 billion years ago, there isn't any light that anyone or anything can pick up and observe right? Or is it that we can only possibly see as far as the universe is currently wide, in which case is it really infinite or is it sort of asymptotically infinite? Is it even theoretically possible to build a telescope that could peer across such astronomical distances? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And tangentially related this is something that's been on my mind for a while and I'm hoping someone can answer it. Say you teleported to some observatory 200 lightyears away and were able to use a telescope to look back at Earth. Say you could also zoom in enough to see cities. Would you then see the world as it was in the 1800s? Or is this idea itself, barring the obvious outlandish conditions, science fiction?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can actually see further than 13.8 billion light years because the universe is expanding. Light travels at the speed of light, which is one light year per year. So the furthest distance that light can travel in the history of the universe is 13.8 billion light years. But in 13.8 billion years, the universe has expanded a lot. The object that the light came from can be more than 13.8 billion light years away. So we can see objects that are now further than 13.8 billion light years away. Taking this into account, the furthest object you can possibly see is about about 50 billion light years away.</p>
<p>In practice though, the universe was opaque in very early times, so when we look at very large distances we just see a uniform &quot;wall&quot;. This is the cosmic microwave background. Note that you don't need an exceptionally good telescope to see that far - the limiting factor in telescopes is more about brightness than resolution, and this background is fairly bright.</p>
<p>And yes, if you were sitting at a star 200 light years away, you could see Earth as it was 200 years ago, although you'd need a very very good telescope to get enough resolution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago I owned a 10 inch reflector telescope. I did some looking around to find the most distant object that an amateur astronomer could hope to see, and found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3C_273" target="_blank">quasar 3C 273</a> seemed to be it. </p>
<p>2.4 billion light years out.</p>
<p>Then I did some math to put it in perspective. If you created a model of the universe in which the distance from the Earth to the Sun was 1 inch, then 3C 273, in your model, would be past Neptune in the real world. Think for a minute how insanely <em>bright</em> that object must be, to be visible at that distance. (If you brought the quasar to about 34 light years from Earth, it would be about as bright as the sun in our sky. For comparison, our sun is about 8 light <em>minutes</em> from us.)</p>

<p>Someone crunched the numbers on this, I think on Reddit, a little while back. Turns out the size of lens you'd need to be able to do this, would be so massive it would collapse itself into a black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is true, assuming you could instantly teleport. Of course the catch is that you can't; it's physically impossible to travel faster than light so you will take at least 200 years to reach that distant planet, so when you look back at Earth with that impossibly huge telescope you will see Earth as it was after you left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answer posted is technically correct but does not go into the details. See a similar question answered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2y93cz/if_we_were_far_enough_from_earth_could_we_see_the/cp7dor1/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, yes, you would <em>technically</em> see the <em>earth</em> as it was in 1800, but to resolve actual buildings/people to say &quot;yep, this is the 1800s&quot;, you need a telescope bigger than humanly possible. This is because you need an actual photon reflected off a person, travel 200 light-years, then enter your telescope to actually &quot;see&quot; them, never mind having enough reflected from a single area that would identify that place as somewhere in the 1800s.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
