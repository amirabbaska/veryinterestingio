<blockquote>
<p>Do they shine with borrowed light, or with their own native lustre?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and later in his 1869 edition of <em>The Christian Philosopher</em> he says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The immense distance at which the nearest stars are known to be pplaced proves that they are bodies of a prodigious size, not inferior to our own sun, and that they shine not by reflected rays, but by their own native light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>suggesting that at some point between 1848 and 1869 the idea that the sun and other stars might be reflecting light was shown to be incorrect.</p>
<p>Was this something that scientists in the 1800's thought might be how the sun generated its light or was this an aberration of christian scientists like T. Dick?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a question sort of in the nether world between /r/AskScience and /r/AskHistorians. I'll try my best to answer it, but I'm not an historian. </p>
<p>While it certainly wasn't yet understood what caused the stars (or the Sun) to shine, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax" target="_blank">trigonometric parallax</a>, the most reliable distance measure for stars, was first measured in 1837 for the star 61 Cygni, proving both the great distance of stars and (once again) Earth's motion around the Sun. Parallax had been searched for for millennia, though, to no avail. The failure to detect it was one reason the ancient Greeks favored an Earth-centered universe. Once it became clear the Earth went around the Sun, though, the failure to observe parallax placed a lower limit on the distance to stars which was already quite large.</p>
<p>In fact, with that lower limit distance <em>and</em> a measure of how bright stars are and how bright the sun is, it would be pretty trivial to show that stars could not be reflecting sunlight after the mid-to-late-17th century or so. The only rub is that they didn't have any good means of precisely measuring the brightness of an object at that point, that I'm aware of. Perhaps someone could have argued that the stars weren't <em>that</em> bright compared to what you'd expect from reflection and been taken seriously just because there was no real sense for how bright the stars were compared to the Sun. </p>
<p>The brightness of stars in the sky, though, is <em>many</em> orders of magnitude greater than a reflective object even at the lower limit distance of naked-eye searches for parallax, though, so I think it would be difficult to seriously entertain the idea that stars were simply reflecting sunlight once it became clear that Earth went around the Sun, which was ~200 years before Thomas Dick's book. </p>
<p>EDIT: In fact, thinking a bit more about this, the planet Uranus had already been discovered by telescope at this point in history and was certainly known to be much closer than the stars, yet much fainter. That observation alone should kill the idea that stars are reflecting sunlight, and it was made in 1781.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first records of individuals suggesting that the sun and stars were the same thingâ€¦ Greek philosophers (scientists of the time) about 2500 years ago. </p>
<p>This is followed by not a whole lot in western culture until waves of modern scientists throughout the 1600-1800s. The first definitive proofs came during the first decades of the 1800s, as we were finally able to calculate distance and brightness (and the only thing we knew of, that could be so bright from so far away, was something sun-like).</p>
<p>This isn't to say that scientists thought that the sun and stars were different until 1830ish, but rather, they hadn't put the final pieces into the puzzle. The sun and the stars were being considered seriously as the same since the late 1600s by scientists.</p>

<p>(Thomas Dick was either being sensationalistic, repressed by the church, didn't personally believe the evidence, or the facts hadn't caught up to him yet)</p>
<p>Edit: Dick may have been writing his very first editions right around the time the first decently accurate distances to stars were measured, but the evidence up to that point was already strong enough to essentially rule out reflection. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
