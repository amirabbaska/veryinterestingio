<p>Everything on a planetary scale is very hard to judge. Since the objects are so small and doesn't have the aspects of stars. For example, we can easily predict a stats temperature based on luminosity and how it falls on the heat spectrum. Although, this isn't anything you can do over a night. But rather daily observations.</p>
<p>So now back to your question. Planets have different perks based on their conditions. Which can help to predict the climate. Also if you observe the host star you can also estimate distance and size based on passages. Because planetary passages block some of the sunlight, making the frequency unnatural. Larger planets have a larger passage when they pass in front of their stars compared to smaller ones. Not only that but the frequency of passages makes estimates for size and distance.</p>
<p>Now we let's touch on the atmosphere. Which works like a konvex lens and have properties for estimations. Which indicates what the planet can contain in terms of materia. And could show wind speed.</p>
<p>In concussion. It's estimations based on raw data and analysis. Some of the predictions are based on concussions drawn from the findings of coincidental factors based on our own solar system. But at the end of the day that's the best you can do with out current technology.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might be interested in asking this on /r/askscience for a slightly more detailed explanation.</p>
<p>To elaborate a bit on what was mentioned by /u/III_Cloud_III;</p>
<p>We can take a guess as a planet's temperature based on its distance from its host star and the star's temperature. This would have to be augmented by knowledge of what the planet's atmosphere is like, if it exists. For instance, without an atmosphere Venus should be colder than Mercury because it's further from the Sun. However, because of its atmosphere its surface temperature is ~740 Kelvin (~460Â°C), which is more than twice as hot as Mercury's ~340K surface temperature.</p>
<p>Determining wind speed is an interesting thing to do. If you've ever had an object such as a car quickly pass by you, you probably noticed the pitch of the sound it made increase as it approached you and decrease as it went away. This is known as the Doppler effect, and it can be observed in the light passing through the atmosphere of a planet (as the planet passes in front of its host star). We can use that to determine how fast the winds are going on the surface: as the atmosphere on the planet moves about the planet, on one side it will be moving toward us and on the other it will be moving away. A cool thing similar to this is that we can use the same technique to measure how quickly stars rotate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
