		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically the court establishes a payment plan based on your income and expenses that requires you to pay much of your disposable income towards the judgment but leaves you enough money to live at a reasonable standard of living.</p>
<p>Also, in this case:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, depending on the order they can take property (normally not your house or primary car), take savings, garnish wages, and take any other liquid assets you may have. The garnishing of your wages can last for years if not the rest of your life. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, if there's a judgment against you in the US, the court doesn't care if you can pay it.  You either pay, or you don't pay.  Depending on why there's a judgment, you might be able to declare bankruptcy and get rid of it.</p>
<p>Secondly, if you really can't pay, then you can still negotiate with the plaintiff.  &quot;You know I can't pay you $37m.  But, how about this: I pay you $10 a week for the next 20 years.  If you don't accept that, then you're going to have to execute on the judgment, which will cost you time and money.  And, if you try that, then I'm just going to declare bankruptcy.&quot;</p>
<p>Third, the plaintiff can execute the judgment.  He/she can order the bank to give him the money in your account, get the sheriff out to your house to grab your TV and your car, garnish your wages, etc....  (The exact remedies depend on what state you're in and how you got the money.  Garnishment, for example, is typically limited to a percentage of your income.  Social Security benefits are immune, etc....)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
