		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We use a tool called cautery to seal small bleeders. For larger vessels, we either run a surgical stapler across them to cut them, or the ends get tied with silk suture after clamping. In big procedures where there is a lot of blood loss, we use something called a cell saver to recycle the blood and give it back to the patient. But for most procedures, there isn't any major bleeding to control in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On cases with some BIG bleeds, there’s something called a cell saver which is a machine that has suction for doctors to vac the surgical site of blood and flush. It takes this mixture of saline, blood, and other “bits”, filters it, centrifuges it, and removes all but viable red blood cells, which can be given back to the patient through a line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer? We avoid major bleeding in the first place. Small blood vessels are sealed with electrocautery; small to medium are tied and/or clipped before dividing them; and large vessels are either stapled or suture ligated before dividing, or clamped if we’re doing arterial reconstruction. </p>
<p>In some cases (ie major pelvic venous trauma) we use direct pressure, sometimes up to 48-72 hours, and leave the abdomen “open” (temporarily closed with a vacuum dressing) while they are resuscitated in the ICU and their coagulopathy (lack of clotting factors, cold, etc) is corrected before it’s safe to return to the OR. </p>
<p>In extreme cases, they call in someone like me (a vascular surgeon) to do all of the above, and then some. But like I said, most surgeons avoid blood loss from the get go. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All those times in the medical TV show where the surgeon asks the nurse for a clamp, that's the solution.  When you cut someone and they bleed, you clamp the vessels so the blood doesn't all leak out.  Then you sew them up when you close the cut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
