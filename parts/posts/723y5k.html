		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, a lot of guys have this idea that there is a finite amount of room in your testes and that your body can only produce a limited amount of sperm.</p>
<p>In truth, your body is almost always producing sperm. While yes there is a finite amount of room in your testes for sperm to be created, in practice it is near impossible to ever reach this cap. One, because your testes can expand slightly, vastly increasing sperm storage. Two, because the amount of sperm your body can actually store, even before the aformentioned enlargement, is a pretty crazily high amount. And three, because older sperm are usually broken down and 'remanufactured' into newer sperm.</p>
<p>Your body nornally (Outside of a few diseases/nutrient deficiencies) does a pretty remarkable job of breaking down old or improperly formed sperm, absorbing the remnants, and then creating new sperm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland stimulates serotoli cells within the testis. These cells drive the creation of sperm (spermatogenesis). They produce a product called inhibin B which feeds back to the pituitary and decreases the amount of FSH being produced (negative feedback). This creates a balance of the hormone driving sperm production. Not so much because the testes are 'full'. </p>
<p>Worth noting that testosterone also negatively feeds back on FSH production - thus taking exogenous testosterone will decrease not only your own bodies testosterone production but sperm production as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your pituitary gland secretes hormones that regulate the production of sperm.</p>
<p>However, sperm are pretty much always being created (~40 million sperm per day!).  If you don't ejaculate to release the sperm from the testes, your body simply breaks down older sperm OR initiates a &quot;wet dream&quot; (involuntary ejaculation) during sleep to decrease the load.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
