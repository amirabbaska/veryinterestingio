<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Yes. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon#Physical_properties" target="_blank">Photons carry momentum, which would cause the flashlight to experience a force against the direction it was shining.</a></p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> let's go an adventure. For a normal pocket flashlight powered by a single 1.5 Volt AA lithium battery, we can do an easy calculation. That battery has a mass of 15 g, and contains a total charge of 2700â€“3400 mAh (that's milliAmp hours) which gives 5.10 Wh (watt hours) of energy. </p>
<p>Let's assume that this thing operates at 100% efficiency. This actually isn't a bad estimate. Not much energy gets lost to heat in the circuit if we have a good LED, and the bit that does get lost to heat will probably find an easier to time radiating from the front, because the forward facing part dominates the angular part of the space that it could be radiating into and the material probably isn't as thick. Anyway, it puts out: </p>
<pre><code> E = 5.10 Watt-hours = 18360 Joules</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28energy%29" target="_blank">This is comparable to the detonation of ~4 gram of TNT.</a> I did some googling to try and find the explosive power of various fireworks to give you a sense of how much this is, but that information doesn't seem readily available. I only seem to have found myself on a government watchlist now for lots of google searches about the explosive power of fireworks. Fortunately, this is America, so information about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder" target="_blank">gunpowder</a> is readily available, which has about 70% the energy density of TNT.  Some useful conversation from <em>grains</em> to grams tells us that 4 grams of TNT contains about as much energy as <a href="http://en.allexperts.com/q/Guns-Firearms-Projectile-1501/2009/9/gunpowder-bullet.htm" target="_blank">sixteen 9mm cartridges worth of gunpowder.</a> It's a good thing our flashlight isn't releasing all this energy at once. Into a bullet. Actually, that's a shame, because that sounds really cool.</p>
<p>Anyyywaaaay, if we calculate the momentum of the photons with this energy, we find </p>
<pre><code> p = E/c = 18360 J/(3.0x10^8 m/s) = 6.12x10^(-5) kg m/s</code></pre>
<p>which is the total momentum of an entire AA battery's worth of pocket flashlight light. So now, your pocket flashlight has that much momentum going backwards. If your flashlight weighs 30 g (so half the mass is in the casing and elecrotonics, and the other half is in the battery), then: </p>
<pre><code> v = p / m = 6.12x10^(-5) kg m/s / (0.030 kg) = 0.002 m/s</code></pre>
<p>That's slow. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28speed%29" target="_blank">Coincidentally, it's also almost exactly equal to the World Record for the fastest snail in the Congham, UK.</a> No, I don't know if the record for the fastest snail in the world was set in Congham, or if this is a local Congham record. Anyway...</p>
<p>So to find your acceleration, we need to know how long it took for the battery to run dead. I know my flashlight dies if I leave it on in my pocket over night, but it certainly can get me through a weekend of camping on one battery (provided I don't leave it on in my pocket the first night), so let's say it has 8 hours of juice. </p>
<p>In that case, the acceleration can be found by:</p>
<pre><code>    a = dv/dt = (0.002 m/s) / (8x3600 s) = 6.94x10^(-8) m/s^2</code></pre>
<p>That's also small. As fuck. It's so small that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28acceleration%29" target="_blank">the Wikipedia page doesn't even give us a sense of how small it is.</a> If we multiply our 30 grams back in, we find the force, which is about 10^(-9) Newtons, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28force%29" target="_blank">which is about the amount of force needed to break a covalent bond.</a> If I haven't hit this point home hard enough yet, that's small. Really really fucking small. So maybe, if you hitch your flashlight like a tugboat to one of those lithium ions from that battery, you might just be able to pull it apart. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen no mention of it here, but the phenomenon known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_anomaly" target="_blank">&quot;the Pioneer Anomoly&quot;</a> has been proposed to be due to an actual case of radiation pressure sourced from a spacecraft producing unintended but measurable acceleration.  Basically, the probe radiates heat unevenly throughout its structure and it shows up as a small net force that looks like something is nudging the craft in a particular direction.  When the discrepancy in Pioneer's flight path was first noticed, people were very excited for a while wondering if there was some kind of new exotic thing on the verge of being discovered at the edge of the solar system.  When first published, the radiation theory felt like a let down for some.  But I thought it was riveting how those who came up with the idea went about trying to prove its plausibility.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Engineer here. Apologies if this has been brought up, but wouldn't the electrons moving across the battery in the flashlight present more of an opportunity to impart a force in deep space?</p>
<p>Here are two situations:</p>
<p>The flashlight is switched on. Maybe some movement occurs from the radiation pressure. Electrons are moving across metal components, and a magnetic field is produced depending on the design of the flashlight, for example from a coiled filament within the bulb. Depending on the magnetic flux conditions in deep space, this could propel or spin the flashlight. However, is it possible for the electrons moving across metal components to exert a force?</p>
<p>The flashlight is switched off. So, opposing components inside the flashlight are at battery potential. This becomes a lens <a href="http://www.vias.org/basicradio/basic_radio_22_02.html" target="_blank">like you'd see in an old vacuum tube</a>. Is there a flashlight design that deflects cosmic rays in such a way as to start spinning?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
