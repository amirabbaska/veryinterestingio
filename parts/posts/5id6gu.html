		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is is <strong>not</strong> your subconcious. It is how your <em>senses</em> perceive your own body. They learn where your body &quot;should&quot; be and because of bad <em>conscious</em> habits, they learn bad places to at be are good places to be at.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/tinbergen-lecture.pdf" target="_blank">This is a Nobel Prize winner speech from 1973</a>. It's a very accessible text, but at the time it was also very divisive for mentioning the Alexander Technique. Go straight to the second part where he's talking about body awareness (crtl F &quot;Alexander&quot;), no need to read about ethology or autism for your specific question.</p>
<p>EDIT: no, good posture is not harder for your muscles. it is not because of age (or I wouldn't have bad posture). And it is also not only about lack of exercise, though this is one of the most important factors <strong>for sedentary people</strong> - hard labor workers have posture problems because they <em>do</em> work! It also isn't only about muscles being underdeveloped, you can have terrible posture with fine muscles and actually it's what's happening to most people with slight posture problems, so with all due respect I have to disagree with /u/ScrawnyTesticles69 on this</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Compared to our ancestors, our lifestyle is extremely sedentary. There's almost no physical effort required to simply be alive. Because we spend so much less time on our feet from birth to death, the muscles that are important for good posture are often poorly developed. For the most part, people that begin to walk or run more frequently can notice improvements in their posture, even without actively trying to improve it. Our musculature encourages good posture, so naturally, being more physically active leads to better posture. The reason it feels unnatural or uncomfortable to try to force good posture is simply that the muscles being engaged are underdeveloped.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Poor posture is, in most people, a combination of too much sedentary time and not enough in our natural postures (walking, running, standing).</p>
<p>Your body gets used to being in a bad posture, so your sensory system acclimates and your muscles and joints try their best to compensate.  Eventually, good posture feels wrong and bad posture feels normal.  Not terribly dissimilar from a person getting used to an abusive relationship.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a biologist but as someone who used to have posture issues, in the short term poor posture is generally more comfortable so if someone forms a habit of poor posture because of comfort or other adaptation issues (sitting at the computer for extend periods for one example) then they'll probably stick with it until it causes issues/ignore it and attribute pain/discomfort to something else.</p>
<p>There are other medical conditions that might be the cause of poor posture like scoliosis forr example</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
