		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every town exists for a reason.  Some enterprise is producing something of value to someone outside the borders of the community, bringing in cash to support the town's local economy. </p>
<p>If you flatten the town, your country loses it's largest producer of widgets.  Generations of experience, tools and machinery evaporated.  You still need widgets, but now someone has to kick out millions to rebuild the factory and the town around it to produce them within the country again, and even then it'll be a year before you're in production.  </p>
<p>Until you're producing again you'll have to pay double the price for imported widgets, which is made even more complicated when the US has <a href="http://media.jrn.com/images/2000*1247/b99685395z.1_20160313230454_000_gsnerv85.1-1.jpg" target="_blank">1000ft of freedom</a> parked off your coast, enforcing a trade embargo.  </p>
<p>However, if you hit them with chemical weapons the property damage is trivial.  Sure you lose the people, but they were lost anyway.  With them out of the way more... cooperative people can be shipped in and widget production can begin as soon as they figure out where the light switches are.  For experience, you can recruit cash-motivated foreigners like fabrication-mercenaries to train the new folks.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is pretty much why. Chemical weapons tend to have very high human casualties while being able to minimise damage to infrastructure. </p>
<p>To achieve the same effect with conventional armaments you would incur far greater collateral damages in terms of infrastructure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Would you say that currently in the 6 year Syrian Civil War, that conventional weapons are winning it for the Government? I would say not, that in fact conventional weapons clearly aren't strong enough to dislodge any kind of rebel. Chemical weapons are extremely powerful, both physically and psychologically. </p>
<p>Dropping Sarin gas on a village and killing everyone indiscriminately is a terrifying move. Both sides have guns, both sides have rockets, etc, but only one side has the means to 100% kill everyone in an area. </p>
<p>So, there are tactical reasons why, to dislodge an enemy they have been unable to dislodge using conventional weapons. There are psychological reasons, to scare your enemy into surrender. Sending a message, we won't just bomb you, we will poison the air so even your kids just die, and then if you survived, we'll bomb the clinic too - and most importantly Trump won't do shit. Putin won't allow his boy Trump to do anything, so why not use it? What's gonna happen if you do?</p>
<p>The last reason is that Syrian Command and Control structure ain't exactly top of the line. The US spends billions and billions in training and technology to enforce a command structure in which orders are always followed - and it still doesn't stop some humans being human and doing what <em>they</em> want. The US armed forces are still rife with violations of the geneva convention, still struggles with the problem of soldiers and commanders doing things based on their own personal desires rather than the desire of their commander.</p>
<p>So the Syrian army definitely has men in it capable of ignoring the prospect of outrage and uproar and just using sarin gas because he is an evil bastard. Or he's angry, or...whatever reason.</p>
<p>My best guess is that this was not authorised by Assad, nor Russia. A commander just decided, he didn't want to deal with bullshit, send in the gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why would Assad, who is currently winning with the help of Russia, carry out a chemical attack knowing it will harm even more of his image and risk destroying Russain support? It makes no logical sense so there is something deeper going on with the attack.</p>
<p>Assad is in no way clean, nor do I support him but during times of war, you can't trust anything you hear, see or read in the media. The conflict in Syria is far more a complex issue than what it appears to be.</p>
<p>EDIT: look at it from an objective point of view, who would benefit most from such an attack? Sure as hell aint Assad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they are well, much worse for humans. In conventional weapons your destroy structures which you might want to take over later. Sarin especially will kill you after instant paralalis, which ensures that it's properly done, positions you for a quiet takeover of the enemy area.
It also send out a message to the enemy that you will torture them if they don't surrender.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
