		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of misinformation in this thread. To answer your question, neither AncestryDNA nor 23andMe can give you a precise percentage breakdown of your ethnic background - but their results don't claim to do that, either. AncestryDNA is pretty clear about offering an estimate of your <em>genetic</em> ethnicity, while 23andMe claims to be able to approximate the proportions of your <em>genetic</em> ancestry with 90% accuracy.</p>
<p>These services work by analyzing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in your DNA. SNPs are genetic variations which scientists can use as &quot;markers&quot; when comparing DNA across populations. For example, researchers evaluating possible genetic links to a disease might compare SNPs in people with the disease to SNPs in people without it. If a particular SNP variant, known as an allele, is much more common in people with the disease than in people without, that allele might be a marker for disease risk.</p>
<p>AncestryDNA and 23andMe have analyzed the DNA of people of known genetic lineage and, from the data collected, isolated marker alleles which are associated with specific ethnic populations. The companies then evaluate the alleles in your DNA and use their findings to estimate your genetic ethnicity/ancestry. If 20% of the SNPs tested show alleles associated with Native American ancestry, they will estimate that you have inherited 20% Native American <em>genetic</em> ethnicity/ancestry.</p>
<p>But what is <em>genetic</em> ethnicity/ancestry? Simply put, your DNA isn't necessarily going to be a completely accurate reflection of your actual ethnic heritage. We each inherit approximately 50% of our DNA from each parent, but alleles associated with ethnicity are not necessarily passed on proportionally. For example, your dad might be ethnically half Spanish and half Native American, with a genetic ethnicity that's 50% Native American and 50% Iberian. The alleles he passes on to you, though, might be 20% Native American and 30% Iberian. But that doesn't mean you're <em>not</em> ethnically a quarter Native American and a quarter Spanish; you just didn't inherit a genetic ethnicity/ancestry proportional to your actual ethnicity.</p>
<p>On top of all that, the associations between some alleles and some ethnic populations are stronger than others. A stronger association means the genetic testing company can be more confident in estimating your genetic ethnicity based on the presence of that allele, while a weaker association means the opposite. AncestryDNA uses confidence intervals to show their level of confidence in each estimate, while 23andMe allows you to view estimates at different confidence thresholds.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> AncestryDNA and 23andMe <em>don't</em> claim to tell you the exact percentage of ethnicities that comprise your ethnic background! What they do offer is a reasonably accurate estimate of the percentages of genetic material you received from distinct genetic lineages. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>DNA ancestry tests can be wildly inaccurate, but no one really knows for sure because all the different companies have their own testing methods and their own proprietary databases that they use for comparison, none of which is peer reviewed or independently verified in any way. DNA analysis itself is an exact science, but interpreting those results is not. You can get wildly different results from different companies. You should take the results with several grains of salt, and think of them more as a generalization of your possible ancestry. You're being hoodwinked when these companies tell you &quot;you're exactly 32% whatever&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to actually ELI5:</p>
<p>Everybody has a unique tray of cookies in the world. Some people have ginger snap, others chocolate chip... some even have green tea cookies! </p>
<p>What ancestry.ca, 23andme, and all other similar DNA analysis companies do is get a sample of somebody's cookie tray sent in so they can determine exactly what kind of cookies a person has. Ancestry.ca and 23andme can tell exactly what kind of cookies you have. </p>
<p>However, they can't tell <em>where</em> your cookies come from by only looking at your cookies. Nothing about a green tea cookie by itself would say something like &quot;Hey, this comes from China!&quot; or &quot;Hey, this comes from Japan!&quot; Conclusions made about your cookies come by comparing them to others. </p>
<p>While methods of determining where your cookies come from vary between companies, what generally happens is that your cookies are compared to a sample group; companies will create groups in specific areas, and test their cookies, then use them to compare further tests. This is fairly accurate, to a degree; if a lot of people from the Southern Europe group have biscotti cookies, and you have biscotti cookies, you probably are from Southern Europe! It is to be stressed these findings are not exact; it is impossible for companies to test everybody in the world, so their tests are only based off a small population of people. But they are still fun to look at!</p>
<p>One thing I'd also like to mention is that these tests also don't work very well on people with very rare cookies; few people alive today have vey rare cookies. Native Americans in North America, for example, have the bison cookie. Analyzing bison cookies can be difficult because most companies don't know what they look like; only a small amount of people have them, and there are also other very rare cookies like the cacao cookie or the blood pyramid cookie. </p>
<p>When testing for Native American populations, companies only have small groups of people for reference; many Native American people, as you know, died from germs that didn't affect people with the biscuit cookie. A person who is Native American might be told that they are not Native American because they have bison cookies but they don't have cacao cookies like the people of  Native American reference group do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
