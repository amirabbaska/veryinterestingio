		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big factor is that Europeans had spent centuries living in very close contact (often same house) as domesticated animals like pigs, cows, sheep etc. </p>
<p>Most epidemic-type viruses come from some animal vector. Living in close  contact with these animals meant europeans evolved immunity to these dieases, which gradually built up as those anumals became a bigger part of european life. </p>
<p>But indigenous Americans had much less close interaction with domestic animals (some Indigenous American cultures did have domesticated dogs, <del>hamsters</del> guinea pigs, etc, (for food) but it was <em>nowhere near</em> as common apart of American life and culture as european), so they got exposed to all these domestic animal viruses (toughened up by gradual contact with europeans) all at once.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;<strong>Populations that experienced different ecological histories
had different evolutionary responses.</strong>
In the case of infectious disease, it was in the main population centers of the Old World that human populations developed the strongest defenses.
Populations isolated from the Old World diseases did not have an opportunity to develop such protections. Amerindians, for example, experienced very little infectious disease. </p>
<p>The story is similar in other isolated populations, such as the Australian Aborigines, Polynesians, and the inhabitants of the Andaman Islands: They didn’t experience millennia of
infectious disease, didn’t evolve improved defenses as most Old Worlders did, and were decimated upon contact with the wider world.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>The Amerindians migrated from Northeast Asia some 15,000 years ago.
They did not carry with them crowd diseases that arose after the birth of agriculture, nor did they carry the genetic defenses that later developed against those diseases.
Since their path to the New World went through frigid landscapes like Siberia and Alaska, they left behind some of the ancient infectious diseases that were vectorborne or had complex life cycles—malaria and Guinea worm, for example. </p>
<p>The world they entered had never before been settled by hominids or great apes, so there were few local pathogens preadapted to humans. Many of the infectious diseases found in the Old World are thought to have originated in domesticated animals, but this does not seem to have been an important factor in the Americas.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>One sign of this reduced disease pressure is the unusual distribution of HLA alleles among Amerindians. The HLA system (for human leukocyte antigen) is a group of genes that encode proteins expressed on the outer surfaces of cells.
The immune system uses them to distinguish self from nonself, so they play an important part in rejection of transplanted organs.
But their most important role is in infectious disease. There they present protein fragments from pathogenic organisms such as bacteria to immune system cells that then attack the pathogen.
In addition, when a virus infects a cell, HLA molecules display viral proteins on the outside of the cell, so that those infected cells can be destroyed by the immune system.
HLA genes are among the most variable of all genes. There are ten or more major variants of each HLA gene, and most
have more than 100 variants. Because these genes are so variable, any two humans (other than identical twins) are almost certain to have a different set of them. Because the alleles are codominant, having different HLA alleles expands the range of pathogens that our immune systems can deal with. </p>
<p>Natural selection therefore favors diversification of the HLA genes, and some alleles, though rare, have been preserved for a long time.
In fact, some are 30 million years old, considerably older than Homo sapiens. That is to say, there are HLA alleles in humans that are more similar to an allele in an orangutan than to other human alleles at that locus. Selection favoring HLA diversity— a selective pressure stemming from infectious disease—has existed more or less continuously for tens of millions of years. This is why even small populations in the Old World retain high HLA diversity.</p>
<p>But Amerindians didn’t have that diversity. Many tribes have a single HLA allele with a frequency of over 50 percent. (2) (Cavalli-Sforza et al., The History and Geography of Human Genes, 1994)</p>
<p>Different tribes have different predominant alleles: It seems as if the frequencies of HLA alleles have drifted randomly in the New World, which hasn’t happened since the Miocene in the Old World. A careful analysis of global HLA diversity confirms continuing diversifying selection on HLA in most human populations but finds no evidence of any selection at all favoring diversity in HLA among Amerindians. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1461383/" target="_blank">(3)</a></p>
<p>And if infectious disease was so unimportant among Amerindians, selection most likely favored weaker immune systems, because people with weaker immune systems would be better able to avoid autoimmune disorders, in which the immune system misfires and attacks some organ or tissue. </p>
<p>Type 1 diabetes, in which the immune system attacks the pancreatic cells that make insulin, and multiple sclerosis, where it attacks the myelin sheaths of the central nervous system, are wellknown examples—both are rare among Amerindians. A less vigorous immune system would have been an advantage under those conditions.</p>
<p>So, there is every reason to think that the inhabitants of the Americas were not just behind the immunological times: While the Old Worlders were experiencing intense selection for increased resistance to infectious disease, the Amerindians were actually becoming more vulnerable. They were adapted to the existing circumstances, but not to the coming collision with the Old World.&quot;</p>
<p>(...)
We know a lot about the genetic basis of resistance to malaria, but relatively little about the genetic basis of European resistance to diseases like smallpox, although there are some
hints. </p>
<p>As we have said before, there is plenty of evidence for selection acting recently on many genes involved with disease defense, but in most cases we don’t know the biochemical
details—for example, which particular infectious organism a particular selected allele defended against. We suspect that delta CCR5 (for chemokine receptor 5), a common mutation among
northern Europeans, protects against smallpox, but since smallpox is dangerous to work with and now exists only in a couple of genetic repositories, it’s hard to be sure. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/100/25/15276.long" target="_blank">(7)</a></p>
<p>Some recessive genetic diseases that are common in Europe and the Middle East also probably have conferred resistance to some infectious diseases: That list would include cystic fibrosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin
deficiency, familial Mediterranean fever, connexin-26 deafness, and hemochromatosis. All are nonexistent in Amerindians, discounting recent admixture.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Syphilis was indisputably present in the Americas before European contact. The dispute is over whether or not syphilis was also present elsewhere in the world at that time. One of the two primary hypotheses proposes that syphilis was carried from the Americas to Europe by the returning crewmen from Christopher Columbus's voyage to the Americas. The other hypothesis says that syphilis existed in Europe previously, but went unrecognized until shortly after Columbus' return. These are referred to as the Columbian and pre-Columbian hypotheses, respectively</p>

<p>Being posted to the Caribbean was basically a death sentence. Soldiers and officials sent there expected to last around 3 years. Malaria, Yellow Fever, etc. One French army of 40,000 sent to Haiti in 1806 was destroyed by Yellow Fever, with more than 2/3 of the troops and most of the officers dying. </p>
<p>They caught syphilis from the natives and brought it back to Europe. </p>
<p>People often wonder 'Well if 95% of Native Americans died from diseases, why didn't 95% of Europeans die from diseases&quot;. </p>
<p>It wasn't 95%, but the number of European colonists who died to disease, sickness, cold, starvation, etc, was very high. For example, of the first 500 colonists to arrive at Jamestown, only about 50 were still alive two years later.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
