		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious about the pleasure aspect of this. Is this a learned behavior/used to let a partner know they're doing well? Personally when I experience intense pleasure, moaning is involuntary. On occasion, I've actually found it difficult to be quiet, should the situation call for it. I suppose &quot;letting a partner know they're doing well&quot; does not necessarily mean one is doing so consciously. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Your sexual partner just does it to make you feel better about yourself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This would need a response from someone who studies human behavior, but I've searched for the subject before and there's not a lot of research about it. The thing is, that as anything about the human brain and behavior, it's a difficult thing to study. But in any case it looks to be a natural human response, and as you may know, not only humans do it, many animals do it too. Who knows how much of this type of behavior in humans is learnt and how much is just pure instinct but it looks like a natural response to communicate and express your situation to others.
Just look at how animals use it, a groan most of the time is telling others around that you have a discomfort or feel threatened, so you could respond violently. Moaning on the other hand, kind of has two possible reasons, pain or pleasure and some articles around the web say moaning for pleasure looks to be a form of communicating that pleasure to the partner or increase libido.

<p>So, if all this is correct, then as any natural response it's not something that you can turn on or off that easily since it's not something that you do consciously. But of course if you rationalize it you can control it, but not always.
Here's another ELI5 about the subject without a definitive answer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1y389o/eli5_why_do_people_moan_during_sex/?utm_source=reddit-android" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1y389o/eli5_why_do_people_moan_during_sex/?utm_source=reddit-android</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eroded to add:
After reading the responses I have come to a conclusion. It’s like this. Someone asked a question. The question was answered but I felt the answer was not well supported. I should have gone to each one of the respondents I had issue with and replied separately. I didn’t want to. I made my own comment thread and I realize that in this sub I shouldn’t have done so if I wasn’t attempting an answer. </p>
<p>Why the hell is everyone saying it’s learned and fake and such in regards to sexual moaning? I have always moaned and cried out during good sex, and I have to concentrate not to. I enjoy sex more when I can relax and not worry about who might hear me. When no one is around I moan during masturbation as well, so who am I trying to impress then? And the ridiculous suggestions by some that it is some weird attempt to draw additional men is ludicrous. This is so stupid. People moan in pleasure from lots of things besides sex and they moan, and cry over emotional pain. It is natural and normal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
