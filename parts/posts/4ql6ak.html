		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit! I’m <a href="https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/people/brian-hare" target="_blank">Brian Hare</a>, and I’m here to talk about canine cognition and how ordinary and extraordinary dog behaviors reveal the role of cognition in the rich mental lives of dogs. The scientific community has made huge strides in our understanding of dogs’ cognitive abilities – I’m excited to share some of the latest and most fascinating – and sometimes surprising – discoveries with you. Did you know, for example, that some dogs can  learn words like human infants? Or some dogs can detect cancer? What makes dogs so successful at winning our hearts?</p>
<p>A bit more about me: I’m an associate professor at Duke University where I founded and direct the <a href="https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/research/dogs" target="_blank">Duke Canine Cognition Center</a>, which is the first center in the U.S. dedicated to studying how dogs think and feel. Our work is being used to improve training techniques, inform ideas about canine cognitive health and identify the best service and bomb detecting dogs.  I helped reveal the love and bond mechanism between humans and dogs. Based on this research, I co-founded <a href="https://www.dognition.com" target="_blank">Dognition</a>, an online tool featuring fun, science-based games that anyone with a dog can use to better understand how their dog thinks compared to other dogs. </p>
<p>Let’s talk about the amazing things dogs can do and why – Ask Me Anything!</p>
<p>For background: Please learn more about me in <a href="https://www.dognition.com/brian-hare" target="_blank">my bio here</a> or check me out in the new podcast series <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dogsmarts/id1115304038?mt=2" target="_blank">DogSmarts</a> by Purina Pro Plan on iTunes and Google Play to learn more about dog cognition.</p>
<p>This AMA is being facilitated as part of a partnership between Dognition and Purina Pro Plan BRIGHT MIND, a breakthrough innovation for dogs that provides brain-supporting nutrition for cognitive health. </p>
<p><strong>I'm here!  Look at all these questions!  I'm excited to get started!</strong></p>
<p><strong>OK AMAZING Q's I will be back later to answer a few more!</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'm back to answer a few more questions</strong></p>

If someone is caring for a dog with a cognitive disability, what are the necessary steps they should take to ensure their dogs life is still enjoyable?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
