<p>Since most of the historical evolution has been based on survival, why has the sex ratio in all mammals remained close? Why don't we see mammals where there are 100 females to 1 male? </p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks a lot for all the responses! I will be going through them and asking follow up questions as I get a chance :-)</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Wow this really blew up. Thanks for all the informative responses everyone, I think there seems to be a consensus that evolution happens at the individual level not at the specie level. And even if the there was a sex ratio discrepancy.. the social dynamics and other survival factors would bring the sex ratio to equal range over time. </p></div></div>
