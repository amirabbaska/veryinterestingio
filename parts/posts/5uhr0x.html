<p>The MPAA has a shadowy &quot;ratings board&quot;.  No one can find out who's on it, anyone whose name becomes known is removed.</p>
<p>How they got appointed is unclear.  The actual profiles don't seem to fit what MPAA described.</p>
<p>The MPAA believes this represents the viewing market.  They may not be that far off.  Sex IS seen as shocking and a moral threat but not violence by many people.</p>
<p>Other things of note:
Specifically, WOMEN enjoying sex or even being an active participant is seen as 10x more serious than just sex.  Seriously, a guy getting a blowjob is NBD.  Even the guy moaning out an orgasm is more or less ok for a family-ish comedy.  But a woman getting eaten out and enjoying it with equal focus on her reactions is just porn... a moral threat.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can I recommend an excellent podcast </p>
<p><a href="http://www.attaboyclarence.com/the-secret-history-of-hollywood-a-modern-guide-to-the-golden-age-of-hollywood/" target="_blank">http://www.attaboyclarence.com/the-secret-history-of-hollywood-a-modern-guide-to-the-golden-age-of-hollywood/</a></p>
<p>There is an episode called &quot;Sex in Monochrome&quot; which is very relevant to this.</p>
<p>There is a period in Hollywood called &quot;Pre-Code&quot;.  During this period, before what we call the Golden Age films had a lot more sex and violence</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Code_Hollywood#Creation_of_the_Code_and_its_contents" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Code_Hollywood#Creation_of_the_Code_and_its_contents</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1929, an American Roman Catholic layman Martin Quigley, editor of the prominent trade paper Motion Picture Herald, and Father Daniel A. Lord, a Jesuit priest, created a code of standards (which Hays liked immensely[11]), and submitted it to the studios.[7][12] Lord's concerns centered on the effects sound film had on children, whom he considered especially susceptible to their allure</p>
<p>The Code sought not only to determine what could be portrayed on screen, but also to promote traditional values.[18] Sexual relations outside of marriage could not be portrayed as attractive and beautiful, presented in a way that might arouse passion, nor be made to seem right and permissible.[14] All criminal action had to be punished, and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience.[4] Authority figures had to be treated respectfully, and the clergy could not be portrayed as comic characters or villains. Under some circumstances, politicians, police officers and judges could be villains, as long as it was clear that they were the exception to the rule.[14]</p>
<p>The entire document contained Catholic undertones and stated that art must be handled carefully because it could be &quot;morally evil in its effects&quot; and because its &quot;deep moral significance&quot; was unquestionable.[16] The Catholic influence on the Code was initially kept secret.[why?][19] A recurring theme was &quot;throughout, the audience feels sure that evil is wrong and good is right.&quot;[4] The Code contained an addendum commonly referred to as the Advertising Code, which regulated film advertising copy and imagery.[20]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also I would recommend that podcast again and also it's sister podcast &quot;Attaboy Clarence&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, part of the distinction lies with the simulation of the act versus a graphic depiction of it. For instance, graphic violence gets you an R rating, but simulated violence doesn't (so if you see lots of blood it goes to an R but otherwise you can blow up as much stuff as you want.) Likewise, sex receives a lower rating the less graphically you depict it. </p>
<p>Edit: For instance you can have Austin Powers and Two and a Half Men talk about sex all the time, but as long as you don't show anything besides a shirtless man and a woman covered up in bedsheets then you are in the firm PG-13 territory. </p>
<p>Likewise, Wolverine can stab and slash tons of soldiers without any blood and stay PG-13, but if you show a realistic portrayal of war like in Saving Private Ryan then you move up to an R rating. </p>
<p>Edit 2: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KXVizOUQVY&amp;app=desktop" target="_blank">An example of a PG-13 sex scene from the Notebook</a></p>
<p>Also, somehow Top Gun managed to stay PG with this <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uy6MseHSToI" target="_blank">love scene</a> although granted they still hadn't ironed out the kinks for what the PG-13 rating was going to be yet (it was only introduced 2 years prior to Top Gun). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's the norm to bathe in sauna - you have seen your entire family naked every week ever since you were a little kid. Childrens' programs on TV can have nudity when it is not sexualized.</p>
<p>Cursing is considered rude but is in no way censored, not even on shows meant for everyone.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuvaohjelmien_ikärajat_Suomessa" target="_blank">rating system</a> has this scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>S = allowed for all ages</li>
<li>7 = recommended minimum age</li>
<li>12 = rec. min. age</li>
<li>16 = rec. min. age</li>
<li>18 = strictly enforced</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of the what causes the rating jump from appropriate for all ages to min. age 7:</p>
<ul>
<li>Violence: mild, slapstick and unrealistic <strong>or</strong> single short but realistic expression of violence.</li>
<li>Sexuality: mild sexual themes, concealed eroticism </li>

<p>Much of it is cultural as well.  As a Francophone Canadian, I see the dichotomy on a regular basis.  Our state broadcaster is the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation/Société Radio-Canada (anglo and franco divisions, respectively).  The English language side will have violence (though nowhere near as much as US productions) and zero nudity and sex.  Tbe French language productions have plenty of contextual nudity, but very little violence.  And the violence that is shown is essential to the plot.  Breasts and full rear nudity are not hidden even if the show is during primetime.</p>
<p>As another example, English radio stations censor some works like bitch and fuck.  That same song played on a French language station will not be censored.  In short, French Canada still holds European standards (to an extent) while English Canada holds American standards (to an extent as well) possibly due to the massive media import from the US which that segment of the population consumes.</p>
