		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>to add something with less detail and specifically about drinking water: if it's a small amount (such as a gulp while drinking), you'd normally have your cough reflex kick in and drive that water out. I'll persist as long as there's still enough water irritating down there, which can lead to instead of just one or two coughs, coughing fits.</p>
<p>if you actually swallow a lot, well, it's pretty much what the other being said, you end up with aspiration (which can be water, any other fluid, sometimes even stomach contents which is very dirty and lead to aspiration pneumonia). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is possible. It's called &quot;aspiration.&quot; What happens then is that fluid can sit and pool in your lungs. Which isnt good for your lungs. Pneumonia can happen or other respiratory dysfunctions. This is actually common in (older) adults that has lost some ability to swallow properly. This is why you will see some people on thickened liquids and pureed food to be able to eat. It's easier to swallow properly. Food can also go into your lungs as well. Aspiration in general can prove to be fatal. If I recall correctly, it's why you want to watch drowning victims for &quot;dry drowning.&quot; They inhaled fluid into their lungs and that's what killed them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My 3yo just went through this last weekend. She's in a &quot;gargling everything&quot; phase. Gargled water while laughing, some went into her lungs while the rest was in her mouth/throat and a few things happened: Her body reflexively tried to cough/exhale to get it out of her lungs. But since there was also still fluid in her mouth and throat, she also had a reflexive swallow. This essentially paralyzed her, holding everything in place because the force up and force down reflexes were both activated. Heimlich didn't work, my husband ended up jamming a finger as far down her throat as possible while one of our older kids called 911. It broke the reflex traffic jam, she coughed quite a bit and of course we all cried. </p>
<p>We could still hear wetness in her lungs when she coughed, so we went to the ER to be safe. Thankfully it was only a tiny amount still down there and we were advised to watch closely for signs of low oxygen or pneumonia. It's been just under a week and she's ok, so we seem to be all clear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aspiration pneumonia, caused by inhaling food/drink, is actually the way that Alzheimer's disease eventually kills you. Your brain unravels to the point where you are unable to swallow, and eventually you aspirate, or inhale some food, and it winds up in your lungs, where it doesn't belong, causing an infection. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: If your body does its job, no. Your larynx (upper airway, vocal chords), will spasm shut to prevent any foreign liquid (or solid matter) from entering the lungs. This is called a laryngospasm. It’s why you feel “tight” after drinking something and it goes down the wrong hole. </p>
<p>If foreign matter does make its way into your lungs, there are a vast multitude of factors that determines what happens to it next. Is the person still breathing on their own? What was the matter? How much of it was there? Is the person in good or poor health? Prior existing conditions? I’ll edit this later being dispatched on a call currently </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
