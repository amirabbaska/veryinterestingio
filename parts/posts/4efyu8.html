<p>The statement is found almost midway down the article.  What metallicity would be expected for a star a) of the Sun's age and b) of the Sun's type?  Is there any implication here?  E.g., Was the sun likely formed elsewhere in the galaxy, such as the galactic center, etc.</p>
<p>Wikipedia says:  &quot;Population I, or metal-rich stars, are young stars with the highest metallicity out of all three populations. The Earth's Sun is an example of a metal-rich star. These are common in the spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy.&quot;</p>
<p>So it's common to find young, metal-rich stars in the spiral arms.  The sun is located just outside of a spiral arm.  The sun is young and metal-rich.  So what exactly would make the sun's metallicity unusual?  It seems to be exactly what one would expect based on the sun's location and age...</p></div></div>
