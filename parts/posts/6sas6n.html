I noted that many of the craters had lines radiating outwards.<br />
What causes them on the moon?  Why are they lines rather than a 'fading grey of concentric circles'?<br />
edit:  I mis-spelled their/there in the title.  Sincerest apologies!</p></div></div>

As to why it doesn't form rings, I'm only speculating here, but it could be due to the fact that lunar regolith consists of fine particles and small rocks only to a depth of 4-15 meters. Below that is what's known as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regolith#Moon" target="_blank">megaregolith</a>, which consists of large chunks of bedrock. These large chunks being ejected by meteor impacts could be the cause of the ray formation as they are thrown from the impact site, trailing smaller fragments. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
