		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems that operators, whether they're pertaining to numbers, sets, propositional logic, vectors or whatever, will only have an associative property (ex. (a+b)+c = a+(b+c) ) when they also have a commutative property (ex. a+b = b+a). </p>
<p>I can't quite put my nose on what the two properties have in common with each other; is there an abstract proof (or disproof) that they're bi-conditional, or something along those lines? Sorry if my question's not clear I'm slightly drunk and frustrated because I can't figure it out on my own.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are plenty of operators that are associative, but not commutative. And plenty that are the other way around. Just to give one example of each:</p>
<p>Function composition: we define the composition of two functions from R-&gt;R, f * g as f(g(x)). Checking associativity:</p>
<p>(f <em> g) </em> h = f(g(x)) <em> h = f(g(h(x)) = f </em> g(h(x)) = f <em> (g </em> h)</p>
<p>However, this operator is not commutative. Let f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = x^(2), then f <em> g = x^2 + 1, but g </em> f = (x + 1)^(2).</p>
<p>The other way around, consider the operator that takes 2 real numbers and returns the average. So a (+) b = (a + b) / 2. This operator is clearly commutative since addition is. But it is not associative. Take a = 0, b = 4, c = 2:</p>
<p>(a (+) b) (+) c = 2 (+) 2 = 2</p>
<p>a (+) (b (+) c) = 0 (+) 3 = 1.5</p>
<p>There are plenty of other examples that you can find for either direction, so in general it is definitely not the case that associativity and commutativity are interchangeable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Believe it or not but you'll learn in any introductory abstract algebra course that the Associative property is more common and general than the Commutative property.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good example of non-associative (but extremely useful) operation that you've likely seen before is the cross product x on vectors in 3-dimensional space.  You usually see this first as a way to take two vectors u and v, and form a new vector (u x v) which is orthogonal to the original two vectors.</p>
<p>This operation is  anti-commutative, i.e., it commutes up to a minus sign, since (u x v) = - (v x u).</p>
<p>It's very non-associative though.  Instead of associativity, it satisfies the &quot;Jacobi Identity&quot;, which can be stated in the following form.  Given three vectors a, b, and c, it's always true that:</p>
<p>a x (b x c) = (a x b) x c + b x (a x c)</p>
<p>This identity is important in defining an algebraic object called Lie algebras.  Beyond being fascinating objects from a mathematical standpoint, Lie algebras also have important applications to particle physics.</p>
<p>If we work with vectors with <em>complex</em> coordinates (i.e., we don't mind giving -1 a square root), the vectors in 3-dimensional space with the cross product form the Lie algebra sl_2(C), which is (arguably!) the most important Lie algebra of all!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
