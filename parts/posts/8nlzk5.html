		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can get a lot of <a href="http://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/co2/ice_core_co2.html" target="_blank">climate history from ice cores</a>, and the dynamics of ice sheets are important for estimating future sea level rise in response to warming.</p>
<p>The waters around Antarctica have unique biology.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02929" target="_blank">uniquely non-turbulent clear air for astronomical purposes</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IceCube_Neutrino_Observatory" target="_blank">detect neutrinos with huge blocks of ice</a>.</p>
<p>Also helps that it's a big chunk of land which is currently outside of national boundaries, and part of the goal is to stake a claim to part of it if that should ever change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the continent least contaminated by human activity and much of it is frozen so there's unique opportunities to discover aspects of planetary,climate, and biological history. Think of how useful Pompeii was for historians since it was like a city frozen in time</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Antarctica is important in the field of meteoritics.</p>
<p>Meteorites fall all over the planet in roughly similar rates, but the flow of ice in some regions of Antarctica acts to concentrate meteorites and push them to the surface.</p>
<p>This is also helped by the fact that the (mostly dark) meteorites often stand out against the white snow.</p>
<p>There are multiple trips each year where planetary scientists will go and 'farm' the meteorites from these areas.</p>
<p>ANSMET is one organisation involved in their collection</p>
