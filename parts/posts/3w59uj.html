		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maker's and other established companies know on average how many gallons they sell a year. But let's pretend snewzie's whiskey is a brand new distillery. </p>
<p>The first year, I might sell as many gallons of bulk alcohol as I can, or even unaged moonshine style whiskey. Save whatever surplus in whiskey barrels to age. The second year, make more white whiskey, maybe try to sell some whiskey from last year, again saving some of this year and year 1 whiskey. </p>
<p>Repeat this for 5 to 10 years, and you've built up an inventory of aged whiskey, while still not going bankrupt. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It takes money to make money.  Most new businesses lose money for a while before they can turn a profit. As big as they are, it took Amazon over a decade to start turning a profit.</p>
<p>There's some things they can do, such as selling unaged whiskeys or use some of their capacity to produce booze under contract for other companies but, ultimately, they just need to wait until they have products ready for the market.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes they can't, so they have to allocate their product. This is happening a lot right now, but how much of that is a real shortage, and how much is marketing is up for debate.</p>
<p>Other strategies are to lower the proof of the product by adding more water, so what they have in inventory goes further (Maker's Mark tried to do this a few years ago but they reversed their decision after a huge backlash), or removing age statements from their products, so they can mix younger whiskey into it. (Jim Beam just did this with Beam Black, it used to have an 8 year age statement, meaning none of the whiskey in the bottle is younger than 8 years old, but they removed the 8, and now have an &quot;XA&quot; on the bottle, meaning &quot;Extra Aged&quot;)</p>
<p>When there is an excess, distillers can store the whiskey that has aged the desired amount in huge steel vats so it doesn't age any more.</p>
<p>It's hard to predict marketing trends so far in the future, and distillers attempt to do so, but sometimes it just comes as a surprise, so you get situations where only the best-performing stores get a couple bottles of a desirable whiskey every year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all whiskey is aged for 10 years, that may only be a small amount of what they sell the most of.  Much of what is sold at bars or liquor stores have only been aged between 2 and 7 years with 4-7 being the most common.  </p>
<p>In Kentucky there are more barrels of bourbon aging then there are people.  So close to 5 million barrels of whisky at any given time.  That would equal about 375 million gallons of product.   (Depending on the age only about 45 gallons or less come out of a barrel and it is cut with water to get it down to 80-100 proof.  So a barrel will give you roughly 75 gallons of whiskey to bottle) Or roughly 1,875,000,000 bottles of whiskey.  </p>
<p>So not all of it that has reached its year mark gets bottled every year.  What's left over continues to age and may be used next year, or may be bottled at 10 years.  </p>
<p>Some expensive bourbons that have been aged for 20+ years were made in a time where they could not have foreseen the rise in Bourbon popularity.  Also due to the extremely long aging, a lot of it evaporates and you only get back about 25 or so gallons from a barrel.  So a very small amount of it is bottled yearly.  In another 20 years, it should be more common as the distilleries are likely putting more in barrels now for he future.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're talking about high end whisky which is only a very small percentage of the market.</p>
<p>The vast majority of whisky is no age statement blended whisky. However these blends are by no means bad just because they are low end. They work hard to maintain a decent and consistent taste profile using some very nice ingredients and then a lot of cheaper grain whiskys whose taste they usually do a decent job of hiding. Of course this involves using some older higher quality whiskys to get the taste right.</p>
<p>Because these blenders are a more consistent and reliable customer, even the makers of older higher quality whiskys will tend to sell most of it to the blenders to use in blends. But they'll sell a relatively speaking small amount to customers directly. This is what you know as high end whisky with an age statement.</p>
<p>If one of these high end whiskys booms in popularity then that just means they sell less to the blenders that year.</p>
<p>Take the story of Johnny Walker Red Label and Cardhu. JW Red has no age statement. It is easily the most popular whisky in the world (can't find a source but I think it's responsible for something like 10% of global whisky sales).</p>
<p>One of Johnny Walker's most expensive ingredients used to be Cardhu. Cardhu also did a 12 YO single malt but the vast majority of Cardhu went into JW. Then in 2000 a very successful advertising campaign led to sales of Cardhu's 12 YO single malt surging in Spain. So Cardhu sold less of it's 12YO barrels to JW and bottled more of it themselves to sell in high end shops.</p>
<p>But JW's blenders found it hard to get the taste of JW red right without Cardhu so they pressured Diageo (the parent company of both) to make Cardhu continue to supply them with their 12YO. Cardhu did this, and tried to keep up production of their 12YO at the same time by keeping the bottle the same but changing the description from &quot;12 YO single malt&quot; (12 years minimum ageing, all malt whisky from one distillery) to &quot;12 YO pure malt&quot; (12 years minimum ageing, all malt whisky but from several distilleries) and diluting their Cardhu with other similar 12 year old malts they brought from wholesalers.</p>
<p>Then there was an outrage and they had to reverse their decision. But that meant less Cardhu 12 YO for Johnny Walker Red, and so JW had to find other expensive whiskys with a similar taste profile for their blenders to work with, for a bit. </p>
<p>Fast forward 12 years and now Cardhu are making a lot more spirit, their 12YO is still doing well, and they are once again the primary top end ingredient in JW Red. But it took 12 years to increase manufacturing, in the meantime they just had to reduce their contribution to the blend.</p>
<p>Tl:dr - Most age statement whisky is mixed into Johnny Walker. If your age statement whisky becomes popular you just hold more of it back from Johnny.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
