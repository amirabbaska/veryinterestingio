<p>From cool to hit the scale went Red, Orange, Yellow, White And Blue. </p>
<p>Tl ;dr; Why do stars go from yellow to white to blue, rather than through green like a rainbow?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The light emitted by hot objects is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation" target="_blank">black-body radiation.</a></p>
<p>With blue and red stars, most of the radiation is outside our visible range, so we can just see where it enters at one edge of our range (ie, blue or red). Green is in the middle of the visible range.</p>
<p>In other words, the light is too broad a spectrum to be &quot;saturated&quot;, ie, even when the peak wavelength is green, the presence of blue and red will just make it look white. Look at the first chart in that wikipedia page - the curve shows the black body colour, which never enters the green region.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Colour of stars is a combination of the frequencies emitted by the source,  which as people have mentioned is a black body spectrum,  the intensity of each frequency which is lost due to scattering in the atmosphere and the way your eye sees colour in terms of the responses of the three (for some people four ) cones cells in your eyes. The sun actually briefly looks green just as it drops below the horizon due to refraction. </p>
<p>Looking at stars in the sky your eyes will be operating in low light conditions known as scotopic vision, which actually alters your perception of colour anyway, so it is hard to gauge the true colour of stars by eye.  Frankly why things are the colour they are is actually quite a deep question!  But the primary reason is the combination of frequencies that make up a black body source cannot ever be the colour we have evolved to see as &quot;green&quot; nor can it be pink for example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
