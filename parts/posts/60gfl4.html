		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand that if you have a given mass compressed into a sphere with radius below its Schwarzschild radius, the escape velocity of that mass is such that light cannot escape it (it is a black hole).  I understand that current understanding of elemental particles and the forces they exert would not provide enough force to resist gravitational collapse.</p>
<p>The thing I'm kind of missing is how this necessarily leads to the idea of a point of near - infinite density and infinitesimal volume.  From my limited understanding, part of the idea of a singularity is that we don't understand how the physics of such an object would work at all, in common parlance we hear that physics &quot;breaks down.&quot;  If we're going to admit that physics as we understand them can't tell us anything useful about a singularity, what leads us to believe the collapse wouldn't stop at say - the size of a tennis ball, or the Planck length, or something like that? </p>
<p><del>Also, can someone speak to any explanation of the coincidence that the density we calculate as being unable to observe due to it's escape velocity is <em>exactly</em> the density that we calculate collapses into a singularity?</del> EDIT: That is not the case, thanks /u/Robo_Connery.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't. We don't pretend we do either though.</p>
<p>The pressure inside whatever object is inside a black hole far exceeds the maximum (well best scaling) pressure that we know about, the degeneracy pressure of neutrons. </p>
<p>There is nothing stopping there being another pressure that we don't know about, &quot;string pressure&quot; or some exotic matter pressure. We don't have theories or observations for any other pressure though and, due to the nature of a black hole, we may never have anything conclusive. At the moment, that there exists a singularity inside a black hole, is certainly the most accurate we can be.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is not true at all. There is no coincidence because the two things (formation of event horizon and exceeding the maximum pressure) don't happen at the same time.</p>
<p>If we have a fictitious neutron star that we gradually add mass to we will eventually reach the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit. This limit is when any extra mass we add will increase the gravity of the star beyond what the internal pressure can support.</p>
<p>At the exact point you reach this limit the surface escape velocity is LESS than the speed of light.</p>
<p>Since the force pulling stuff in exceeds the force pushing stuff out the star will shrink, very quickly it will have shrunk from it's initial size (~10km) to (~4km) which, for something of a few solar masses is the Schwarzschild radius. At this point and not before, the surface escape velocity exceeds the speed of light.</p>
<p>With no pressure capable of resisting the ever increasing gravity we assume the collapse continues till all the mass is in a single point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question: if the resultant product was not a point (or ring) would we be able to figure this out by gravitational mapping? Any anisotropies would have to be extremely minute wouldn't they? But infalling matter could cause restructuring similar to neutron starquakes? It is hard for me to imagine an interior that is not a singularity. But imagination has nothing to do with reality quite frequently. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
