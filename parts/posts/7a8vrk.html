The bee seemed to be inspecting scattered things on the drive way, a leaf, a worm that had crawled up and died, a beer cap.  Each time, the bee would approach (in flight) and swing side to side for 5-8 seconds and then move on to the next object. It did this for each one.  </p>
<p>My question is, why? Is it something with their eyes?</p></div></div>

Interestingly different bee species or hives may have different habits or dances. Think of it like a bee taking a big sniiiiff of the thing; they can't really breathe like we can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
