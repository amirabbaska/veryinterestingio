		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Copied for visibility, the answer is from my comment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3xvd0b/why_is_glass_so_loud/cy86hud" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Essentially, what causes the noise is that glass is a very stiff material, and resonates for a long time when struck. You can hear this whenever two glasses clink together. When glass is broken each piece is able to 'ring' independently. The frequencies they produce will depend on their size and shape, and the combined effect can be extremely loud. This is especially true if it was formerly a large piece of glass, such as a doorway, because it will produce many pieces.</p>
<p>^EDIT: ^Grammar</p>
<p>EDIT2: To answer a common question, constructive interferance will have little to do with the noise. Rather, the sounds have a range of frequencies, all of which will 'pile up' on each other constructively and destructively. The overall effect is an increase in noise power, however, and so the loudness increases. For a good overview, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density#Power_spectral_density" target="_blank">Power Spectral Density</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT3: Edited for clarity and added more information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glass is incredibly brittle/hard, as well as dense, and thus doesn't lose a whole lot of energy when it vibrates (imagine the reverse of this as a pillow). When class vibrates, most of the energy is going into sound/heat. Compare this to squishier objects, where more energy is going into just moving around the particles on the inside of the object.</p>
<p>Also, your girlfriend fell through a glass door? Is she okay?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As people have noted, glass is pretty stiff:like 80 GPa versus 180 GPa for steel. If you bang clean steel balls together, though, it won't be as loud as a similar-energy impact of glass balls. That's because steel is ductile: it acts like clay and if you look closely you'll see that the contact surface of the steel has been deformed. That means the balls had a little time to stop and turn around. The yield stress of steel is like 250 MPa versus 2,000 MPa for glass. So glass is much stronger than most steels (not tougher, though). So if you smash two pieces of glass together and they don't break, they will stop very suddenly, which will cause a sudden change in airflow around them leading to a pressure waveâ€”a loud sharp sound.</p>
<p>If they do break, then it's brittle so all the energy is dissipated at once so you get a sudden smashing sound versus a thud for steel.</p>
<p>Hardened steel is almost as high yield stress and sounds a lot like glass.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: glass doesn't yield so glass objects stop &quot;instantly&quot; when they collide; that means acceleration is speed/zero time. Don't divide by zero or things get loud.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound is a change in air pressure. Glass is a very efficient surface for changing the air pressure. Much like the cone in a speaker, it can push and pull air really well. When it shatters it's basically the highest amount of energy you can put into the glass so the resulting sound is a bunch of highly efficient acoustic surfaces expelling the energy from the impact. </p>
<p>This is one aspect of the answer but not the entire picture. Just the bit I'm familiar with. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
