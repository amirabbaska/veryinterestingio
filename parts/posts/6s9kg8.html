		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its just a regular gif, its just that your brain interprets the rotation it sees in the image as a three dimensional object.  its your brain which decides how to mix images with depth cues to decide how far away things are, and its using that rotation effect to interpret the image as being a sphere.  There are a bunch of different ways your brain decides how far away things are there's the well known way of the difference between what the right and left eyes see, parallax, and that's what 3D glasses help you with, but for things that are far away they don't help much which you can see if you close alternating eyes, something close will appear to move much further side to side than something far away. </p>
<p>Another method is the fact that the eyes can adjust their focal lengths so that they focus at a different distance away, this isn't something a 3D movie or screen can work with because the image is always at a fixed distance away and that's where the eye has to focus. </p>
<p>There are also a bit less clear cut ones like the relative size of objects,  things that are close look bigger then when they're far away and the brain will use that information to map out the scene. </p>
<p>In this case what the brain is using is the motion of the image to interpret the scene has having depth.  And so that's what you feel when you see it.  </p>
<p>There are a whole bunch of cues for depth, not just the one that 3D glasses cover, and they all get used everyday to make really complicated assessments of what we see.  This gif is just tricking one of them and not giving other information that would let the brain make the more &quot;correct&quot; conclusion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone in the comments describes why. The pictures are distorted, so parts of it move unnaturally to what your brain expects from a flat image, so your brain compensates by trying to map it to a shape that aligns with how it moves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its the contour of the shapes as they lay on the sphere. As they transverse the sphere left to right, the features of the photo of the lunar surface distort to follow the contour of a globe. Oblong toward the edges, &quot;flatter&quot; or a straight on whole view as they get closer to a head on view in the center. </p>
<p>In the same way this drawing of a hand is made to look 3d, so is this gif.  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/As1lZWf.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/As1lZWf.jpg</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brain uses various visual cues to detect depth and one of those cues is a parallax effect in which <strong>relative</strong> movement of image parts makes object seem volumetric even without using stereoscopic vision, try seeing the gif with one eye closed, the effect would be attenuated even more. In the gif parts of the moon that are closer to the edge move slower than in the center so the overall movement gives fake distance effect to those edges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
