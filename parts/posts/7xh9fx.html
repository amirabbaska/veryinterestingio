		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I don't think this is chemical, i think it's legal.  the bottles aren't rated for reuse, legally.  they have not done the testing needed to verify that they can safely reuse their bottles, so they put the warning on there.  What you do with the bottle in your personal use is WAY different.  It's similar to the do not remove mattress tags.  those aren't for you, they're to stop people reselling mattresses under the table.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good responses here, but I feel the need to step in and say that plastic degrading or breaking off into your drink is rare to impossible. The plastic of ordinary beverage containers still takes near eternity to degrade or release anything harmful. Reports have exaggerated this concept when the actual effects occur over a matter of decades. Keep reusing that bottle as long as you keep it clean. Infinitely better even than recycling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other responses, which are all accurate, there's another more immediately commercial reason. If you don't refill the bottle, then you'll have to buy a new one already full of water. </p>
<p>Refilling bottles hurts the company's chances of you buying more bottles from them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The more you use the bottle the more microscopic cracks will appear on the inner layers. (as well as the outer ones but that doesn't matter as much in this case)</p>
<p>The cracks are perfect spot for bacteria to stay and eventually make its way into your body when drinking from the bottle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They say &quot;do not refill&quot; because the company doesn't want any liabilities concerning what someone might try to pour into them. I believe it's as simple as that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
