<p>How important is class?
Are people from different classes expected to behave a certain way? Manners, accents, where they live, etc.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I never expected so much thoughtful responses.  Class in the UK is difficult to explain but I think I was schooled by the thoughtful responses below. I will be back in London this year so hopefully I will learn more about the UK. Happy New Year everyone! </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have to laugh at all the people saying ‘class divisions don’t really exist here any more’. My life has been a study of British class divisions. My family went from lower working class (both grandfathers were coal miners) to the lower rungs of aristocracy in two generations (my sister and I were privately educated, went to very good universities; she married name-on-buildings wealthy). I can safely assure you that class divisions are very deeply entrenched in the UK, but not in a glaringly obvious way to most people. </p>
<p>The working and lower-middle classes are relatively close together in wealth, education, society, location, etc. They intermingle pretty seamlessly, having gone to the same state schools, holiday destinations, restaurants, rugby/football games, pubs, etc -and in some cases universities.  The major fork in society is found at true middle-class, where those who can afford it send their children to private schools. </p>
<p>This is the most obvious indicator of class and wealth. ‘Old money’ places like Eton, Harrow and Gordonstoun (expect titles and landed gentry), newer money but still very wealthy places like Charter House and Cheltenham Ladies’ (father is a CEO, CFO, Russian property magnate, mummy comes from old money), moving ‘down’ the ranks to Haberdashers’, Houndslow, etc. until you find yourself among the thousands of ‘no-name’ private schools that, despite not possessing massive endowments or educating peers of the realm, still act as the gate-keepers of social stratification. </p>
<p>Universities are <em>slightly</em> more egalitarian. Theoretically, anyone can make it to Oxford, Cambridge, UCL, St Andrews, etc. if they work super hard and have all the right extra-curriculars, but state schools capable of sculpting such a student are relatively thin on the ground (and generally located in high net worth areas anyway). In comparison, private schools exist to craft you into the perfect candidate. If a state school student does manage to make it to the British version of the Ivy League, they are immediately met with their first taste of social stratification: drinking port with tutors, rowing, lacrosse, punting, literal Old Boys’ and Girls’ networks, wine tasting, ski trips, gap years, summers abroad, polo, and so on. Having never experienced these things, it is very difficult to assimilate and learn the new language of wealth and privilege, even if you can afford to indulge such pastimes. </p>
<p>Upper-middle and upper class people don’t apply for jobs. They reach out through the previously established networks described above, secured and reinforced by a lifetime of shared experiences on their strata.</p>
<p>It is because of these literally exclusive experiences that the wealthy have their own language that distinguishes them from middle-class in a way that doesn’t ‘upset the proletariat’. Your average Brit wouldn’t be able to distinguish a casual mention of skiing in Corchevel from Klosters or St Moritz or Val Thoren, but these all mean different things to the initiated. The working and middle classes would just hear ‘I went skiing’; something that most can not afford to do either way. But to those in-the-know, these make a difference between networking with millionaires and networking with billionaires. This is just one example out of dozens to show how the upper-classes heavily stratify themselves in ways the lower classes aren’t privy to.</p>
<p>Where you shop, dine, drink, live, work, entertain and are entertained, holiday, golf, swim, play tennis, etc. mean little to those who don’t know the language, but everything to those who do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest class divisions in the UK are probably working, middle, and upper class, which roughly translates to people who have skilled or unskilled manual jobs (construction, mechanic), people who have jobs that require more education (teacher, accountant), and the aristocracy.  However, these days it's a lot more complicated than that! Since a lot of industry here collapsed (see the 1970s and 80s), there are a lot of people who would probably consider themselves working class, but no longer work in those industries. &quot;Middle class&quot; encompasses a huge swathe of the population, so it's not necessarily a useful distinction. </p>
<p>You could probably more usefully divide the population by which newspaper they read, that seems to group people roughly by their wealth and political leanings. You've got papers like the Mirror and the Sun, whose readers generally have less money and education; the Daily Mail, which is like the British equivalent of Fox News; then more &quot;high brow&quot; papers like the Guardian (liberal/left wing), the Telegraph (Conservative/right wing), and the Times. The different papers often strongly advocate certain political stances (the EU referendum was a great example). I'm probably what you could describe as a typical Guardian reader - a bleeding-heart lefty liberal with too much education, who recycles and grows their own vegetables for fun ;-)</p>
<p>There's still very much an us and them mentality in this country when it comes to class, which the media and our politicians like to exacerbate and mercilessly exploit...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The most interesting part (on which John Cleese has written about in one of his books) was the part about the middle class having more money than the upper class, but still being vulgar. </p>
<p>The dynamic there is that it's fine to have money, but not to make it (ie inherited wealth vs. working as a lawyer or other professional)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary difference, at least between US/UK class systems, is financial</p>
<p>But it’s not just about how much money you have (like in the US), but how old, where it came from, etc. </p>
<p>In America, in theory anyone can rise to the upper echelons of society purely through economic means.  </p>
<p>In the UK you can be a broke aristocrat and still be “upper class”. </p>
<p>Money does not equate with social “class” as simply as it does in the US. In fact the wrong kind of money can be seen as vulgar and negatively impact your standing. </p>
<p>One exception would be honorary titles. If you were working class and distinguished yourself enough to receive a title, that would give you a boost in society, but more as a novelty factor. </p>
<p>As has been said in this thread, accent is the easiest signifier of class, (as it directly relates to your education - government or private school, note I did not say public school) but only to trained English ears as it’s more akin to dialects, so it’s quite nuanced. </p>
<p>This is why American’s tend to butcher the English accent. They think everyone English is “posh”, but they usually end up with a hideous version of Cockney from Mary Poppins. Cockney is definitely not posh. It is an awesomely weird and wonderful culture though. </p>
<p>This might be a good time to explain the Posh Spice conundrum. Posh Spice is ironic. She was/is very working class, she married a footballer. Doesn’t get more working class than football. But she liked to wear heels rather than trainers, hence the “posh”. Glad I got that off my chest!</p>
<p>Leaving aside arguments of rapacious elites sticking it to the working classes. A different topic. I think there is actually a good amount of genuine affection between the classes. I think a lot of this goodwill stems from WWII when the working class “Tommy” (enlisted men) really distinguished themselves and saved the nation. The officer corps was more likely drawn from the upper classes. But they all mucked in together. </p>
<p>In many respects I think a lot of people are quite comfortable with the class system. Its confusing to outsiders but makes sense to a lot of people in a weird way. Middle Class is of course the exception as they are perpetually aspirational. </p>
<p>You can see this affection today in small pockets of country life and sporting pursuits. it’s a tradition that is uniquely English and most everyone involved values it and wants to preserve it. </p>
