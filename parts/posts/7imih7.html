		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the beginning, screws were made by hand with metal or wood rods and files. We did the best we could, but no two threads were identical.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:  &quot;Henry Maudslay, (born Aug. 22, 1771, Woolwich, Kent, Eng.—died Feb. 14, 1831, London), British engineer and inventor of the metal lathe and other devices.&quot;  Specifically, he invented the screw-cutting lathe.</p>
<p>From the Connections series by James Burke: IIRC Mr. Maudslay traveled to France and saw a screw driven indexing machine being used to precisely scribe the lines on sextants for use in navigating the world. This was the inspiration for a lathe that was used to 'automate' the production of pulleys used in rigging the British Man of War sailing ships. According to Burke, this innovation won the naval arms race for Britain because no one else could build war ships as fast as Britain could.</p>
<p>The big deal with lathes is that they could cut screws a lot faster than a file. That's the leap in productivity you have to understand in order to get the impact of this screw-cutting lathe. </p>
<p>My observations from life as a toolmaker and lover of antique tech: I've never seen a lathe with the headstock on the right. It's always on the left. One might hypothesize that Mr. Maudslay's original design was this way and it was so successful that everyone copied it, but one would be wrong:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Maudslay#/media/File:Maudslay_screw-cutting_lathes_of_circa_1797_and_1800.png" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Maudslay#/media/File:Maudslay_screw-cutting_lathes_of_circa_1797_and_1800.png</a></p>
<p>This is the only lathe I've see that has the headstock on the right.</p>
<p>Others have mentioned it's easier to drive a right handed thread if you're a right handed person, and I believe this is probably the true reason for the standard, although I don't think there is a standard that says &quot;thou shalt screw clockwise.&quot; A screw-cutting lathe still depends on the touch and feel of its operator, and the majority of those operators were right handed.</p>
<p>My bet is the practice became commonplace before we had standards committees and the Industrial Revolution institutionalized it.</p>
<p>By institutionalized, I mean once a manufacturer committed to something that worked, it wasn't changed except to make incremental improvements. Changing automatic screw machines was not a good investment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are predominantly right-handed and importantly the musculature of the arm delivers great twisting action clockwise to the right arm. This is due to the geometry of the joints and the way the radius pivots across the ulna in the lower arm. The upper arm muscles really give some purchase when tightening a screw.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's likely related to the right hand rule.  Left hand threads tighten counter clockwise and correlate to the left hand.  There are a lot of things in nature and physics that behave according to the right hand rule.</p>
<p>Much better than &quot;righty tighty, Lefty loosey&quot; is using your hand for each type of screw.  Simply cup your hand and point your thumb in the direction you want the screw to travel and you turn the screw in the direction that your fingers point.  If dealing with right handed threads(most screws) use your right hand. If dealing with the rare left handed thread, use your left hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
