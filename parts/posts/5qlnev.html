		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are likely structural differences in the brain which may account for &quot;high IQ&quot;. For example, it was found that individuals like Einstein have larger than average areas of the brain in charge of imaginative abilities. Likely enhancing Einstein's ability to imagine/stimulate complex phenomena. He famously gained insights into light/physics/energy from literally imagining himself traveling along on a beam of light. </p>
<p>We know that different areas of the brain perform various functions so it's likely that a predisposition to stronger connections or activity and likely size of the specific region may influence abilities</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are asking a question to an answer we dont fully understand yet. If you worked out on some level every day versus the same version of you sitting and reading reddit all day were to get an IQ test, you might score the same for different reasons. Due to other factors you might score different. There are a lot of variables to your question. Your age/experience would definitely be a factor, what if you were born in a cave but aced at cave-paintings? I would love for someone who is more qualified than me to chime in.</p>
<p>I will bet money that a current version of you will do better than you if you were to do things that helped brain development and neuroplasticity. Whether is was taking vitamins, working out, taking drugs or just connecting your brain to the internet in the next ~50 years. I wonder if an individual who has an IQ of 120 can get 180 just because he designs the IQ tests.</p>
<p>There are DEFINITELY physical differences in the brain, whether its nature or nurture. Neural pathways are always changing so yesterdays &quot;you&quot; is different from today's &quot;you&quot;. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a medium strength correlation between IQ and reaction time. <a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/18569" target="_blank">This stackexchange answer</a> gives a nice overview. So <em>if</em> reaction time is determined mostly by bulk properties of neurons, or something similarly &quot;physical&quot; (as opposed to, I don't know, conscious decisions or something), then yes, that's a difference.</p>
<p>Regarding genetic contribution, Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ" target="_blank">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The general figure for the heritability of IQ, according to an authoritative American Psychological Association report, is 0.45 for children, and rises to around 0.75 for late teens and adults.[5][6] The heritability of IQ increases with age and reaches an asymptote at 18â€“20 years of age and continues at that level well into adulthood.[7] Recent studies suggest that family and parenting characteristics are not significant contributors to variation in IQ scores;[8] however, poor prenatal environment, malnutrition and disease can have deleterious effects.[9][10]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But make sure you understand what &quot;heritability&quot; means, it's pretty complicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The whole idea of IQ is pretty outdated at this point. I'm sure you've heard the 'blaming fish for not being able to climb trees' quote at some point, and that is a pretty decent take on the situation. There are many, many different measures of 'intelligence,' and it is nearing impossible to look at changes in the brain as causation rather than correlation.</p>
<p>Also, a lot of IQ research comes from a time when people believed the brain didn't change or adapt, and now neuroplasticity is well-studied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As it has already been said we don't know a lot about why this is. However, in the mid 1980's after a scientist studied Einstein's brain. What he found was different than what was expected. Instead of Einstein having more neurons or synapses than the average brain, he had nearly twice as many glial cells. What is known about glial cells is that they provide support and nourishment for neurons, and they play an important role in synapse formation. While the meaning of this difference is still unclear it seems that Einstein's brain had much more neural support than many others, which could have assisted in his higher learning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
