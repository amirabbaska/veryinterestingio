<p>It made me wonder: does cooling a melted metal faster than the &quot;normal&quot; rate give it a higher hardness? For example, if I melted steel in a vacuum furnace, and then flooded the space with extremely cold argon (still a gas, let's say -295 degrees F), would that change the properties of the metal as compared to doing the exact same thing but using argon at room temp?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to your question is specific to each metal and its alloys. </p>
<p>What you are talking about is the cooling rate of the material and how it affects the properties of a metallic alloy. </p>
<p>For Steel, a high cooling rate will generate a very hard and brittle crystalline phase called Martensite. A faster cooling rate will increase the amount of martensite in the steel thus increasing the hardness. At some point the steel will reach about 100% martensite and increasing the cooling rate will not significantly increase the hardness. </p>
<p>If you can reach significantly higher cooling rate (in the order of millions of degrees per second) you can create an amorphous metal which has a significantly higher hardness than polycrystalline metal. An amorphous metal is a metal that keep its liquid molecular arrangement rather than creating a crystalline phase (like martensite). Amorphous metal are also called metallic glass because of their similar structure and properties.</p>
<p>Aluminum is much different than steel and the cooling rate as a much different effect. The typical aluminum alloy that is used for building and in cars is the 6000 series aluminum alloy. Using a high cooling rate on this alloy actually decreases it strength rather than increasing it. This alloy is hardened with a principle called precipitation hardening where precipitating compound in the metal will harden it. A high cooling rate with not allow enough time for the precipitate to form and the strength of the alloy will be at its minimum.</p>
<p>The cooling rate as such a big impact on the properties that you usually want to have a tight control on it to ensure that your material as the right properties. This is why materials will often go through a heat treatment before shipping it to the customer.</p>
<p>I went all over the place with my answer so if you have any other question donâ€™t hesitate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a steel mill, the argon is going to be room temperature by the time it gets to the melt. I used to work in air separation, and a lot of our facilities supplied oxygen, nitrogen, and argon to the mills. Gas would be supplied either directly from the separation tower, or it would be stored as a liquid, then vaporized before sending to the plant. </p>
<p>In the case of the gas pulled from the tower, as much of the cold is conserved as possible, by passing the nearly cryogenic pure gases through a heat exchanger against incoming compressed atmosphere. The outgoing gases will be about 60F. </p>
<p>The gas from vaporized liquid is also warmed to at least -15F before being put into a pipe to the plant, simply because any colder will cause carbon steel piping to become so brittle that it can easily rupture from the pressure. Stainless steel piping is used of the temperatures are going to be colder than that, and stainless steel piping is really expensive, so it's way cheaper to just warm the gas enough to use regular carbon steel. </p>
<p>Finally, I'm not sure what you were reading, but the mills normally don't really use the argon (or nitrogen) to cool the steel. They use those gases to &quot;blanket the melt&quot;, essentially flooding the top of the melt container with one of these gases to keep oxygen away from the melted steel. They <em>only</em> use argon for this in rare cases, when nitrogen will have some sort of chemical impact on a specific alloy. Argon is well over ten times as expensive as nitrogen in bulk supply, and they will use literally tons of gas each melt. </p>
<p>Stainless steel mills will also use argon for oxygen-argon decarburization, a process which bubbles the mixed gas through a steel melt to remove the carbon. This process also uses loads of argon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different cool down and heatup schedules to achieve specific material properties. CD at rate 1 for a certain length will give you one set. But when you hold temp in the middle for a day or two or three, it changes. Maybe heat back up to less than previous start point, cool down at rate 2, hold, cool down at rate 3...</p>
<p>Your different argon temperatures would result in different cool down rates. The cold shock would probably result in higher tensike stressed in the outside, and compression stresses on inside; when compared to room temp argon.
Material Science Engineering (matse) is a neat field and surprisingly complex. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a metallurgist who works in the automotive steel industry, I have to mention a clarification about how some vacuum furnaces works.  The vacuum isn't always to keep oxygen out, it can be used in the molten stage to reduce the pressure of the atmosphere to force excess carbon in the melt to release as CO and CO2.</p>
<p>The steel making step before vacuum degassing involves blowing oxygen in the molten metal to mix with excess carbon, creating CO and CO2 gas, but there's a limit to how much carbon you can remove through this method.  That's because normal atmospheric pressure is too high to reduce the carbon levels to the levels needed for low carbon steel grades (also called &quot;intersticial free&quot; steel).  </p>
<p>By pulling a vacuum, more carbon is able to be extracted as CO and CO2.  This step is critical for exposed automotive steel, which are the painted panels, doors, hoods, etc on cars.  Without reaching this ultra low carbon level, the steel wouldn't be soft enough to stamp the shapes they use in auto design these days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some alloys you also want to lock into a dual phase. Which can give you the strength (ductility) of one metal and the hardness of another. People see black smithing videos of for example swords being made and it all looks pretty simple you get it hot you hit it a bit then quench it then repeat. The precision required in the pouring temperature, the cooling time and the heat treatment are very tight. It's not simply as hot as possible or as cold as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
