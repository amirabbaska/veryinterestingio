<p>They found a 20 minute nap is better than 200mg of caffeine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A “power nap” as it is called is usually between 15-30 minutes, and when done correctly, avoids the deep sleep stages. The first 30ish minutes of sleep are spent in Stage 1 and 2, which are the lighter phases. During these, the brain is semi-relaxed, slows down signals, and gets some rest. It is important to wake up before Stage 3 and 4 because waking up during those leaves the person dazed and more tired, because the body was interrupted during its shut off stage. Power naps are like trying to reap as many benefits of sleep as possible without actually becoming fully asleep, meaning one feels more alert in less time. It can be compared to putting on a bandage when you’re really busy until you have time to get stitches.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn’t a perfect correlation between feeling states and physiological states. When you exercise, you start feeling fatigue long before your muscles physically run out of energy to burn. Obese people feel hungry at mealtimes even though it would take weeks of total starvation to kill them. And when you’re mildly sleep deprived, your brain purposely creates a state of sleepiness and exhaustion even though it is physically capable of continuing operation. You feel more tired than your brain actually is. The evolutionary reason for this is probably just to motivate humans to emphasize sleep in their daily routines and not go too long without it. So, a short nap is enough to reverse acute feelings of sleepiness. The brain is programmed to return to a restful feeling state even after a short period of sleep. But only in the short term. If you sleep poorly for 10 days in a row, you’ll find that a 20-minute power nap won’t rejuvenate you nearly as well as on day 1. At that point, your brain really is physically incapable of operating at full levels without sleeping to recover.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you start everyday with an empty trailer behind your car. You spend all day in your car. As you go about your day the trailer is filled with stuff you accumulate from daily experiences. A nap can empty some of the load from your trailer. Deep sleep on the other hand is car maintenance plus emptying of trailer. It takes longer and if your car functions fine, you won't feel much difference between just emptying the trailer and both maintenance and emptying the trailer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apparently it's built into our circadian rhythm through evolution. There's a dip around lunch time which allows a nap to be had because we probably all did this thousands of years ago like most animals. That dip is different depending if your circadian rhythm is different like a night owl. So the dip could be are around 5 o'clock for someone else. You get about 20 minutes, anymore and you've ruined it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
