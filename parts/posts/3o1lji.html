		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two basic types of space suits: Launch/Entry suits, and EVA suits.</p>
<p><strong>Launch/Entry:</strong> This could also be called Launch, Entry, Abort (LEA) suits or IVA (intra-vehicular activity) suits. I prefer the Launch/Entry or LEA designation because most of the prime design drivers center around when things go wrong - emergency launch pad egress, emergency landing, etc.  IVA suits makes it sound like it's what you wear when you're hanging out in orbit for long periods of time, which isn't really the case - you wear normal clothing for that.  In any case, LEA suits are designed to be: light, provide good mobility unpressurized, be pressurizable during an emergency like a cabin decompression, also provide minimal mobility when pressurized to operate critical controls; provide survival gear like emergency breathing, life preserver, radio, etc; be bright in color (Orange!) so rescue crew can see you.  Others: boots with good traction; keep you from overheating, provide good visual field, etc.</p>
<p><strong>EVA suits:</strong> They are a completely different ball of wax. Where LEA suits are only pressurized when something goes wrong, EVA suits are pressurized nominally, outside a vehicle; to somewhere between 4-8 psid; for reference, a basketball is pressurized to 8 psid so a lot of very detailed attention is paid to providing sufficient mobility through the use of hard bearings, convolutes, patterning, etc. An EVA suit arm might have more individual pieces than some basic LEA suits.  EVA suits also have to deal with other things with the space environment - thermal extremes and micrometeorites drive you to having a relatively thick cover garment with multiple layers of insulation and heavy fabric, where an LEA suit would have a very basic single-layer cover layer. By the way, the reason these suits are white is for thermal reasons - you already have to cool occupants as it is.  If we used black suits, it would be much harder to do so.</p>
<p>The fact that you have all these bearings, disconnects between components, hard mobility elements, sometimes composite structures instead of soft fabric (better durability) is one of the reasons why EVA suits end up being much heavier than LEA suits.  Also, EVA suits haven't had to be low mass (doesn't matter in micro-g) so primary design has centered around durability, easy resizing, and mobility.</p>
<p>I should mention that in Gemini and Apollo, we used one suit for both LEA and EVA.  It works in a pinch, but the mobility suffers greatly. I can talk more to this, but it wasn't really your question.</p>
<p>Hopefully this outlines the distinctly different drivers and requirements that result in very different designs.  Most suits that you see today from commercial companies (SpaceX, Final Frontier, Orbital Outfitters, etc) are LEA suits. That's why they look so different from recent suits that NASA has put out (Z-1, etc).</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - Orange is unpressurized launch/entry suit and only pressurized in emergencies; White is pressurized EVA suit used in spacewalks.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> One major thing I neglected to mention was dust. Space suits haven't dealt with dust in 40 years. Current suits aren't design to deal with them.  They pose significant performance, durability, safety and health issues for both Moon and Mars missions.  How to evaluate dust performance isn't even completely understood. In fact, NASA Tournament Labs just released a challenge where <a href="https://ninesights.ninesigma.com/web/nasa-eva-test" target="_blank">you can win $5,000 if you come up with a good way to do this.</a></p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: lots of questions on those &quot;tight-fitting suits&quot;.  Yes, those concepts and prototypes have been around since the 1960s.  They are called MCP or mechanical counter-pressure. They show great promise in theory, and if and when they are ready, they will greatly reduce mass, improve safety, improve mobility, etc.  But they need a lot of work to get there.  Material science is not there, and there are other issues that would need to be hurdled before they are ready for a real flight design.  I would think at least a couple decades.</p>
<p>edit: formatting; specifics; added TL;DR.
edit: obligatory thanks for the gold! :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were special blue space suits for space spies in the 1960's.  The military wanted manned space stations with camera's.  We had tried to send up satellites that would take pictures of russia and return with the film.  The satellite worked fine, except all the pictures were of the tops of clouds.  A human could look and see that it was cloudy and orbit till it clears up, then take the picture.</p>
<p>Here's a link to the nasa article about it.  <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/features/found_mol_spacesuits.html" target="_blank">http://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/features/found_mol_spacesuits.html</a></p>
<p>Also there is a great Nova episode about it.  <a href="http://video.pbs.org/video/980042464/" target="_blank">http://video.pbs.org/video/980042464/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
