		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So lets say you own a company that sells clothes.  You get all the proper paperwork saying that your company is authorized to operate in your home country.  So you are free to sell it's clothes within your own country.  While there might be some minor regulation differences between regions, normally countries take steps to make these &quot;domestic&quot; sales as easy as possible. </p>
<p>But when you want to expand that company into a new country, you'll face a series of problems.  First is that shipping the product itself into the new country will likely incur a kind of tax.  This is known as a tariff or duty, aka an import tax. </p>
<p>The next problem has to do with regulations.  Different countries have different regulations on products.  So my home country might allow the use of red die #1357 but the country I'm trying to expand into might not.  Just different rules for different countries.</p>
<p>A long time ago the people of Europe saw some problems with this system.  European countries tend to be fairly small so companies were always looking to expand into the country next door, and due to the above 2 things this was a giant pain in the ass. </p>
<p>The idea of the &quot;single market&quot; was that they would do away with the import/export taxes.  Second they should take steps so that a product that is legal to sell in Germany is also legal to sell in Spain. This makes it easy for companies to expand their customer base from one country to another.</p>
<p>In a related way, the same idea was applied to the movement of people.  A, Employee is just someone who sells their labor and they should be allowed to sell it in Germany, Spain or the UK. Just like any company can sell it's goods, any person can sell their labor. </p>
<p>So what does leaving this do to the UK.  It means that the citizens of the UK will require special permission (a visa) to live and work in other European countries.  So a Londoner wanting to work in Berlin would face the same challenges as a Londoner who wanted to work in New York. </p>
<p>Next, UK companies would face additional challenges when it comes to selling their products to the rest of Europe.  This would likely mean the prices of those products raise, and sales fall.  This is expected to cause some economic problems for the UK.</p>
<p>Foreign companies would also face higher costs when selling to the UK.  So a product made in Germany would cost more.  This would make it easier for local companies to compete with those foreign companies. So in general there would be a few more jobs, but the costs of almost all imported goods would raise so everyone would be spending a little more of their income on those same goods. In general it is expected that the economic boost from the new jobs will be fairly minor, wheres the damage from increased prices would be fairly large, so a net negative. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basics of the single market have been well explained already but one aspect that hasn't been mentioned yet is renegotiating trade deals.</p>
<p>Trade deals basically determine the conditions under which certain products can be sold in each country. As it stands, the EU has trade deals with lots of different countries and groups of countries that have been negotiated and renegotiated over the years. </p>
<p>When the UK leaves the single market, they will have to create their own trade deals with all of these other nations. This may be problematic for a number of reasons. </p>
<p>Firstly, the UK doesn't actually have many people who specialize in this kind of thing as it was mostly done for them by the EU. </p>
<p>And secondly, these deals are incredibly complicated and have to be done not just for every country, but for every industry too. On top of that, it is technically illegal for an EU member to negotiate trade deals by itself so in theory, the UK won't have any trade deals in place the day it leaves. Although, there will probably be behind the scenes negotiations. </p>
<p>They could use the current EU deals or they could default to the standard WTO deals while the sort out their own but these come with their own problems. </p>
<p>Basically, leaving the common market has made trade for the UK a lot more complicated than it was before. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially the single market allows the (currently) 28 EU Member States to move things between themselves freely. This includes goods, workers, services, and capital all without paying any fees (tariffs). For the UK, leaving will mean that they can charge for their goods going to the EU and vice versa (however this could change depending on the final deal, a Free Trade Agreement will be likely). One of the main reasons the UK want to leave the single market is because it will allow the country to restrict the free movement of people (E.G. require EU migrants to have a work permit before arriving, rather than them being free to work and live in the UK).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The free flow of capital within the EU has made the U.K. a major hub for banking. This sector contributes more than 10% of the GDP, the highest portion among the G7. Thousands of jobs will be lost, nevermind billions of taxable revenue that funds things like schools, healthcare, and security will vanish quite quickly as major banks move to the likes of Amsterdam and Dublin. </p>
<p>With a &quot;hard&quot; Brexit like May is suggesting, it will be years or decades even before the U.K. sees growth again. All because grandma doesn't like brown people. &quot;Leavers&quot; other favorite argument is that the EU gets the decide unilateral manufacturing standards for goods (they had a commercial about the 64 regulations that affect the pillows on your bed). But leaving the customs union means that if you have any hope of exporting products to countries in the EU, you still have to meet these regulations. The British public have been duped, and it will change the country forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The single market means is like having all your friends be your family so you can sleep over whenever you want. The nice thing is you can sleep over at your best friend's house whenever you want, unfortunately Urkel your least favorite friend can sleep over at your place whenever. If you leave the single market, then you can set boundaries when Urkel can sleep over at your place, but now your best friend can request your barbie doll in order for you to sleep there.</p>
<p>The UK just lost the friends as family and will need to establish new rules for sleep overs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
