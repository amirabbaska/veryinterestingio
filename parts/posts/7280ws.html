		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is part of the thirst response.  When your brain senses you're getting dehydrated, it signals you by cutting down on saliva production among other things.  When you consume water, you immediately feel refreshed but the water won't be absorbed for another 20 or 30 minutes.  The brain detects that you've drunk something mainly by the rapid cooling your throat experiences.  Cold drinks intensify this effect, so your brain gives you an instant, exaggerated sense of relief.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is especially true with beer.
Domestic lagers ( bud, Miller, colors, etc) are meant to be drank as cold as possible because the cold masks the flaws or poor quality.
This is why Europeans drink cellar  temperature beer. It's a better/different style with MUCH more flavor. If you were to drink that beer at the same temperature as American beer you would lose all the flavor.
This applies to more than just beer though.
Try it with ice cream sometime.
Let it warm up and soften just slightly and you'll notice WAY more flavor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In places like China, it is usually specified that you want chilled or iced water when ordered because some places will bring hot water. Some people like warm beer, iced coffee, warmed saki, cold soup, and other preferences that they feel tastes better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cold water is cleaner. Water from a cool stream is cleaner than water from a warm puddle. </p>
<p>If you give a horse a choice between a bucket of cold water and a bucket of tepid water, they will choose the cold water. However, they will drink less of the cold water than the tepid water if only given one or the other. The instinct to find cold water is greater than the more comfortable feeling of drinking room temperature water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
