		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called the Magnus effect. A bend shot has a lot of spin. The spinning motion combines with the linear movement. The speed of the inside of the curve is less than the speed on the outside of the curve. So the ball moves into the direction of the spin. </p>
<p><em>Edit: As many have pointed out, the way the spinning ball interfaces with the relatively still air creates the curving movement. This is affected by the speed of the ball, the surface characteristics of the ball, the rotation and direction of spin, and other characteristics of the ball. This can be seen in soccer, basketball, golf, tennis, table tennis, and other round ball sports. Bowling and curling are slightly different because the ball or rock is interfacing with a solid (wood lanes or ice) instead of a fluid (air).</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Why does the almost total lack of spin make a knuckleball move all over erratically? </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take a soccer ball roll it across your blanket, but as you roll it give it a spin. It causes the blanket to twirl around it which, in turn, will cause the direction of the ball to change as it rolls and guide it in a curved direction where there is less resistance from the curdled blanket wrinkles. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is what's happening to the air around a soccer ball when you kick it a certain way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others are explaining it from a physics perspective, I'll add in a sports perspective. Maybe people unfamiliar with the sport will find it interesting.</p>
<p>There are two ways to do it. Well, technically if you hit the ball off center and make it spin it will have a curve. But I'll talk about these big impressive curves.</p>
<p>The simplest one, but difficult to get it accurate, we call &quot;trivela&quot; here in Brazil. Another way to say it, which makes it  easier to understand, is &quot;bola de três dedos&quot;, literally &quot;three <del>fingers</del> toes ball&quot;. So you kick with it the part of your foot where the three smaller toes are located, the outside of your foot. <del>IIRC some people call it &quot;knuckle ball&quot;, presumably because you use your knuckles</del>. </p>
<p>You angle your foot slightly inwards, so you hit the ball with the outside of your foot to spin it. Roberto Carlos' &quot;Banana Shot&quot; against France is a famous example.</p>
<p>You can also do it with the inside of your foot to get a different curve. You use the part of your foot right behind your big toe. This is what you see in free kicks most of the time since it tends to be more accurate. </p>
<p>Some players are just talented at getting this stuff right. There's this Malaysian guy called Faiz Subri who gets amazing curve shots and won a Puskas Award with one of them. You can find videos on YouTube.</p>
<p>Edit: I was wrong about &quot;knuckle ball&quot; in English and corrected &quot;fingers&quot; to &quot;toes&quot;. I also added the bit about Roberto Carlos because it's a good example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>former collegiate soccer player- the Magnus effect on a trivala kick is as difficult as it seems. not only are you (on the fly with 20+ other variables in play) you are also aiming off target by some 5-30ft to ensure a goalworthy shot.
the really impressive part to me is aiming for some point +/- 10ft from the actual goal to achieve a shot on goal. I'm also a pool player, and the English on a pool cue is very similar. set a shot angle, aim off target and let the physics do the work.
at the end of the day, it's another one of those skills where the initial set up is counterintuitive until the execution,  then the wizardry and witchcraft take over. all hail the dark arts</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
