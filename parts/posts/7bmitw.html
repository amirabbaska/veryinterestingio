		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of these have multiple meanings, these are the ones I run across most often. </p>
<p>Beat: a length of time. This is used nonmusically as well, “step on stage, give a beat, then deliver your line”. In music is it usually the pulse that you can clap to. In 4/4 time, for example you get 4 beats in your bar. </p>
<p>Bar: a bar is a logical collection of beats. Bars usually get 3 or 4 beats, but other options are possible. </p>
<p>Step: I usually see this in composition programs. It is common to have a run of notes that are all the same length, for example 8 sixteenth notes. The step is the distance between each note. If you were notating this, you want to step at sixteenth notes. You typically set your step to eighth notes or triplets or quarter notes. </p>
<p>Tempo: how fast the beats happen. Usually measured in “beats per minute” or BPM. </p>
<p>Rhythm: this is the collection of notes in the music. Take all the notes in a phrase, and that is the rhythm. </p>
<p>Tact: I have never heard of this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Masters degree in conducting here: tact in this context likely refers to tactus, which is the term for how many beats are felt in each bar.
For example, in 4/4 there may be 4 beats in the bar, but if the conductor wants the music to flow “faster” they might only conduct 2 big beats instead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A beat can refer to a number of things.  ELi5 version - it's what you clap along or bob your head to in a song.  Look up any video of Dr. Dre mixing in the studio and he is likely bobbing his head to the beat.  Most rock songs, you clap to beats 2 and 4 only, rather than every beat.</p>
<p>Bar or barline is how the beats are organized - into groups of 3, 4, 6, etc., depending on meter - 3/4, 4/4, 6/8, etc.  Each bar has a specific number of beats, depending on the meter, or key signature.</p>
<p>Step or interval is the distance between notes. If you are familiar with piano, the distance between two adjacent (touching) notes is a half-step or semitone.  </p>
<p>Tempo - how fast the beats happen.  Punk is usually really fast.</p>
<p>Takt is interchangeable with beat, according to Merriam-Webster.  I've also seen it used in place of tempo as well as the conductor's baton.</p>
<p>Rhythm - refers to the way in which a melodic line moves against the beat.  Think of the song &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;  Sing it in your head (or aloud if you want).  The first word of the song has a rhythm different from the beat, using a &quot;dotted&quot; rhythm, meaning the first syllable of the word is held 50% longer than the beat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beat - a basic length of time. You can think of it as a 1 base unit.</p>
<p>Bar - a logical collenction of beats, usually 2, 3 or 4, but almost any combination is possible.</p>
<p>Step - the distance in pitch between two notes that are next to each other, such as C and D (Do and Re).</p>
<p>(Thought I might add another one as it's relevant to steps.</p>
<p>Skip - the distance in pitch between two notes that are not next to each other, such as C and E (Do and Mi). )</p>
<p>Tempo - the number of beats in one minute (BPM). This is the most important factor in how fast the piece feels. In the olden days people weren't that pracise and just used italian words like Allegro (fast) or Moderato (moderately).</p>
<p>Tact - This is a very uncommon term. It could potentially have two meanings.</p>
<p>1 Archaically it used to be the word for the musical bar. It still is in use in many other languages.</p>
<p>2 It is the feel of the beat. You may sometimes notice musical modulation, very popular in jazz or swing, where the notes &quot;feel&quot; right, but arguably, mathematically the beat may shift in length to what &quot;feels&quot; right/better.</p>
<p>Rhythm - the combination of different lengths of the beat (beats) put together, often with distinguishable start and end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
