		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pure water doesn’t. It’s the impurities dissolved in tap water that make it conductive, meaning it can create paths for electricity that bypass the intended pathways. This can damage IC’s and other sensitive components. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>water likes to dissolve minerals, salts and oxygen into it which can make it conductive enough to damage delicate components and mildly corrosive if it sits against metallic components.</p>
<p>Instant damage is caused when conductive water creates a short circuit somewhere in the device that destroys components because of a voltage or current spike.  Long term damage is caused when water sits against metallic parts and rusts them to the point of breaking (like broken wires or circuit board traces or “legs” on board mounted components) or physically fouling (like a corroded contact in a switch that no longer conducts electricity properly)
Also modern electronics are usually packed so tightly into a device that water’s surface tension makes it hard to remove from all the crevices and tight spots which means it has more time to do damage before you can get the device dried out.</p>
<p>To answer your question about submerging electronics in mineral oil: oils are typically made of nonpolar molecules so they don’t dissolve harmful compounds as easily as water, which means it’s hard to make oil conductive, which means it won’t cause instant short circuits in electronics.
Also, oil doesn’t dissolve oxygen as readily as water so it does not cause corrosion on metallic components after long term exposure.  It can actually be formulated to protect components from corrosion.
Interesting side-note, mineral oil is such a good insulator that some high-voltage transformers on power distribution lines are filled with it to prevent arcing and to help disperse heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to clean the flux off of printed circuit boards in an industrial dishwasher hooked up to city water with a &quot;soap&quot; called a Saponifier.  The last cycle was a rinse cycle with city water.</p>
<p>We had to make sure that we used parts that were rated for aqueous cleaning.  For example we hand mounted the switches after cleaning.  </p>
<p>This was 25 years ago most were takin out of service about 3 years ago when we did a system upgrade.  A few of them are still in service.  </p>
<p>Some notes the parts were heat dried in the dishwasher and the water temperature was set to 165 F.  Like others said for energized circuits you have to worry about the damage done by the conductive liquids shorting out parts plus what ever other stuff is in the liquid that remains conductive and thickens (more conductive) as the water evaporates, e.g. sugar in coffee. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electronics are based around moving electricity down controlled paths.</p>
<p>Water shorts the paths together, so you get voltage and amperage to components in ways they aren't designed for. For instance a CPU expecting 5v and getting 12v isn't going to have a good time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
