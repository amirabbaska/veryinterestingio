		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you super freeze an egg so much it can't move or do anything. </p>
<p>But then you notice this egg, in its frozen state, periodically flips itself upside down every 5 seconds, as if by magic.</p>
<p>Much like the egg being white, or round, its flipping up and down is a fundamental part of its existence. AS OPPOSED to, normally, such an act requiring a push (or force) from an outside source.</p>
<p>Now, say you have a doodad that does something 5 seconds after you flip a switch. How does the doodad know when that 5 seconds are up? </p>
<p>The ways we solve that problem now are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stored energy. Think of turning an hourglass turned upside down.</li>
<li>Counters. Cpu or crystal does a thing every x amount of seconds, and keeps track. </li>
<li>Decay. Won't get into that, but it requires energy</li>
</ol>
<p>They all require force/energy, grant small amount, but still there.</p>
<p>Now imagine that the top half off the egg is a piece of metal, and when it's facing down, it completes a circuit. When the circuit is complete, you know your 5 seconds is up. You get this for free instead of using energy (or almost free, MUCH less energy than the other methods).</p>
<p>Imagine you had to keep track of billions things with billions of eggs. This amount of energy can add up, especially if it's in a small space. </p>
<p>All the neat things you can do with billions of counters for much cheaper energy than we have now, is important to computers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is new to me, but I can give you some background on why it is interesting. The laws of physics have a few symmetries in them - for example rotation, spatial translation, and time translation. This means if I put you in the middle of a vacuum, any experiment you did would give repeatable results even if you turned around, or if you moved forward by a meter, or if you waited an hour (respectively).</p>
<p>Now, if you aren't surrounded by a vacuum we might be able to break one of these symmetries. For instance, if there was a big ferromagnet next to you you could use a compass and tell what way you are facing. And if you were standing on a big crystal, then moving over by half a unit cell would look different from moving over by a full unit cell.</p>
<p>You could also imagine sitting next to a pendulum, which would break the time symmetry. That works for a while, but eventually the pendulum stops. Before I read the paper you linked to, I would have told you that you can't build oscillator that goes on forever, because it breaks the laws of thermodynamics (a perpetual motion machine). Any machine that breaks time translation symmetry eventually should peter out.</p>
<p>What the authors seem to be claiming is that you can make a system that keeps oscillating forever. It is sort of a perpetual motion machine (although one that only breaks even, it won't generate energy for you). That is surprising, and I need to look at the paper more carefully to figure out how it works. </p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!</p>
<p><strong>Edit2:</strong> Sorry for not replying below - haven't been able to reddit for a bit. I think the original <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.160401" target="_blank">theory paper</a> where this idea was proposed is more useful for understanding what is going on than the experimental paper. It isn't written at an ELI5 level, but the theory paper does help explain how you can create a &quot;time crystal&quot; with a simple thought experiment. The experimental paper is a little more confusing, because they are introducing a time-varying potential which makes it harder to see why the time crystal itself is the source of the measured correlations. A few questions I see coming up that I can add something to:</p>
<p>(1) Is this a perpetual motion machine? Well, it sounds very similar to a perpetual energy machine of the third kind, the kind that oscillates forever. Normally the second law requires that those should dissipate energy and slow down until they enter a time independent ground state (or, if the temperature is high enough that you aren't stuck in the ground state, the system will eventually fluctuate randomly in different excited states without long term correlations in time). But this system is in its ground state, so it can't dissipate any more energy. So we aren't violating thermodynamics, it is just that nobody thought a ground state would behave this way.</p>
<p>(2) Aren't there other examples of perpetual motion machines of the first kind? In other words, can we make a frictionless oscillator? We can come very, very close. u/pocketMAD provides some examples, like a spinning sphere in a vacuum. This doesn't work though. If the sphere is perfectly symmetric, then nothing is oscillating. When you look at the sphere, you can tell it is moving but there is no way to keep track of where in the cycle it is. If we make the sphere slightly asymmetric, we can measure an oscillation but the sphere also starts emitting gravity waves that dissipate the energy. It may sound nitpicky, but it is basically the difference between &quot;so small it might as well be zero&quot; compared to actually being zero.</p>
<p>(3) What about simple quantum systems like the hydrogen molecule that u/Kandiru mentions? Alternatively, you could consider the orbital spin of an electron around an atom or superconducting electrons in a loop (this last example is even brought up in the theory paper). The problem is all of these states might have motion but they are still time independent. I can't wait &quot;10 cycles&quot; and measure the hydrogen molecule to be more stretched or less stretched if it is sitting in the ground state. In quantum mechanics, you can have constant motion (electrons in a hydrogen atom never lose their kinetic energy) but that doesn't mean there is anything you can measure that changes with time. So a time crystal is different from those example. You should be able to wait a fixed time and see it has moved to a specific state.</p>
<p>(4) Does cooling matter, as u/amiintoodeep suggests? No, we should be able to set up a time crystal as a closed system once we cool it down enough to lock it in the ground state. In other words, it shouldn't be dissipating or gaining any energy if it really is in the ground state. As an aside, the fact that we need to cool the time crystal to make it work isn't surprising. Spontaneous symmetry breaking always has a critical temperature. Heat a regular crystal and it melts, removing the periodic structure. Heat a ferromagnet and you get a paramagnet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Time crystals are a series of atoms (Ytterbium atoms, specifically) arranged in a circle. These atoms are held in place by a magnetic field, and are kept at very cold temperatures to make sure nothing interferes with them. The atoms are all negatively charged, meaning they all have one extra electron than they normally would like to have.</p>
<p>To fully understand time crystals, you must know a bit about electrons. Electrons have a property called &quot;spin&quot;. Spin just describes how an electron likes to orbit around the nucleus of an atom. A fundamental understanding would be thinking about this like how earth orbits the sun, but also rotates on it's axis at the same time. So, in the way the earth orbits the sun so do electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom. The way that they &quot;rotate&quot; on their axis is their spin. There are two types of spin: up and down. </p>
<p>**(This is of course not exactly how spin works, but is good for a fundamental understanding)</p>
<p>Now, remember that we have a circle of atoms in a nice, stable environment, all given an extra electron. A laser is then used to make the extra electron of each atom spin either up or down. The researchers &quot;spun&quot; the atoms in alternating order, with the idea that this would create a never-ending cycle of spin oscillations. One atom would cause the next to change direction of it's spin, and so on and so on forever. </p>
<p>What was discovered was that the rate of spin oscillation (flipping from up to down) took twice as long as expected. This is considered the proof that the crystal was affected by time.</p>
<p>Practical benefits to humanity are pretty much for computing. We can use these up/down spins instead of transistors (on/ off electrical charges) in modern microprocessors. Could be a pretty significant boost to performance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>• What are time-crystals?
They are not what you're thinking -- a diamond-like crystal shaped like a clock -- but in this case it is a string of ions that were placed in a ring-shape and then super-cooled to the point where there was no perpetual movement from energy. </p>
<pre><code> In a normal crystal in it's normal state (when atoms are constantly in motion and influencing each other), you can look at it's structure and you will see a symmetrical, repeating pattern from any angle. When this same crystal is brought to its "ground-state", or state in which there is no movement or energy, the structure will naturally become asymmetrical. It was only able to maintain a symmetrical structure because it had energy from the movement of its atoms. 

 The difference between an ordinary crystal and a time-crystal is that when an ordinary crystal is brought to it's ground state, its atomic structure becomes asymmetrical, but when a time-crystal is brought to its ground-state, its atomic structure stays symmetrical (from the atoms moving) even though there is absolutely no energy present. </code></pre>
<p>The atoms still move over a repeating period of <strong>time</strong> rather than a repeating period of <strong>space</strong>. </p>
<p>Put even more simply, the atoms of a time-crystal are influenced (moved) by time, the atoms of an ordinary crystal are influenced (moved) by physical energy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
