		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top answer is a great ELI5, but I'll see if I can go into more details while keeping it simple. </p>
<p>So the most common form of touchscreens these days is &quot;capacitive&quot; touchscreens. What does that mean? That they use capacitors! Now capacitors are this weird thing where you can store electricity in two things that are <em>close but not touching</em>. </p>
<p>The classical example is two metal plates separated by air. It turns out that the electric field between them can store energy, and the closer they are together, the more energy they store. </p>
<p>The &quot;plates&quot; don't have to be metal, though, they can be anything conductive. Like skin!</p>
<p>So what your phone has is a bunch of half-capacitors. It has only one of the two conductive plates, and those plates are hidden behind the screen. The magic comes when you use your finger to be the <em>other half</em> of the capacitor!</p>
<p>So remember how I said that the closer the plates are to each other, the more energy they store? Your phone is constantly charging/discharging its plates (it has a big grid of them), and figuring out which take more energy to charge. Because the ones that take more energy have something conductive near them (your finger)!</p>
<p>As I said earlier, there's no contact between the two plates, so you don't have to be touching your phone for it to sense your finger. It's just calibrated at the factory so that you're <em>most likely</em> touching it when it notices a &quot;tap&quot;. </p>
<p>Likewise, other conductive things will work. Sausages are a good example, but metal coins will work too (careful about scratching your screen, though). </p>
<p>They really are a pretty cool piece of technology, I hope this explanation helped. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several different types of touchscreens. The two that you're probably most familiar with are resistive and capacitive.</p>
<p>Resistive touchscreens, which are used in Nintendo's products and pre-iPhone PDAs and smartphones have flexible plastic screens. When you push on the screen, you squeeze multiple layers together and this completes an electric circuit.</p>
<p>Most modern smartphones use capacitive touchscreens. These touchscreens are made of glass. When you touch the screen with your hand, you distort the electric field in the screen and it can measure where that change took place. Insulators, like plastic or most fibers, won't distort the field so the screen won't recognize them. &quot;Smartphone gloves&quot; have metal fibers woven into the fingertips to make the screen notice them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever touched your finger to a stereo plug?</p>
<p>It gives a little hum when it is in contact with your skin, that you don't get when you touch it to a table, for example.</p>
<p>The electrical <strong>Capacitance</strong> of a human body is very particular.</p>
<p>Imagine that you have a Battleship board, with these little plugs sticking out, instead of the pegs.</p>
<p>Each is connected to a stereo labelled with the coordinates of the plug. When someone touches it, you can tell if they're using their body, based on whether it hums.<br />
You can tell where they're touching it, based on which stereo makes the hum.</p>
<p>This is essentially how &quot;Capacitive&quot; touch phones work, except that you can't see the plugs, and there are a lot more of them, than there are on our Battleship board.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>TL;DW: When electricity flows through a wire, it creates an electric field around it. When your finger comes close to the wire, some of that charge transfers to your finger and causes the voltage in the wire to decrease. Smartphone screens have a grid made of wires, and when you touch the screen, you phone can figure out the coordinated of where you tapped by looking at which horizontal wire had a voltage drop and which vertical wire had a voltage drop</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reading through a lot of these comments are wrong so I just want to clear things up. There are no electrical contacts at all and it has nothing to do with electrical signals from your muscles. </p>
<p>Capacitive touch is simply a flat piece of metal. By rapidly charging and discharging this plate and measuring the charge/ac current you can determine the capacitance. This single plate does not have much capacitance by itself. When you bring a finger close to this plate you increase the capacitance of the plate by creating an electro static field between your finger and the plate. </p>
<p>A touch screen has rows and columbs of long thin plates. When you bring your finger to the screen you are increasing the capacitance of 2 seperate plates a row and a columb. But you are also increasing the capacitance of neaboring plates. Your phone may only have 40 rows and 30 columbs but it can determine where your finger is between plates. So say your finger is halfway between row 25 and 26 and directly on column 16. Your phone would measure 3 plates having a significantly higher capacitance compared to the other 67.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
