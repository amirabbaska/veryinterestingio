			<a href="/posts/8z57ep" onclick="return false">I heard that detergents, soaps, and surfactants have a polar end and a non-polar end, and are thus able to dissolve grease. But so do fatty acids; the carboxyl end (the acid part) is polar, and the long hydrocarbon tail is non-polar. So why don't fatty acids behave like soap? What's the difference?</a>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have heard correctly. Let me try to explain the differences. </p>
<p>'Fats' as we think of them (oils or tallow or some other such foody thing) are not just fatty acids, but are mostly fatty acids with the polar end stuck on to a somewhat non-polar molecule called glycerin. Usually three fatty acids will be stuck to one glycerin, making a triglyceride. This means that the fatty acids effectively stop having a 'polar' part, as the end of the fatty acid is now a somewhat non-polar glycerin with two other very non-polar fatty acid back ones sticking off of it. </p>
<p>So the way soap works is by forming balls called micelles with polar part touching the water and the non-polar stuff touching the inside. All the grease can go on the inside of those balls, and that's how soap gets so much nonpolar stuff into water - by filling up these balls.</p>
<p>Because triglycerides (read: fats) effectively lose the polar end, and because they have a bad packing geometry (which I won't get into), they can't form these fat-soaking micelles and so they sort of just clump together.</p>
<p>As for your other question: surfactant is a big general word that basically means anything that aggregates at a surface. If you get technical, micelle formation falls into this category. Any ways, it's usually applied to things like fatty acids, which can form micelles and take up fats just like soap. And detergent is somewhat less general, usually applied to water-based molecules that form micelles, just like fatty acids. So to answer your question, fatty acids are just a single type of detergent, which is a type of surfactant. </p>
<p>And to clarify: fatty acids are not necessarily the best type of detergent, but they should work as a kind of crappy soap as long as they're not stuck to glycerin!</p>
<p>Hope that helps clarify.</p>
<p>TLDR: Fatty acids are detergents. Fats are usually mostly triglycerides. Triglycerides are not detergents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This actually is quite a cool topic, your intuition of soap and fatty acids being similar is completely valid, it's because they are!</p>
<p>To understand how similar they are I think it's worthy to mention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saponification" target="_blank">how soap is produced</a>. Soaps are produced by reacting fatty acids with a strong base, Sodium and <del>Kalium</del> <em>Potassium</em> Hydroxide are frequently used, which will steal a H^+ off of the COOH end of the fatty acid. This &quot;Locks&quot; the fatty acid in an ion state, which makes it way more effective as a partially polar partially apolar molecule, but also technically a <a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwildearthapothecary.files.wordpress.com%2F2014%2F09%2Fchemistry-of-soap-goodness.png&amp;f=1" target="_blank">salt</a>!  Another important thing to realize is that part of the reason soap is as stable as it is is due to the fact that the negative charge is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxylate" target="_blank">delocalized, as it is in all Carboxylates</a>.</p>
<p>As to the difference between surfactants and soaps let's look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant" target="_blank">definition of surfactans</a>. Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension. Soaps are an example of surfactants as they lower the surface tension (in water), though not all surfactants are soaps per say. It's relatively easy to understand why soaps allow for the lowering of surface tension. For one, due to its polarity it can properly mix and thus get in between different water molecules, and lower the surface tension, <a href="https://youtu.be/HNnFqve-Wgk?t=35s" target="_blank">an example of which can be seen in this video</a>
This lowering of surface tension is also the reason you need soap to make bubbles! You may at times have seen bubbles of water appear for brief moments in puddles while it's raining, but they never stick around for long. Due to the <a href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/bubbles/soap.html" target="_blank">high surface tension the internal pressure simply isn't high enough</a> and therefore a bubble without soap collapses inward!</p>
<p>As a bonus soap fact: Back in High School whenever I asked what Bases tasted like (as acids had such a pronounced taste) I was always told they tasted 'soapy', which is only half the story. The reasons bases taste soapy is because it's converting the fat in your mouth INTO soap! I personally love how bases have such an indirect way of taste!</p>
<p>Soap is exciting!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fatty acids, and carboxylic acids in general, are weak acid. In a water solution of fatty acids, less than 1 out of 1000 of the fatty acid molecules are ionised. The ionised form is polar, the unionised form isn't. (Depending on the length of its chain, the fatty acid might not even dissolve in water, so no ionisation at all).</p>
<p>Traditional soaps are sodium salts of these same fatty acids. Suffice it to say, the sodium ion forces the fatty acid molecules to ionise, which greatly increases the number of polar molecules that work as a surfactant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
