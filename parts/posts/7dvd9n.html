		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When cold, your body reduces blood flow to extremities such as the fingers to conserve heat. This makes the nerves in the fingers less responsive, thus the numb feeling you get as well as the difficulty in making them move with the same agility as when warm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a fluid in the joints known as synovial fluid that becomes more viscous (thicker) at lower temperatures. This thickness of the fluid contributes to the rigidity experienced when your hands are cold. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a musician (specifically a strings player) cold hands are literally the devil. You get less blood flow, and your muscles become a lot less efficient. Your nerves (which are numb, because cold) refuse to send signals fast enough to do things that require a lot of dexterity (AKA texting or playing the bass)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are position or “angle” sensors in your joints. That’s how you know roughly where your hands are when your eyes are closed. Your brain depends on the feedback from those sensors to control your muscles. When cold, those sensors send delayed signals. The result is much smaller movements of your muscles. The effect is similar to what happens when you use a “speech jammer” app.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
