		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most important effect in this is not necessarily that different ethnicities create <em>better</em> offspring, but that the genetic defects that permeate individual populations are far less likely to be present in both parents if they are from different populations. It means that children with mixed ethnicities are less likely to express those defects because they have received a &quot;healthy&quot; chromosome from one of their parents. They can still pass on the defective one to their children however and it takes a few child generations for the defect to become less and less prevalent </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The genetic advantage distinction is different between individuals and populations. A single child of parents of wide genetic background may or may not benefit, it's kind of a crap shoot about what you're going to get in a one-off birth. </p>
<p>A POPULATION that incorporates a wider genetic background is almost certainly stronger, though, simply because there are fewer individuals of one genetic background. A situation change that could wipe out that specific genetic background cannot as easily wipe out the entire population due to the diversity.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was at one time.  Diversity was good because you couldn't predict the future.  You couldn't tell what would make people better suited to live tomorrow.  Maybe something would come by that would favor a trait that no one in your group has, and that could be devastating for the group.</p>
<p>So you diversify so that you have a large variety of people.  Selective pressure then comes by, and kills the less fit people (and/or lets the more fit people breed more) and then those once-alternative genes become mainstream.  And the process repeats.  The more diverse you are, the better chance <em>someone</em> or some subgroup will be sufficiently equipped to handle it.</p>
<p>In a world without significant selection pressure, arguing that genetic diversity is unequivocally good may not automatically be true.  You certainly want to have a diverse enough population group that recessive genes don't get paired up often, (avoid family up to first or second cousins) but beyond that it may not make much of a difference.  Human kind has descended from bottle-necked populations before.  At plenty of times in our history the number of humans alive has been under a million.  Half the countries in the world, if isolated, would still have a far richer gene pool to mix around than in many times in our species' history.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see studies on the health, fitness, intelligence, etc of 'muts'.  Of people that are the children of two people from very separate population groups.  Say, a father that's been Germanic for 8 generations and a woman whose been Chinese for the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly about avoiding &quot;bad&quot; things.  Women have 2 X chromosomes, men an X and a Y.  When they have a child the child gets one chromosome from each parent.  A girl gets an X from dad and an X from mom, a boy gets a Y from dad and an X from mom.</p>
<p>Let's posit a theory that Dad has a bad X.  If they have a boy, no problem because it'll have Dad's good Y and a good X from mom.  If they have a girl it'll get a bad X from dad but have a backup copy in mom's X.  So the little girl has one bad X and one good X.</p>
<p>Now in a population with a limited number of people, that bad X is going to be present in lots of people, boys and girls, but it's mostly OK because they have another chromosome as a backup. </p>
<p>Except for one day, bad X Billy and bad X Betty have a baby.  It's a girl so she gets Billy's bad X, and through the luck of the draw also gets Bettys bad X.  So now baby Betsy has 2 bad X chromosomes and you see defects.</p>
<p>Normally those bad chromosomes have to be bad in the same kind of way in order for there to be a high chance of defects.  That can happen in a small population, but different tribes are likely to have bad chromosomes that are bad in different ways.  So the body is able to cobble together enough human code to make 1 good human.  2 bad copies are fine as long as they are differently bad, 2 of the same bad copy means you have no copy of the good code and everything gets fucked up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to reducing negative homogeneous genes (like /u/searingsky explains);</p>
<p>A more genetically diverse population can withstand a wider range of changes to its environment. You need both 'good' and 'bad' genes in the gene-pool because you don't know what the next crisis is going to bring. </p>
<p>If a certain food-source suddenly becomes available, it's genetically advantageous to have individuals that can process that food source (Lactose Tolerance and certain Food Allergies). </p>
<p>If a certain blood-parasite becomes rampant, it's genetically advantageous to have blood that can't carry the pathogen (Sickle-cell Anemia) </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
