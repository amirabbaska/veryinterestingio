		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/simkhovich mentioned a good example of dusty plasmas where solids, gases, and plasmas coexist but there's an important distinction when you're dealing with plasmas: most plasmas aren't at thermal equilibrium. At its triple point, water is a solid, liquid, and gas at the same temperature and pressure. In a plasma, the neutral gas molecules, ions, and electrons are usually all at different temperatures, and in a dusty plasma the dust particles are again at a different temperature. Plasma is interesting because while it is certainly different enough to be considered a fourth state of matter, the transition to the plasma state is not totally analogous to the process of freezing, melting, boiling, etc., so plasma rarely exists in equilibrium with other states of matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order to have a triple-point you need a phase transition first. Water evaporates into steam, ice melts into water etc. The transition from one phase into the other is sharp and there is no phase in between.</p>
<p>On the other hand the transition from gas to plasma is continuous (characterized by the degree of ionization). There is no sharp edge that would have gas on one side and plasma on the other. Therefore you can't have the triple-point.</p>
<p>Note: For high enough pressures, the phase transition is not sharp from gas to liquid either. The point in phase diagram where the phase transition no longer occurs is called critical point. Interestingly it is possible to go &quot;around&quot; that point and continuously change gas to liquid (or vice versa) without any phase transition happening in between. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A plasma is a hot ionized gas consisting of approximately equal numbers of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons. The characteristics of plasmas are significantly different from those of ordinary neutral gases so that plasmas are considered a distinct &quot;fourth state of matter.&quot;</p>
<p>Copied from online, I found the following on page 62 of the Naval Research Laboratory Plasma Formulary NRL/PU/6790--11-551, Revised 2011: &quot;Complex (dusty) plasmas (CDPs) may be regarded as a new and unusual state of matter. CDPs contain charged microparticles (dust grains) in addition to electrons, ions, and neutral gas. Electrostatic coupling between the grains can vary over a wide range, so that the states of CDPs can range from weakly coupled (gaseous) to crystalline. CDPs can be investigated at the kinetic level (individual particles are easily visualized and relevant time scales are accessible). CDPs are of interest as a non-Hamiltonian system of interacting particles as a means to study generic fundamental physics of self-organization, pattern formation, phase transitions, and scaling. Their discovery has therefore opened new ways of precision investigation in many-particle physics.&quot; Crystallinity normally refers to the degree of structural order in a solid. Typical CDP experimental dust temperatures appear to be ~3 x 10^-2 - 10^2 eV. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also realistically for most fluids you reach the critical point long before having enough thermal energy for a plasma. Look at the phase diagram for CO2 for example and you note that there is a point beyond which you can't really distinguish between gas and liquid anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
