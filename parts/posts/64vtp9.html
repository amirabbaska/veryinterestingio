		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This comment is in response to those who say &quot;JUST FIX EVERYTHING&quot;. </p>
<p>Kinda just pasting my comment from another thread lower down. Spent too much time typing this. </p>
<p>It's all in the severity of the issues and for the higher ups to perceive said issues as &quot;bad enough&quot;. Producers don't usually understand the severity of things unless they're extremely obvious. Thankfully, even though I'm only a QA Lead, I'm in a position where I can actually voice my concerns for the bugs on the more minor-but-annoying side. We call this kind of stuff &quot;User Pain&quot;. As in, a typo isn't that bad or annoying. No one would just drop the game and stop playing, send us hate mail, etc, because of a typo. But a looping sound bug, although not game-breaking, could be annoying as hell for players.</p>
<p>Every single game ever released (save for maybe, Pong) has had bugs. It's just some are a lot worse than others. </p>
<p>Hypothetical Situation Time: Let's say it's the last day of work on your game before it's &quot;Too Late&quot;. </p>
<p>You find a typo in a side mission. Do you delay the game a month or two for that? That means paying whoever is left on the project for another month AS WELL as the PR shitstorm for the pushback and blablabla. </p>
<p>That's a lot of time and money. But I used a small issue on purpose. Another small issue that no one gives a shit about would be like assets clipping into each other on a small scale. Could happen throughout the whole game, as long as it's not jarringly obvious it's really not that bad. I'm talking about stuff like you look at the table and it clearly combines into the floor instead of being on-top of it. Stuff like that.</p>
<p>Next is a medium tier. </p>
<p>So let's say you have the same amount of time left before it's &quot;Too Late&quot;, except instead of a Typo, it's... </p>
<p>When you're on the last level, if you happen to close the game while in the middle of a cutscene, when you reboot your game, the cutscene is skipped and you can't watch it again. Kinda sucks. Kinda. This is worse than a typo, but still, it's very specific (For this example, let's just say it ONLY happens on the final level, during that specific cutscene). Delay the game? Probably not. This is something that can go in the Day 1 Patch or Day 15/30 or whatever. </p>
<p>Last example. Last day before &quot;Too Late&quot;. You're on the last level about to beat the game and 100% of the time, when killing the final boss, the game crashes. So you do it again just to be sure and yes, 100% of the time, no matter what, the game crashes. This is out of the ordinary since QA would've caught it (or people are about to get fired), but for the sake of the story let's just say they didn't. This is delay-worthy. </p>
<p>Another major must-fix would be legal issues, but those do not cause User Pain (generally), but producers are 100% going to fix. </p>
<p><strong>Extra Tidbit:</strong> Bugs usually have classifications such a S-Bug, A, B, C-Class. S is must fix. C is Typos, clipping art, stuff like that. User Pain is something we started a few years ago, which is a 2nd classification we use in tandem. </p>
<p>So we could say &quot;The game has 0 S-Bugs! We're pretty good to go...But it has 3000 C-Class still.&quot; The producers don't exactly care about the C-Class. But now that we've opened them up to hearing what User Pain actually means, we have formulas for bug types like Audio Looping and stuff like that where we say (paraphrasing) &quot;Yeah, but this B-Class bug has 90/100 User Pain. Literally everyone who buys the game is going to hear it&quot; and they can rethink their position on the bug. </p>
<p>Games nowadays and always, to be honest, but now more than ever, tend to be super complicated in so many aspects that it's impossible to even <em>FIND</em> all the issues, let alone fix them. </p>
<p>Think of this: A game is tested by a team of 40 testers for 40 hours a week (lol) for let's say 2ish years. </p>
<p>If it's a big game (AAA, million copies sold, etc), within the first 2 hours that it has been released, it has been played by the public for more hours than it was tested throughout it's whole testing cycle. There are things that you guys do that we didn't think of. There are so many possibilities. It's mind blowing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Towards the end of a development cycle, caution is the name of the game.</p>
<p>Video games are really complex (and often somewhat haphazardly put together), so <em>any</em> change risks breaking something. If you're two weeks away from launch, the last thing you want to do is break stuff, so you play it safe, you don't make <em>any</em> change unless you are absolutely certain that it is (1) safe, and (2) necessary. So assets that turned out to be unused? Eh, leave them in, they do no harm that way.</p>
<p>This is also why games sometimes ship with entire levels removed, or with very obvious bugs left in. You're near the launch date, and yes, you know this is a bug, and yes, you're 90% sure fixing it is safe and will break nothing else. But... what if it does? You don't have time to re-test everything else, so you have to ask whether leaving in a known bug is better than fixing it and risking breaking something much more important <em>that you won't even have time to discover before release</em>. Or you found a single tricky bug in this map and you just don't have time to fix it so.... just disable that map entirely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big reason to not delete content you aren't using is to avoid breaking your game. A lot of games use assets in multiple places, and as the game gets bigger the interconnection can get very complicated. If you aren't completely certain taking something out won't effect something else, it makes sense to just leave it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can answer this in the context of Age of Empires by Ensemble Studios between version 1 (AoE original) to version 2 (AoK/C) alpha, beta, release, and AoE2HD.</p>
<p>AoE (version 1) was heavily polished with little to no leftover assets within the data or code structure. This cannot be said the same about AoK (version 2). This really came down to how rushed AoK was compared to AoE. Given the day and age of the 2 games, there wasn't really a proper way to clean up assets or remove them. Nothing was brought to 'modern' standards when the format got upgraded from AoE1 to AoE2. Storage space was no longer a big concern, yet the spaghetti ('stuff everywhere') conventions were kept.</p>
<p>The amount of AoE2 alpha and beta assets left in is perhaps 1/6th of the entire dataset. Much of them only show up in a re-polish for AoC (the expansion), or are little easter eggs for us dataminers to find. Some don't have proper animations, bad transparent backgrounds, or come from the immediate AoE1 dataset just for testing. </p>
<p>SkyBox labs (AoE2HD devs) have done a decent job trudging through the original source code. Including working with reversed-engineered tools to the point where the entire asset blob database (where assets are actually stored) has been exploded (extracted) and used on the fly. Some of the graphics (mostly background images) have finally been updated to modern conventions, yet the engine palette is still low-res color, because all sprite assets use a single palette<em>. </em>There's multiple palettes for game objects, each share their own global palette, but really there's only 1 important one.</p>
<p>Also there's a engine code fork, recoding of the original, that Lucas Arts got back in the day, a little more polished than what AoE2 (AoK/C) is capable of. But the spaghetti conventions still reside within.</p>
<p>tl;dr Don't look into the asset database of AoE, there's a generational programming gap of etiquettes on display.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There might be a forgotten piece of code somewhere in your game that calls the unused content. If you remove it and it does that your entire game will crash. So to remove unused stuff you need to go through your entire game and check to make sure nothing calls the unused thing before you can remove it. Or you can leave it in. Way easier and way safer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
