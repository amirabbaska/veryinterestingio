		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For certain definitions of bee.</p>
<p>Honey bees <em>apis mellifera</em> that are managed by man are not declining. Despite what the <a href="https://beeinformed.org/2018/03/31/the-2017-2018-colony-loss-management-survey-now-live/" target="_blank">annual loss survey says</a>: &quot; we lose 40+% every year&quot; beekeepers can double or more the number of hives they have every year also. No one is recording the gains like the losses.  The finally tally is an increase in managed hives every year. Managed hives do have problems, varroa mites which carry dozens of viruses being the primary one. As beekeepers we do not want 40% losses every hive lost takes money out of our pockets so we would really like solutions but our bees are not in danger of dying. </p>
<p>Prior to varroa they were also hit with some other diseases like tracheal mites and small hive beetles that caused many bee keepers to fold. Long term the famous <a href="http://scientificbeekeeping.com/scibeeimages/millions-of-hives-graph.png" target="_blank">decline in millions of hives since WWII</a> is more due to changes in practices than deaths of bees however. Prior to WWII every farmer would have a  few hives. After WWII migratory beekeeping came into being and rather than farmers maintaining hives beekeepers would bring in bees from across the country for the bloom period then relocate them to other crops for the next bloom. This meant that far fewer hives were needed in total across the country.</p>
<p>Finally there has been a massive surge in the number of new hobbyist beekeepers. 15 years ago Florida had around 1000 registered beekeepers, and most of those were large commercial operations. That number had been relatively steady for decades. Today there are nearly 5000 registered beekeepers (and many more not registered) and that number keeps going up. Most those hobbyists only maintain a handful of hives but they are everywhere not just in rural areas.</p>
<p>Non-managed <em>apis mellifera</em> the feral hives in the Americas and the natural wild ones in the Old World took a massive hit (late 80s-90s in the U.S.) due to the influx of varroa and their diseases. <a href="https://www.apidologie.org/articles/apido/abs/2007/01/m6063/m6063.html" target="_blank">Studies in the few areas</a> where we had numbers show they have come back to pre-varroa numbers. The problem is they came back with significantly less genetic diversity than before the fall. This sets them up for a potential epidemic of some other disease or pest. This is particularity acute in the Americas since the bee population is not natural and was genetically bottlenecked by being imported from the Old World.</p>
<p>Bees however encompasses a larger term than honey bees. In the United States alone there are some <a href="https://bugguide.net/node/view/475348" target="_blank">4000 species of bees</a>. These include bumble bees, carpenter bees, leaf cutter bees, orchard mason bees and many more you have likely never heard of.  Most of these are regional and solitary. They are losing habitat, they are negatively effected by pesticides and monoculture  farming (which only blooms for a brief window and won't sustain a population year round). Many of them are in serious trouble. Documenting that is hard. We know the numbers have declined and continue to do so we just don't have good pre-decline and present population counts to know exactly how much. Its also a hard problem to fix. Solitary bees need wild habitat to thrive. Our cities, suburban lawns and monoculture farms are not the places they thrive and <a href="http://www.xerces.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PollinatorsNaturalAreas_June2014_web.pdf" target="_blank">we continue to expand those into the wild spaces</a>.</p>
<p>Bees are also not the only problem The problem is greater to losses in pollinator: butterflies, bats, and other animals pollinate crops and natural plants and are all in need of protection. Which is why the Federal government has <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pollinator-protection/pollinator-protection-strategic-plan" target="_blank">gotten involved</a>.</p>
