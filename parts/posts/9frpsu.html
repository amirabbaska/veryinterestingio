		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a therapist in a neuro clinic. It depends on the involvement of their spinal cord injury or whatever condition has left them paralyzed. You can still have partial motor innervation or none at all depending the kind of injury/pathology. Tetra and paraplegic people have difficulties with regulation of body temperature for number of reasons but generally speaking they don’t sweat or have goosebumps. </p>
<p>Most people still have some sort of autonomic warnings of when there “paralyzed” involved body is in trouble from an injury, infection, or a danger perceived scenario, its called autonomic dysreflexia. They develop a large change in blood pressure, feel sick, can develop uncontrolled muscle spasms. </p>
<p>Edit: Grammarz and specifying I’m a physical therapist assistant, I help modify and execute plan of cares to rehabilitate spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injuries, and other populations like orthopedics and amputees!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been paralyzed from the chest down for 20 years. I was camping the other night and it was very warm and humid. I had blankets on my lower body and a fan blowing on my face/arms, and fell asleep, I woke up not feeling cold, but shivering terribly like I was cold (or had a fever). I took the blankets off and turned the fan off and equalized and was fine. If it rains and gets my pants wet, my face and upper body get really flushed and hot, presumably as my body warms up my wet legs.
But in the winter, my legs can get icy cold and I wont have any idea or indication, really, other than feeling uncomfortable/unsettled...then if I hit a certain point (presumably when my core temperature drops below a certain level), I feel terribly cold and it takes forever to get/feel warm (forever=an hour or more). Ive gotten better at equalizing, and depend 100% on my gerbing electric heated socks, which i recharge and reuse every single day once the temperature drops below 50°</p>
<p>As for why i get flush from rain but not really cold... it seems to have to do with wetness/humidity/evaporation. Due to the nature of my spinal cord injury, I don't really sweat. A little in my armpits and a lot on my chest, but not on my head at all. Its bizarre and sucks. But again, if i'm in a humid environment, and especially when i'm wearing a hat, it seems to activate the sweating on my head.</p>
<p>In the summer my legs get very hot; my body cant seem to cool them. Though if i put them up (i.e. Lay down) their temperature quickly evens out. (In the summer, hot legs equalize in like 15 minutes when i lay down, whereas in the winter, cold legs take over an hour to equalize)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
