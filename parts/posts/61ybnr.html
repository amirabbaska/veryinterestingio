		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same reason why peoples faces get really shiny while their arms and legs don't. Your face (and chest, back, shoulders) has pores. In these pores are things called sebaceous glands, which produce sebum. Sebum is the bodies natural waxy substance which lubricates the skin and keeps it healthy. Some people produce a lot of it, and their faces shine like a diamond. Some people produce little of it and get dry skin. It itself is not a bad thing. Acne comes from when the pores get clogged. </p>
<p>Most people have the bacteria that causes acne on their skin already. But it doesn't do anything on healthy skin with healthy pores. Acne happens when these pores get clogged up. The bacteria consumes the sebum in our pores and releases its waste. Something to note is that the bacteria are anaerobic, meaning they thrive in low oxygen environments. So these bacteria are in your pores, eating your sebum, releasing waste, and your pores gets clogged. This is the start of a pimple. If the clog is deep, and the top of the pore is still open, a blackhead forms. If the clog is near the surface and a thin layer of skin forms over it, a whitehead forms.</p>
<p>So the face produces the most sebum and has a lot of pores, making it prime breakout territory. Your forearms and legs have much less sebum so they don't really get acne.</p>
<p>Edit: as I am the top comment, I'm going to plug /r/skincareaddiction as a prime knowledge center with very helpful people. First things first, don't pop whiteheads if you can avoid it, and if you have to, do it gently and cleanly. Popping acne and picking at pores is how you get scarring, and you don't want facial scarring. Secondly, daily sunscreen is how you look 30 when you're 50. Sun damage causes wrinkles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have the largest concentration of sebaceous (oil producing) glands in your face, back and chest. The sebaceous glands enlarge at puberty due to an influx of a testosterone hormone called DHEA. That over-stimulates the production of oil in these glands. Acne is an inflamed pore filled with oil, bacteria, and dead skin cells. The oil, dead skin, and bacteria get &quot;stuck&quot; in your pore and when your immune system tries to get rid of it, it causes the pus and inflammation we call acne.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_gland" target="_blank">Sebaceous glands</a> in the skin secrete <em>sebum</em>, an oily substance. They're found especially in the face and scalp. Sebum has these properties:</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lubricates the skin.</li>
<li>Waterproofs the skin.</li>
<li>Delays dehydration by turning sweat into more of an oily sheet than easily lost sweat drops.</li>
<li>Contains antiinflammatory, antimicrobial components.</li>
<li>Can work as a vitamin E transmitter to upper skin layers.</li>
<li>&quot;Mechanically&quot; (it's an oily film) protects the body against bacteria, viruses, other contaminants. See _<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_mantle" target="_blank">acid mantle</a>_.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapienic_acid" target="_blank">Sapienic acid</a>_ is a component of it, unique to the human species (hence the name) and seems to contribute to said acne, but also potentially an important antibacterial component. Sooo...</li>
</ul>
<p>I think these established facts answer your question pretty well? Sure, no direct answer to &quot;why face in particular&quot;, but it's easy enough for me to infer that helping to literally keep one's head cool (overheating can lead to heat stroke) has been evolutionary helpful, and so has some added handling of germs in your face given the closeness to how they are digested or breathed in? Hell it could even have sexual reasons given that well lubricated skin has obvious and well known properties in making it stay young (thus a huge part of the and our face is the most important body part in sexual selection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people are kind of stating the obvious I think: your face has more/larger pores.</p>
<p>Most of us can tell that just from looking at our arms and face. What I don't understand is why does our face have bigger pores? Is it because we need to sweat more there to keep our brain cool or something? Maybe because the sun hits our face more often, so it gets hotter? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I noticed is that these areas are also washed and rewashed aggressively more than the &quot;clear and beautiful&quot; areas. </p>
<p>When I finally &quot;gave up&quot; and stopped washing my face so much my acne eventually cleared up. I would use the Acid soaps, special creams, tanning, picking, not picking, everything and anything. It wasn't until I just stopped that my face finally started healing. I won't lie, it did get worse before it got better. And it was hard.</p>
<p>Perhaps my experience was one of reaching adult age and it just going away, I dont know. My wife swears by the Charcoal Soap. It's black, has almost only charcoal in it and does seem to create nicer skin.</p>
<p>There is a bit of feeding the beast that happens when one washes their face. It starts with a break out, some hard cleaning, acid pads, feeling good, then waking up to a face that looks like it slept face down in pizza grease. The facial skin is like most parts, a self organized system. It knows all the oil had been stripped off and over produces. Hence the ever increasing oily face. If that's someone's experience then just stoo washing your face. A towel pat down once a day will work. Perhaps a light water rinse once a day.</p>
<p>Then we have the other cases where the face is infected, and each time something is popped it spreads. This requires antibiotics. And the will power to stop picking. Acne IS different then pimples. Sometimes we will get pimples with white heads that just go bloop when touched. Then there are the omg this hurts so much bumps that are swollen and red and full of crap. That's acne and it's a special kind of bacteria that shouldn't really be concentrated like that. It may require a good dermatologist. Acne needs medicine, break outs from Mensi can be dealt with by not over washing. </p>
<p>Others answered the scientific side so I wanted to speak about my own personal experience with it and the research I've done. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
