		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, comets are mostly composed of ice. But 326 million trillion gallons?? That sounds like a ridiculously high amount! How many comets must have hit the planet to deliver so much water? And where did the comet's ice come from in the first place?</p>
<p>Thanks for all your answers!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When thinking about this, it helps to remember that the Earth essentially started out as two asteroids colliding and sticking together to form one bigger asteroid. That then hit a third asteroid to make it slightly bigger... and thousands of collisions later you've built up something roughly the mass of the Earth. The Earth is only ~0.03% water, so you don't need to have too many of those thousands of collisions be icy objects to get an ocean's worth of water.</p>
<p>Water is very abundant in space, and beyond the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost_line_%28astrophysics%29" target="_blank">snow line</a> in your planetary disk, water is cold enough to be ice and thus make up a larger fraction (~10-80%) of the solid material.</p>
<p>In the planet formation process, billions of comets form out beyond the snow line that are largely ice. Over the 20 million years of the planet formation process, lots of those billions of icy things end up getting scattered into the inner solar system and colliding with the large asteroids/proto-planets and giving them water.</p>
<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0510285" target="_blank">Simulations of this planet forming process</a> show that it's easy to get many oceans of water into these habitable zone planets, but the amount of water delivered can vary quite a lot just due to random chance and exactly how many collisions happen.</p>
<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3290" target="_blank">Simulations specific to our solar system</a> back this up, and show that it's really not hard to get water from comets onto the Earth.</p>
<p>EDIT: It's a little late in the game for an edit here, but for posterity's sake. For those asking why Venus and Mars don't have water if I'm claiming it's so easy for the Earth: the answer is they both <em>did</em> have lots and lots of water. See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2ow60u/how_exactly_did_comets_deliver_326_million/cmrgjqi" target="_blank">my answer here</a> for a brief summary of why it disappeared on both those planets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some very good answers here, but there is something missing. It's worth noting that there are many hydrous minerals in nature. These are minerals with water as an intrinsic part of their structure. All that water need not be in ice form, or even as comets. Plain old rock has plenty of water in its structure. As our planet accreted, the interior rock melted. Magmatic differentiation (or a differently named process for planetary formation) concentrated heavier metallic elements (iron, nickel, uranium, etc) in the core. Consider the volume of rock that must have been melted to accumulate the massive iron core that Earth has. If even 0.1% of that rock volume was water, that would still be a lot of water. The pressure at the core would have no space for water, and so it would be driven into the mantle. On the early earth, this water would have been driven upwards towards the surface, carrying dissolved minerals to the crust. It would also be released as steam during geological events such as earthquakes and geysers. Comets were not the only source of Earth's water. Water was already here, locked into the basic structure of the minerals that make up the planet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit:  I realize this graphic has its issues.  I believe that is all the surface water.  And thank you for the Gold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

From what I understand the ratio of heavy water to light water in comets is too high for our water to have come from comets. The actual paper is linked in the article, but it is behind a pay wall so I have to rely on the BBC's interpretation unfortunately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
