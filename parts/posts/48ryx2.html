<p>&quot;According to the Harvard group there was a one in 2 million chance of the result being a statistical fluke.&quot;</p>
<p>1 in 2 million!</p>
<p>Those claims turned out completely false.</p>

<p>Recently, gravitational waves discovery has been announced again. This time not by Harvard but a joint venture spearheaded by MIT.</p>
<p>So, basically, with Harvard so falsely sure of their claim of their gravitational wave discovery, what makes LIGO's claims so much more trustworthy?</p></div></div>
