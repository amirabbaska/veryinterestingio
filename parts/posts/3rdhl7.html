Once you tilted the cup at all you would lose the swirl as the liquid deformed against the cup wall and that creates imbalances. You can actually try this. Stir up a liquid in a cup where the liquid mass is as great as possible relative to the cup (paper cups work well) and then pick the cup up by your fingertips. Tilt the cup to one side to disturb the vortex and you should feel the cup trying to move around in various directions as the vortex collapses and sloshes against the cup unevenly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When walking with a cup of coffee that is not stirred, each step you take adds energy to the liquid.  Small turbulences build up and eventually the wave makes the surface spill over the edge.</p>
<p>When your coffee is swirling, you are disrupting the feedback loop so that the energy is redistributed in a radial pattern, which makes the wave that would make the liquid spill over the side take longer to build up.  However, the center of the swirl is lower than the edges by virtue of the radial alignment of the swirl, so less of a standing wave is needed for the spill to happen.</p>
<p>Therefore, it depends on both the distance you walk and the size of the swirl.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3rdhl7/if_i_pick_up_my_coffee_right_after_i_stir_it_so/cwnjpnr" target="_blank">established via experiment</a> that <strong>walking while stirring</strong> my coffee caused me to spill none of it, which is contrary to my usual klutziness with a coffee mug.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coffee - black, hot, no creamer/sugar.</li>
<li>Utensil - Coffee mug with handle.</li>
<li>Fill level - Upper meniscus of coffee about 1 cm from top of mug.</li>
<li>Stirrer - used two different stirrers: thin red plastic, and steel teaspoon.</li>
<li>Gait - regular walking gait, did not need to vary it like I usually would have when carrying a full mug.</li>
<li>Distance - 15 feet (ordinarily I would have sloshed it at least once by now).</li>
<li>Floor - Tile.</li>
