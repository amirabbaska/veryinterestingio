		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After going on vacation I was driving back to south Florida, about where the category 4 hurricane is supposed to hit and I realized that a whole lot of birds, a lot more than usual, we’re moving north and since It’s becoming colder everywhere I thought it should be the other way around where birds migrate south. Now with the hurricane looking like a very large threat, I figured that must be the reason for the birds fleeing. </p>
<p>Bonus question: if they can sense the hurricanes, why can’t humans?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where I live it is hilly and temperate. The sheep and cows will come down from the tops of the hills when bad weather is due more often than not. So if you see them grazing on top of the hills it's going to be fine for a while.<br />
I wonder how the behaviour changes in flat places like Australia where the grazing is mostly all on the same level?<br />
Obviously I know not all of Australia is flat, but when you see the massive ranches, there aren't many hills around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
