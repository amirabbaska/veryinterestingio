		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A common misconseption is, that just because animals don't do things like brushing teeth, wiping their asses or shower daily doesn't mean that it would not be better for them. It is just that humans have a higher standart of living and don't often die early in life, so we tend to see way more long term effects of these things in humans.</p>
<p>If every species would live to old age, we would see way more things like rotten teeth. One animal that usually lives to old age is the elephant, and a fun fact is that one of the most common deaths for them is dying of starvation because all their teeth have fallen out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) We tend to eat a high sugar diet (either direct sugar or processed grains that easily convert to sugar)... this allows mouth bacteria to fuck our teeth more easily than more &quot;natural&quot; diets. </p>
<p>2) Animal's teeth do rot. However, they tend to die before reaching an older age in the wild.... so they tend to die before their teeth are given a full chance to rot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>Animals do lose their teeth. They also rot. However, those that are not domesticated do better thanks to a less harmful diet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humans live a long time compared to most animals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most people in the West do not eat a great diet, both in general and for our teeth.</p>
</li>
<li>We also have to floss. Daily. Don't forget.</li>
</ol>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I use evora -- they took the strongest mouth bacteria(3 strains)  and genetically modified it to make hydrogen peroxide instead of lactic acid(so whitens and cleans instead of cavaties).  Sadly the FDA forced them to ensure it can't reproduce, so you have take it daily.  I try to floss though, too.  I find the pick things help-- shaped like a bow with floss pre-strung through it and a handle -- I have tight gaps so you can sort of bite the bow to gently get the floss between the teeth floss.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
