		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm seeing a lot of really great replies about animals (whales, etc) but it seems people are overlooking plants!! The &quot;sea grasses&quot; are not algae but are flowering land plants that have evolved to live in the water.  Sea grass beds create places to live that are HUGELY important to young fish and a whole host of ocean invertebrates. Like many things in the ocean, they're being hit hard by climate change and many of these grass beds are disappearing, leaving baby sea creatures of all types more exposed to predation.</p>
<p>Their flowers, however, are very disappointing compared to their land-based relatives at so i can see why people overlook them - but their evolutionary story is fascinating!  </p>
<p>I believe there have actually been THREE independent invasions of land plants back into the marine environment just in seagrasses..i'm pretty sure that has mammals beat (though likely not all animals..thanks /u/Harsimaja)! Fact check me on these claims though.</p>
<p>Tl:DR; Don't forget about the plants, yo!</p>
<p>Edit 1: /u/Mechasteel brings up Lilypads as another example. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/92arnm/theres_evidence_that_life_emerged_and_evolved/e34sqmj" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/92arnm/theres_evidence_that_life_emerged_and_evolved/e34sqmj</a></p>
<p>Edit 2: /u/zilti asked an awesome question: &quot;since seagrass flowers are underwater, is there an oceanic pollonator like a &quot;sea bee&quot;?&quot;.</p>
<p>Edit the third: SEA BEES ARE A THING GUYS! thanks /u/GeneralRetreat for finding the article <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/92arnm/theres_evidence_that_life_emerged_and_evolved/e350qqi" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/92arnm/theres_evidence_that_life_emerged_and_evolved/e350qqi</a>.  Ok...so there's no one single &quot;sea bee&quot; species, but the flowers are definitely pollinated by more than currents and appear to have aquatic-specific adaptations to attract pollinators.<br />
Sea bees are also not the only reproductive option these awesome plants have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/92arnm/theres_evidence_that_life_emerged_and_evolved/e358jxt" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/92arnm/theres_evidence_that_life_emerged_and_evolved/e358jxt</a> - thanks /r/wtfjen!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stacks. The most obvious is whales/dolphins/orcas which went water-&gt;land-&gt;water, but also tortoises made the transition 3 times and went water-&gt;land-&gt;water-&gt;land (i.e land tortoises evolved from sea turtles, which evolved from land reptiles, which evolved from lobe finned fish. The reptile that went back into the ocean to become the sea turtle had tortoise-like cousin that remained on land, but it's now extinct)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sirenians, such as manatees and dugongs are a good example. Although they are closely related to elephants and hyraxes, their evolution was more similar to cetaceans in that they lost their hind limbs; their forelimbs became paddles for open water swimming in coastal and freshwater habitats. The only remaining feature of the hindlimbs is the remnants of a pelvis. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the ones already mentioned, there were many reptile species that headed back into the ocean after evolving on land. Most of the ones we see today (crocodiles, sea turtles, marine iguanas, sea snakes, etc) are hybrids. They can live on land as well as in the water.</p>
<p>However during the Mesozoic era there were quite a few true marine reptiles that lived entirely in the water. Some of their names might be familiar to you: ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, mosasaurs. These animals weren't fish, and they weren't dinosaurs (although they lived during the same period). They were cold blooded reptiles that evolved on land and eventually adapted to living in the water very successfully.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insects are land creatures, closely related to crustaceans. A small number of insects evolved back to water, but exclusively fresh water. There are exceptions, but very very few, some water bugs that live on the ocean surface, and some flies that live along the ocean shores. Diptera, a huge order of insects, are considered semi aquatic in that the larval stages require moist environments, though they find moisture in forest detritus, tiny pools of water, or corpses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
