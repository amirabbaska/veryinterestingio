		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes from the food you eat. The nutrients that you consume get broken down to a molecular level during digestion, and changed into simple forms like Glucose, a common sugar. One Glucose molecule is made of six Oxygen atoms, twelve Hydrogen atoms, and six Carbon atoms.</p>
<p>When your cells 'burn' glucose for energy by combining it with oxygen, the reaction equation looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>C6H12O6 + 6x O2 â€”&gt; 6x CO2 + 6x H2O</code></pre>
<p>...which gives you Water and Carbon Dioxide in addition to useful energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glucose (aka sugar from food) breaks down and gives us CO2.</p>
<p>Glucose is C6H12O6 </p>
<p>Oxygen O2</p>
<p>Carbon Dioxide CO2</p>
<p>If we have 1 glucose and 6 oxygens, that can give us 6 CO2 and 6 H20.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the right answer has already been given: the carbon atom comes from what we eat and drink. What has not been said yet is that this process is in some ways comparable to fire. You are 'burning' the energy of that sandwich you ate this morning by moving your finger to type this. </p>
<p>How so? Basically by making the molecules smaller and smaller because every time you break the bonds that are keeping the atoms together, they release energy. Sugars are in essence a chain of carbon atoms all linked together with hydrogen atoms attached. Oxygen in a way is what is forcing the bonds of these atoms apart (well, in an ELI5 way) and takes its place, which is why you get C<strong>O</strong>2 and H2<strong>O</strong> from this reaction. </p>
<p>Wood is also a chain of C's and H's. If you light a fire, you are basically providing the energy to break the first couple of bonds, these broken bonds release their energy as heat and if the breaking of bonds releases enough heat to sustain itself, the fire will keep going until there is no bonds left to break, or no oxygen to break the bonds with. In your body, the process happens slower and more step by step, which is why spontaneous combustion is such a rare occurrence. </p>
<p>How does this bond energy get there in the first place? Sunlight! Plants use the exact opposite reaction in their mitochondria to 'glue together' carbon from CO2 in the air with hydrogen from water (H20) so in some ways, if you are getting hot from running around, you are getting hot because of the energy of the sun. </p>
<p>Also, if you want to know how much energy is in food, burn it under some water and see how much the temperature increases. Knowing that it takes about 1 calorie to heat up 1 gram of water by one degree Celsius, you can get an estimate (though it will always be too low since some of the heat will just go into the air/whatever is holding the water, so you don't measure that). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're not breathing out the air you just breathed in plus a Carbon. You're breathing out old air. Basically your body uses the O2 for stuff inside your body and those processes turn it into CO2. Then you breath THAT out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
