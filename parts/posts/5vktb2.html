		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>DCIM stands for (D)igital (C)amera (Im)ages. It's the name for the file folder digital cameras should store images, specified by the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association, which created the book of standards for digital camera file systems (called the Design rule for Camera File system).</p>
<p>The DCIM folder is supposed to be the top folder. Each camera is supposed to have subfolders that start with three numbers and then up to five letters for the name of the manufacturer. So an iPhone might save pictures in DCIM/100APPLE. In your example, I'm guessing XPBH is an abbreviation for the camera maker. This is done so that you can keep images taken on different cameras separated in different folders within the DCIM directory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It stands for Digital Camera IMages.</p>
<p>It is part of the Design rule for Camera File system (DCF), which defines a standardize way for cameras to access memory cards.</p>
<p>Directories have the format 999XXXXX, and most device models will use a preferred directory name.  Files within the directory use the format XXXX9999, which again might be specific to the device.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
