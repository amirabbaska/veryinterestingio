Would focusing all this light to the center of the desk where the user is directly looking at most of the time, have greater effect than spreading the light evenly between all surfaces visible with direct and peripheral vision? Assuming the light source itself is not within peripheral. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The important cells for this type of photoreception are not the rods and cones, but photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsically_photosensitive_retinal_ganglion_cells" target="_blank">pRGCs</a>). These are neurons in the retina that sense light by themselves and send that signal directly to the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain, where the circadian clock is regulated.</p>
<p>I only found a paper that shows the distribution of the pRGCs in rat retinas (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2885915/" target="_blank">it's open access</a>). In rats the pRGCs are pretty spread out across the retina, but I don't know how that looks in humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
