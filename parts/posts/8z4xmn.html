Launching as the real Shuttle did gives me stability issues in the game while performing the roll, so I launch with the shuttle already facing the right way.</p>
<p>Was there a reason the Shuttle didn't launch facing east to begin with?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Space Shuttle launched to a variety of orbital inclinations, which meant the roll had to be different. It's a lot easier to just roll the Shuttle in flight than it would be to rotate the launchpad. In real life the Shuttle doesn't just sit on the ground help by a few clamps, there's a lot of infrastructure as can be seen in this picture.</p>

<p>The tower comprises the &quot;Fixed Service Structure&quot; and &quot;Rotating Service Structure&quot;. The latter part can swing towards the Shuttle so that payloads can be loaded on the launchpad.</p>
<p>There's also the Mobile Launcher Platform that the Shuttle sits on. While that moves, it sits itself on fixed supports.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, one more aspect is that the Shuttle's infrastructure was based on Apollo's. While I don't know the details, my understanding is that effectively determined the orientation of the Shuttles on the launchpad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Credit to /u/mimshot for this answer back in 2015 to the same question:</p>
<p>During launch the space shuttle is trying to reach orbit. This requires going up and West East, but mostly West East. Space is not very far away (about half the distance from New York to Boston), so the hard part of reaching orbit is not so much getting up as dealing with the falling back down. The space shuttle deals with this by going sideways (i.e., West East) fast enough that it misses the Earth as it falls back down. You can think of orbit as falling towards the earth but going sideways fast enough that you miss it on the way back down, keep falling, keep moving sideways, keep missing, repeat.</p>
<p>For that to work, you have to go really, really fast, which isn't so much a problem in space, but is a big problem when you're still climbing through the atmosphere because while going through space at 17000 miles per hour is no problem, going through air anywhere near that speed can cause a lot of problems.</p>
<p>When the space shuttle first launches, it's trying to gain altitude and speed. The airflow causes a lot of mechanical stress, so it rolls to put the fuel tank up. That way the tank (which is going to break up and fall in the ocean 8 minutes after launch) eats most of the wear and tear while protecting the orbiter, which is far more delicate and contains even more delicate humans in it.</p>
<p>Also, we should probably start saying &quot;did&quot; rather than &quot;does&quot; in regards to the space shuttle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is a great video that explains it.  <a href="https://youtu.be/zYesWQNmU5Y" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/zYesWQNmU5Y</a></p>
<p>TL;DW:  The launch pad is aligned North South or East West, so the rocket will launch directly in that direction.  Rockets do not orbit perfectly NS or EW, instead the orbit has a tilt or incline.</p>
<p>To correct for this, the rocket will roll so it’s guidance artificial horizon will be level in the direction it is going.</p>
<p>It is didn’t roll the artificial horizon would be rolled to one side making flight control difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
