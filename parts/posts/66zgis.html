		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically the annoying sounds are harsh/sudden, like the beeping of an alarm clock.  The visual equivalent would be a bright light flashing in your face incessantly.  Non-annoying repeating sounds may be the sound of waves on a beach, which is actually relaxing for some people.  As is the visual of waves crashing on a beach. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of it has to do with some of our senses getting tired. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_fatigue" target="_blank">Annoying smells for example get ignored eventually</a> so you won't be able to pick out certain smells after prolonged exposure. It also comes down to individual perceptions. For some people seeing someone walking in and out of a door multiple times could be distracting and annoying while someone else doesn't even notice. So it's a combination of sensitivity and how our senses actually work to protect us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well I've got a test for you. Don't pay for Direct TV access on a three hour United flight and watch their promotion bullshit loop the whole time. I could turn the screen off directly in front of me, but nearly every other screen I could see was on the loop. It was maddening. And to be honest, since I didn't have headphones plugged in, it was even more annoying because I didn't have the additional context.
I would have agreed with you, but when looking away really isn't that easy, trust me, it's annoying.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
