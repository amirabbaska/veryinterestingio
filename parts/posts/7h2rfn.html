</blockquote>
<p>Mobile phones work off UHF (Ultra High Frequency), so the range is very short. There are usually signal repeaters across a country, so it gives the impression mobiles work everywhere. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>wouldn't this take an enormous amount of power</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, not really, as long as there is <em>nothing</em> between Voyager and the receiving antenna (usually very large).  As long as the signal is stronger than the cosmic background, you'll pick it up if the antenna is sensitive enough. </p>
<p>So the ELI5 version of this would be :</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening to a mouse in a crowded street.</li>
</ul>
<p>Versus</p>
<ul>
<li>In an empty and noise-less room, you are staring at the mouse's direction, , holding your breath, and listening for it.</li>
</ul>
<p>EDIT: did not expect this to get so up voted. So, a lot of people have mentioned attenuation (signal degradation) as well as background cosmic waves.</p>
<p>The waves would very much weaken, but it can travel a long wave before its degrades to a unreadable state. Voyager being able to recieve a signal so far out is proof that's its possible. Im sure someone who has a background in radiowaves will come along and explain (I'm only a small-time pilot, so my knowledge of waves is limited to terrestrial navigation).</p>
<p>As to cosmic background radiation, credit to lazydog at the bottom of the page, I'll repost his comment</p>

<p>Basically, it's like this: we take two giant receiver antennas. We point one directly at Voyager, and one just a fraction of a degree off. Both receivers get all of the noise from that area of the sky, but only the first gets Voyager's signal as well. If you subtract the noise signal from the noise + Voyager signal, what you've got left is just the Voyager signal. This methodology is combined with a lot of fancy error correction coding to eliminate reception errors, and the net effect is the pinnacle of communications technology: the ability to communicate with a tiny craft billions of miles away.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They used a very large dish to focus the transmissions into a narrow beam. The bigger the dish, the greater the effective power. A 70M dish has a gain of around a million (depending on the frequency) . </p>
<p>They also used very low bit rate communications.  The usable bit rate is highly dependent on signal to noise ratio. </p>
<p>They do use high power on the Earth side, but the spacecraft has only a few watts, and a small dish. The Earthbound receivers use ruby <del>masters</del> masers cooled in liquid helium to get the lowest noise. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that they do in order to make communication with these spacecraft more reliable is to send the same batch of commands multiple times, each with a very slight frequency offset. This accounts for any relative velocity variation between Earth and the spacecraft, which may receive 3 of 5 commands sent, for example. The signals from the Voyagers are not strong - they are, in fact, weak compared to the background noise, but clever software algorithms have been developed which identify and isolate these transmissions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Some other commenters have covered really well how it's still transmitting, so I'll cover a bit of how we're receiving. The signals Voyager transmits are really weak when they get here, and there's a lot of noise in the electromagnetic spectrum, so the signals are way weaker than the noise. &quot;But wait&quot; you might say, &quot;if the signals are weaker than the noise, how can we hear them?&quot; It's a challenge comparable to hearing your friend whispering from across a room full of people talking. We came up with a really clever way to hear them, though.</p>
<p>Basically, it's like this: we take two giant receiver antennas. We point one directly at Voyager, and one just a fraction of a degree off.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't very much in the way of it, since it is mostly empty space between there and here.</p>
<p>There is a high latency, of course.</p>
<p>Your phone signal can't work with high latency since it is designed for quick communications, and it is prone to errors caused by other nearby signals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
