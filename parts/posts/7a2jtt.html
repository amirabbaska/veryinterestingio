One thing I noticed is that it looked like all of the continent's had clearly increasing populations (e.g. Asia and Africa) but Europe maintained what appeared to be a constant population. Why is this?</p>
<p>Also apologies if social science is not the correct flair, was unsure of what to choose given the content.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So far, all societies have tended to reduce their population growth rate as they become more technologically developed and economically successful.  Likely reasons include better access to birth control (so having kids is a choice), better childhood health care (if your kids are unlikely to die, you don't need as many), and better retirement plans (so you're not dependent on your kids to take care of you when you get old).</p>
<p>Europe is a world leader in all of these factors, so it's no surprise that its population should be stabilizing more rapidly.  If you look below the continent scale, many individual countries also follow this pattern: the population of Japan, for example, is actually shrinking slightly.  The USA is an interesting case: while population growth is zero in large segments of its population, it has also historically had population growth due to immigration, and has many sub-populations where the factors I mentioned above (birth control, childhood health care, retirement plans) aren't easy to come by.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called the demographic transition. </p>
<p>Societies used to have high birth rates and high mortality. Mortality drops first, then birth rates. </p>
<p>Europe has mostly finished this demographic transition. </p>
<p>The other, poorer and less developed societies, are still in the transition period where mortality is dropping but birth rates lag behind. </p>
<p>The population of Europe increased in the same way during the industrial revolution. Try looking at population data from 1750-1950.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The elimination of child labor, and new social security systems contributed to this demographic shift.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a model that explains how fast a country's population grows called the demographic transition model. Many European countries have entered the final stage, stage 5. This is the first stage of the model where a country's population begins to stop increasing--due to higher average population age, less need for children, better education and more access to birth control. The model is interesting, you should check it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they already went through their population boom. In the past, families would have many kids because it's likely that many wouldn't make it to adulthood. So families would have 8 or 10 kids sometimes. When medicine came around, it made it so many more kids live through adulthood and are able to reproduce. Instead of only 2 or 3 kids living out of those 10, 9 or 10 of them would. This causes a huge population boom after medicine is widespread in an area. After this boom, families start to only have, on average, 2 kids, which is exactly how many it takes to make a child, so population starts to level off. In areas where there isn't easy access to medicine, population usually climbs more so than being level.</p>
<p>A good youtube channel who has a video on this is Kurzgesagt: <a href="https://youtu.be/QsBT5EQt348" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/QsBT5EQt348</a><br />
He talks about the massive population growth we've had in the past hundred or so years, why that is, and why advanced countries' populations are beginning to level out and barely grow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
