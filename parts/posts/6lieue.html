		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are certainly differences in perceived loudness of given stimuli between animals, but that is not necessarily tied to ‘better’ hearing. Hearing can be ‘better’ or ‘worse’ in many ways. In terms of the evolutionary advantages of hearing, detecting very quiet sounds, subtle differences between two detectable sounds in both frequency and intensity, and the range of frequency response of the organism are quite important. A given stimuli evoking a ‘louder’ percept is probably much less important. However, an animal with lower absolute thresholds for hearing sounds (that is, they can hear very quiet stimuli) would also typically have lower pain thresholds at a given frequency (suggesting, though not definitely demonstrating, that they hear it as ‘louder’). </p>
<p>If you are interested in more detail, especially links to more reading and thoughts on some of the methodological intricacies that would enable answering this question more definitively:</p>
<p>Loudness is a psychological phenomenon that can't be measured with nearly the sort of precision as sound pressure level (in dB) or sound intensity (in pascals or other units), but there are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics" target="_blank">psychophysical</a> studies quantifying loudness using self-report, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_threshold" target="_blank">detection thresholds</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_pain" target="_blank">pain thresholds</a>, and many other methods. In humans, these methods can yield well-characterized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour" target="_blank">equal loudness contours</a> that describe the relationship of loudness and sound pressure at various frequencies.</p>
<p>While the self-report measures of many psychophysical studies may seem 'soft' as a metric to many scientists, they are extremely well-studied and, while much noisier than most methods of 'harder' sciences, highly reliable if done properly. In non-human animals, this practice can be significantly more difficult. Typical methods include using response latency (or reaction time) as a substitute measure for loudness, which has been shown reliable in some studies like [this one]( <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4955967" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4955967</a>). There is also [a fascinating study]( <a href="http://asa.scitation.org.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/doi/10.1121/1.3641449" target="_blank">http://asa.scitation.org.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/doi/10.1121/1.3641449</a>) on dolphins that trained the animals to discrimate sounds based on loudness. </p>
<p>Using methods like this, one could operationalize the definition of ‘better’ hearing (for example, lower absolute threshold at frequency X), you could quantify relationship between that definition of good hearing in different species capable of being trained to discriminate loudness, and then see if that measure of ‘good’ hearing correlated with hearing sounds of a given sound pressure level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This actually has to do more with physics. 'Loudness' can't exactly be measured as it is a unique experience to the individual. What can be measure however and is often what certain animals have over humans is the ability to detect different levels of Hertz (Hz). Humans hear the range of 20 to 20,000 Hz, while dogs as an example hear from 67 to 45,000 Hz (or 45 kHz). Dog whistles are just above human hearing at about 23,000 Hz to 54,000 Hz (Which is why some don't work: dogs can't hear them too).</p>
