Torque is how many bundles you can carry at a time, while horsepower is how quickly you can get all the bundles on the roof. If one person can carry one bundle up in a minute and another person can carry two bundles at a time but it takes him two minutes, they have the same horsepower but the second guy has more torque. The first guy has to move twice as fast to accomplish the same thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Torque is rotational force. You might be familiar with the unit of measurement, <em>foot-pound</em> (ft-lb). Imagine you're using a 1 foot long wrench to remove a wheel from your car. If you align the wrench horizontally (parallel to the ground) and set a 50 lb weight on the end of the wrench, you're putting 50 foot-pounds of twisting force on the lug nut.</p>
<p>This helps quantify how much force a vehicle can put to the road, or how hard the vehicle can pull. However, having high torque doesn't mean high speed. Construction vehicles have enormous torque to be able to move heavy loads, but don't move quickly.</p>
<p>Horsepower takes this a step further by measuring torque <em>multiplied by engine speed</em>. This gives a somewhat more useful measure for cars, because it represents an engine's ability to apply its torque over time. Two cars might have the same horsepower, but one achieves it through higher engine speed with lower torque, while the other achieves it through high torque with lower speed.</p>
<p>Generally, smaller engines have less torque but can rev higher, while large engines have more torque but cannot reach such high speeds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, lots of wrong answers in this thread. tl;dr at bottom.</p>
<p>Torque is how much twisting (technical term: angular) force something exerts. In the case of a car engine, it's basically how hard the engine is trying to speed the car up (or, specifically, how hard the engine is trying to twist the axles, which is what makes the car move). In the case of brakes, it's how hard the brakes are trying to slow the car down. If you know Newton's Second Law, *force = mass × acceleration*, then the rotational equivalent of force is torque.</p>
<p>The reason that we talk about torque rather than force is because when you want to spin something, where you apply force to it relative to the axis makes a big difference. For instance, with a lever, the farther away from the fulcrum you apply force, the easier it is to make it move, but the slower it goes. Torque accounts for this by saying that something that makes something spin the same amount is the same torque. So the closer you are to the axis (the center you're rotating around, like the fulcrum of a lever), the more force you need to produce the same amount of torque. It's similar to how we measure the speed that a wheel is spinning in rpm (or another similar unit) rather than in how fast any individual part of the wheel is moving.</p>
<p>Forces only exist when they cause or prevent change of speed, and the same is true of torque. More force is required to accelerate something from a standstill, because you have to give it all the inertia of motion. But once it's moving, you only need to apply enough force to counter drag and friction to keep it moving at the same speed. So a car that's cruising at speed is not actually applying all that much torque; the engine would put in the most torque if you press the pedal down all the way from a standstill, or if you slam the brakes.</p>
<p>Horsepower is a measure of power, which is difficult to explain fully without first explaining work. Work is *force × distance*, and measures how much energy is transferred from the source of the force into whatever is moving. The faster something accelerates, the higher the force, so over the same distance, it will do more work. This works out, because the resulting speed is higher, so the moving object has higher energy.</p>
<p>Work is really unintuitive at first, because of how muscles work. Muscles consume chemical energy to exert any force, even just to hold something up. So you shouldn't think of work as how hard you have to strain for something. A better example is a building: a building stays up because, even though gravity tries to pull it down, the forces that hold it together counteract gravity. They don't need to keep spending energy to do so. And since nothing is moving, the total work done by gravity on the building is 0.</p>
<p>Power is a measure of how quickly energy is transferred. The SI unit of power is the watt, which is the same thing we measure electricity with, and that helps understand it. For instance, if you use an electric heater, then the wattage determines how much electrical energy can be transferred into heat per second. More wattage means you use up more energy in a given amount of time, but get more heat out. Horsepower is a different unit of power, but measures the same thing (the exact definition varies, but is usually around 745 W unless you're measuring steam engines in which case it's about 9800 W for some reason I can't explain).</p>
<p>When applied to motion, we already have *work = force × distance*, and then we have *power = work / time*. But *distance / time = speed* (ignoring the technical distinction between speed and velocity), so *power = force × speed*. In the case of a car, the power is the speed at which the car is moving, times its speed. In order to exert the same force on two objects, you have to transfer *more* energy on the one that is moving faster. Remember that the transfer of energy and the force are not the same thing. If we want to talk about torque instead, the same thing comes out once we account for rotational speed (which, again, we measure in units like rpm), we get *power = torque × rotational speed*.</p>
<p>This might seem a bit weird, but the reason is fundamentally because of the fact that kinetic energy (that is, the energy of something moving) is not linear. If you have two objects of the same mass, with the first traveling twice as fast as the first, then the first object actually has four times the kinetic energy than the second. The reason that this has to be true can ultimately be traced down to relativity and to the fact that the laws of physics don't change over time (as far as we know, anyway). But it's also why something traveling twice as fast hitting you can hurt more than twice as much.</p>
<p>This means that the power output of the engine limits the top rotational speed of the drift shaft coming out of the engine, because at some point it is already spinning so fast that the engine can't output enough torque to do anything more than overcome resistance. From there, the drive train and wheels (most importantly the gear ratio, but wheel radius plays an important role as well) affect the conversion of torque into forward force. There is a tradeoff between force and speed. In a low gear, you get high torque but a low top speed, which is perfect for accelerating at lower speeds. In high gear, you get lower torque, so the engine has a hard time accelerating the car, but in exchange it can keep it up at much higher speeds.</p>
<p>tl;dr Torque is how much force is applied to accelerate or decelerate something spinning. We rate car engines with torque, not force, because car engines work by spinning an axle (or multiple axles). Horsepower is how quickly the engine can transfer energy into moving the car.</p>
<p>While it depends on other factors, and the drive train is super important, the horsepower is the ultimate limiter on the top speed of the car. Torque affects how fast the engine can accelerate the car, more torque is faster.</p>
<p>For two engines of the same power but different torque, the one with lower torque will have a higher top speed but lower acceleration. The gearbox lets us convert between torque and top speed, though, so then a lot of the distinction comes into the kind of gears needed.</p>
<p>EDIT: Talked about drive trains and the role of gears and cleared up the summary, thanks to u/constantino1's reply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I guess because you've used the word &quot;horsepower&quot;, you're only getting answers about cars. Horsepower is a unit of power output that can be used to describe any source of work over time - it is not limited to cars. That is to say that power describes a force applied to move an object over a given distance and time. Power can be measured in horsepower or a number of other units. Torque is a twisting force, or a force applied at a distance from a rotation point. They differ in that power is related to time, whereas torque is not. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Horsepower is power, ideally measured in Watts. I assume you are talking about a car or something similar, so in this case we are talking about mechanical power, but it is the same as electrical power. It is a measure of the rate at which energy is exchanged.<br />
Torque is measured in Nm, and it is the force that is acting on a rotating object, in this case the axle of the car.<br />
By definition the horsepower is the product of the Torque and the rotating speed(rpm) of the object. It is important to note that you can achieve the same horsepower with different torques as long as you have different rpm.<br />
That is what the gearbox of a car does. The engine provides a constant amount of power(horsepower) by rotating the shaft at a certain speed (rpm1) with a certain force (torque1). When you need to go uphill, you need addtional force, so the gearbox use gears of different radii to lower the rotating speed of the wheels (rpm2) and so obtain an higher force (torque2).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
