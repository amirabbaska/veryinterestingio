		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lawyer here, specialising in international law. The answers that have been posted so far are not bad, but contain some significant mistakes and don't answer the question very well. Here's my attempt at a brief explanation.</p>
<p><strong>What rules govern war?</strong></p>
<p>The use of military force is governed by international law. When it comes to war, there are two bodies of law that need to be considered. </p>
<p>The first body of law, called <em>jus ad bellum</em> is the law governing whether or not a sovereign State is permitted to even use force in the first place. Most commonly, a State is permitted to use force in only two circumstances. The first circumstance in which a State may use force is in self-defence, where it has suffered an armed attack. The second circumstance is where the United Nations Security Council has authorised the use of force (see, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_678" target="_blank">the UN authorisation of the use of force in the first Gulf War</a>).</p>
<p>The second body of law, called <em>jus in bello</em> (or, its much more friendly English name, <em>international humanitarian law</em>), governs how parties to an armed conflict must behave once the war has actually started. The most important rules about how countries are required to behave in war are found in the four <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions" target="_blank">Geneva Conventions</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_1907" target="_blank">1899 and 1907 Hague Regulations</a>. It's impossible to talk about these in any detail here, but the most important thing about these treaties is the general principles that they lay down. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>The principle of distinction, which requires that the parties to the armed conflict should only target military objectives, and never target civilians.</li>
<li>The principle of proportionality, which requires that any harm caused to civilians or their property not be excessive when weighed against the military advantage to be gained.</li>
<li>The principle of military necessity, meaning that any attack carried out should be for the purpose of militarily defeating the opposing army, not for some other purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do the rules work and what happens if they are broken?</strong></p>
<p>The second part of your question is a lot more complicated. There is no simple answer, but I will do my best to summarise it. First of all, we need to note that there are two levels of responsibility involved. There is the responsibility of the countries, as legal entities, and the criminal responsibility of the leaders, as individual people. </p>
<p>One country may sue another country for a violation of the laws of war. For example, during the Cold War, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua_v._United_States" target="_blank">Nicaragua successfully brought a case against the United States in the International Court of Justice for violation of the rules of jus ad bellum</a>. However, due to various technical reasons, it is quite rare for one country to sue another in this way.</p>
<p>The more common kind of responsibility is individual criminal responsibility of soldiers, commanders, and politicians who were involved in ordering or carrying out criminally illegal attacks under international humanitarian law (e.g. war crimes, ethnic cleansing, genocide, crimes against humanity). Under the Geneva Convention, States are meant to prosecute violations of the laws of war carried out by their own soldiers. However, as you might expect, this is not all that common.</p>
<p>Instead, these violations are often prosecuted by international courts and tribunals. Sometimes, a group of States or the United Nations will set up a court system to prosecute crimes carried out in a specific conflict (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_former_Yugoslavia" target="_blank">Yugoslavia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_Rwanda" target="_blank">Rwanda</a>). More recently, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court" target="_blank">International Criminal Court</a> has been established in the hopes that it would be able to prosecute crimes committed in many different conflicts, whenever the violating State fails to prosecute its own responsible citizens.</p>
<p>Some countries have also adopted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_jurisdiction" target="_blank">controversial laws</a> allowing their domestic courts to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, etc. regardless of where the crime was committed and regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are also cases where prosecution and enforcement of the rules is not forthcoming for political reasons. In these cases, you might see only a condemnation by the United Nations, or some lesser form of censure.</p>
<p>I could keep talking about this forever and in a lot more detail, but this is it in a nutshell!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Prior to World War 1 there were such organizations as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. <del>All of which obviously failed since there was a world war.</del> (per comments)</p>
<p>So after World War 1 it was decided at the Paris Peace Conference that there needs to be some sort of international organization to stop another world war. The organization stood up was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations" target="_blank">League of Nations</a>. </p>
<p>The League of Nations ended up being a failure. It lacked a way to enforce it's ideas and when the Axis Powers arose for World War 2 those countries withdrew which meant the end of the League of Nations. </p>
<p>This is the perfect lead in to your question.</p>
<p>During World War 2 FDR would come up with the idea of the United Nations. The big difference would be the security council system in the UN. </p>
<p>The security council has 5 permanent members (the winners or WWII) - US, UK, China, Russia (prev USSR), and France. In addition to these 5 very powerful seats, 10 other nations are voted in to the security council and sit for 2 years. </p>
<p>It's important to note that only the 5 permanent members hold the veto card to resolutions so global politics play a huge role on what the UN does ... cough Ukraine cough Russian Federation right to veto.</p>
<p>Having the security council gave countries with the most power at the time additional power. It also gave the losers of WWII a say in international law but not nearly as much power. It was the perfect timing and setup to get buy-in from ALL of the countries (of course not immediately it took time). &quot;Buy-in&quot; is very important to the UN's success. As of right now there are 193 nations that are members of the United Nations. It's basically every nation except Vatican City. This is huge - it is direct evidence that there is buy-in and with buy-in comes influence.</p>
<p>So how are rules of war managed by the United Nations? </p>
<p>The UN develops, votes on, and implements international law. For example, I've seen it on Reddit many times as a TIL post. The Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies. Which bans any military use of celestial bodies, including weapon testing or as military bases.  This is international law passed by the United Nations in an attempt to create peace before belligerence occurs.</p>
<p>But for war the UN is very effective. Of note, there hasn't been a World War Three which points to success during times of exponential military capability improvements.  So let's talk about how it works.</p>
<p>In the most basic case State A has an issue with State B and decide to use military aggression. The aggression that is allowed is already agreed upon by the United Nations so don't use chemical weapons, napalm, nukes, if you bomb a building the military objective better outweigh the loss of civilian life. That's all international law and if you break those laws your country is likely going to face some major sanctions voted on by the United Nations ... unless of course a permanent party vetoes those attempts ... Ukraine crisis.</p>
<p>The hardest thing for some first studying the UN to understand is that it is not entirely a peace organization. The UN is realistic and allows for war between countries and even multiple countries. Very strong laws about how other countries can intervene during a civil war. What it does do well is reduces the spillover of war. A country can claim neutraility and doing so buys that country protection but don't you dare aid a belligerent country by sending them goods that are going to be used for war - you are no longer neutral and you can be attacked.</p>
<p>Think you can beat a country by starving them to death? Blockade their ports and stop all commercial shipping? Nope that would be against international law.</p>
<p>So what happens when international law is broke? Well, it depends. The UN isn't the most powerful thing in the world by a long shot so the comments about you can break the law and nothing will happen are not wrong. Global politics will always play a part.</p>
<p>But I will say the UN is a success. It undoubtedly has major errors such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Assistance_Mission_for_Rwanda" target="_blank">United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda</a> which I would consider it's biggest failure. Not only did UN Peacekeepers get killed but genocide happened. All because it was a peacekeeping mission rather than peacemaking.</p>
<p>But it's the right forum to deal with issues in regards to war. It's okay and certainly can get better.</p>
<p>Feel free to correct me. I studied the UN during my two years with the Naval War College and am by no means an expert. Since studying the UN I do keep up with the news and have a deeper understanding each time something happens in the world. I only suggest you do the same.</p>
<p>TL;DR - The United Nations is the successful international forum for war. Since its inception laws have been passed that guide the rules of war and if a country does not abide by those laws they will likely receive sanctions. The UN has done a fantastic job of keeping wars between belligerent nations and reduce the probability of world war. The UN is not perfect but is the best we have ever seen in the history of civilization. P.S. The ribs were fantastic.</p>
<p>Edit: I'll finish the rest after lunch.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm back I'm typing and eating ribs soaked in Open Pit USA</p>
<p>Edit: Hey guys I did warn you that some of this may be incorrect. There are some really good responses that I suggest you read. Great to see the dialogue and learning going on in this thread.</p>
<p>Edit: Strikethrough the failure of Red Cross and the Hague Conventions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>None of the answers so far have been great, so I'll take a stab at it.</p>
<p>The rules of war have changed extensively over history. Militaries had internal rules--primarily concerning organization, chain of command, etc.--but when it came to defeating the enemy, there were no rules. It was kill or be killed; any members of the losing military that did not escape or retreat in time (which was very unlikely, as this was considered cowardly) were usually killed or enslaved. It was also considered inappropriate to inflict unnecessary damage to civilian populations, but pillaging, raping, and similar atrocities were fairly common.</p>
<p>This culture began to change around WWI due to the rapid development of dangerous military technology, such as the machine gun and poison gas. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_1907" target="_blank">The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907</a> were the first modern attempt at formally regulating the rules of war and the standards and punishments for war crimes. The administration of these regulations have been inconsistent, to say the least. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions" target="_blank">The Geneva Conventions</a> refers to a series of treaties that attempt to institute humanitarian treatment of POWs and civilians during wartime, and it also covers the neutrality of aid organizations (the Red Cross, for example). The implementation of Geneva Convention standards has, sadly, also historically proven to be rather uneven.</p>
<p>What happens if a country breaks the rules? Some people will tell you that the answer is nothing, others will tell you that only the losers are punished. Neither is totally true. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court" target="_blank">The International Criminal Court</a> is an independent judicial body that was established less than 20 years ago which prosecutes war crimes and crimes against humanity. It has successfully prosecuted and jailed war criminals, such as [Charles Taylor](<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Taylor_(Liberian_politician" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Taylor_(Liberian_politician</a>). The United States is not a member of the ICC.</p>
<p>Historically, the forced demilitarization of German after WWI (which would obviously later be violated) and Japan after WWII are examples of what could happen to a country if they were found to have committed serious war crimes. Unfortunately, there's more nuance to these punishments than which countries won and lost. The United States, for example, has never faced punishment for war crimes, despite the fact that the U.S. is now known to have ordered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lai_Massacre" target="_blank">a massacre of civilians and subsequently covered up the incident</a> during the Vietnam War, a conflict that the United States is widely agreed to have lost. I suppose one could say that war criminals are punished, but only if they are among the losers AND command less hegemony than the winners.</p>
<p>I hope that answers your question. I'll gladly edit if I missed the mark the first time around, and will answer any other follow-up questions that you may have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay most people here have covered modern war rules. But war rules have existed since the dawn of conflict. Human societies have always tried to &quot;civilize&quot; armed conflicts.</p>
<p>Take the early tribal societies. Generally war (not talking about raiding) was conducted on pre established rules, shared by the same culture group. For example, the Celts used &quot;champions&quot; (1 versus 1) to settle disputes in somewhat codified rites generally to avoid destroying too much property and lives. Other early war rules, like in Mesopotamia, was that armies tried to fight outside of agricultural lands, avoided destroying granaries if possible, minimized civilian casualties so you could enslave them later. In early China, generally only nobles (who fought on chariots) and their retainers were allowed to fight. In these cases when you defeated your opponent, it was assumed they would surrender to you, unless they had walls to hide behind.</p>
<p>A somewhat more known equivalent and written example of rules of war are the Bushido code, in Japan (ex:commit sepuku for acting dishonorably) or the code of Chivalry, in Europe (ex: nobles are suppose to fight other nobles, not armed lowborns; you were suppose to capture fellow nobles if they asked for mercy or yielded in exchange for ransom). Most of these rules were only enforced by reputation among peers. If you broke them if would sour your relationship with other rulers or important members of the elite class, making diplomacy much harder. </p>
<p>An other example during the Middle Ages is the banning of crossbows by the Catholic Church. It did not stop powerful lords to arm peasants or mercenary bands with it because they were able to take down knights at long distances and training time was short compared to most bows. Lords at time had a difficult time to pay their armies so they agreed to let their soldiers sack conquered towns for 3 days; after that they were suppose to enforce order once again even if it meant hanging their own people. There was also the common practice of letting garrisons go unharmed if they surrendered voluntarily, that way you avoid the drama of a lengthy and costly siege.</p>
<p>During the gunpowder age, and especially in the 18th century Europe, you were not suppose to kill officers (generally occupied by aristocrats) but capture them so you could exchange them for your own officers. Main reason besides their noble birth was that training officers was a long term process and most were career professionals expected to climb the hierarchy in the army. </p>
<p>After the Napoleonic Wars in Europe you had the institution of the Concert of Nations, in order to avoid total war scenarios that happened in those years. This summit was suppose to help avoid major conflicts, codified the rules of engagement and help fellow monarchies by providing a certain defense from outside interference when faced with internal conflicts, such as revolutionaries (ex: 1848 spring revolutions).</p>
<p>In the end these conventions, rites, codes and treaties could only be enforced by their own communities, whenever by strength of arms, diplomacy or religion. That is why when different cultures fought each other, the conflicts would be quite bloody in the initial phases. Like most human social conventions, belligerents can choose to ignore or enforce them. </p>
<p>I hope this post gives a you a little snapshot of how humans have tried to control the chaotic world of War.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
