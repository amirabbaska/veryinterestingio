Now imagine you're trying to read a book in another language, but you have a dictionary. So you have to look up every word. Take you a LOT longer right? You finish the task much slower.</p>
<p>So to read the same speed as a natural speaker, you might need to be able to read, and search through the dictionary, ten times as fast, or more.</p>
<p>That's emulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Imagine trying to unscrew a nut while holding the plyers with another pair of plyers. It is certainly possible, but you going to need a bigger amount of force to hold on to the plyers and move the nut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because a PC is not built to understand commands from different consoles.</p>
<p>Consoles have their own hardware architecture, and their own hardware commands. Consoles have been designed to streamline and run these commands as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>PC's however, run on a different hardware architecture. As a result, the emulator has to convert all these hardware commands into software instructions the processor can understand and run. With software overhead as well as the multiple instruction conversions that happen per second, it's clear that an emulator must be more powerful than the console it emulates</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDITED: So, my original response got zapped by the mod (and I've no interest in debating the merits of that, let's move on), so let's try again.</p>
<p>To emulate means to equal or approach equality with. What makes console emulation hard is that your PC has to do it well enough to be acceptable (the game must look the same, say) and fast enough to play the same.</p>
<p>Imagine your friend drew a picture with some colored pencils. Looks great right? Now your job is to take another sheet of paper, and, as quickly as you can, draw exactly the same picture. Same lines, same shades, same colors. Your pencils are mostly the same, so that at least gives you a leg up, but boy...it's gonna be hard isn't it? Now try doing that and being told you have to draw it as fast as your friend did the first time.</p>
<p>Let's take a detour into the &quot;mostly the same&quot; clause. If the PC has key components that are identical to the console, that's like you have the same colored pencils. You say &quot;I need a thick dark orange &quot; and lo and behold, you have the perfect pencil to hand. This is like your PC running the same operating system on the same processor chip as the console. Life is looking sweet. But if the components differ, that's like you needing a thick dark orange but only having a thin pencil. You can get there, but it's gonna take more time. In PC terms this is like having a CPU that has different chip registers from your console. Or maybe you need orange but you only have red and a yellow. Your PC is missing some hardware feature of the console and it has to cobble together a solution in software to make it right.</p>
<p>In short, when a PC emulates a console, you are asking it to do everything the console does, just as fast, but using its systems. It has to work harder to get it right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference is a result of the time cost of emulating hardware registers (storage locations in the CPU and graphics for instructions) in software. The reason is <strong>not</strong>, as some have suggested, to do with translating between differing CPU architectures. In fact, the major console CPU's are using the same CPU architecture as your PC, which is the x86-64 (also known as x64, x86_64, AMD64 and Intel 64) architecture. However, the console processor is packaged in a tight configuration with the graphics bridge that we call <em>system</em> <em>on</em> <em>chip</em>. The exact configuration is secret (proprietary), but it can be reverse engineered and then mapped to your system, which is what the emulator does.</p>
<p>Quick background knowledge: The speed of communication between active memory (RAM) to the computer's brain (CPU) is much slower than the speed of internal communication within the CPU (CPU to CPU) and also slower than CPU to graphics. These external communications are usually ten-times slower (an &quot;order of magnitude&quot; slower) than the equivalent internal communication would be. RAM to CPU can be even slower than that, but ten-times slower is a good estimate. </p>
<p>On your console, your game disc has instructions that read-from and write within the CPU and graphics bridge. These instructions are interpreted very quickly, since they're CPU-internal for the console.
On your PC emulator, however, the console's registers are being represented virtually in software, meaning that they're assigned locations in RAM by your operating system. So every time the game reads or writes from these virtualized registers, it takes roughly ten times as long as it would on the console. To account for the lag this would produce, your PC needs to be much speedier than your console needs to be (not necessarily ten times as fast, since most of your emulated gaming experience will not fit the the worst case scenario).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
