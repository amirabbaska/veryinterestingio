<p>The announced GTX 1070 has 7,2 Billion transistors. WTF.
Well considering the size of a GPU (the die for the chip is only 314 mm², a 20 Cent coin is 391 mm²), those have to be insanely tiny.</p>
<p>How does something that consists only of a couple of hundreds of molecules, something that's only 16 nm large, not get completely destroyed at the slightest movement?</p>
<p>And more insanely: how do they pull it off 7,2 Billion times on a single chip? How many of those are usually broken? </p></div></div>
