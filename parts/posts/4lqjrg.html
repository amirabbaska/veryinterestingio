<p>The announced GTX 1070 has 7,2 Billion transistors. WTF.
Well considering the size of a GPU (the die for the chip is only 314 mm², a 20 Cent coin is 391 mm²), those have to be insanely tiny.</p>
<p>How does something that consists only of a couple of hundreds of molecules, something that's only 16 nm large, not get completely destroyed at the slightest movement?</p>
<p>And more insanely: how do they pull it off 7,2 Billion times on a single chip? How many of those are usually broken? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're solid state - that means literally they are solids. There aren't lots of tiny separate bits, it's all produced on a single crystal of silicon.</p>
<p>The individual features are tiny, which also means they're very light weight so there's almost no mass to cause problems when you thump it.</p>
<p>This robustness is <em>one</em> of the original drives behind solid state electronics - being able to make something which would survive being fired out of a gun (radar fuses) or into missiles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you may have a fundamental misunderstanding of what a transistor is. </p>
<p>Transistors have no moving parts, are really really tiny and made of very tough material. In many cases, they are smaller than the cells in your body (which don't have a habit of just breaking, fortunately) </p>
<p>All a transistor does is either let current through, or resist it (represented by the binary units 1 and 0) Since all math can be done in binary (base 2) transistors can do any calculation that exists (given enough time) [also not totally true, you can only do calculations who's units don't exceed the number of transistors, but even 16 transistors can have 65,536 unique values, so it's sorta a moot point when dealing with millions]</p>
<p>How do they do it? You start with a wafer made of mostly silicone and you lase etch paths into it then wash it in a solution that bonds with the silicone to chemically &quot;print&quot; the transistors. They don't break because like anything it doesn't just break (it's like asking why the minerals in rock don't break when the rock moves. It doesn't really make sense for them to break, yknow?) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Integrated circuitry is printed directly onto the substrate material. In the case of processors it's a single, flawless piece of silicon. You should do some research into how the chips are made, because that will show you quite clearly how the individual transistors are almost impossible to brake without scratching or wiping the surface of the die. You could throw a processor across the room or drop it on the floor and aside from breaking the pins loose you most likely won't damage the die at all.</p>
<p>The designs of integrated circuits are basically drawn up on a computer (originally obviously they were designed by hand plotting) through some sort of CAD program, and everything is carefully done in very thin layers. These layers are then projected through lenses onto the surface of the silicon which is coated with some type of photo-resist so that the image becomes the correct tiny size, and exposes some areas of the photo-resist to be rinsed off. Now you're left with a pattern off the first layer of the metals you need to start building connections and areas of the actual transistors on the surface. This process is repeated, so you end up coating the current layer of metal with an insulator, exposing it to the pattern of the next layer, coating it with metal, etc etc etc. It's a very involved process but it's a trillion dollar industry with millions of people perfecting the process so it's reasonable to see how in 40 years we've gotten to this point.</p>
<p>Youtube has some great videos showing how IC's are developed, and it's a little more involved than I described but that's the basic idea. So you see there are no moving parts or exposed flimsy wires or pieces, everything is just layers a few atoms thick, insulated from one another, and printed on the surface of this piece of silicon. The entire depth of all the layers on top of each other is something like a a nanometer or even less. So it's almost like just a single plane.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
