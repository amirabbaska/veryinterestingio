		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these answers make conventional sense, but they don't get to the heart of why this is really true, /u/maphhifi.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: maps differ depending on who draws them, and more importantly, where those people are from. A map that the Haudenosaunee (aka Iroquois) people would have drawn to lay out their territory would look very different than what White Protestants would draw. Generally, when the people who have historically lived in and thrived in one location draw maps, they do so with those considerations in mind: <strong>when locals make maps, they usually try to divide up populations, territory or villages based on culture, economics, politics or language, not simple geography.</strong> Why would they? After all, knowing what village is allied with which tribe, or knowing which town speaks what language or follows which religion, is much more important to everyday life than knowing where a mountain or river is.</p>
<p>Now, look at a map of the world, and count how many countries, provinces, territories and states have borders with straight lines. Notice anything? Yeah: <strong>almost all of those straight-lined borders</strong> are in Africa, the Middle East, Australia, the western and north-western US/Canada. What's the common element here? <strong>These are all nations and provinces that were subject to colonialism and colonization.</strong> And colonialism/colonization, as systems employed by the empires of the world (as well as the US), had one goal: the <em>extraction of value</em> from nations, the same way you'd extract value from a mine or farm you own. And if your goal is to extract value instead of show borders between different cultures or towns, you're going to draw that map very differently. More specifically, you're going to draw it with a lot of simple, straight lines so you don't waste time or energy mapping it out or considering what the land is like, who is on it and what they might feel about it. </p>
<p>Probably the worst example of this (and that's saying something, if you've ever read about the tragedy that was the Scramble for Africa) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement" target="_blank">Sykes-Picot Agreement</a>, which the British and the French formed between themselves to divide up formerly Ottoman territory after World War 1. The map of the area (which encompasses parts of what is now Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and, most importantly, Syria) was almost entirely <strong>a straight line</strong>, with the Brits taking one half and the French taking the other. That boundary was one of the deciding factors that split up dozens of cultures and people who spoke dozens of languages and dialects, believed different religions, and had radically different cultures and political philosophies. It split communities that were probably better off together, and put communities who were enemies together. If you've ever wondered why Africa seems to have so many civil wars in relation to other continents, <em>this</em> is one reason you can trace it back to: cultural conflicts that force opposing interests into one space.</p>
<p><strong>That</strong> is the real reason why there are so many nations with straight-line borders: because they were almost all colonized nations or territories of a former empire, which usually had really bad consequences.</p>
<p>One of my favourite professors ever in the History department summed this up best: &quot;Any time you see straight lines on a map, you can bet money that the person who drew that map didn't live there.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Boundaries between states can broadly be separated by whether the people responsible for drawing up the lines lived there at the time they were made or not.</p>
<p>Boundaries between states (in the broader sense of the term) where people have lived for a long time tend to follow geographical features -- rivers, mountain ridges, etc.</p>
<p>Boundaries drawn up by outsiders or over unoccupied territories tend to be much less complicated, because there's no one (important) there to care about the conflict.  Very important geographical obstacles, like rivers that can't be forded, may be considered, but the &quot;empty space&quot; between is often divided by straight lines.</p>
<p>The eastern US's borders were largely defined by the original 13 colonies, and the borders between those colonies were geographically defined.  There was however <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/shepherd/british_colonies_1763-76.jpg" target="_blank">a lot of unsettled territory to the west of the initial settlement sites</a>, and borders more or less turned straight east-west past the point at which people lived and cared.  <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/a3/c1/b0/a3c1b01b243391b0334bc9717810f661.jpg" target="_blank">As states like Alabama &amp; Tennessee were carved out of the territory claimed the Georgia and North Carolina</a>, their latitudinal borders stayed straight lines extending from established states until they hit a powerful geographical border that could not be ignored -- the Mississippi River.  Similarly, Kentucky was defined by the Ohio River to its North and a straight line to the South.</p>
<p>That began a pattern that followed after territories were gained with the Louisiana Purchase, the Russo-American Treaty of 1824, the annexation of Texas, and the Mexican American War.  We'd take large territories that we now owned and largely cut along the latitude east to west.  We started making straight lines north-to-south too, except when a river got in the way, because no one lived there to get in disputes over minor adjustments back and forth like they do in densely populated territories.</p>
<p>You can see a similar pattern in the way that Europe divided up colonial Africa and the Middle East with no regard for the natives living there.  Rivers where they were big enough.  Straight lines to keep thing simple beyond that.  Quick and dirty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of boundaries: geographic, and and political. If the boundary is squiggly, it's a river. If it's straight, a group of people sat down and argued over it until they agreed, then drew a straight line.</p>
<p>In Europe, those political boundaries were decided by centuries of war and incredibly detailed political maneuvering...There is so little land, every bit counted, and even the political boundaries are squiggly.</p>
<p>In the US, especially out West, where the land is flat and featureless, there is no reason not to draw a straight line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They tend to be not-straight when there is a significant geographical boundary, like a river, or historical population divide, like language. If there isn't a significant geographical boundary, drawing a squiggle doesn't necessarily gain you much value. It's just unnecessary complexity to keep track of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
