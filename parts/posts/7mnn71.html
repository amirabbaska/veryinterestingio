<p>A good aquarium will be curated to take both these into account, and will only contain well fed, mutually compatible species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A well fed fish is less likely to eat other fish. However, this isn't always the case and many predator type fish will in fact go after anything they can fit in their mouth. When stocking predator aquariums you do have to be careful to stock compatible tank mates, otherwise, you risk other fish/shrimp becoming a meal. Lionfish, eels, groupers are examples of saltwater fish where this applies and I've seen cichlids in freshwater eat tank mates as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is rare for aquariums to put predatory fish in with their prey species. For the extreme predators they will be in an isolated take by themselves, sometimes down to a single tank for a single individual. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
