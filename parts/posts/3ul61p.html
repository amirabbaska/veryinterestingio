		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a blade moves, it creates a wake, like a boats wake, that disturbs the air around it. That wake can interfere with the efficiency of the next blade as it passes. So, it's a tradeoff situation for efficiency that factors in  number of blades, blade speed, wind speed, and RPM to maximize the efficiency of energy conversion. This is also why how close the towers are to each other and how they are oriented overall on the landscape. Watch a sailing race and see how they try to steal each other's wind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because blades cause turbulence and disrupt the air for the blade that follows. Turbulent air generates less lift. </p>
<p>The reason why odd number of blades is preferred to even numbered is stability.  In even numbered turbines, when one blade is in high position and experiences strongest force, another is in the wind shade in the front of the tower. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Short Form</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Goals of wind turbines are efficiency, as there is not a great amount of energy to harness (velocities are low), as blade numbers increase efficiency drops this is due to interference with each other. One blade is most efficient but not practical, two has an issue stated below, 3 blades therefore is the optimal choice.</p>
</li>
<li>Differences in wind speed at the surface of the earth dictate 3 blades are required for large diameter wind turbines. As altitude increases and diameter increases, delta wind velocity increases from top of the diameter to the bottom (earth has a form of boundary layer), this is inducing more work / more force on the blade at the highest point, the point with a blade is at its highest altitude vertical has two lower loading blades below it evening out this force as best as possible. With only two blades the tower would oscillate at a higher magnitude, requiring a more costly stronger and more ridged tower and blades.</li>
</ol>
<p>(So if it was not a structural / oscillating issue wind turbines would be 2 blade, as they counterbalance each other)</p>
<p>The Longer version is very long so I suggest looking up some topics to learn more.</p>
<p>A windmill is a lifting surface just the same as aircraft wings, all principles cross over. Research induced drag, and wing tip vortices, and vorticity in general, once you have a grasp of these topics you will start to see the challenge.</p>
<p>Look up wing loading, and how this effects lifting surfaces. </p>
<p>Look up boundary layers. And how this would affect all flows. </p>
<p>Feel free to ask questions!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aero Engineer here, I also work for a tidal energy company (same concept as wind just underwater using the tide). Essentially there is trade off between efficiency and cost. Theoretically more blades means more efficiency, however you get diminishing returns due to the wake effects on both the other blades and downstream turbines. More blades also means more capital cost, (raw material, manufacturing, transportation, installation costs all increase with more blades). A final point is the complexity/size of the hub which has to house the blade pitch systems, these are mechanical systems with motors, bearings, hydraulics ect ect. This added complexity is both expensive and decreases the reliability of the system, meaning its going to spend more time not working and you're going to be spending more on fixing it.</p>
<p>So yeah its a trade off between efficiency, capital cost and reliability (effectively ongoing costs). Wind turbine manufacturers don't care about making the most efficient turbine; they care about what their return on investment will be. Many things effect that, not just efficiency.</p>
<p>So why not one or two? Well this is perhaps more interesting... The  ground/sea will slow down the air close to it. Meaning that the wind   at the top of the turbine is going faster than the wind at the bottom. This creates oscillatory loading as the blades passes through the fast and slow air. This is at a frequency of rotor speed x number of blades. Only one or two blades means the frequency is quite low where you might have to worry about resonance with the tower. The amplitude of the loading is also higher with a lower number of blades meaning greater fatigue damage (cracks growing in materials when loaded cyclically)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
