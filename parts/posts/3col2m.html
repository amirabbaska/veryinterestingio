		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of reports of Orcas actually assisting Austrialian whalers by tracking and hearding whales into Eden bay to be killed by the whalers who then caught and butchered the whales, leaving the meat and tongue to the Orcas. The whales were too big for the Orcas to kill on their own, so this provided a new food source for them. This would indicate that they could indeed reliably locate other whales, probably by sound. (also pretty interesting anecdote about Orca intelligence and ability to learn)</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://us.whales.org/faqs/facts-about-whales-and-dolphins" target="_blank">HOW DO WHALES, DOLPHINS AND PORPOISES COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Communication amongst whales and dolphins is achieved in several ways. They create sounds, make &gt;entire ocean basins) using very low frequencies. Dolphins and porpoises however, usually use higher &gt;frequencies, which limits the distance their sounds can travel.
In general, dolphins make two kinds of sounds, “whistles” and “clicks”. Clicks are used to sense their &gt;surroundings through echolocation, while they use whistles to communicate with other members of their &gt;species and very likely, with other species too. It is also thought that each dolphin has a unique whistle &gt;called a ‘signature whistle’, which is used to identify an individual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also interesting, here is a clip showing pictures of a whale and dolphin “playing” with each other.
<a href="http://www.amnh.org/explore/science-bulletins/\(watch\)/bio/news/whales-give-dolphins-a-lift" target="_blank">Whales Give Dolphins a Lift</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many species interact in the wild, most often as predator and prey. But recent encounters between &gt;humpback whales and bottlenose dolphins reveal a playful side to interspecies interaction. In two &gt;different locations in Hawaii, scientists watched as dolphins “rode” the heads of whales: the whales lifted &gt;the dolphins out of the water, and then the dolphins slid back in. The two species seemed to cooperate &gt;in the activity, and neither displayed signs of aggression or distress. Whales and dolphins in Hawaiian &gt;waters often interact, but playful social activity such as this is extremely rare between species. These &gt;are the first recorded examples of this type of behavior.</p>

<p>This article talks about a study that observed two species of dolphin altering their native frequency range when coming in to contact. It is proposed that they are attempting interspecies communication. I don't know enough about dolphins or communication to make any meaningful additions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will defer to an expert in the field, but I found a journal article that details how killer whales learned to imitate dolphin whistles and clicks.  Therefore, the answer to your question is partly yes.</p>

<p>I would theorize that cetacean species that have the ability to hear other species also have a good chance of communicating with one another in some fashion (if we take communicating to mean <em>any</em> conveyance of information, no matter how small or insignificant).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very interesting question, if I'm reading it right. Are you asking whether there is communication <em>between different species?</em> So, for example, do blue whales respond to grey whale signals?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
