		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from what's mentioned here, there's also inferred data. So for instance, a data collector might have 2 or 3 pieces of data on an individual, and from that data, they are then are able to predict another characteristic with a high degree of accuracy. </p>
<p>Famous example is Target... They were able to predict with reasonable certainty that a woman was pregnant. Other examples would include religion, sexual preference etc...</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you mean this <a href="https://personalreports.lexisnexis.com/access_your_full_file_disclosure.jsp" target="_blank">full file disclosure</a>, it says where they get most of the information.</p>
<p>It turns out that public records are pretty extensive if you have the resources to automatically collect them. When I received my report, it had 2 lawsuits on it where I was the plaintiff in a very large and populous county, but it didn’t have the 1 lawsuit I had as a plaintiff in a very small county. There’s an easy to navigate website in order to access the court records for the big county but no way to do it online for the small one. This is where land, criminal, lawsuit, etc. information on the report comes from.</p>
<p>Insurance companies tend to report information in order to use the company’s reports when a new customer wants to join them. You should be able to see insurance information going back years.</p>
<p>Credit reporting bureaus are responsible for another big chunk of information and this is usually the most important. Credit card companies and places that loan out money will report your address to a credit reporting bureau. Those bureaus will then report that information to Lexis Nexis. Former addresses, collection accounts, credit cards, mortgages, auto loans, etc. all come from a credit reporting bureau. You can see what’s on your credit reports immediately by using <a href="http://annualcreditreport.com" target="_blank">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> If you want to dig even deeper, you can see what’s on your credit report, get your credit score, and get emailed when something shows up on your credit <a href="http://moneyographyadvanced.net/review-of-credit-sesame" target="_blank">through other free sites</a></p>
<p>There is some cross checking between all of the information sources such as matching up your insurance information to a car loan or getting your addresses from more than one place. Other information, such as where you went to college, comes directly from the school’s bursar’s office, or through the American Student List.
Lexis Nexis itself appears to work mostly as a compiler of information and either sells that information, or trades it for more information, making their reports more valuable.</p>
<p>What can you do to stay out of it? Not much. Opting-out on the Lexis Nexis website isn’t an option unless there is a genuine danger if a 3rd party knew where you live (crazy stalker ex, etc.).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't totally related, but I worked for Microsoft's Data Science team and learned some really interesting facts on how certain companies get their data and user info... 1.) It's not technically illegal for giant tech companies to &quot;digitally spy&quot; on their software users... Example - If you are continuously visiting amazon and buying dresses or shopping online for women's clothing - you're most likely a woman... If you're buying kid's clothes, you're most likely a mother... If you're on dating sites, you're most likely single... Microsoft or large tech companies can easily bypass &quot;identity laws&quot; and based on your internet history and browsing history digitally &quot;guesstimate&quot; your age, race and sex in just a few days, weeks of monitoring your traffic. One allows this when you use their browsers, use Office, use their OS, etc. 2.) Companies are also sleazy and often don't care about your privacy - they sell your info and detailed personal info to these companies and their affiliates. I claimed bankruptcy last year and for the next 6 months of filing received 100+ offers for cheap car loans and bad credit lendors offering car loans from local dealerships (had a car and was not looking at all)... Anywhooo....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I sell voter and consumer data for a living. Agree with everyone else - we have a team of 20 that comb through PDF after PDF scraping personal info from documents, using fuzzy match techniques to link that data public records and voter file info, then investing in large consumer data lists from third parties to grab fields such as 'affinity for golf, number of credit cards, etc.' We then use that data to inform predictive models on people likelihood to like certain things or do certain actions. Then sell that data to end clients and reinvest in the collection process. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
