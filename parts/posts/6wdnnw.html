		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electricity is run on an alternating current (AC) which reverses voltage in the pattern of a sine wave. In the US, the frequency of this alternating is 60 Hz, which is a B flat (more of a flat B or sharp B flat, really). Sometimes interactions with surroundings, especially at high voltages like in transformers, can cause a hum at the frequency the grid is run on. In most of Europe, as an example, it's run at 50 Hz not 60 Hz, so you would hear a G (a little sharp) instead of a B flat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, alternating current (AC) oscillates at 60Hz and the buzzing you hear is generated by the second harmonic, so 120Hz. The nearest B-flat is at 116.54Hz, so it's pretty close! The next B is at 123.47Hz, so really you're hearing something that is very much in the middle of B and B-flat. If you were in Europe, where the standard is 50Hz, you'd be hearing something between G (98Hz) and G-sharp (103.83Hz).</p>
<p>Also, excellent ear, are you a musician?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As a musician, you might appreciate this story. These jammers were complaining about random humming coming from their amps. Their jam room was close to some overhead wires. It took a while, but we finally figured out that when their guitar strings were parallel to the power lines, the amps would hum, but if they stood so that the guitar strings were perpendicular to the power lines, the humming would go away. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electricity oscillating doesn't produce the sound by itself; the oscillation of electricity needs to move air in order to produce a sound. Air is not influenced enough by electromagnetism at audible frequencies that we would hear any sounds from a direct interaction between the electricity and the air.</p>
<p>The oscillating current of AC electricity creates an oscillating magnetic field, which is especially strong in electrical transformers where the wire is wound around an iron core. The kind of iron used in transformers exhibits a phenomenon called &quot;megnetostriction&quot;, where the crystal structure of the iron grains in the metal changes its length in the presence of a magnetic field. It is this rapid oscillating length change in the iron cores of transformers and other electromagnetic components that results in vibrations that we can hear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
