		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In obstetrics pelvimetry is used assess whether a women's pelvis is thought to be clinically adequate for vaginal birth. Typically the physician measures the diagonal conjugate (symphysis pubis to sacral promontory) and estimates interspinous distance (distance between ischial spines). Generally the limiting dimension for delivery is considered to be the ischial spines. The true limiting factors anatomically for vaginal birth are the bony parts of the pelvis that can't be seen externally. So someone with wider hips won't necessarily guarantee that they will have an easier birth. Not to mention the other two P's that affect ease of birth. The passenger (size of baby) and the powers (strength of uterine contractions). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>Researchers estimate cases where the baby cannot fit down the birth canal have increased from 30 in 1,000 in the 1960s to 36 in 1,000 births today. Historically, these genes would not have been passed from mother to child as both would have died in labour.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's shocking to me how many people on here assume the question is referring to FAT content of the hips, when I thought it was common knowledge that females naturally have wider pelvises/hips for the sole purpose of giving birth!
<a href="http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/skeleton_male_female_differences.html" target="_blank">Difference between male &amp; female skeleton</a> </p>
<p>The link doesn't answer the question directly, but essentially the wideness of the hips themselves may not directly correlate with ease of birth but rather the wideness of the pubis bones (where the hip joints meet, at the bottom) would most likely!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, the bulk of my training is in animals, not humans, but &quot;wide hips&quot; refers to the measure of the birth canal. It has nothing to do with fat.</p>
<p>If you're talking about fat, it's referred to as &quot;condition,&quot; which also has an effect, but it's not what cattle farmers mean when they talk about wide hips.</p>
<p>The size of the birth canal, of course, has an effect. The wider the birth canal, the easier the birth. There is a thorough paper on the topic relating to primates <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4305166/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
