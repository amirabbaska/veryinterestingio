		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A quiet noise from a nearby source will have more high frequency content than the same noise made much louder from far away. This is because air absorbs high frequency sound energy over distance but not low frequency to the same extent (think about how a plane sounds low and rumbly from far away, but when you are close, it sounds like all of the frequencies).</p>
<p>Additionally, nearby sounds will create stronger reflections off of surfaces close to you, creating a more full sound compared to distant sounds which will most likely consist of just one apparent location, or the reflections will be recognized as an echo, another indication that the sound is a large distance away.</p>
<p>If you are not near any other objects, the first effect will be the predominant way your ear/brain make the distinction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interaural arrival times (sound arriving in on ear slightly before the other), interaural spectral differences (the fact that your head casts an acoustic shadow and blocks high frequencies will help you determine which direction it's coming from and how far away it is, less of an acoustic shadow means the sound is closer) and interaural intensity differences (sound from farther away will be louder in the ear facing it, whereas this difference will be less pronounced in a sound that's close).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the study of audio engineering the terminology that we use is interaural time difference and interaural level difference.   It refers to the sound hitting the ears at different times and at different amplitudes.</p>
<p>The first order reflections of a sound source bouncing off of surfaces between the listener and the source will collect carry and transmit information to the listeners brain about the location of the source. </p>
<p>If you listen to a loved one who is in your childhood home over the phone you might be able to tell which room your family member is standing in simply by the pattern of first order reflections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add to the top answers that your ear doesn't; your brain does. Your ear is just a microphone that translates vibrations into a signal (nerve pulses in this case, electrical current in the case of an actual microphone) that your brain (or computer) can work with. Your brain (or computer) then processes it and judges what is the case and not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In terms of decibels (also referred to as volume, or the intensity of sound), a distant noise could measure the same as a quiet, nearby noise. The difference is that through evolution, we've learned to pick up on the fine nuances between the two.</p>
<p>Nearby sounds will tighter reflections (echos) off the walls and surfaces around us. Far away sounds, that were loud when produced but have gotten quieter as they reach us, are filled with reflections that are greater spaced. A sharp &quot;bang&quot; 1/2 mile away will trail with echos a lot longer than a nearby snap, though both may have the same decibel rating.</p>
<p>Also note that over distances, low frequencies travel further than high frequencies. That's why when you hear a helicopter close up, you can detect the high-pitched whine of the turbine very easily, but seeing a helicopter in the distance, you only hear the low pounding of the blades. Knowing this, our brains automatically can decipher how far away something is, especially when we know what it sounds like nearby.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
