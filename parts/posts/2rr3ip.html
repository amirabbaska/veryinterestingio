<p>Yes, some of those calories would &quot;pass through&quot; and not be able to be digested.  Unless your body is used to utilizing a massive amount of calories, it's not going to waste energy having and maintaining receptors in your gut that almost never get used.  For instance, you only make so much bile at a time, which is necessary to absorb fats.  If your gut gets overwhelmed with more fat than you can possibly absorb, it's going to pass through the region where fat is absorbed...which is a relatively short region, and get turned into massive amounts of gas later on down the line.   This gas is the result of microbes in your gut inexpertly fermenting fats, which is a nutrient they are not used to utilizing, so they break it down inefficiently, making gases as their own &quot;poop&quot;.  You may absorb some of the other products these microbes create as a result of this breaking down, but it won't be as calorie-rich as if you were able to absorb the fats as fat.</p>
<p>If you consistently eat high calorie foods, or a particular type of nutrient, your gut and its microbiome will change in response to that level of intake, and you would absorb those calories more efficiently.</p>
<p>TL;DR?  The second one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm just going to leave this paragraph here from H.M. Sinclair (Laboratory of Human Nutrition, University of Oxford) in his &quot;The Diet of Canadian Indians and Eskimos&quot; from 1952 symposium proceedings; emphasis mine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Eskimo is apparently able to digest and absorb very large amounts of protein and fat at a single meal.  In times of plenty, 4 kg of meat daily is a common amount and much is taken at a single meal : they do not usually take food in the morning.  Consumption of larger amounts such as 15 kg has been observed on occasion, and Ross (1835) considered that an Eskimo ' perhaps eats twenty pounds
of flesh and oil daily', <strong>which I suppose is possibly 46,000 Cal.</strong> Parry (1824) thought he would test the capacity of an adolescent Eskimo ; the food was weighed and, apart from fluids, he ate in 20 h 8-1/2 lb. meat and 1-3/4 lb. bread <strong>(about 15,700 Cal.)</strong> and ' did not consider the quantity extraordinary '.  But this is trivial compared with the feats of the Siberian Yakuti who eat 25-30 lb. meat daily, and there is no record approaching the 35 lb. of beef and 18 lb. of butter (providing about 112,000 Cal. and occupying a volume of the order of 5-1/2 gal.) alleged to have been eaten in less than 3 h by each of two Yakuti (Simpson, 1847.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>One wonders if the Yakuti had very deep pockets and somehow spoofed Simpson by stuffing them full of beef and butter when not being observed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all depends on what you are eating.  Different substances are absorbed at different rates so it is more about the source of the calories.  Sugar is easily broken down and absorbed so eating 10000 calories from sugar might be more completely absorbed than 10000 calories from something harder to break down like fiber.
In this case however I don't think it's as much about absorbing the nutrients as it is retaining them.  If we have too much of anything and our body is not able to convert in into adipose for storage as quickly as we take it in then we will expelled the unused portion.  So theoretically you would be able to store the excess nutrients from 1000 calories a day more easily thus having a larger overall impact on your weight.  That is the really simple answer though and there are a ton of other variables that can play a factor in that such as your overall health and metabolism as well as the composition of the meals you are eating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are only considering energy expenditure, maximum daily energy expenditure in humans is between 4 and 5 times BMR (basal metabolic rate) based off of research looking at Tour de France cyclists. The biomass accumulation question is a little harder to answer, but it also relates to BMR and is regulated by hormones, internal gut morphology, existing body composition that can signal for increased deposition of fat, glycogen stores, etc.</p>
<p>Examples of the extremes of energy assimilation in a natural system (i.e. not force feeding, no artificial manipulation of hormone levels) are shorebirds during migration. During migration several species have energy assimilation rates more than 7 times their BMR which translates in an ability to increase lean body mass by ~10-15% a day to recover from and fuel up for long migratory flights. Can you imagine if a 180 lb person could pack on 18+ lbs of mass...in a day?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
