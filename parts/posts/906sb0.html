		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The crack is not in Yellowstone, it's near Yellowstone. This is significant, because <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grte/learn/news/scientists-monitor-rock-buttress-and-conduct-risk-assessment.htm" target="_blank">it's in the Grand Tetons</a> an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_the_Grand_Teton_area" target="_blank">actively exhuming mountain range characterized by steep, rocky hillslopes</a>, where cracks like this are exceedingly common. A good analogue for this feature this are the <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/rockyplanet/2017/09/29/why-are-the-rockfalls-at-yosemite/" target="_blank">exfoliation joints that that lead to rockfalls in Yosemite</a>. I'm not sure of the rock type in the specific area of the crack (i.e. whether it is technically an exfoliation joint in a granitic rock like those that are common in Yosemite), but regardless of the exact rock type in this area, features like this are 1) common in steep, rocky landscapes, 2) develop overtime through a variety of surface weathering processes, e.g. <a href="https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/ks3/gsl/education/resources/rockcycle/page3562.html" target="_blank">freeze-thaw cycles</a> but can propagate rapidly (e.g. this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZ1V_DJKV8" target="_blank">video from Yosemite</a> of an exfoliation joint propagating somewhat violently in a few seconds) and 3) have nothing to do with the Yellowstone caldera.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If there were such a crack in the caldera, WHICH THERE IS NOT:</p>
<p>There are a lot of dissolved gasses in the magma just below the surface, much like dissolved CO2 in an unopened bottle of soda.  And in this analogy, the magma is always shaken, so it’s always ready to spew out everywhere.</p>
<p>The layer of cooled rock that covers the caldera is like the cap on the soda bottle.  Open it, even a little bit, and a bunch of gas will spew out, along with some magma (called lava when it comes out).  It’ll almost certainly tear the hole wider as it comes out, releasing more gas and lava.</p>
<p>When magma escapes, more magma pushes up to replace it, but the pressure right there is a little lower.  The bigger the hole gets, the faster the gas and lava come out, the pressure there drops even more, and the area of low-pressure magma expands.</p>
<p>If the pressure under the surface rock gets low enough to let the dissolved gas boil, then this snowball starts rolling downhill <em>really</em> fast, and it’s time to party like it’s the end of the world.  Because it is, more or less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
