<p>The first person to pick has a 1/10 (10%) chance to win. So he has a 9/10 (90%) chance to not win. That means that the second person to pick has a 9/10 (90%) chance to get his turn (which only happens if person 1 doesn't win), but if he gets his turn he has 1/9 (~11.11%) chance to win. That means his total chance to win is 9/10 * 1/9 = 1/10 (10%).</p>
<p>Person 3 only gets his turn if both 1 and 2 don't win. That means that the chance that he gets his turn is equal to 1 minus the chance that either player 1 or player 2 wins. That means: 1 - (1/10 + 1/10) = 8/10 (80%). At that point, he has a chance of 1/8 to pick the correct ball, so his total chance of winning is 8/10 * 1/8 = 1/10 (10%).</p>
<p>You can extend the same line of reasoning for the other players and find the same outcome, 10%, for each.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the probability of final result is the same regardless of what order you go in</p>
<p>however it's <em>feels</em> like the probabilities are different because <em>if</em> you reveal the outcomes as you go, the likelihood of someone now pulling out the red ball <em>given that</em> the last X were white <em>does</em> change as you go along</p>
<p>e.g. initial likelihood of anyone getting the red ball regardless of order = 10%</p>
<p>but say <em>given that</em> the first 8 people pulled out white, the 9th person to go now has a 50% chance of pulling red</p>
<p>if they pull white, the final person now has 100% chance of pulling red</p>
<p>however everyone had a 10% chance to start with regardless of order</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't matter. You can see this by calculating the probabilities as u/Rannasha did, or as follows: </p>
<p>Take one ball after another out of the bag without looking, and arrange the balls in a sequence in the order you picked them. The red ball will be one of the 10 balls in the sequence, and it can be the first, the second, the third, etc. or the tenth ball, all with equal likelihood. The reason: all you did was to create a random sequence of the 10 balls, with all sequences equally likely. (The sequences are equally likely for symmetry reasons: no sequence is &quot;better&quot; than any other.)</p>
<p>Now you translate this to your original game: each of the ten people is equally likely to end up with the red ball.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If all ten are pulled at once, everyone has equal odds. If all ten are pulled in sequence, but all are revealed after the last ball is pulled, everyone has equal odds. </p>
<p>If they are pulled in sequence and revealed immediately after each ball is pulled, <em>but nobody can take any actions that modify the game based on the revealed information</em>, then everyone still has equal overall odds of winning, but the instantaneous odds fluctuate over the course of the game:  say you are fourth in line.  First and second balls are pulled and are revealed to be white.  You now know that there is a 1/8 probability your ball is red. Third person pulls red. Now you have a 0 probability of pulling red.</p>
<p>Interesting things happen when the balls are pulled in sequence, revealed immediately, <em>and you can take action based on that information</em>.
In such a setup, if you have the option to choose to remain in the game or not (and perhaps increase an initial wager) it can be advantageous to go later in line. I'd have to sit down with paper and pencil to figure out of you would be better off going last or somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>Look up the &quot;Monty Hall Problem&quot; for an  interesting and not immediately intuitive application (though not quite the same problem, it is petty fascinating. )</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another way to see that it doesn't matter, is that if you numbered the balls 1 to 10, you would effectively be choosing a random permutation between you. From here you can see it's symmetric and hence each person has the same odds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
