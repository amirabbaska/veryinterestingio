</blockquote>
<p>Hitting one's self can be a form of stimming (self-stimulatory behavior), but there are many other ways to stim. These include hand flapping, rocking back and forth, various head movements, jumping up and down, etc. Sensory processing, or how we receive and respond to messages from our senses, is difficult for many people with autism, so self-stimulatory behaviors are a way to cope. Some people describe it as something else to feel or think about, and remember it's an automatic behavior seen in people as young as toddlers. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hitting the head is a common form of self-injurious behavior, but hitting other body parts, slapping walls or the ground, etc. are other forms of self-injurious behavior that people with autism and other special needs may engage in. There's also bitting one's self, which another person commented about, pulling ears, pinching, scratching, etc. I think head banging gets a LOT of notice because it is particularly overt and can be scary for the people around the person. </p>
<p>Self-injurious behavior MAY or MAY NOT be self-stimulatory. They <strong>almost always</strong> begin that way, but they may <em>develop varied functions over time</em>. For example, a child with autism engages in self-injurious behavior as a form of sensory stimulation, a way to cope with other sensory issues or internal events like emotions. This behavior may then get them access to tangibles, like a favorite snack or a desired toy or to go outside to play in order to calm down. Over time, the behavior might be engaged in for sensory stimulation OR for access to items or activities. Another example is attention. This behavior understandably gets a lot of attention. It's up to the people around the child to keep the child safe. However, the child may begin to engage in self-injurious behavior for attention. I've personally seen both of these happen. It's up to a trained behavior professional like a school psychologist or a Board Certified Behavior Analyst to tease apart the functions of the behavior and for classroom and care staff to follow through on procedures to reduce the number of times the student or client engages in the behavior. </p>
<p>Good question! Thanks for asking it. </p>

<p>Also, it's a damn good read in my humble opinion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a different self-harm than you find in non-autism</p>
<p>Hitting head (stimming) is due to sensory overload. People without autism also sometimes experience it: if you stub your toe you will rub it for example (feeling of pain gets reduced because its covered by other sensation in same area). Or if you eat really hot food you may feel the urge to stand up and walk around so your bodily focus gets placed someplace else. That is sort of what happens with autism: too much sensory stuff going on, so by actively hurting themselves the focus gets reshifted to the pain (it sort of &quot;drowns out&quot; the rest a bit, not exactly, but sort of).</p>
<p>Self-harm as a consequence of for example extreme depression or helplessness (like we find with borderline, common example for self-harm) is similar but also different. It is more characterized by severely high stress levels, and the self-harm (e.g. cutting) actually physiologically reduces these levels. So it is more emotion based and less sensory like in autism usually is.</p>
<p>But then to get back to your question, why some of the engage in head-banging specifically; I don't really know. I can imagine because the sensory overload happens literally in the head (sounds, sights, smell) banging the head becomes the intuitive focus point. But that's speculation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a six year old with infantile autism. From what I can understand by watching what leads up to these incidents and what I have been taught by the parent classes offered by the hospital is that it is an escape from a situation that he is incapable of dealing with. The pain from damaging himself is the only thing he can think of that can divert his frustration away from the situation. There literally is no getting away from it. He knows he can't hit his brothers or sisters so he hit himself and screams. It must be awful being so incapable of dealing with a situation that everyone else masters perfectly, that you have to inflict physical pain to yourself to stop the frustration from &quot;exploding my brain&quot; as he says. </p>
<p>I've become quite good at reading him that I can get to him before he starts loosing it most of the times, and I ask him if he wants to wrestle it out of him. So we wrestle, and he gets the frustration out if his body by wrestling me instead of hurting himself. </p>
<p>This is my personal observation with my son. It differs from person to person. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a board certified behavior analyst (BCBA) and an educational psychologist. I'm also the clinical director for an agency that specializes in behavioral therapy for autism and developmental disabilities (ABA therapy). </p>
<p>Self injury can occur for a variety of reasons. But the simplest explanation is that it's learned. Very early on in the development of a child (think infant) self stimulatory behavior is common. Babies often hand flap, move their arms and hands around, etc. for most kids, this goes away through the normal course of brain development. However for kiddos with autism, that development is impaired. They keep doing it despite the negative social effects it has. </p>
<p>In many cases, early infantile self-stimulatory behavior morphs into something else. Imagine a baby flapping their hands around. That's common. Parents will generally ignore that. But if the baby ever makes contact with their head while flapping around, parents will step in and stop them and say &quot; uh oh don't hit your head&quot; or something similar. Repeat this pattern over multiple trials and you can see how the child may learn that this always gets attention. And it continues from there. When they want attention they hit their head. </p>
<p>In another example, the infant doesn't learn how to soothe independently or using other means. They aren't calmed by hugs from a caregiver and they don't respond to social soothing. So the only thing that works is flapping. Let's digress to an analogy... suppose you have anxiety and deep breathing works for you. When you're mildly anxious small breaths might help. When you're entirely overwhelmed it takes more concerted effort, deeper breaths etc. the same holds true for self injury. Head hitting works in high anxiety situations. It distracts from the excessive input (anxiety) and calms the person down. </p>
<p>In short there are myriad reasons for self injury and head banging. Sometimes it's self soothing (stimming) sometimes it's attention, sometimes it's something else entirely (like escape from something aversive or access to something they want). But it's always for a reason. And that makes it treatable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
