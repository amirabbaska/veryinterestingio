		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because this phenomenon is caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure and oxygenated blood is not reaching your brain, so you kinda loose a little bit of all functioning including muscle control. Vision, speech, and hearing. </p>

<p>Vasovagal Syncope is more common than I ever thought and I noticed the muffled sounds often too. After lots of testing they found that I pass out on a &quot;tilt table test&quot;. Basically, if I stand too quickly I'm prone to the drop in blood pressure (which causes muffled sounds and fainting occasionally).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anyone else here have issues with muscular vasovagal triggers? I'll get presyncope just from tilting my head down, stretching my back, or sitting on a chair with lumbar support. No doctor seems to know what to do with me. Also orthostatic issues in general, but the reflex syncope is the hardest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your blood vessels are pipes filled with fluid, like a rain stick. When you’re sitting, it’s like the rain stick is on its side. When you stand up, you’re suddenly turning the rain stick on its end, and all the blood rushes to the floor (away from your brain, which makes you feel dizzy and muffled). Your blood vessels are supposed to tighten up while you’re standing so that you don’t feel dizzy/muffled, but for a variety of reasons, some people’s vessels are a little slower to tighten up. It’s called Orthostatic Hypotension</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone mentioned orthostatic hypertension above but I suffer from this due to exact opposite ie a drop in blood pressure related to vasovagal syncope (and something I deal with due to naturally low blood pressure). I don’t always pass out but I get a head rush, vision fades to purple and my hearing fades. </p>
