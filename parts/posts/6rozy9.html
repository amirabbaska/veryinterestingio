		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Living in British Columbia and with the current wildfires that are going on, does the smoke somewhat cool the area? On Wednesday and Thursday, the forecast predicted the temperature to be nearly 100F but felt like mid-high 80s instead. Where I live is currently engulfed from the smoke. Does this cool the earth by reflecting the heat rays back into the atmosphere/space?</p></div></div>

<p><a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/weather/why-so-much-smoke-from-b-c-fires-natures-air-conditioning-is-broken-weather-service-says/" target="_blank">http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/weather/why-so-much-smoke-from-b-c-fires-natures-air-conditioning-is-broken-weather-service-says/</a></p>
<p>Long answer...</p>
<p>From the article: &quot;The layer of smoke acts like a sunshine shield, which happens to be deploying at the beginning of Washington state’s intense heat wave&quot;....</p>
<p>Here’s how the phenomenon works, according to the National Weather Service’s Seattle office:</p>
<p>The smoke’s particulate matter refracts some of the sun’s rays, radiating them back out into the atmosphere (think of light through a prism), said weather-service meteorologist Ted Buehner.</p>
<p>But those same particles are creating a barrier between land and sun, slightly lowering the predicted high for Wednesday, from 97 to 95 degrees.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, here in Bellingham if certainly felt colder than it normally would. It was kind of surreal with the haze creating a perpetual sunset. Much of the expected record temperatures around Seattle ended up being ~5 degrees cooler Thursday thanks to the fires.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Smoke is uncombusted fuel composed of 3 particles; solids (ash), vapour and gas. While suspended in the atmosphere, the particles will reflect light cast through it from the sun. </p>
<p>Imagine being in a smoke filled building and trying to shine a flashlight through it. Or noticing all the dust in a room when a sunbeam shines through your window.</p>
<p>Q&amp;A: Why do light rays show up in smoke?</p>
