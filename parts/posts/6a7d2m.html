<blockquote>
<p>From thread with the same title</p>
<p>It is due to what is known as &quot;stress induced crystallization&quot;. As mentioned before, many polymers are semi-crystalline, containing both crystalline and amorphous (non-ordered, think spaghetti) regions. When the crystalline region size is on the order of the wavelength of light, it can scatter light making the plastic opaque. For polymers that are entirely amorphous, you have no crystalline regions and thus the polymers are transparent. As I mentioned above, you can think of the amorphous regions as something similar to spaghetti, a messed of tangled polymer chains. When you bend the plastic (i.e. stress), you are forcing those polymer chains to align in the axis of strain, inducing crystallization in that region, which can then scatter light and turn the plastic opaque or white.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plastic isn't just plastic. It can be in different microscopic shapes. Just like how sugar can be a crystal or dissolved and invisible, or caramel, or rock candy, etc. When you bend the plastic you're changing the structure of the plastic on a microscopic level and that structure change affects the color. There is no simple explanation that explains the actual effect at a 5 year old's reading level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume a lot of these people are correct about crystal whatevers. I think that with certain plastics that are bendable, you can open tiny openings in the plastic to reveal the color inside but thats completely up to the material used. I'm talking about very cheap plastic, especially when it's old and easier to bend like it's a piece of taffy. You'll get that same color if you were to cut the plastic, and that is simply the color of the plastic before it was painted or colored. For clear plastics I have no idea. Probably a structural reaction to stress. Like when you break glass and it turns white.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the turning white is because plastic is made up of a lot of tiny strings stuck together, normally these strings are randomly aligned to each other. If plastic is this way, it is actually transparent, the colour comes from other coloured stuff which is mixed in the plastic. The bending causes the strings to stretch a bit, and since they are all stretched in the same direction, the plastic will now turn from transparent to white. Since the colour stuff is inside the plastic, you will not see the colour anymore through the whiteness of the plastic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This also happens in amorphous (non-crystalline) through a process called crazing.  Basically, it is a series of microcracks that cannot be felt or seen but affect how the light is scattered.  These can actually toughen the material until they combine together to form larger cracks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
