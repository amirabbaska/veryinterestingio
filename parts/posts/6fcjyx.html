		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: Since this comment has gotten so much attention, I want to start off by saying: There's no one group of Boomers to blame. Some came out successful, others are just as screwed as many young people today. It would be wrong to generalize a whole generation. So keep that in mind. </p>
<p>It depends a bit on the country, but there are usually some common factors that seem to correlate across the western world. Some of the points below will obviously only apply for Norway, or countries which followed similar policies, but other reasons have been pretty much universal. So YMMV. </p>
<p>Here in Norway, the country was a mess after the war. Northern parts had been burnt down, as the Nazis were pulling out, and everything was pretty much in shambles. The gov. countered this with house ownership / building programs, and even started a bank, literally translated to &quot;house bank&quot;. The goal was that everyone should be able to own a house. </p>
<p>One way to do that, was to build cheap and fast. As the Boomers became adults, in the mid 60's / early 70's, the could afford to buy either used homes, or build new ones. Sure, the interest rates were high, and people ended up paying for their homes a long time...but they COULD do so on a &quot;normal&quot; salary. They could get work straight out of Jr. HS at age 16, and be home owners by they were in their early 20's. </p>
<p>By the time the Boomers were in their 30's, most owned homes, and were midways on paying it down. We're now in the late 70's. </p>
<p>Fast forward to the 80's...Boomers are now in their 40's, mortgage free, and are looking into new ways of investing their money. Before that, everything was heavily regulated. The Financial markets, the real estate market (at least in Norway). Privatization also spurs up. </p>
<p>What used to be subsidized, was now private. Private Banks could finally earn big bucks on handing out loans, and people could flip houses at whatever prices they wanted, people could take out loans/re-mortgaging against their homes. All this, mixed in with high consumption, led people to take out gigantic loans, a building housing bubble, and a subsequent crash. </p>
<p>From then (early/mid 90's), real estate prices have gone up much faster than salaries have, with exception of a small speed-bump around 07-09. Boomers have been able to take out new loans on their first house, and then buy house number 2, 3.  </p>
<p>Some have been able to sell their old houses with huge profits, and buy stuff that they'd never been able to, with the respect to their incomes. Many will buy their kids their first home, or at least help them, by simply re-mortgaging their house. No unprivileged kid can compete against that. </p>
<p>Another important fact is that many boomers petitioned a lot to get various zoning laws and codes in place, that makes building new housing more difficult. You have codes that prohibits new housing, if it destroys view / sunlight / aesthetics / etc. the neighbors. In many places, this makes it practically impossible to build taller buildings. If housing developers send in applications for a modern block building, you can bet they'll get stonewalled by 20 neighbors, with zoning codes on their side. </p>
<p>So, if you ask a 20'something - 40'something around here, why Boomers ruined the housing market, they'll probably say: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They reap the benefits of a <del>solid social-program</del> re-building (economic) program as young, which they then discard/change as they get older </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They vote for laws which benefit and encourage hoarding houses </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They vote for laws and regulations which make it almost impossible to build new houses at a reasonable price, which in turn keeps their home prices high.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They take out huge loans for consumption, and try to earn back the money by jacking up rents on their house number 1,2,3, etc. </p>
</li>
<li>They drive up prices to artificially high levels, because their (then cheap) assets are now worth millions. </li>
</ul>
<p>It's a long and complicated story. </p>
<p>edit: spelling </p>
<p>edit 2: </p>
<p><strong>Slightly shorter TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>Boomers here grew up in a time with good social programs, which would guarantee most homeownership, if they just worked hard and paid their bills. When they got old, they privatized and deregulated those programs, all while making it more expensive to build new homes. </p>
<p>Many boomers saw huge profits in home ownership, and started hoarding homes. Buying home nr. 2,3,and so on, and renting them out. When private consumption caught up, they'd just jack up rents and such. When it came to the point that young people were REALLY struggling to buy homes, they stepped in and re-mortgaged their home, or became trustees, so that these privileged kids could put in MUCH higher bids than they could before. </p>
<p>Suddenly every other 21-22 year old graduates are bidding 25%-50% higher than ask, because their parents home from 1974 is worth a million bucks. </p>
<p>Then they have the nerve to call those left out for &quot;lazy&quot;,&quot;entitled&quot;, etc., and saying that homeownership is not some kind of human right, even though they themselves were helped some 40 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>But with that said, it's a very, very complex topic. They are not the ONLY reason things are expensive...very many places, all around the world, bureaucracy has made it very expensive and time consuming to build anything new. You could of course ask yourself, who came up with that system? Why did they make it so incredibly difficult to build new houses, in the various areas?</strong></p>
<p>As for US vs EU difference: I think that in the late 80s / early 90s, US and the Western World got &quot;synchronized&quot; on real estate market. Global debt is more tied up together, so that one crash is not only contained to a single country anymore. </p>
<p>The US were (domestically) untouched by the war, and emerged as a world leader in production and manufacturing, which led way to great wealth among regular workers in the 50's and 60's. EU countries were heavily subsidized in that same period, to build up countries. </p>
<p>With Regan and Thatcher leading the way, many western countries seemed to agree on many economic policies during the 80's, which later led to lower interest rates, and thus more debt to the people. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This little rant is Australia-centric, but... This is what happens when a generation's only economic plan is to borrow from the future. </p>
<p>Our largest, oldest generation has enjoyed a political majority for decades. And with that majority they have enjoyed an unprecedented boom and a record period of prosperity. They have extended their prosperity and comfort by rigging policy in their sole favour, bolstering home investment and - wherever cutbacks have been required - relentlessly targeting families and youth, lest we engage in the travesty of upsetting anyone's comfortable retirement.</p>
<p>So zealous has been this generation's avoidance of shouldering absolutely any personal economic pain whatsoever, we have clung to many dangerous policies in spite of decades of warnings (you know how we've been hearing about the crash for years? Yeah, we've also been doing NOTHING to prevent it for years). We've fed the world's most obvious property bubble, baulking at the very suggestion of allowing house prices to ever fall - even a little. At our last election the suggestion prices might drop 2% was met with such a wave of collective Boomer hysteria we were forced to throw the country under the bus yet again. Won't somebody please think of the portfolios!</p>
<p>And so, we continued building and building our idiotic debt pile. Our elders helpfully explained the problem wasn't them or their selfish, myopic, harmful policy deck-stacking, oh goodness no. It was young people - buying iphones and lattes and avocados. Apparently the young invented consumerism in this fantasy, and of course reality is not admitted into the delusion. We've ignored the fact spending on retail, entertainment and domestic tourism has ground to a halt in younger demographics - which are both spending and earning less than past generations. Lost to debate is the fact that without spending, economies also stall. These inconvenient truths aren't welcome as long as house prices keep rising.</p>
<p>Unfortunately - and this is the issue eclipsing all others, there's a rather fucking important problem with debt: it is consumption brought forward. Without sufficient consumption, the debt pile our aging population sits on is going to drown us. And where does ongoing consumption come from? Taxpayers with fucking jobs. Taxpayers able to afford a basic home to live in. Taxpayers able to gain a semblance of financial stability.</p>
<p>If you want to end the property bubble and return this country to a fair playing field (and if we have any hope of restoring economic stability and surviving an aging population this must happen) here's what you need to do. Stop playing their fucking game. Stop telling yourself the Boomers ruined the housing market: yeah they kinda did, but economic reality will bite them right in the &quot;on paper millions&quot; sooner or later (houses, after all, are only worth what people will pay for them). Stop worrying house prices will remain in a never-ending upward spiral in the complete absence of wage growth. Stop fearing the horde of investors (primarily Boomers and foreign nationals) snapping up properties aren't going to hit the wall of reality. Stop engaging in the very fear of missing out that keeps you chained to a bandwagon careering towards a cliff. Sit back, make yourself a smashed avo sandwich, and call bullshit on the bubble. That is your best weapon. (Let's face it, your only weapon.)</p>
<p>This bubble is already on life support. Rates are rising, negative sentiment is rising (the media - which just a year or two ago denied a bubble even existed, has gone crash mad), income growth is at a record low and cities are entering oversupply. Yes some investors (mostly Boomer investors, by the way - and on the brink of retirement) are still buying, but who are they going to sell to? Other investors? And who are <em>they</em> going to sell to? A ponzi scheme cannot survive when only investors are buying, and when the median buyer is priced out. It is mathematically impossible for the sheer volume of investment properties in this country to be continually onsold for profit in a market now absolutely flooded with supply in which ordinary home buyers can't get a look in (and with the banks tightening lending, probably couldn't buy if they wanted to). </p>
<p>Speculators bet on the direction of prices, and prices (though they can rise irrationally) are still tethered to market fundamentals like incomes (not growing in Australia), physical housing supply (notice a few hundred fucking cranes and apartments in your city lately? Who's going to buy these now banks won't lend to foreign investors and values are falling?), rental yields (record lows), population growth rates (diving)... fundamentals and sentiment have de-coupled but fundamentals represent the true picture of market demand. Fundamentals are reality. We will be returning to that reality the second our positive feedback of manic sentiment turns into a self-feeding snowball of negativity (which, arguably, is already happening). Sentiment is the only pin that matters in a bubble we are waist deep in dead sentiment canaries here in Australia.</p>
<p>So keep calm and call bullshit. The trouble with bubbles is there is an inescapable point where everyone realises value is a mirage. A point where people realise tulips are just shitty fucking flowers. A point where our Boomers will come to understand houses are four walls and not million-dollar ATMs - that capital gains only happen for as long as our dwindling pool of buyers are both willing and able to pay more. A point where our Boomers will realise that if all owners become investors, you have nothing going on but one giant ridiculous circle-jerk. Due to oversupply, the investors in this country are basically borrowing millions to a play game of musical chairs in a room with more chairs than people. Oh, and the chairs are all negatively geared, so without capital gains are <em>making an annual loss</em>. Many on interest-only finance too, our very own impending little sub-prime crisis.</p>
<p>We will reach a point soon where our underemployed youth, starved of financial security, saddled with the debts and excess of our idiot forefathers, and living on a dying planet, will become the voting majority. </p>
<p>The youth will remember (especially when we're considering whether our insanely generous Boomer-drafted pension scheme is going to work...) </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Zoning is the enemy of millennials, and they just don't realize it yet.  </p>
<p>In Australia, there is an enormous housing bubble, because when demand started to outstrip supply (in the mid-90's), baby boomers who owned houses in the inner city blocked any higher density development.  Australia has large Asian migration, who tend to like higher density walkable living, matched with an emerging millennial market who like the same.  </p>
<p>A decade of under development built up a runaway housing bubble.  By the mid 2000's the government realized how much they had screwed up (or new development got so lucrative the developers were able to buy them off), and apartment building took off.  </p>
<p>By this stage, it was too late.  The average person believed that owning real estate makes you rich, and development has still not dampened demand a decade later (just created a lot of empty apartments for investment purposes).  </p>
<p>In the US, cities have significantly higher taxes on multi-unit development (that millennials want), vs suburban sprawl.  They label these taxes &quot;Affordable Housing Ordinances&quot;, ie the money goes towards affordable housing.  In some cities, a developer of new apartments must pay up to 20% towards affordable housing funds.  Developers of suburban houses have no such tax.  This is because boomers (often running local government) like houses on the fringe of cities, and millennials who don't have a lot of political power yet like walkable communities.  </p>
<p>This led to only ultra luxury multi-unit developments being viable with the additional taxes.  So wealthier millennials are doing fine, but middle class millennials get squeezed by housing.  </p>
<p>Then you have cities in the US like Chicago which is completely broken by zoning, in order to enrich local politicians.  If a developer wants to build something outside the zoning, they need the alderman (local politician) to personally approve it.  Aldermen down-zoned almost the entire city to single family homes, even complete neighborhoods currently full of 3 flat and 4 flat buildings.  This means the current structure would be illegal to be built today, and developers cannot build new structures without the alderman personal approval (ie contributing to alderman funds / lobbying).  This benefits baby boomers who already owned real estate, and disadvantages millennials yet to enter the market by restricting supply.   </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The responses here are all very similar. No one has really raised the wages side of things. </p>
<p>Back when boomers were contemplating a house, the typical house cost 4x gross salary (obviously depending on which country, city etc). So to get a responsible 20% deposit, you needed to save 25% of your income for just short of a year. </p>
<p>Interest rates were high, but the servicing costs were relatively low - the loan amount was 80% of 4 years salary. </p>
<p>After things like the 87 stock crash, when interest rates started to decrease, housing was touted as a great investment. It was bricks and mortar, the price didn't fluctuate daily and it certainly didn't show that it went down 8% one week and up 9% the next like the sharemarket can. </p>
<p>Boomers drew equity from their homes which had steadily increased in value to buy investment properties, which in turn increased their prices and so forth. </p>
<p>To the point where it's a massive issue now - and in some places (Sydney Melbourne and Auckland in my corner of the world) the price to wage ratio is closer to 12x. Referring the the original premise that you need a comfortable 20% deposit, that's saving 25% of your income for just over 10 years. That's scary in itself, but property prices are increasing faster than inflation and wages. So you need to save faster than 25% to make any progress. And more than 40% of city dwellers in Australia are in rental stress - i.e. Paying more than 30% of their income on rent. So it begs the question - if you pay 25% average tax, 30% rent and are supposed to save more than 25% for 10+ years - how the hell is it supposed to happen?</p>
<p>Boomers ruined the housing market - but they also fucked the job market. </p>
<p>And don't even get me started on how 22 year old graduate from university with a mortgage already - they didn't have to pay for theirs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the United States, at least, they got to buy into the housing market after WWII when it was dirt cheap, even adjusted for inflation, to homestead in any places one would want to.  They also had the benefit of many American cities being left for dead due to various socio-economic factors that drove everyone to the suburbs, so they could hold properties there for peanuts as well. </p>
<p>Now decades have gone past and that property that was bought for around 100K (adjusted) back in 1972 is now worth 800K and if a young person wants to homestead the math doesn't work.  Set aside the fact that any middle income person is going to be subjecting an intolerable percentage of their income just to housing, they're not going to get 4 million dollars for that house in 30 years barring some sort of bizarro hyperinflation scenario that pushes the average salary for a middle class person to several hundred thousand dollars a year...while simultaneously keeping everyone employed.</p>
<p>This means, effectively, that most people raised in a working middle to full middle class household cannot reasonably follow the 'guidebook' on proper middle class living (e.g...get an education, buy a house and homestead, raise a family..) without lucking into a high paying position.  Boomers straight didn't have to rely on that luck nearly as much to fulfill the American dream.  Oh and the labor market is in a state of perpetual downward pricing pressure to boot due to the inherent operation of capitalism.</p>
<p>Now, all of this would be what it is and just lamentable...but Boomers never shut the f*ck up about how young people 'just aren't working hard enough.'  Which is complete garbage.  They've basically deluded themselves into believing that the time they lived in, when there was enough inefficient slack in the system and prices were low enough so that they could get paid and didn't have to get lucky, is how things actually are..not just how they happened to be when they were in that time of their lives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
