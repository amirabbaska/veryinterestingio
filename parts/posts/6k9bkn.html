Would the electricity just fizzle out after a certain distance or would it keep traveling until it hit an insulator?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The current density definitely decreases with distance. Because lightning is such a brief event (about 70uS for the main strike), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect" target="_blank">skin effect</a> has significant influence on the distribution of the current. The skin effect is the tendency of rapidly changing current to be concentrated near the surface of a conductor. There will be far more current 10M away horizontally away from the strike than 10M vertically. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I tried explaining this to the 10 year olds in my class. The best example I could think of is: imagine a bath full of water. A single drop of ribena/cordial is the lightening strike. Where it first hits, it is concentrated so anything within range of it during the initial hit would be affected. However, just like the drop of ribena in a tub of water, the electrical current dissipates outwards until it is too weak and is quickly neutralised.  A simple explanation, but it helped the kids visual it!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That reminds me of the <a href="http://www.tri-statemarine.com/uncategorized/electric-shock-drowning/" target="_blank">risk of electrocution in harbors</a> due to improper wiring on boats/docks. While at the dock, most boats are plugged into shoreline power to keep batteries topped up that serve the bilge pumps. I'm not aware of any states that require non-commercial boat wiring to be inspected. Miswired boats can leak current into the water which can cause the muscles to seize and the person stop breathing. Harbor electrocutions are more of a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terry-gardner/esd-hidden-danger-in-fres_b_693454.html" target="_blank">problem in freshwater harbors</a> as humans are better conductors than the freshwater. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lightning is nothing more than an imbalanced electrical charge balancing out.  It is dramatic in the air because air is such a poor conductor that the charge must build up to titanic levels to force open a channel.  The ocean (as a whole) is a very good conductor, so the charge will dissipate in a very non-dramatic fashion, with the intensity of the current dropping off with the <del>square</del> cube of the distance from the strike point, until all the energy has been absorbed.  Since water has a tremendous capacity to absorb energy, and since saltwater has a high ability to pass current, it doesn't take much volume to neutralize the charge.</p>
<p>Still, anything within a dozen meters or so of the strike point is in for a rough ride.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Point of order, pure water is an insulator of electricity because the autoionization of water does not provide enough charge density to allow for electrons to flow freely. </p>
<p>Anytime an ionic compound is dissolved in water, the ionic compound will provide enough charge density to allow the flow of electrons.  Thus conducting electricity. </p>
<p>Note that ionic compounds means acids, bases, and salts.......covalent compounds (like sugar and most organic compounds) dissolved in water will not conduct electricity either </p>
<p>I do have a side question , how does a lightening strike change the temperature of the water it strikes?  Is there a plume of water vapor? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
