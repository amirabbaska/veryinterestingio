		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a condition called gustatory rhinitis, in which people sneeze, have a watery nose, or get congested after eating, Any food can trigger symptoms, though the most severe reaction is apparently caused by hot, spicy foods and alcohol. We often joke they come in waves of a prime number, such as 13, 17 or 19.</p>
<p>Others struggle with allergic rhinitis, a fancy pants word for hay fever. If an allergen is up in your business, you have to get it out. Depending upon body sensitivity, that could take one....or nineteen sneezes.</p>
<p>TLDR It's a function of time place and body: if you are hypersensitive and out in a field during pollen season, let the games begin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a doctor, but I come from a family with a history of sinus problems. I for instance have a deviated septum. My sister does not, but every morning she sneezes about 5-10 times in succession. It's most likely in her case an issue of mucus removal/loosening it all up for later removal. That and congenital sinus issues that cause the sneezing fit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
