		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the problem here is that efficiency has a specific meaning in thermodynamics and the OP is not using it in thst context. I think he is simply observing that the heat normally regarded as waste heat is actually useful in heating the room. This has nothing to do with the devices efficiency. It just good use of a waste product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a lot of places, heating with gas (by furnace) is cheaper than heating electrically, so it might not be perfectly efficient from a cost perspective.</p>
<p>Also, a lot of work goes into designing a heating system for a home so that heat is distributed somewhat evenly. Heat coming from appliances probably isn't going to be as evenly dissipated. To give an extreme example, having one source of heat in a corner of your home will require more energy to maintain your home's climate than having a whole system of ducts which aim to evenly heat your home, because an uneven climate loses more heat to the outside environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd say: yes.</p>
<p>If you define efficiency by the fraction of energy that does what you consider to be useful work, then I'd say it's 100% efficient.</p>
<p>However, 100% efficiency might be nothing to brag about.</p>
<p>A heat pump can have an &quot;efficiency&quot; of around 400%. That is: you end up getting 4x as much energy pumped into your home as is used by the heat pump.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can lose energy acoustically as well as thermally.  An appliance that makes noise is wasting some energy.  Even without that, your question wants to take the whole house as a system to claim total efficiency for the appliances, but then not take into account that the thermal efficiency of the house itself is going to count in the total.  I don't think it is a fair way to tally the efficiencies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If their design was to produce heat, then yes (or very almost*), and in this case they could be (very almost*) perfectly efficient in every season. Appliances besides heaters, however, don't become perfectly efficient just because a major by-product of their operation is now considered useful (as that lost heat energy is energy that could have been used to, for example, spin the blender's blades a little faster).</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4d6k57/can_we_say_that_the_efficiency_of_an_heating/" target="_blank">Can we say that the efficiency of an heating device (in term of energy converted) is 100%?</a> for a discussion on the efficiency of heaters, for which heat loss does not decrease efficiency.</p>
<p>*Energy can be lost to phenomena besides heat, e.g. thermal radiation at frequencies besides infrared (heat), the emitting of sound etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
