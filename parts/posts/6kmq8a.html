		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surfaces that look and feel smooth to the naked eye &amp; touch actually still have uneven, rough imperfections at the molecular level. Friction happens because of the way those imperfections collide when two surfaces push up against each other. The force required to overcome that friction depends on the material; smoother surfaces have less imperfections, so they have less friction. Theoretically, if there was a material that was completely smooth at the molecular level, it's friction coefficient would be zero (no friction).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question! The true answer is: &quot;Nobody knows.&quot;</p>
<p>When friction happens, there can be chemical transofmations, extreme local heating, electrification, plasma discharges (google &quot;triboplasma&quot;), all kinds of weird fluid dynamics, phase transformations, etc. Furthermore, these are usually not &quot;equilibrium processes&quot;: there are strong spatial gradients, and everything changes in time quite fast. Figuring all this out is further complicated by the fact that most of this happens on small scale (from nanometers to microns). All of it is hidden from naked eye by small scale and short duration of these processes.</p>
<p>The keywords you might want to check out in Google Scholar are: nanotribology, tribochemistry, friction multiphysics. </p>
<p>By the way, for similar reasons, there is no microscopic theory of how polishing works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The negatively-charged electrons do repel each other. However, the electromagnetic force scales weakly with distance (relative to some other fundamental forces), which means that even far away from each other, two electric charges will still interact with each other.</p>
<p>Put most simply, the electrons in one molecule can be attracted to the nuclei in a different molecule--not necessarily enough for the two molecules to form a chemical bond and become a single new molecule, but enough that the energy of the system is lower if they are closer together. (Remember, all systems are trying to move to the lowest energy possible.)</p>
<p>The ways in which electrons and nuclei can become pretty complicated, and so you get all sorts of differently behaving interactions that can lead to friction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here talking about surface roughness and Van der Waals forces is missing something important, where does the energy go?</p>
<p>If an atom from one surface &quot;bumps&quot; into an atom from the second surface it will &quot;bump&quot; the atom behind it, and that one &quot;bumps&quot; the atom behind it and so on...  A sound wave is generated.  All those sound waves from all those irregularities bumping into each other interact with each other to random vibrations which we perceive as heat.</p>
<p>That's what friction is at a molecular level. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
