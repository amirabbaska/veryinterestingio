		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's part of an agreed treaty from the Hauge convention </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Contracting Powers recognize that hostilities between themselves must not commence without previous and explicit warning, in the form either of a reasoned declaration of war or of an ultimatum with conditional declaration of war.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And was adopted by the United Nations after its founding.
It serves multiple purposes</p>
<p>1) All native and allied citizens are being informed to leave the country</p>
<p>2) It informs citizens of said country, thus limiting loss of civilian life</p>
<p>3) It informs allied and neighboring countries what is commencing so they can either not get caught in the cross fire or join in if they have an agreement with one of the nations</p>
<p>4) Is considered morally right in many eyes, the goal of most modern wars isn't the decimation of a country, but a specific action or actions. A formal declaration of war would include a list of demands, with the hope being a coup will take place to meet those demands. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you would be able to take much more advantage if you can organize a surprise attack. But this is a hard thing to do with a big army group as the movements will be spotted long in advance. Most wars do not just suddenly start one day. It is usually a result of escalation of a conflict. The best result for all countries is if their conflicts can get resolved before it escalates to war. So the last step before invasion is usually a threat of war or even a direct declaration in the hopes that the country will yield to the demands before the war even starts. It is also a declaration to other nations that you currently consider the other country an enemy which does have some implications for trade and diplomacy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You declare war so that your citizens in said country has some time to gtfo out of there and vice versa. Had you made an unprovoked attack, your citizens will be in enemy territory. </p>
<p>Thoses people have familys in your country who wouldn't look too kindly on you when trying to rally support for the war.</p>
<p>With that said, if it's a country that your citizens don't really have a present there, no one really does it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most nations in the modern world do not actually declare war before attacking.</p>
<p>Declaring war is generally something you'd want to do if you want the other guy to capitulate or surrender rather than fight back, or you want allies and local industry to be aware you are about to engage in a military conflict and to recalibrate themselves appropriately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my understand very few wars are initiated by someone declaring war. </p>
<p>More commonly the declaration is after the fact</p>
<p>ie by the victim, ''You attacked me? I declare war!&quot; </p>
<p>or an Allied nation. &quot;'i intended to join this war&quot;</p>
<p>Even in the case of someone declaring war and then attacking, the truth is they were likely preparing for this war for a while, moving troops around etc. So they are likely to declare war minutes before the first bombs land, and that much notice is not really going to help too much. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
