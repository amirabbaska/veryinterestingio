I don't see why we wouldn't use grey water (is that the right term?). We tend to not drink from our toilets, and the water is only used to remove waste. Please explain. Thank you.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our potable water supply is one thing I think we take for granted in North America. Using gray water would be waay better of course.
You CAN get toilets that are specifically designed to use gray water, or some toilets that have the sink right <em>over</em> the toilet for this purpose. Its just specialty bathroom ceramics (therefore $$$) and additional plumbing $$. </p>
<p>If we were to have a separate supply system to take say industrial gray water (industrial outflow, water from laundromats, storm sewers etc.) - which would be ridiculously expensive to put in - then you have to worry about where the water came from. Last thing you want is hazardous chemicals dumped accidentally at the soap plant to vent fumes through every toilet in town. So now you're into water testing and quality analysis and maybe pre-treatment... hey, we already have a water plant that does that. </p>
<p>Good idea in practice, essentially doubles your water supply infrastructure.</p>
<p>No, the only way to do this on a practical home level would be for you to collect your rainwater in a cistern with solar pumps to move it to a tank in your attic.  You'd still need to change the feed for your toilet and run new lines to each bathroom but its doable. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>About 10 years ago, I used to work in Business Development and Engineering for a district steam company.  We had 13 miles of supply piping, but the condensate was not returned back to the plant.  Most customers just sent that water down the drain.  However, I used to tell all of my customers that the water was clean and could be used for any non-potable use.</p>
<p>The main thing preventing usage was the piping costs.  However, in cases of new construction, I found that several clients took advantage of this &quot;free&quot; water.  One client pumped it to a holding tank on the roof and that was the primary source for toilets.  They had a valve on the domestic water line that would be engaged if the holding tank emptied out and for the summer when steam usage was generally non-existent.  I also had a few clients that used the water for power washing plaza areas or for water fountain make-up water.  </p>
<p>There was some code requirement that did not allow usage for irrigation, but that would have also been a good use of the condensate. However, I was dealing with a built up downtown area, so irrigation needs were minimal even if allowed.</p>
<p>On a related topic, a much higher percentage of clients used the condensate to pre-heat their domestic hot water since getting the energy out of the condensate can be easier than using the condensate water itself.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most efficient system I've been able to design takes waste water from showers &amp; sinks condensates, washer etc and drains to a small settling tank, bout 500 gallons. The overflow goes to an ejection pump system that pumps to a tank at a high point to gravity feed all the toilets. That tank requires overflow switches to tell the ejection pump to stop pumping when it is full at Wich point a bypass valve opens to pump into the sewer system. This whole thing is easily 5-8k on top of 7k system. Not to mention all code violations required to accommodate this....aaaand you've stopped reading by now because this is boring as shit.
At the end of the day all this extra juice and material negates any environmental benefit. Low flow toilets only use 1.2 gallons per flush. The sink in the tank is a good idea but it's illegal by universal plumbing code.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work on a small island where fresh water was limited. There <em>had</em> been saltwater supplied directly to the toilets, but maintenance was a big issue.The site was built before plastic plumbing was available. So the toilets were connected to fresh water. </p>
<p>Some years later, during a major rebuild, grey water flushing <em>was</em> considered, but was rejected due to complexity and maintenance issues. New low-flush toilets extended an improved fresh water supply.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water treatment is actually pretty cheap, whereas running another set of plumbing or having a built-in greywater system is more expensive.</p>
<p>There are places where the true cost of clean water is not really factored into the price (e.g. the desert southwest) and in some such places people are beginning to install greywater systems so they can save water and be more environmentally friendly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
