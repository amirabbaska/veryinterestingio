		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Euclidean geometry for the most part assumes you are drawing your shapes on something like a sheet of paper on a table. That table and paper might be infinite in size, but in general you expect certain things to happen or not happen when you draw your shape no matter where you draw your shape on that paper.</p>
<p>For example if you draw a triangle in Euclidean geometry then the measure of all the angles will add up to 180 degrees.</p>
<p>But there is no reason that paper need be flat. Anything we do to the paper to make it not flat is Non-Euclidean geometry. You could for instance roll it into a tube and tape the edges. Now you have very similar rules but things play out a bit difference. Now for example you can draw a line in one direction and depending on what direction you pick perhaps it goes on for infinity like before. Or perhaps if you pick another direction it goes around your loop and reconnects with its self forming a circle. Pick somewhere in between those and the line spirals around the paper endlessly.</p>
<p>Normally in everyday life we use Euclidean geometry. If we were in a city with a bunch of square blocks all the same size, you could solve things like 'If I go 3 blocks north, and then 4 blocks east, how many blocks would I have traveled had I just gone in a straight line from my start location to my end location.' Answer - '5 blocks.'</p>
<p>But the earth isn't a flat sheet of paper (much to the disappointment of the Flat Earthers) and is more like a sphere than a piece of paper.</p>
<p>So you can do things like 'I'm at some point and I walk 5 miles south, I then turn 90 degrees. I then walk some distance in a straight line. I then turn 90 degrees in the other direction and walk 5 miles north. I am now back at my starting location. Where am I?' Answer? There are many such locations on earth! The most commonly known location is the North Pole.</p>
<p>EDIT: Some people are pointing out that part of my explanation is incorrect. I'm not going to change it though, as the basic point is to demonstrate that a flat surface behaves differently than non-flat surfaces. Sure Mathematicians might have a very well defined view of flat surfaces, but often well defined math principles aren't easy to express in an ELI5 perfectly. So I'll accept that I'm wrong about cylinder, but leave the analogy as it really is intended to be just a quick primer into getting your mind thinking in a non-euclidean way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Euclidean geometry is a bunch of characteristics that Euclid observed about geometry from drawing lines on paper. Those characteristics are called &quot;axioms&quot; nowadays, or &quot;assumptions&quot; - they're things that you assume are true in order to work something out when doing mathematics. These assumptions are basically all really obvious things like, &quot;if you have two points you can connect them with a straight line&quot; and &quot;if you have a straight line segment you can extend it forever in either direction&quot; and things like this.</p>
<p>There's then the question of whether those assumptions actually hold in the real world. If you set up any situation in which they're all true, then you've got a situation which is Euclidean. If you set one up where one or more are false, it's non-Euclidean. So there's only <em>one</em> way in which geometry can be Euclidean, but several in which it can be non-Euclidean.</p>
<p>Other answers explain some of these possibilities but always on a sphere. Imagine for an alternative how geometry might look on a pringle. In fact let's make it a gigantic space-pringle. You can still connect points with lines on a pringle, of course, and if it's big enough you can extend points as far as you like. But something else is weird: if you take a point and a straight line on a pringle (now, you have to know what a straight line on a curved surface is, but suffice to say you can come up with something sensible) then there are lots of lines through the point that never touch the first line. In contrast if you do this on a flat piece of paper there is exactly one line that doesn't touch the first one - the parallel line going through the point.</p>
<p>So one way of being non-Euclidean is to be like a pringle.</p>
<p>Another aspect of geometry is how distances are calculated: in Euclidean geometry this is Pythagoras' Theorem; you add up the squares of the distances along each axis and take the square root. You can change this <em>metric</em> - way of calculating distance - to, for example, the Manhattan Metric (the distance from A to B is just the same of the distances along each axis - so if you were travelling on a grid like the streets of Manhattan, the distance you have to travel is the number of blocks North or South, plus the number East or West - you can't take a shortcut diagonally). This is another non-Euclidean geometry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key factor is the parallel postulate, or more generally: given a line and a point not on that line, how many lines through that point are there that are parallel to the original line? In Euclidean geometry, the answer is always 1. In other geometries, this isn't the case. The most common answers are &quot;0&quot; (spherical geometry) and &quot;infinitely many&quot; (hyperbolic geometry). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I go south for 10 miles, west for 10 miles, and north for 10 miles.  And I end up back in the same place.  Where am I?</p>
<p>Well, i'm in non-euclidean space, because in Euclidean space that's impossible.  I must be on the surface of a globe or something where a lot of the regular rules of geometry you'd expect don't quite apply.  </p>
<p>Non-euclidean geometry is geometry where your space must be weird, or bent, or wraps around on itself, or something to make it different than an infinite, flat surface, where the rules of infinite, flat surfaces don't hold up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two ways you can imagine that - from a purely mathematical point of view and from a real-life point of view.</p>
<p>From the real-life point of view, Euclidean geometry assumes we work with a flat surface. Non-Euclidean geometries do not assume that. Some types of Non-Euclidean geometries do assume other things - for example, that we work with a curved surface. If we assume something about that curvature, than we can come out with some useful rules about those curved surfaces. If we do not assume anything - we can just understand how geometry works in general. Based on that understanding we could imagine some weird
crazy curvatured surfaces. And to our surprise, we found out that some physics could be explained more elegantly if we use that crazy math instead of usual Euclidean geometry.</p>
<p>From pure math - Euclidean geometry based on 5 main postulates. We just assume they are true and prove everything else. Those postulates are quite basic - like you can always draw one and only one straight line between 2 points. Some scientist tried to simplify that - what happens if we replace those 5 with other 5? Or with other 4? or less?
And they come out that you can. It is easy to replace those 5 postulates with different specific sets of other postulates - then initial postulates will be proved with help of new ones, and everything will remain the same. So to keep Euclidean geometry we can formulate 5 postulates in different ways. We come up with simplest definitions, but we could easily think other 5 postulates which result in equivalent geometry.
But not any 5 postulates. It came out, that if we take different sets of postulates and we'll get different geometry. There is a whole branch of math dedicated to that postulates study. There is a lot of different useful stuff you can come up with if you assume something, or do not assume anything but basic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
