		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seatbelts aren’t just for collisions or sudden stops while taxiing. They are primarily there to keep you in your seat in the event of bad turbulence. Turbulence can happen suddenly and without warning. If you’re not secured you can easily fly up and hit the ceiling. On your way back down, you can land on another passenger and injure them too. </p>
<p>On private planes, it’s more of a “your house your rules” deal as no one will be liable for injury but you, but I can guarantee the pilots up front who know what’s up are wearing theirs at all times.  </p>
<p>Edit: pilots are required to wear seatbelts at all times. Even in private aircraft. What I meant to imply was that given their awareness of clear air turbulence, I’m sure they would do so regardless of requirement. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There also was <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloha_Airlines_Flight_243" target="_blank">Aloha Airlines Flight 243</a>  where the roof of the plane ripped off during flight and a flight attendant was sucked out. Since the passengers had seatbelts on, no other fatalities occurred. The incident was caused by failure in some of the rivets due to the high number of pressurization/depressurization cycles because that particular aircraft was used mainly for short flights. Ever since I learned that in a materials science course, I’ve always kept my seat belt on at all times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've flown private a fair amount. I'm not remotely rich, but I've worked for several very rich guys.  </p>
<p>They keep their seatbelts on! When we move seats to change the conversations we take the seatbelts off in the old seat and put them on in the new seat. One of my bosses often takes a nap on the couch of his jet if we have an early morning departure. He wears a seatbelt around his middle while he's napping.  </p>
<p>Rich guys are usually pretty smart. Just because no one there is forcing them to put on their belts doesn't mean they don't understand the risk/reward of doing so. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Easiest way I can explain why you SHOULD wear your seatbelt on a plane: In case of turbulence, you don't get thrown against the ceiling, <em>the entire plane slams against you</em>. That's because you're free-falling inside the airplane while the airplane itself is suddenly pushed downwards by aerodynamics and air pressure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
