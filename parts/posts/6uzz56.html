		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, they're decorative.  It's called a Spire, and it has a long history in Western architecture, especially Gothic architecture.  It became a staple part of Skyscraper architecture when skyscrapers first became a thing.  Architects were vying to hold the title of &quot;worlds tallest building&quot;.  What easier way to do that than to stick 180 feet of nothing on top of it, reaching for the sky.</p>
<p>Some buildings make use of their spires for various utility purposes, mounting radio and observation equipment.  This isn't quite as common as you might think, though.  Skyscrapers tend to be built fairly close to each other, so there's not much demand for such hardware real-estate.  Plus, if not designed for it, such attachments might visibly mar the aesthetics of the spire.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An interested counter-example of this building trend is in Los Angeles.  For the last 40 years, it had been part of the fire codes that skyscrapers in LA must have flat roofs to enable Helicopters to land on them, to allow to evacuations during fires.  In the 40 years since the law was passed, technology to aid in escaping high-rise fires has advanced significantly, and LA recently just removed this regulation.</p>
