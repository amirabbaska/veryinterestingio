		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speed of sound really isn't the limiting factor here. No matter what the speed, if it never dies down (attenuates) it will all travel infinitely.</p>
<p>Attenuation of sound varies greatly by a variety of variables, one of the most important actually being the frequency of the sound in question. And they behave incredibly weirdly. At low frequencies, for example, higher humidity is better. At higher frequencies, lower humidity is better. At middle frequencies, no humidity is best, but if there is humidity, higher is better. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Atmospheric_sound_absorption_coefficient_2.svg" target="_blank">Attenuation per meter per atmosphere by frequency and humidity</a> [and <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Engineering_Acoustics/Outdoor_Sound_Propagation#Attenuation_by_atmospheric_absorption.5B5.5D_.5B6.5D_.5B7.5D" target="_blank">source</a>]. </p>
<p>However, attenuation always increases with atmospheric pressure as the chart is in attenuation per atmosphere. And since it's per meter, the speed of sound shouldn't affect it. So going by the atmospheric attenuation, sound travels furthest in low pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The speed of sound is the square root of the pressure divided by the mass density. Now since in an ideal gas the pressure is equal to the nkT where n is the number density, T the absolute temperature and k the Boltzmann constant. So to answer your question, assuming the air is homogeneous i.e. the same everywhere and your question relates to the distance travelled in a certain amount of time, it will depend quite how the air pressure is higher. If the air is hotter with the same density, then yes it will travel further. If the air is more dense but the same temperature, it will cover less distance in a given time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey all, little late to the party, but I thought I'd talk a little about the way sound works.</p>
<p>One key element to having a good understanding of how sound propagates is being aware that sound's fundamental form is vibration: specifically, compression and rarefaction (expansion). In a wave representation of sound the crest correlates to the point of greatest compression and the trough to the point of greatest rarefaction. Imagine a caterpillar moving along (compress, relax, compress, relax) and you'll have the basic idea. Sound <em>can</em> travel in &quot;waves&quot; but when it does it's due to environmental factors; given an entirely static environment, sound will propagate through perfectly spherical pulses of expansion and compression.</p>
<p>There are a number of elements that affect sound travel through a medium (density, rigidity, salinity if it's traveling through water) and unfortunately without a lot of math it's difficult to predict how sound will act in a given environment. A rule of thumb that may help is that &quot;sound is lazy&quot; and will escape/avoid/attenuate in an environment where the sound speed is high. The ocean is a great example of this. In a column of water the speed of sound varies constantly due to three main elements: temperature, salinity, and pressure. (I'm assuming that we're in the middle of an ocean in this example so salinity is close enough to constant to not be a factor) Close to the surface, there's a layer of water where the sound speed is high due to temperature and then further down, in layers of water that are never warmed by the sun, there's another layer where sound reaches the same speed due to pressure. These two layers of water form the upper and lower borders of a &quot;duct&quot; through which sound can propagate without losing energy to the surface or bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>If you're curious about how sound works in water, I'd suggest googling &quot;RP 33 navy&quot; (<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=rp%2033%20navy" target="_blank">here</a>) and checking out the top link. One of the primary references for sonar techs in the US Navy is this document and it has a lot of good information for those of you who can stomach some really dry reading.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming the volume of air is constant, yes</p>
<p>The speed of sound is defined as:
V_air = sqrt(y <em> R </em> T) with &quot;y&quot; the specific heat ratio of air, &quot;R&quot; the molecular gas constant for air, and &quot;T&quot; the temperature of the air in either kelvin or rankines. </p>
<p>So if the air pressure is higher, then the ideal gas law tells us that the air temperature would be higher too, as long as the volume of air is constant</p>
<p>So going back to the speed of sound equation, y and R don't change with temperature ideally (y actually changes a lot with temperature at supersonic flow conditions and faster). So the speed of sound equation is just a function of temperature.</p>
<p>So air pressure going up causing air temp goes up, which in terms increases the speed of sound </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
