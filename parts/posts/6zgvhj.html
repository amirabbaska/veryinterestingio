		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before electricity, there were no fast ways of communicating across continents. When electricity was discovered within a nation, they never thought of waiting months to ask other nations about how they plug in devices. The nation just wanted to take advantage of the new invention as soon as possible! Therefore, there are so many plug standards as the first nations consulted their own engineers and scientists to make their own working plug.</p>
<p>Once people found out there were different standards, it was too late to change since so many buildings and devices have already been converted to one type of outlet.</p>
<p>In terms of different setups, there's two major kinds of standard voltage depending on the country: 110 Volt and 230 Volt. 110 V is the standard in North and Central Americas + western Japan. 230 V is found everywhere else. 230 Volt is more efficient power-wise but more dangerous due to the high voltage. 110 V is safer but it cannot supply as much power (ovens and refrigerators may need a separate high voltage plug). <del>Luckily, there are no plugs that can plug into both which is an easy way to burn out your device.</del> Nevermind... there are definitely plugs that can plug into both... check your adapter specifications and/or read your manual to prevent your devices from dying when using the wrong voltage!</p>
<p>Both of these outlets supply alternating current meaning the voltage goes up and down with time. They swing at a cycle of 60 Hz (cycles per second) in countries with a 110 V standard and 50 Hz in countries with a 230 V standard. This had influence on the refresh rate of TVs since TVs fixed their refresh rates to the power frequency to prevent strobing effects that would occur if the frequencies were mismatched. Nowadays with digital content, most TVs have been standardized to display at 60 Hz refresh rate.</p>
<p>Edit: Clarifications in the last paragraph.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is very hard to change systems once one is adopted. Ontario Canada had electric power since the 1890s, the Brock #1 power plant at Niagara Falls. But there were other private systems before that.</p>
<p>So Ontario at one time had 2 systems, 25cyles per second and 60 cycles per second. This became so unwieldy that in 1950 they switched everything to 60 cycles. Teams of electricians went from door to door, replacing the motors in everyone's washing machines, refrigerators and other appliances. This cost a great deal of money, and inconvenience for a lot of people. Today it would be even harder and more costly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tom Scott argued that UK plugs are superior because if the wire gets yanked the last thing to go is the Earth wire apparently making it a bit safer. I'm not so sure,  I do know that if you step on an upturned UK plug you are going to come out with a long string of four letter expletives. That shit seriously hurts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>UK plugs are superior as far as safety is concerned - they have a fuse in the plug, pins are rectangular for best contact surface and the ground pin is longer so it connects first and disconnect last. The sockets are better too - they have individual on/off switches and shutters in them for protection, you can't reach live wire unless ground is plugged in.</p>
<p>They are rather cumbersome and take a lot of space though.</p>
<p>Euro plugs are a bit worse but still good, can't really reach live wire unintentionally, US ungrounded plugs are quite possibly the worst there are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
