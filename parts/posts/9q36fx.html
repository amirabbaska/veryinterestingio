		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To understand wealth creation, I feel its better to eliminate currency and look at a barter system. </p>
<p>I'm a farmer that handles chickens and you handle plants. My chickens need your plants to eat. You and your big family need the eggs from my chickens to eat. </p>
<p>You want to be able to buy more eggs. You work longer hours to plant more plants to be able to sell more to me so I can feed more to my chickens. My better fed chickens produce more eggs and you can buy more of them because I bought more plants from you. My farm now produces more eggs and your produces more plants. We've increased our production, and therefore &quot;income&quot; or GDP. </p>
<p>Wealth creation comes when you deal with products that store value. Obviously, chickens eggs spoil and plants die. But, suppose you take a surplus of plants you made and sell it to another guy who in return for those plants, builds you a house. Now you have a house. That is wealth. The people in our little town know that it takes an X amount of plants, or X amount of chicken eggs to build a house. That house is part of your wealth now. You can sell it if you want in the future at a market price.</p>
<p>Obviously, I have no idea how farming actually works, but you get the gist of it lol. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we convert raw materials into other resources, the value increases.</p>
<p>Raw steel and rocks isn’t that useful, but build a building and you can house people/do commercial activities. Wood isn’t useful, but you can print knowledge on paper and books are more valuable than raw wood.</p>
<p>This concept extends to ideas, not just physical materials. A new technology like self-driving cars increases the value of the economy. A new app that allows you to easily order food delivery also adds value.</p>
<p>As Long as economic activity exists, humans are constantly transforming resources, and value will increase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>None of these are very useful explanations to a 5 year old...so let me try.</p>
<p>We're in a class of 20 people and we all really like purple marbles.  They're all identical, but as stupid 5 year olds we can't get enough purple marbles.  We'll do anything for them.</p>
<p>Jake has all the marbles.  His parents bought out the store, and he now has ~100 marbles.  And he won't give them to anyone.  The wealth of the entire economy is 100 marbles.</p>
<p>The teacher starts randomly gives the kids a toy to keep each day.  Some suck (the creepy old stuffed animal) where  other's are awesome (Buzz Lightyear with extending wings).  Everyone wants Buzz, and his companion toy, Woody.  </p>
<p>Teacher gives Jake a creepy stuffed animal, and gives Susie and Billy the Buzz and Woody toys.  Jake's really into Toy Story, so he gives 15 marbles to Susie for Buzz and 10 to Billy for Woody.</p>
<p>Everyone wants Buzz and Woody.  Now that this transaction has happened, Jake knows that any other kid would happily give him 20 marbles for Buzz or 15 for Woody.</p>
<p>The total wealth in this economy is no longer 100 marbles, but since the toy story  transaction there are still 100 physical marbles in the economy, and two assets (Buzz and Woody) worth a grand total of 35 Marbles, for a total economy the size of 135 marbles.  Your marble-based economy just grew by 35%.  Even though the number of physical marbles stayed the same.  </p>
<p>There is currently only about $1t of physical US dollars but the US economy is about $20t/yr.  So that's like the total value of all the toys being 2,000 marbles while still only having 100 physical marbles.</p>
<p>Marbles are pretty gate, so people start doing all sorts of stuff to do them.  Samuel can make a pretty awesome clay figurines that people will buy for 5 marbles; Susie will let you come to her house and watch her 3D TV for 3 marbles, Billy is really neat and will be your friend for 1 marbles/day</p>
<p>--How Banks Create Money--
Martha is a hell of a business girl, and starts a marble bank.  Because the class is only 20 people, let's say she's the only bank (so I can talk about her like she's the whole banking industry).</p>
<p>Marbles are great to play with, and look at (they are purple, after all), but it's hard to save 25 marbles up when they're so easy to lose, will roll out of your cubby, might get stolen by that one kid, etc.  So, while it might be useful to carry 1-5 marbles on you, it's probably a good idea to give them to Martha for safekeeping.</p>
<p>Martha is in an interesting spot.  She now has 60 marbles in her care.  What to do with them?</p>
<p>The Friend for money business is good, and Billy has amassed a fortune: 20 marbles and a number of toys worth a total of another 40 marbles.  No toy is quite like his first, though, and Billy desperately wants to buy Buzz Lightyear back from Jake. Its traded hands a few times, and most recently sold for 40 marbles.</p>
<p>Billy could sell half his toys and buy Buzz back, but that might take a while and the rumor is that Susie has 40 physical marbles today and is thinking of buying it.</p>
<p>Martha offers to make Billy a loan, based on the fact that he has 3 people who give him a marble every day for friendship.  She'll lend him 20 marbles, and he'll give her all his marble income for the next 10 school days (30 marbles in all).  If he is business goes poorly, Martha has the right to seize 30 marbles worth of his toys, which are being put up as collateral.  She could then sell those to the highest bidder to recover her losses.</p>
<p>Billy happily accepts, Buzz is his.</p>
<p>But physical marbles don't really change hands.  All 20 of Billy's saved marbles are being held by Martha, and the 40 marbles given to Jake don't come in a bag: but via a bank transfer where Martha deducts 40 marbles from Billy's account and credits them to Jake's.</p>
<p>In other words, the Bank of Martha just created 20 marbles of value by lending it.  BoM could potentially lend far more virtual marbles than exist on Martha's cubby.</p>
<p>Again, there are about $1t of physical us dollars in the world.  If you added them all up, the amount of USD in all accounts is about $10t.  So Martha could potentially totally have accounts totalling 1,000 marbles.</p>
<p>The more that people buy and sell things, the greater the velocity of money and the more that more people get to use it.  Wealth, in that sense, is created when you either find ways to sell things for more money, or increase the total number of things worth buying.</p>
<p>Hope this doesn't get too buried ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s not only so much money. As value is added to a society they can make more “money” and everything is okay.  In fact if societies don’t increase the amount of money in circulation at any time as the value of goods within their society increases then the money becomes more expensive and it becomes harder for the economy to work properly because there isn’t enough money to allow everyone that needs it access to it and that inhibits growth and trading of goods and services.
The opposite is also true, if you make to much money then each unit of money becomes worth less and that leads to inflation above what is beneficial. People lose faith that a dollar (for example) will buy the same amount of goods and services tomorrow that it does today. This also impacts the functioning of the economy. </p>
<p>Remember money is really just something we believe has value in it. Shiny metal or paper or whatever, in reality there no to little actual value to it other than what people say it does. Money is just an easier way of doing bartering. Instead of a farmer with milk having to find someone that wants milk and that has what he wants we trade for little pieces of something or electronic digits so we can more efficiently work in the economy.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
