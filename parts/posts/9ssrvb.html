		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some trains do that. As an example, if you book trains of the German DB far in advance you can get a cheaper price.</p>
<p>Plane tickets are expensive and most people don't take them frequently. People accept looking up the price (and comparing different offers) each time they fly.</p>
<p>If a bus company tries to charge you a different price for your commute every day you probably avoid that company. It also means every ticket has to be for a specific time and day - again something people accept for planes, but not necessarily for cheaper bus and train rides.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I worked for an airline, the airline had tiered ticket prices. So in order to have the really cheap ones, you have to have the more expensive ones. For a Domestic NZ flight the prices can range from $79 to $280 for example. This is instead of having all the tickets at the same price which would be the average for example $140. People want the cheap tickets.
So the tickets come out 350 days in advance, which means the cheapest tickets are usually purchased months or well in advanced. When people then go to book flights for two weeks time, they see only the expensive tickets cos the cheaper ones are gone. Especially if you’re booking for peak times, like 8am-10am and 4-7pm on week nights, any weekend flights and school holiday times etc.
My country is small and really only has 2 airlines so we had a bit more of a monopoly, I’m not sure if that’s how the other airlines work but may provide some insight.
I’m guessing train and bus tickets are cheaper on the whole anyway and don’t require tiered pricing systems as a blanket average will sell just fine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Municipal transit like buses and trains are run at a loss. The gate fare is only a fraction of the cost per passenger. Airlines are run as a for profit enterprise, with cities supporting the airport infrastructure to some degree, but mostly the airlines compete amongst each other for business.</p>
<p>Tickets are sold based on demand and they try to optimize their flight routes. It costs a lot to fly a route between two points, and it’s a big deal to add another flight. They want to sell exact platefuls, if possible, so they vary the price a lot to try and get all the seats filled at the best price possible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Privately operated buses and trains in the US do vary the price - they aren't fixed. Sure, Amtrak and greyhound are a bit more straight forward about the pricing (they sell them in like 4 tiers, as the cheap ones sell out, only the more expensive ones remain - despite not having a reserved seat). If you look at the bargain lines (like Bolt or Mega bus) you'll see they do something similar too - starting with a limited discounted ticket (was $1 when they launched) but going up substantially higher.<br />
The notable difference between airlines and buses is that people are willing to pay a MUCH higher price for a last minute ticket, so the variance is much higher. Also, the volume per plane is larger, ticket purchasing more predictable - so you end up with the ability to really play around with prices.<br />
As far as the why - you have to sell so many tickets for the plane to take off (lets say at $100 a ticket). As they book up, you know you can book the flight, so you up the price to sell down the sales. The upside of this is, you can usually book a flight anywhere at anytime, as long as you're willing to pay for it. Downside is really confusing and extreme pricing changes in an industry that already has REALLY skeptical customers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
