		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top comment doesn’t quite ELI5.  It’s because light travels at different speeds through mediums with different densities. So it travels fastest in a vacuum, the denser something is the slower light travels through it. On a hot day you see waves off asphalt because it’s so hot that it heats up the air right above it, which makes that air less dense than surrounding air. Also the density of the air around the asphalt widely varies and be it’s being heated up and swirling around etc, so light is traveling through it at all different speeds so it looks wavy. Gasoline probably lets off some gas/evaporates and changes the density as well resulting in the same effect. Same thing happens if you look just above a flame on a lighter or campfire or natural gas from a stove </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
