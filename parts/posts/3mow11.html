		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of speculation that NASA may be about to announce this but I was wonder what it would mean for us. If we have found running water would this make us more likely to increase our interest in the planet? If so, why? Will it enable us to possibly answer questions about ourselves and our own planet? If so, what questions? What will it mean for space exploration? How will it change or enhance our understanding of the greater universe? </p>
<p>I'm aware that it would be a monumental achievement and that running water is considered something of a holy grail in terms of finding it in space, but I'm unsure of why and of what it could mean to find it. Thanks in advance to anyone willing to answer.</p></div></div>
