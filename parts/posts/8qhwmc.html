		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two kinds of &quot;plastic&quot; (broadly). </p>
<ol>
<li>Thermo<em>plastic</em></li>
<li>Thermo<em>set</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The word &quot;plastic&quot; means changeable. A thermoplastic is like ice and water. When it's cold enough, it will become a solid and when warm enough it will melt into a liquid. While it is a warm liquid, it will take the shape of its container just like water in an ice cube trays. When cooled down, it hardens to a solid again like ice. That's how recycling works. </p>
<p>A thermoset behaves more like a fried egg. It is liquid until it is heated enough to solidify. But you can't &quot;uncook&quot; an egg. If you heat it more, it will just burn. </p>
<p><strong>More detail</strong></p>
<p>A thermoplastic is a hydrocarbon polymer - a long chain of carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms on the side. These long chains can behave like spaghetti - while cooking, the strands all slide past each other easily, but cooled and dry, they tangle into a solid cake (like a ramen noodle brick). Like a ramen noodle brick, they tend to be somewhat flexible and not very tough. These plastics are PET (as in soda bottles), Acrylic (as in plexiglass), or PC-ABS blends as in most electronics as well as many others. Just look for the SIC code on the back of recyclable materials and see <a href="https://organicchemistryproject.weebly.com/uploads/3/0/7/7/30779593/8640434_orig.gif" target="_blank">this chart</a> to see what they are. </p>
<p>A thermoset <em>cross-links</em> when it is cooked. Like an egg or a cake. The hydrocarbons actually form covalent bonds <em>between</em> each other forming a structure that won't break when heated again until the whole material combusts. You can trigger this cross-linking through heat, UV exposure (as in that UV stuff a dentist uses in fillings, or 3D printing), or through a chemical reaction (like epoxy resin). Covalent bonds are strong, so cross-linked plastics tend to be tougher. Examples include aramids (as in kevlar fiber), the resin part of carbon fiber, polyurethane, and Bakelite. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A large amount of recycled plastic is ‘down-cycled,’ where it’s made into cheaper, lower-quality objects like road speed bumps, which then get thrown away normally at the end of their life cycle.<br />
So basically, a lot of plastics aren’t really recycled at all, they’re just reused once, maybe twice, and then thrown away anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plastics can be either thermoset or thermoplastic (in aid of simplicity). Thermoplastic types can be melted down, any number of times you want. Thermoset plastics are 'locked' into their final form:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, we have a challenge here in Toronto regarding Thermoplastic plastic: If it's black, we can't recycle it.</p>
<p>Our sorting machines can't see the black plastic in on the rubber conveyor belts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[Toronto's] optical sorting technology at the recycling facility cannot distinguish black plastic from the black conveyor belt, and as a result can't sort it,&quot; said Jim McKay, the city's general manager of solid waste management services.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two main reasons, material properties and cost.  Some plastics simply degrade with too much exposure to heat, solvents, and other such things that are a staple of recycling plants, so you can't recycle them without destroying them.  The other thing is that in order to justify the cost of recycling there has to be a sufficiently robust and lucrative resale market for that commodity.  If it's simply cheaper and easier to buy new then recycling plants simply won't bother with them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
