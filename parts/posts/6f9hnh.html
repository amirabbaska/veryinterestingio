		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Fox News Channel and the Standard Fox Channel are not the same organization. They are owned by the same <em>parent company</em>, but that doesn't mean much. The Parent Company has very little influence in the Day-to-Day decision-making for Fox News and Fox under normal circumstances, they only step in when one of the Fox channels starts under-performing (not making enough money).</p>
<p>Fox News Channel and Standard Fox Channel have different content for one reason: They do not want to compete with each-other. Their Parent Company wants <em>both of them</em> to have their own audience. This is because people can only watch one Advertisement at once. If your own Channels steal each-other's audiences, then the amount of Ad Money that is produced by all the Channels <em>does not increase</em>.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Fox News's Parent Company <em>also</em> owns National Geographic. You know, the publication that believes that Global Warming is real and calls people to work against it. Meanwhile, Fox News believes it's fake and tells everyone to work against anti-Global Warming things.</p>
<p>Basically: Corporations have no internal Moral Values, except a desire to make more money. They only have alternative brands that pander to different audiences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Money is a big factor. They're a corporation, and as to not gain any animosity, they don't choose sides. If Fox made a leftist news company, they wouldn't have as much room for profit as they would with Fox News. Same idea goes for their television, where sticking to a formula someone else has already tapped into doesn't gain revenue as easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They don't put all their eggs in one basket, so they get the senior demographic with their conservative news and get a younger demographic with their more raunchy and trashy programming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
