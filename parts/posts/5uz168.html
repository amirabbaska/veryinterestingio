		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a long time, bluetooth audio streaming was not good enough. It would use massive amounts of power consumption in relativity to the range of operation - and would be interfered by lots of things. It wasn't until bluetooth 3 and 4 that it really got better, and added functionality for multiple device connection (ie, connecting your phone via bluetooth to the headset and at the same time your computer or another phone, or even a second pair of headphones)</p>
<p>The audio quality still isn't all there, in my opinion. At a rate of 25MB/s, one would think that it would be able to stream at lossless audio quality - but almost every bluetooth audio device i've seen implements some form of audio dithering (reducing the bitrate to make it smaller and easier on the network) before sending it out via bluetooth wireless protocol.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big part of the problem was and still is that the buds need to receive a stereo signal at exactly the same time. The phone being in your pocket on one side of your body is enough to throw that off.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bluetooth is not &quot;broadcast&quot; where the signal is available for anything listening. It is a two-way &quot;conversation&quot; which is why you need to &quot;pair&quot; your phone/source to your listening device. In short, two Bluetooth devices doing the same thing with the same source at the same time involves at least moderate difficulties beyond making two clones of the same device. As others have mentioned this was not actually possible until later revisions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The wireless package has been around for quite a while already.  The problem was battery life and size.    Newer technology allows for long enough battery life to last a day of listening.    I had wireless ones 5 or 6 years ago and they only last 4hrs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
