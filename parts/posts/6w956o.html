		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ability for an internal monologue is a fascinating, not well studied feature of the human mind. The current hypothesis for what causes it lies within that of corollary discharge (efferent copy).</p>
<p>Whenever neurons within the  primary motor cortex of the brain &quot;fire&quot; to do a specific action, this information flows in different ways. One signal goes directly to the muscle in which the brain is trying to manipulate, and instantly causes a reaction. However, at the same time, a &quot;copy&quot; of this signal goes to the cerebellum and parietal lobes. Information from the sensory receptors at the muscle also feed back to the parietal lobes and cerebellum. So, whenever movement is initiated, the signal immediately goes to the muscle, it moves, and then a signal from those sensory neurons heads back to the cerebellum and parietal lobes. This allows them to compare the input signal and the actual action of the muscle, where they send near instantaneous corrective signals to make the movement more refined in what is called a servo-loop.</p>
<p>At the same time as the original firing, however, a signal is sent into a different region of the parietal lobe from the primary motor cortex of the movement about to take place. There, the signal is interpreted, and neurons responsible for the comprehension of one's self and its whereabouts in space form a &quot;simulation&quot; of the movement of the muscle in what is known as corollary discharge so that the action is understood by the brain, and no response occurs in the brain that would end up inhibiting the action trying to take place. </p>
<p>One can &quot;see&quot; corollary discharge by closing his/her eyes and waving his/her hand in front of his/her face. Even though there is no real visual input of the action taking place, one can clearly imagine a &quot;ghost&quot; like limb performing the action in front of themselves. The corollary discharge is able to simulate the action taking place, and is thus able to predict the other sensory results of that action, too.</p>
<p>In an internal monologue, it appears that the effects of corollary discharge, that is the simulation of the sensory affects of one's actions, is able to occur independently, without the original motor signal. The exact mechanism for how this works is not completely understood, but, it has been hypothesized that it has something to do with internally projecting mirror neurons. Therefore, this imagined speech is from a mere prediction of resultant sensory input from a simulation within the right parietal lobe's proprioceptive (whereabouts in space) regions of the brain.</p>
<p>If I were to take a guess, the actual voice one hears is not processed within the auditory regions of the brain. Rather, the complex planning that occurs in the prefrontal cortex connects with wernicke's area (a language center in the temporal lobe of the brain), which assigns language to the thoughts. Then, this would most likely get sent to internally projecting mirror neurons in the frontal lobe in Broca's Area (another language center in the brain, is responsible for syntax and controlling the movements within the mouth to produce speech), where the corollary discharge simulation would take place. This, would produce the &quot;sounds&quot; of internal speech. Since the meaning of the internal speech would already be known, then, audial processing and interpretation would not need to occur. Thus, the corollary discharge would only be used to produce the recognizable interpretations of speech that allows for more complex thought.</p>
<p>I hope that this explains it in a clear, understandable fashion!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Atlantic recently had an article where they put microphones on schizophrenic patients shirts. The patients told them what their voices were telling them and later the scientists saw through the recorded microphones that the patients were unknowingly whispering to themselves the thoughts they heard the voices say. So scientists now think that schizophrenia might be this aspect of the brain, our inner voice so to speak, that's malfunctioning and causing the disease in part. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just adding some more in depth to the question, but people who lose their memory also remember the &quot;voice&quot; of their thought? Or even other people's voices, since we can &quot;imitate&quot; it in our minds [thinking about you, Morgan Freeman]? And a little more, deaf people, how their &quot;voice&quot; works in their mind? There are so many interestings thoughts about it!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm late to the party, but Daniel Dennett has an interesting theory about this in Consciousness Explained.  If i remember correctly, he suggests we developed verbal language before we had an inner monologue.  </p>
<p>Initially we  developed primitive language to communicate with each other, then we chanced across talking to ourselves out loud as a means of stimulating our own minds.   E.g when you forget where you have put your car keys, verbalizing your thoughts can help you remember where they are.  Dennett seemed to think it was a means of stimulating different areas of the brain that are not communicating well with each other, e.g words come out of your mouth and reenter your ears, a different part of your brain interprets these words, stimulating the brain and providing a kind of artificial link between different areas of the mind.  </p>
<p>If I remember correctly he suggested an internal monologue developed as an extension of this ability.  I know, more philosophy than science, but still an interesting perspective.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
