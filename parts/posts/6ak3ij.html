		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While some Christians prefer the King James translation of the Bible, there are many, many translations of the Bible in many different languages, made at different times. Christianity is a world religion, and has become very aggressive about translating its holy texts into whatever languages its people speak.</p>
<p>The original languages of the Bible are Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. What we call &quot;Modern English&quot; didn't exist until shortly before the time of Shakespeare - and the King James Bible. There are earlier English translations, but they're even more difficult to read for people nowadays.</p>
<p>The influence &amp; staying power of the King James Version comes from a couple of things: the translation was made after the invention of the printing press, so it was widely available. The translation was authorized by the Church of England, which used it exclusively, so anywhere that the C of E had influence, the KJV did too: it wasn't too long after the KJV was published that the British Empire circled the globe, bringing British culture and religion with it. And the KJV was, for its time, the best English translation available.</p>
<p>There are other translations of the Bible made about that time and later, but for centuries the KJV remained dominant for the reasons above. But languages change over time, and the meanings of words change. Eventually re-translation is necessary. The last century has produced a number of very good English translations now widely used by English-speaking Christians. (My favorite is the English Standard Version, first published in 2001.)</p>
<p>But because the KJV was the dominant translation for so long, its language has become entrenched in English-speaking society. And people like tradition. It feels weird to change how a holy text reads or sounds. People stick with what they know or what they're used to. Therefore the KJV is still around and will still be around for many years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>National Geographic <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/12/king-james-bible/nicolson-text" target="_blank">published an article</a> a few years ago, which speaks to both the poetics and the influence of the KJV on the English language. It's worth a read.</p>
<p>Curiously, there are some concepts that are holdovers from the KJV that are so ingrained in the Christian tradition that they've persisted into an era in which other English translations are preferred. For example, everyone knows that Moses parted the Red Sea, despite that this is evidently a mistranslation, and should be the &quot;Sea of Reeds&quot;. The latter could perhaps describe wetlands and tidal flats that would make more geographical sense.</p>
<p>Another holdover from KJV is that we largely still infer that Jesus was a carpenter, owing to the stated profession of his father. However, the word given for Joseph's profession is tekton, which is also used for stonemasons. The KJV translators were largely from Western and Northern Europe, and went with &quot;carpenter&quot;. </p>
<p>However, contextual clues would seem to suggest stonemason. Stories about Jesus routinely find him using analogies about building with stone. &quot;The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,&quot; although here, &quot;cornerstone&quot; may actually read &quot;head of the arch,&quot; which would suggest not only a stone analogy, but also an understanding of the construction of a Roman arch. There are metaphors about safe places to build, adding rooms to houses, etc, all of which were stone structures.</p>
<p>But, KJV established certain readings, and they outlive that particular translation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(wall of text incoming, but it's relevant to the question.. bear with me!)</p>
<p>In the early 16th century, the Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus tried to compile a 'New testament in Greek' as a comprehensive version didn't really exist and there were doubts about the quality and integrity of the few manuscripts that were available for study around that time. The New Testament texts had been written around 50-150 AD (as is commonly accepted) but around the 15th/16th century, most known Greek manuscripts were only a couple of hundreds of years old - anything older was either lost and forgotten in monasteries all over Europe, or worn out beyond use, or decomposed due to the age of the biological materials used to write on, for instance. </p>
<p>So, Erasmus studied the few manuscripts he could find and, in 1516, published the first edition of his New Testament in Greek - which became popularly known as the 'Textus Receptus' (TR for short) There were several revised editions later, as more/earlier manuscripts were found in monasteries and such and textual variants were discussed, accepted or rejected. For a long time, the TR was the gold standard of Greek New Testament - and it had a large influence on the KJV; the translators that made the KJV made extensive use of it. You could even say that the KJV is largely based on the TR!</p>
<p>Now - Erasmus lived in northwestern Europe. The manuscripts (parchments) he could study, came from the western church, via Byzantium (eastern Roman empire). In later centuries, howver, archeology and other research yielded many new texts for study, not parchments from the western (byzantine) tradition, but from sources in Egypt for instance: papyri, often much older than the parchments Erasmus had. Some of these papyri are dated to the second and third century AD, which brings ur much close to their time of writing, when compared to what Erasmus had to work with! These texts are sometimes called 'alexandrian' (from Alexandria in Egypt), to distinguish them from the western 'byzantine' texts. </p>
<p>Slowly but surely, the influence of these alexandrian texts grew. And newer compilations of a Greek New Testaments (such as Nestle Aland) which replaced the Textus Receptus, made good use of the more ancient alexandrian sources, with their own unique textual variants. This leads to textual differences with the Textus Receptus of course!</p>
<p>So how is this relevant to the usage of the KJV today? Well, most newer bible translations no longer use the Textus Receptus as source, but newer compilations such as the already metioned Nestle Aland. But, there is a specific subset of christians that do not accept the alexandrian textual variants as valid; they consider them corrupted by gnostic influences and/or other early heresies, or by theologians such as Origenes for example. These christians only want to use a bible translation that is based on the TR and that pretty much leaves you with the KJV only!</p>
<p>In Dutch, we have the 'Statenvertaling' bible translation, which was based on the TR and made in the early 17th century, and here, too, we have people who only want to read that one translation for pretty much the same reasons.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I only glanced through and didn't see this comment and it's important to understand when talking about translations. There are two ways to translate a book.</p>
<p>1) Is to be word for word as accurate as possible. You don't look at the context, inference, anything like that.  Tree = tree even if the description sounds what we would call in English a bush.</p>
<p>2) They try to figure out the idea they were trying to get across and use the best words in English to convey what was trying to be said, and that's what they translate it to. He towered above them might get translated to he was taller than the men around him (this is a terrible example but gets the idea across)</p>
<p>Someone smarter than me can explain it better.</p>
<p>There are other people who can describe it better and come up with some examples.</p>

<p>The vast majority of Christians do not prefer the KJV over the translations in their language or ones that are more modern. </p>
<p>Some are vehemently opposed to anything but KJV, King James Only-ist, and they have been mentioned. This is rare but very energetic. I don't fight with them, I just tell them I pledge to obey and believe the KJV, too. They tend to be conspiracy theorists that think that other translations have been damaged. And 9/11 was an inside job. </p>
<p>As others have mentioned the Bible wasn't &quot;written&quot; but translated from manuscripts that came from real historical figures and groups.  These manuscripts number in the thousands, with many, many copies of each book spread all over the Ancient Near East, Egypt, Asia Minor. </p>
<p>That's much better than having one &quot;original&quot; manuscript as far as increasing or improving certitude. One &quot;original&quot; can always be faked. But thousands of almost identical copies spread over the known world can't be faked. Copies buried in a cave can't be faked. </p>
<p>So the KJV was translated from a group of manuscripts available during the 1600s that were pretty good, though not as good as the ones we have now, and that's enabled us to clear up some confusion about certain words--not teachings, not doctrines, just very fine adjustments in the precise word or semantic range of a word. So modern translations are generally better, although some have been influenced by modern gender-equity issues to make them neutralize pronouns and things like that--I'm not for it. If the Bible is a very male oriented book, then for truth's sake, make that clear in your translations. </p>
<p>But even then, we are talking about whether we use it or he. Not a big issue (except in Galatians 3-4). And then not a big issue except for scholarly types. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
