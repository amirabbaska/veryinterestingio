		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, sidebar here, from a nerdy ((and pedantic) massage therapist:</p>
<p>There are lots of responses here, all giving very reasonable and more or less science-y sounding answers expressed with absolute confidence. They're all missing one important thing.</p>
<p>Here's the somewhat awkward truth: we don't really know. In fact, the answer to most questions about massage is &quot;We don't know for sure.&quot; There are a lot of things that we know definitely work, and we have some theories as to why, but we aren't really sure. </p>
<p>There are a couple of really good reasons for this. </p>
<p>First, massage is really hard to study in a scientifically rigorous way. You can't even do a proper blind study - every subject will know whether or not they got a massage! </p>
<p>The second reason is that to really understand how massage works, you'd have to be able to see what's going on in a living body on a sub-microscopic level in real-time, and we don't have any way to do that. Through decades of studying chemical structures of proteins and other components in muscle tissues and nerve fibers, scientists have developed a really good sense of how these things work, and <em>some</em> of the ways things can go wrong. But there are still lots of failure modes that aren't well understood yet.</p>
<p>So, if we don't know exactly why your neck gets tense when you're stressed, or why massage fixes it, what <em>do</em> we know? Well, let's start with a basic understanding of the feedback loop that regulates the tension in any given muscle (or really, any cluster of muscle fibers within a muscle):</p>
<ol>
<li>Sensory receptors in and around every muscle in the body, every second of every day, send information up to the brain. This includes pressure sensors in the muscle that detect contraction, stretch sensors in the tendons, chemical receptors throughout the muscle tissue that detect inflammation, and more.</li>
<li>The brain receives all this info, and compares it to past experience to estimate the current position, motion, and state of every body part, including the current tension of each muscle. (When you close your eyes and wave your arms around and you can feel where they are, this is what makes that possible.)</li>
<li>The brain determines the difference between the position and motion of each body part vs where it wants those body parts to be, as well as the current contraction state of each muscle, and contracts or relaxes all muscles accordingly. (This is why you're capable of walking, or even standing, without falling over.)</li>
<li>Return to step #1.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, if a muscle is more tense (that is, trying to contract more) than it should be - or, if just a few fibers in a muscle are tense, as in the case of a &quot;knot&quot; - the problem could be at any step of that process. Perhaps the tissues are sending incorrect or contradictory information to the brain, or the brain is misinterpreting the information, or the brain is sending the wrong signals to the muscle, or the signal from the brain isn't reaching the muscle properly. And of course, there are several possible causes for each of these.</p>
<p>Massage could help any of those situations. It can increase lymphatic flow, flushing out metabolic byproducts that might interfere with nerve signals or with the muscle's ability to respond. It could also &quot;recalibrate&quot; the brain's sensorimotor system, by sending a wide range of unusual signals - for example, I can stretch the tendon at one end of the muscle without simultaneously stretching the other end - something that rarely happens naturally, forcing the brain to &quot;recalibrate&quot; its idea of what a given sensory input means.</p>
<p>Without being able to trace individual nerve signals, let alone look at the chemical changes inside a muscle cell from one millisecond to the next, it's surprisingly hard to tell for sure exactly which of these things is happening, and why, and how. Which is why the most honest answer to why massage works is still almost always &quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, with that huge disclaimer, let's finally come back to your original question: my own pet theory, based on what I've read and my personal experience, is something like this: </p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, it's very rare that you'll keep the same muscle active for an extended period. You're always making small movements and adjustments, giving any particular group of muscle fibers a chance to relax every now and then. When you're under stress, however, as others have pointed out, your brain switches to &quot;fight or flight&quot; mode, releasing cortisol, adrenaline, and other hormones into your body. This can cause you to tense up all your muscles in preparation for sudden action. It can also help you to hold very still, perhaps as you focus intently one one thing. And then, of course, the mental distraction of the stress may cause you not to consciously notice that you've held one muscle tight long enough that it's getting uncomfortable.</p>
<p>At some point, when you perform this unusual action of keeping a muscle tight for a very long time, something goes wrong in the feedback loop above. Perhaps the tight muscles inhibit lymphatic flow, causing a build up of metabolic byproducts, causing inflammation. Or perhaps fatigue of the overworked stretch sensors causes the brain to misinterpret their signals, or start to ignore them completely. For whatever reason, that muscle (or part of a muscle) keeps trying to contract more than is appropriate. Then you get a massage, and (one way or another) everything is cleared out and recalibrated, and you feel better.</p>
<p>Why does this happen in the neck, specifically? Well, it can happen anywhere, and different people &quot;carry their tension&quot; in different places. The thing about the neck is, those muscles are pretty busy. If you're not lying down, you're probably using those muscles to support your head. And especially if you spend your days at a desk, looking at a screen or at paperwork or anything involving focused attention, not looking around much, while feeling stressed and anxious... it's just asking for trouble!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you are stressed, you experience fight-or-flight, even if the stressor is emotional/psychological in nature.  When this response occurs, it causes you to produce more adrenaline.  Adrenaline causes muscle tension (muscle tension being a sign of stress).  If you massage a muscle, you can cause that muscle to relax.  So stress increases adrenaline, causing muscle tension, massage relaxes muscles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hiya! Massage Therapist here.  </p>
<p>Muscles can do lots of things! You can use them to move parts of your body around, like your arms and legs.  You can also use them to hold yourself really still, like a statue! This is called tensing up.  When you use your muscles to tense up, it’s really hard for anyone to push you around.  Try it!  Have a friend try to push you over while your body is relaxed.  Then have them try to push you while your muscles are tense, and feel the difference.  Tensing up can protect you!</p>
<p>Now, when a person is overly stressed, they may feel the need to be in a constant state of protection, and stay tense all the time.  This is called ‘hypertension’ (double edit: that isn’t the correct term, forgive me! It’s really called hypertonicity.). The shoulders and neck are the most common place for stuck tension, but it can be held in different places all over the body.</p>
<p>When a muscle is constantly contracted, it can cause some problems.  Tense muscles restrict blood circulation, which can prevent the muscle from getting the nutrients it needs to be healthy.  Also, a muscle that doesn’t relax and can limit the amount of movement your body can do.</p>
<p>Phew!  That was a lot of information!  Let’s shake it out before we continue.</p>
<p>Okay, so now we get to the good stuff: how does massage actually help?  The simple answer is that it takes the muscles out of tension, and into a supple, relaxed state.  BUT HOW?  </p>
<p>First, a massage can only be effective if the person can relax.  They need to be in a space where they feel safe, where they can lower their tension defenses.  This is why spas and massage studios pay extra attention to atmosphere and ambiance.  Soft music, low lights, and privacy are standard in most massage spaces.</p>
<p>Then you get to the actual massage.  There are a ton of techniques that massage therapists use to loosen muscles!  By kneading, stroking, pressing, shaking and/or tapping muscles, we help them out of tension and into relaxation.  Without the tension, you can move the muscle more easily, the circulation to the area improves, and posture improves. </p>
<p>Also, there can be great emotional relief alongside the physical relief, when you can shift away from feeling defensive and locked down.</p>
<p>I hope this helps, I know it’s long-winded.  Feel free to ask me any questions you have about the benefits of massage!  I love the field, and am so happy to help people feel better in their bodies all day!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people are tense, they tend to shrug their shoulders up (no idea why). We're not talking shrugging a lot, but it's enough to activate the trapezius muscle and the muscles of the neck. Overtime, the muscles get sore and contracted from having been activated for so long. When they've been contracted for so long, it's also hard for the muscle fibers to relax and release to their normal length. This is what you experience as an achy/sore neck.</p>
<p>The reason a massage fixes it is due to the massage forcing the muscle fibers to extend again. When the muscle fibers can lengthen to their normal range, bam, no tightness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you've ever seen a cat or dog get frightened, you'll notice they puff up and try to look bigger.  This is a response to danger and our body experiences stress in the same way.  We tuck our shoulders up and keep our head low.  Doing this for a long time can cause the muscles tension.  An easy way to massage this is to slowly rotate your neck from the left, to down, to right and back again over and over.  You can also shrug and relax your shoulders.  Lastly, hold your finders on one side of your neck close to your shoulders, pretty tight but not too tight, and then cock your head to the opposite side slowly, then move your fingers a bit higher and repeat.  The key to any stretching is if it hurts, don't do it.  If you're still experiencing pain, you should consider seeing your doctor.  Many insurance plans cover massage for rehabilitation of injury, most massage chains won't/can't bill your insurance, so try to go to a sports medicine specialists, they employee masseuses that can bill your insurance.
