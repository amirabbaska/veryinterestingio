		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept behind the question is an interesting one and the idea of predicting the lifespan of an individual based on biological indicators is indeed a popular research topic.</p>
<p>Long story short specifically for telomeres, the answer is &quot;not really&quot;. Different cells divide at different speeds. Also, many cells do not divide any further at all. If someone got even a minor injury or a mildly traumatic event or some weird habits, that would affect cell division as well. And then there are the individual differences in telomere lengths. Given all these, it will be virtually impossible to predict the &quot;endpoint&quot; of cell division in the real-time scale, let alone predicting one for an individual based on a few cells.</p>
<p>Also, generally telomere length is not the limiting factor for humans. There's some evidence that it can be a contributing one, but it is not really a major factor (the correlation was not practically significant and causation is somewhat dubious). There are many other ways a person can die &quot;of old age&quot; depending on the definition, including cancer, neurological disorders (Alzheimer's etc.), osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, kidney failure, weak immune system etc. etc., all of which are very much age-related. There are even sayings that most people don't have Huntington's Disease because we die before we reach the age of developing one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I believe more evidence is emerging (especially in the field of stem cells and iPSCs) that telomere length is a dynamic process. Cells contain proteins that can trim long telomeres (telomerase), protect short ones (TZAP and the shelterin complex), and lengthen critically short telomeres (thought to also be the telomerase). The whole thought that aging was directly attributed to telomere length was appealing. Although I think it is naive to assume a cell doesn't have a way to lengthen telomeres and just dies. Long telomeres are actually trimmed to a shorter length because it's considered a cancer risk. While I don't have telomere elongation articles right in front of me and some of the resources I'm finding suggest telomeres don't lengthen in somatic cells, the paper below does discuss the dynamic process. I'm starting to believe telomere length is a lot more dynamic than the previous notion that we lose some base pairs every replication cycle and then the cell dies.</p>

<p>Edit: and I'll just quote this article to address your original question because there is a correlation. &quot;In addition, we find that telomere length inversely correlates with lifespan, while telomerase expression correlates with mass. The
role of replicative aging as a tumor suppression mechanism is well accepted; however, its contribution to lifespan remains controversial.&quot;

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you under the impression that when the last telomere falls off a person just falls over dead?</p>
<p>People don't die of &quot;old age.&quot; They die of one of many causes that become common as they age. The terminology &quot;dying of old age&quot; means one or several of these things occurred and it doesn't really matter which one. Often this is a major stroke or heart failure caused by a dysrhythmia, or even a progressive illness like a respiratory problem or cancer finally causing one of the conditions necessary to life to not be met for long enough to kill the person.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if ill function of cells thanks to not having been replaced or regenerated was a major killer, you could (and do) have that with plenty of telomeres left. The telomeres alone are not a good predictor of general health or longevity in human or in any animal as complex as humans. Death has many, many contributing factors, many possible causations, and predicting when someone is likely to die therefore necessities a complex predictive approach.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Telomeres can both grow and shrink in length. Statistically there is an average number of repeats till a telomere fails but the number isn't set in stone. Shortened telomeres cause errors in the uncapped genetic medium but the errors could have zero or devastating effect.</p>
<p>Biology is a very fluid science, it's extremely difficult to predict anything in biological systems other than an average.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
