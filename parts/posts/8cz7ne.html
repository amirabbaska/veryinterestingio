		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So basically it's two things:</p>
<p>The first is how they get the videos to you - Netflix has massive global &quot;Content Delivery Network (CDN)&quot;, a huge network of servers which host all the movies and TV shows.</p>
<p>Basically when you go to play a video on Netflix, the &quot;closest&quot; server to you is selected for you to stream from. Because Netflix is now so big, they've been able strike deals with ISPs (the companies who you pay to get internet) to be able to store their movies and TV shows on servers directly inside your providers network. No need to stream across large sections of busy, contested public internet.</p>
<p>The second is what they do to the videos before they stream them - Basically because Netflix is big enough they can afford a great research and development team which has created ways to process the Netflix library so that it's smaller and easier to stream to you while being good quality. In fact, they now claim that you only need a ~200Kbps connection to stream at an enjoyable quality.</p>
<p>While Amazon can also compete with Netflix in terms of ease of streaming (I find, anyway), most other services simply do not have the resources/motivation to create as good an experience. Youtube is a notable exception, however, because although Alphabet (Youtube's parent company) has tremendous resources, Youtube's video library is <em>HUGE</em> and growing everyday. To be able to host and process all that as well as they do at the moment is something of a miracle, but with current technology, there's no way you could get the Netflix experience on Youtube.</p>
<p>Edit: Just to clarify, when you actually visit the netflix website/app/etc, the interface and the catalogue of content (titles, artwork, cast, etc.) is served to you from an Amazon AWS datacentre. When you actually click on a video, the website/app/etc tells your device to go and fetch the content from one of the servers - or Open Connect Appliances (OCAs) - inside or &quot;near&quot; your ISP. Essentially, everything before you hit &quot;play&quot; comes from an Amazon server, everything after comes from Netflix's CDN called &quot;Open Connect&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>NetFlix hosts caching servers inside major ISP's networks.  This means that if what you're watching is popular, it just has to travel the last mile to get to you, instead of hopping from network to network first, causing latency and lower quality due to bottlenecks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The control plane (what's needed before a video starts playing) is hosted on Amazon (AWS). From there, the closest content server to you (or best for another reason) is used to get the video content to you, in order of preference:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Netflix Open Connect appliance co-located at your ISP</li>
<li>through a PNI (Private Network Interconnect) between Netflix and your ISP</li>
<li>through a public peering point (IX)</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason it's so good is they've spent a lot to put their content everywhere they can and to have fallbacks if, for instance, the local appliance at your ISP is too busy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer (which duplicates a lot of answers here) </p>
<p>Netflix does not send a copy of Stranger Things to you from it's HQ in California. </p>
<p>Instead, Netflix stores a copy of it on a computer <em>in every city</em></p>
<p>So they only have to send the video ten miles, instead of a few thousand miles from California. </p>
<p>Not only does a short trip take less time, there aren't as many accidents and traffic jams to slow it down along the way</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
