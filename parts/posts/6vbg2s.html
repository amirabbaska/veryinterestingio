		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's from the Bible.  A widow offers 2 coins as an offering, compared to the other followers who offer larger sums.  Jesus was more interested in the widow because the 2 coins were the total sum of her money, while the others offered larger sums, but were smaller portions of their wealth.  I think it's supposed to imply &quot;my ideas aren't worth much, but it is all I have, and I hope it's helpful&quot;.  Hope this helped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
