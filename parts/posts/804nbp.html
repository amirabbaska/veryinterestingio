		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although Voyager 1 didn’t use this method, there was actually a US satellite program that did drop canisters of film back to earth. The Corona Program was a reconnaissance program which ejected film canisters from the satellite, which were then “caught” during re-entry by planes with special hooks. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Film is not the opposite of digital - <em>analog</em> is. Film is an analog method of recording an image, but it's not the only way - for example, live television used to be 100% analog, but of course didn't involve storing images on film at any point in the process.</p>
<p>A digital camera uses a CCD or CMOS <em>sensor</em> to capture the image as electric charges, whilst a film camera uses photographic film to capture the image chemically (silver halides turned into silver metal, originally). A television camera, and also the vidicon cameras used on Voyager, use something more similar to a CCD, where a plate of photoconductive material is scanned by an electron beam.</p>
<p>The voltage is then an electronic signal that can be transmitted. Again there are different methods of transmission: film can be transmitted physically because it's a physical, semi-permanent thing. But you could transmit it some other way by detecting where the silver crystals are and sending that information somehow. In any case, Voyager sends the information by radio wave, which is also how live television worked. Nowadays digital images are sent by radio wave - the transmission method is the same even though the kind of information is different. You have to decide how you will turn the information into a radio wave, of course, and this will differ between analog and digitally captured images, but that's OK.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They use/used half duplex FSK radio modems to send the data back. You can communicate 2 ways using half duplex FSK but you have to do it in a structured way. You would need a starting point, and ending point, and a check sum in the data stream to get the picture or slices of the picture that you would concatenate later. You would also have to do this like a CB or Military radio where you have things like &quot;over&quot; and &quot;roger&quot; in the data stream so you keep the &quot;conversation&quot; going.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
