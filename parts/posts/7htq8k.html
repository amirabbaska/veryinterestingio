		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the sand and geology of the area. Essentially the deeper you go the more compact the sand becomes and eventually you would run into sand stone. Under that there would be a layer of limestone. This pattern would alternate for the riseing and falling of sea levels. Thicknesses depend on how long sea levels were at different heights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So sand is produced on the continent and dumped into the ocean via river. Some of the sand remains as a beach, however sand is also brought back up by the ocean via wave action. Also the further out you go from the beach depending on conditions the formation of limestone will accrue. If you were to drill down you would cut through alternating layers of sand and limestone and you would eventually meet bed rock, and that could be basalt, or any other kind of igneous and metamorphic rocks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like already said, it really depends on the Geology of the area. For example, the shoreface could have prograded or retrograded, basically moving back and forth over time due to changes in sea level. What was once a tidal zone with tidalite structures could eventually be a deep ocean area where shape forms, or maybe a back swamp area and you could get coal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Doesn't answer your question - but it's a piece to your puzzle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer that my professor would give you is that it depends entirely on the type of beach. Just for a few examples, we can have beaches that have nothing but siliciclastic sediment on them, but then you can also have entire beaches of only carbonate sediment. Not to mention the extreme variety within these two main groups. </p>
<p>As for what’s under it, that depends entirely on the history of the locality’s environment. Certain environments are known to produce certain sequences of lithologies as they move. For example in a braided river system we see lots of sandstones with sedimentary structures indicating flow (like trough crossbedding) from the times the river channel is active, interbedded with  mudstones from periods where the channel is inactive. </p>
<p>These recognized patterns for different environments are called facies models, which we then use to interpret the history of environments like beaches from drill cores. </p>
<p>So to answer your question, it’s either carbonate or siliciclastic rock (pretty much literally any sedimentary rock) resulting from the environment that deposited it. With a little digging around you could probably find a paper with a stratigraphic section + analysis for wherever you were interested in. </p>
<p>P.S. good question, helped me study for my sedimentation and stratigraphy exam. </p>
<p>TL;DR in general it varies a lot (more than I feel other people have been suggesting)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
