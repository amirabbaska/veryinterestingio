		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pain is a combination of a neurological response <em>and</em> an emotional response.  I think it is the emotional response that makes the experience of the pain high or low.  I suspect some people have been told to tough it out, or just walk through it, so their &quot;emotional&quot; response makes the pain more tolerable.  The neurological response is pretty much the same, although some studies have shown there may be a genetic influence.</p>
<p>Everything I've read about pain makes me think it is one of those things that medicine really doesn't understand very well.  Perhaps that's why it is so difficult to answer your question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It looks like there's a significant genetic component to nociception: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the first twin studies (experimental, female only) by Norbury et al.10 showed a statistically significant genetic component (varying between 22% and 55%) in pain sensitivity.  --  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4590159/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4590159/</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its partially both.
I have something called sensory processing disorder: sensory seeking behaviors.
I have broken limbs 4 times. During the last two I didn't cry at all, and when i broke my arm in four spots, i casually got up, walked to the nurse and someone took me to the hospital. I started crying halfway to the hospital.
This disorder basically makes pain reception, and all feeling reception limited to some degree.  Compared to my brother, those around me and what i perceive to be the norm i have an extreme pain tolerance. I was also raised in a, more or less, suck it up based environment.
Basically its both, but in my case it leans towards less sensitive pain receptors (technically speaking its ineffective transmission of data to my brain)
I hope this helps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As one of the people who has a high pain tolerance I can say from my personal experience I generally do not feel the same pain that other people do. Point in case I recently had out patient gall bladder surgery. Surgery was at 7:30 am. By that evening I was back on my feet and just taking a little tylenol to deal with what pain I was feeling. (Which mostly was just surface irritation.) When I was talking with the surgeon they told me to expect to be laid up in the bed for about a week with the pain. I returned to work 3 days later. I had a similar thing occur with getting my wisdom teeth pulled. I had a reaction to the gas so my dentist removed all 4 teeth with nothing but local anesthetic. I took tylenol that night and that was the extent of pain killers I took. </p>
<p>The caveat with my pain tolerance though is that pain medication does have little effect. If I've got a headache or sore back I can take 4 500mg tylenol or ibuprofen and feel little to no relief. The same with the few narcotics I've received from surgeries and procedures. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
