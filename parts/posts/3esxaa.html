Data shows that viewership dropped significantly for the following moon missions and networks also lost interest in broadcasting the live transmissions. Was it because the general public was actually bored or were TV stations losing money?</p>
<p>This makes me feel that interest might fall just as quickly in the future Mars One mission if that ever happens.</p></div></div>
