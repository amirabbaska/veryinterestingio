		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can cross your eyes because that's the action required to look at an object which is very close to you. You can see this by focusing on your finger and moving it towards your face; you'll end up with crossed eyes.</p>
<p>However, no matter how far away an object is, you'll only ever need both eyes pointing in exactly the same direction; you'll never need them pointing apart, and so there's no reason to be able to do that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a few replies here saying that we don't <em>need</em> to turn our eyes outward but that doesn't explain why we <em>can't</em>.</p>
<p>But now OP has got me curious,  how is it that the muscles actually don't work that way? I know my muscles can turn my left eye to the left and they can also turn my right eye to the right, so what's preventing them from doing both of those movements at once?</p>
<p>Edit: I don't care about why we didn't evolve with this trait, I'm wondering purely in present day modern human physiology why our muscles do what they do</p>
<p>So to clarify, the question is not <em>&quot;Why don't we have this trait?&quot;</em>, it's <em>&quot;Why is it that moving eyes inward vs outward are two separate traits?&quot;</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there, girl diagnosed with &quot;lazy eyes&quot; here! I can relax the muscles in my eyes, and they drift outwards, probably comparable to a 45 degree angle. Can't see things in a focused manner since my then-domimate eye takes over, but it is possible for a lot of people to make their eyes go outward. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, when I worked in a 3D mapping company we used to hold two photos side by side and you could relax your eyes to the point that you could overlay the two photos and suddenly it would pop out in 3D. Super cool. It took me about 2 weeks of trying to be able to let my eyes do this, and really I only kept at it because my other co-workers could do it. So you actually can train your eyes to go outward, but it just takes practice. The best way to explain how to do it is to &quot;relax&quot; your eyes and let them drift, then you start to be able to control the drift over time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
