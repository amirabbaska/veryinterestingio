		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're referring to flames that can be seen with the naked eye, it's usually any mixtures of alcohol and water, the &quot;coldest&quot; ones being formed by isopropyl alcohol with water mixtures and diethyl ether (150ish C). It should be noted, though, that combustion can occur even before that, at lower temperatures, but the flames can't be seen with the naked eye. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While combustion can occur with a lot of things the easiest is still oxygen.</p>
<p>To make life easy i'll use an endothermic reaction so i will burn hydrogen.</p>
<p>The lower I can go and still have both as gas is about 90K, -182C.
Hydrogen is still gas at that point.</p>
<p>You would need to create a spark artificially because of thermodynamics but technically the flame would hover around that 90K point.</p>
<p>I would love to see it happen because the flame would be some strange stuff but being endothermic it should stay cold bar your intervention to maintain it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I take it that by flames you mean fire...</p>
<p>In theory, flames are a byproduct of combustion - an exothermic reaction which gives off excess energy in the form of heat. (Reacting particles do not need the excess heat).
A cool(est) flame would be the result of combustion reaction that has the smallest enthalpy change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>At 798K all solid materials will glow red due to black body radiation. This is what you will usually see in a flame. There are other processes why you would see light at lower temperatures, e.g. ionization or excitation by electric fields, but that is usually not happening in flames. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I actually meant &quot;what is the lowest temperature at which combustion can occur,&quot; but I think the visible flame idea that y'all have begun to explain is equally interesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
