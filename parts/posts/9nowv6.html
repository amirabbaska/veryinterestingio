		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the kind of sticky since there are several phenomenons that can cause stickiness.</p>
<p>The two biggest reasons something is sticky is either because it tends to make intermolecular bonds (such as hydrogen bonding) or because it consists of long molecules that tangle up like velcro.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's two big types of adhesion, mechanical and chemical. Chemical is usually associated with tackiness, and can be both on a powerful scale (like irreversible bonds, e.g. welding, epoxy, wood glue) and weaker scale (more general tackiness, e.g. tapes and glue sticks). The irreversible bonds are made by forming actual covalent bonds between the substrate (what you stick to) and the adhesive. The weaker bonds are normally from van der Waals interactions between the substrate and the adhesive. But, if the molecules are small, the van der Waals forces just rip them away from the rest of the adhesive, and they aren't sticky, just wet (like water). You need a gigantic molecule which can't be pulled away from the bulk of the adhesive, and a polymer usually fits this nicely. So a large polymer with chemical groups which give strong van der Waals forces typically are extremely tacky. </p>
<p>Another thing that has to be taking into account is the wetting of the substrate. Solids actually have a surface &quot;tension&quot; to them, it's just called surface energy, and if the adhesive can't beat the surface energy it won't be able to make a <a href="http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roypta/368/1929/4695/F2.large.jpg" target="_blank">solid bond</a>. Since the strength of a van der Waals bond is directly proportional to the surface area of contact, if the adhesive can overcome the surface energy of the solid you'll get an extremely tacky adhesive. </p>
<p>The last thing to keep in mind is the flowability of the adhesive. If it can flow and move under slight pressure, it can get even more surface area of contact, and get even more adhesive power. These adhesives are called pressure sensitive adhesives, and are typically the tackiest things out there. The way you get a polymer to only slightly flow, but not be a complete liquid, is by manipulating its Tg, or glass transition temperature. It's exactly what it sounds like, as glass heats up, it slowly get softer, but never really hits a melting point, it just keeps flowing better and better until it's totally liquid. If your polymer has its Tg near room temperature, then it can flow around your substrate and get as much contact as possible. </p>
<p>So, to recap, the best way to make a really tacky adhesive is to get a large polymer, with a ton of van der Waals interaction potential, a low surface tension, and a Tg near room temperature. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply: sticky organics like honey are made of carbohydrates, which have lots of OH groups. These groups can hydrogen bond. Lots of H bonds are very strong. This is why a quick rinse of water will usually get rid of sticky syrup on your hands. Glue, on the other hand, reacts with air to form covalent bonds with whatever two substrates you attach. It has to dry because the reactions need to take place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
