		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A TV remote is typically made in such a way that every button is an &quot;on&quot; button for the remote itself. Meaning it uses absolutely no power when you're not pressing any buttons. So the reason is the same as for a flashlight -- when not in use it doesn't do anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many answers here mention that remotes use IR, which is one-way, while controllers use bluetooth, which is two-way. This is close to being the answer, but I just wanted to add a bit extra. </p>
<p>The important thing to note is that bluetooth is connection-oriented. Devices establish explicit connections with each other, and then either device can talk to the other over the established connection. </p>
<p>Now, because devices want to connect as soon as they can, they have to constantly be trying to connect, meaning at regular intervals they're sending out a signal just asking &quot;anyone else nearby speak bluetooth?&quot; This uses power. </p>
<p>Of course, devices can get around this by either giving up and going to sleep after a while, which means the user will have to &quot;wake up&quot; the device before it tries connecting again. </p>
<p>Another reason controllers might draw more power is that electronics just always draw a little bit of power, even when they're completely off, and more complicated electronic with more components are going to draw more idle power. And since a controller is much more complex than a remote, it draws more idle power. On top of that, since the best way to prevent this idle power loss is to physically disconnect the battery, IR remotes can just use every single button as a physical disconnection, so the battery is only even connected to anything when a button is pressed. In a controller, a bunch of components need to be on continuously, even when no buttons are being pressed (like the bluetooth radio). So, to counteract the idle power draw, controllers come with on/off switches, which can be used to physically disconnect the battery from the electronics and saving power. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A basic tv remote just blasts an ir signals into the ether depending on which circuit is completed, it’s the TVs job to receive the signal. Your game controller has to send AND receive a constant stream of very complex signals, when you aren’t using it and it’s left on it still has to sit there and constantly check if anything has changed which drains its battery. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll address it in two parts:
1) TV remotes do drain batteries but do so at a very slow pace. The basic structure to TV remotes use an LED at the infrared frequency range that characteristically blocks most current from the battery until someone turns it &quot;on&quot;. When you press a button it turns on for a short burst, then back off. You also have to program a remote when you start because the receiver at the TV only responds to a certain type of signal. </p>
<p>2) The actual use of a game controller vs a TV controller are pretty different. A TV remote signal is very directional; if you don't point it at the correct spot you don't get the channel changed or the volume changed, etc., this wouldn't be convenient for a game controller. You also care about missed inputs, having a two way connection instead of a one way connection like a TV remote means you need constant talk between the game controller and system. This means quite literally in-between all of your inputs on your game controller the system and controller are both communicating with &quot;hey I'm here &quot; and &quot; do you still see me signals&quot; on top of other things. Newer features have reinforced the need for this type of partnership (things like rumble)</p>
<p>real ELI5:
They were built to do different things, a lot of what a game controller does requires input from you and the game system. Doing this requires energy for working in both directions. Talking both ways requires synchronization as well (in order to understand each other) so that's why they use power even when not being used to make sure they are still synced (most have power saving built in to disconnect after so much time of no use)
They could have made game controllers work the same way as remotes but you wouldn't have the benefits of the feautures like rumble etc.</p>
