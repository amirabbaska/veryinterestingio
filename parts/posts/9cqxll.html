So when I show people (anyone who will lol) I dunk them in water first but I don’t know why water makes them more vibrant as I don’t see this in other objects. You might say it’s because of dust but this isn’t true because I get them wet, then they dry and become colorless without getting dusty (unless that dust is rock-seeking or something). </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons, the major one at play is that it changes how the light reflects off the surface. It consolidates the light and allows it to be seen from one direction. The water also creates a new smoother surface that is shinier bc it allows all the light to shine off of it.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's to do with the smoothness of the surface. When they're dry the surface is more irregular so light reflecting is scattered more. When wet, the surface tension of the water provides a smoother more uniform surface, reflecting light more consistently which makes the colours appear more vividly.<br />
A good habit is to put a thin layer of a clear varnish on rocks you like, to highlight the colours. This also stops certain types of stone from degrading and producing dust, meaning they aren't creating mess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with how light reflects off the surface of the material, this applies to everything, not just rocks.  (Have some experience in fine metal work in jewellery as well as lapidary work)</p>
<p>Under a microscope the surface is very rough and contains a lot of irregular peaks and valleys.  This causes light to bounce off in different directions and scatter.  Light = colour</p>
<p>Dipping a rock in water makes it wet, and since water likes to cling (it's cohesive) it fills up all the gaps to simulate a smooth surface.
The more smooth the surface, the more uniformly the light bounces back to your eyes so it appears more vibrant.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the process of jewellery making (as well as stone polishing for jewellery) is all about &quot;smoothing&quot; out the surface of various materials so it has an appealing and consistent look.  Often we even alter the finish of parts of objects to create contrast, such as how there are matte finish links in watches so the polished parts stand out more.</p>
<p>Gemstones have an added layer because they are transparent and take advantage of light passing through, but the basic principles still apply.</p>
<p>tldr : the surface of objects are rough on a microscopic level and that causes light to scatter instead of bounce back to your eyes, water smooths out that scatter and makes the surface more consistent</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
