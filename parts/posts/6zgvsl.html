		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it is a strategy used to get people in the door, much like a sale, it is ok to not make as much money on one or two items because usually when people come in they buy more than they were intending to in the first place, it happens. so to get people in the door it is actually more profitable to sell some things at a reduced price or even at a loss if it means you are making more profit on other goods and or services</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Retail stores <em>really</em> like when customer have their gift cards.  When someone buys a target gift card, it's basically* guaranteed sales for them.  By selling gift cards in other stores, they extend their reach, and make sales to customers who might not have otherwise stepped foot or thought about target in the first place.</p>
<p>In return for this extra sales opportunity, they're willing to share back a little bit of that sale to whatever company is selling the card for them.  Really popular gift cards like Apple will pay out 1% of the card value.  Less popular cards like regional restaurant will pay out a higher amount, usually up to 5%, to entire other businesses into carrying their cards.  Since most stores make much more then 5% on each sale, it's worth it to them to give a &quot;cut&quot; to some other store to sell their gift card - they'll still make a profit when the card is redeemed.</p>
<p>But even this amount would usually not be enough to get a store to sell your product.  A regular grocery store will make between 15% and 30% on every item they sell, so a 5% gift card is not very profitable.  To offset this, gift card malls (the industry term for selling other store gift cards in your store) have a few other advantages.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They're low risk.  The merchant doesn't have to buy the cards - they're given to them for free.  The cards don't have any value until activated, so theft is not a problem for the store selling them.  Compare that to regular products, which they have to pay for up front, and if they're stolen the store is out the cost of the item.  Gift cards also don't affect their on hand inventory value, which means they don't drive up insurance costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They don't take up shelf space. Shelf space in a store is a valuable commodity - most products need to be on a shelf, and the more space you have, the more stuff you can sell.  Compare a small independent convenience store to a Walmart - the reason the convenience store is crammed full of stuff is because they are trying to maximize the limited space they have.  Gift card malls can be hung on a wall, put on a spinner and shoved in a corner, or left in front of a register.  Most stores can find a space where the cards are essentially taking up 0 space that could have been filled with more profitable products.  </p>
</li>
<li>They draw in more customers.  Even if 90% of the shoppers who buy a gift card don't buy anything else, the 10% who realize they need milk and grab a gallon from the back are &quot;free&quot; extra sales the store might not have gotten anyway.  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Source</strong> - I used to work for a company that pushed gift card malls as a value added option with our POS platform, to independent grocery stores.</p>
<p>* Some people are saying stores love them because they keep the money from un-redeemed gift cards.  This isn't quite accurate.  In the US, gift cards cant expire for  at least five years.  Some states don't let them <a href="http://consumersunion.org/research/state-gift-card-consumer-protection-laws-2013-update/" target="_blank">expire ever</a>.  Businesses are required to hold the money they get from selling the gift cards in a separate holding account while waiting for the cards to be redeemed, at which point they can pull the cash into their usual revenue.  The exception is when a business shuts down, then they can take any outstanding gift card balances as cash.  Most companies would rather have the gift card redeemed quick so they can realize the revenue now, rather then wait five years, even if the payoff could be bigger.  Revenue means growth, cash sitting in an account they can't access means accounting costs.  (Edited for accuracy)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I always just assumed that they worked out a deal with those companies. Say Starbucks will sell Walmart a $25 card at the cost of $20. Now Walmart is +$5 and Starbucks is still getting at least most of their profit margin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gift card companies pay a commission to the stockist. They can afford to do this as something like 30% of all gift cards are not redeemed within their validity period. And the provider of the card (iTunes, whatever), has a profit margin on their goods. $50 of music downloads doesn't cost $50 to Apple. So the combination of unredeemed value and margin for profit more than covers the commission the retailer receives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who worked in gift card manufacturing, and spent a lot of time staring at cards, I noticed that a lot of cards have a purchasing fee. You but a card that has a certain amount on it, and you pay a small activation fee. </p>
<p>Now, looking at the physical details is about where my expertise ends, but I'd imagine that most if not all of the profits made by companies come through those small activation fees. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
