		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would attribute that perception to the fact that musical popularity was more genre-specific in the 60's, whereas now it isn't unusual to hear elements of metal, hip hop, or other genres that would have been distinguished from &quot;pop music&quot; even 20-30 years ago. The culture around protest was arguably stronger and gave artists more to identify with so there are artists like Brother Ali that come to mind whose music could certainly qualify as &quot;protest&quot; but I tend to just think about it as hip hop.</p>
<p>There's still plenty of protest music; what constitutes pop just covers more territory these days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How are you defining “protest music”? Political themes are still very prevalent in music, even the stuff on the radio. </p>
<p>This is America - Childish Gambino,
Same Love - Macklemore,
When the President Talks to God - Bright Eyes (okay this is old),
Take me to Church - Hozier </p>
<p>Just to name a few from the top of my head. </p>
<p>Edit: added commas</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Protest music had a bigger impact in the 60’s because of how the music business was structured back then.</p>
<p>You had a small number of powerful record companies and very controlled radio playlists. If an artist that was making records and getting radio time because of previous commercial success put out a protest song, that song was going to be heard by a wide range of people, including people who may not previously given a lot of thought to the circumstances behind the protest. It “spread the word”.</p>
<p>Now, there are so many ways to put out your music and so many ways to listen to it, it is difficult to get a message out to anyone beyond your normal audience (and the uninformed people who need to hear the message the most won’t be exposed to it).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my memory, protest songs are generally about wars or come during period of war.</p>
<p>While the US is still at war, it's simmered down and isn't in the front pages as much as when we first invaded Afghanistan and Iraq—during which time there was protest music.</p>
<p>Here's one I remember from early Bush years by Bright Eyes:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHCXM9TujY" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHCXM9TujY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHCXM9TujY</a></a></p>
<p>Even the Cardigans (Swedish group) song &quot;You're the Storm&quot; (allusion to Desert Storm?) that came out in 2003 seems pretty related to the recent Iraq invasion:</p>

<p>It came a bit later but Coldplay's &quot;Violet Hill&quot; was anti-war:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IakDItZ7f7Q" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IakDItZ7f7Q" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IakDItZ7f7Q</a></a></p>
<p>But in the 1960s war was on television way more than it is now, whereas it's much more sanitized for the non-military public now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;Orange man bad&quot; memes on politics subreddits arent quite the same as the race riots, an active draft into an unpopular war, and assassinations that happened in 1968.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
