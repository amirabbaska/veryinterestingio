<p>Edit: Thanks for the responses everyone, I understand it totally now. My students ask me this question every year when I teach the unit on Earth and space and every year a student asks me this, so this year I'm getting the jump on them and doing my research before they inevitably ask me. Its difficult to quench the curiosity of kids, now only to anticipate what they're follow up question Will be...</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you're confusing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time" target="_blank">sidereal time</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time" target="_blank">solar time</a>.  A sidereal day is the amount of time it takes for the Earth to rotate by 360°, and is indeed 23h56m4s.  A solar day is the interval between two successive instances of the Sun crossing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_\(astronomy\)" target="_blank">local meridian</a>.  Since the Earth moves by roughly 1° around the Sun each day, the Earth has to rotate by roughly 361° for the Sun to cross the local meridian.  In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sidereal_day_\(prograde\).png" target="_blank">this image</a>, sidereal time is the difference between the blue circles labelled &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, where solar time is the difference between the blue circles labelled &quot;1&quot; and &quot;3&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's how long it takes for a 360° rotation of the earth. Since it's also revolving around the sun it requires more than a 360° turn for the same point to be facing the sun again. Therefore, a &quot;day&quot; as we know it is more than 360° and a lot closer to 24 hours than your estimate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 4 minute discrepency is our position relative to the stars, not the sun.  We measure days by the sun, not the stars.</p>
<p>So, one day is 1440 minutes.  One orbit is 365.25 days.  So every time we've completed one <em>solar</em> day - that is, the sun has returned to the same relative position it started in, we've moved further 1/365.25° in our orbit.  Leaving the stars 1440/365.25 minutes out of place - 3.94 minutes.</p>
<p>This &quot;discrepency&quot; doesn't need to be accounted for, because once it's happened 365.25 times, the stars are back where they started.</p>
<p>The leap year accounts for that 0.25 in our 365.25 day orbit.  So you can see where 4*0.25 becomes simple.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, 23h25m4s is the length of a <em>sideral day</em>, which is the time it takes to face the same direction relevant to an object outside the solar system (such as the galactic center). A solar day (the time it takes for the sun to reach the same angle in the sky) is about 24 hours (give or take a few seconds on certain days, considering the earth moves at different speeds at different parts of its ellipse).</p>
<p>Leap years are a different kettle of fish. You see, the speed at which the earth rotates, and the speed at which it revolves around the sun are not connected, and the solar year is 365d5h48m46s (which is 11m14s less than 365.25 days) so we accumulate nearly a quarter of a day (to be specific, 24.219907407407407407407407407407%) per year, which would mean over time, our calendar would slip and we'd end up with summer in the northern hemisphere for christmas! over the course of 100 years, autumn would begin to creep into august, and spring into January, as the seasons shifted over by 24 days. So, we could add an extra day ever 4 years to fix it right? However, since the solar year is 11m14s shorter than that .25, we're now shifting 11m14s a year in the other direction. in 128 years, we'd be one day off. So we do better by NOT including an extra day on years divisible by 100. But we also knew we could do better, so we made an exception to that rule: If the year was divisible by 400 it WOULD be a Leap Year. Now it will take 3300 years to diverge for the calendar year and solar year to converge by a single day!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your math is off, we add add the lap day because the solar year is actually about 365 1/4 days, we add the extra day every 4 years to account for that. We actually had to change it a while back to account for the fact that its slightly less the 365 1/4 </p>
<p>Heres a better explanation...</p>
<p>The exact length of a solar year is actually 11 minutes and 14 seconds less than 365 ¼ days. That means that even if you add a leap day every four years, the calendar would still overshoot the solar year by a little bit—11 minutes and 14 seconds per year. These minutes and seconds really start to add up: after 128 years, the calendar would gain an entire extra day. So, the leap year rule, &quot;add a leap year every four years&quot; was a good rule, but not good enough!</p>
<p>Calendar Correction, Part II</p>
<p>To rectify the situation, the creators of our calendar (the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582) decided to omit leap years three times every four hundred years. This would shorten the calendar every so often and rid it of the annual excess of 11 minutes and 14 seconds. So in addition to the rule that a leap year occurs every four years, a new rule was added: a century year is not a leap year unless it is evenly divisible by 400. This rule manages to eliminate three leap years every few hundred years.</p>
