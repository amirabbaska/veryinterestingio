		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To work properly they need to move a large amount of air.  This means their small motors must spin impellers at a very high speed to create suction (loud).  Also any sort of muffler to reduce the sound would impair the air movement making them less effective at creating suction.  So, no matter the style the noise (with present technology) just can't be helped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, while it used to be a necessity for them to be loud, the technology exists to make relatively quiet vacuums. However, the general public is moronic and thinks that a quieter vacuum is not as powerful as a loud one. Thus, manufacturers purposefully build loud units so people think they're getting power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My in-laws had an huge unit in the basement and you could connect a hose to several sockets throughout the house. Not as loud (except in the basement ;)
But as someone pointed out you can only pick 2 and this was not a cheap system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
