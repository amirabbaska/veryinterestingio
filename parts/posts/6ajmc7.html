How is it despite all our modern technology we can't replicate the growing conditions required for truffles? Why are we dependent on pigs to find wild truffles? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can easily cultivate many mushrooms, like the common button mushrooms, oyster and shiitakes, and even psychedelic ones like liberty caps or cubensis.  What makes these mushrooms easy to cultivate is that they are happy living in their preferred medium: soil for some, like the buttons or liberty caps, or on dead wood like oysters and shiitake.</p>
<p>Truffles are <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza" target="_blank">mycorrhizal</a>, which means they are dependent on a symbiotic relationship with the roots of specific plants, in this case trees.  While we can certainly spread truffle spores in areas where the right trees grow, that relationship can't be forced, and it can take years for the mycelium to intergrow with the tree roots to the point that the mycelium is healthy and strong enough to fruit.</p>
<p>Even if this condition is met, most mushrooms require specific environmental conditions in order to fruit, so you've got to have the right climate, altitude, seasonal amounts of moisture, etc.  </p>
<p>This is the same reason that other mycorrhizal mushrooms like chanterelles are not cultivated on a large scale: they require very specific symbiotic relationships that cannot be forced or rushed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have explained that farming truffles is very expensive and slow.  On the &quot;why pigs?&quot; question, mature truffles have a distinctive smell, and they can be located by their smell.  Dogs have been trained and used, as dogs are humanity's go-to animal when it comes to scent tracking.  It turns out that pigs are much more sensitive to the specific truffle smell.  In spite of their bad reputation, pigs are quite intelligent and trainable.  They got the job by being better at it than dogs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically they depend on extremely specific soil conditions and an extensive network of tree roots. They do plant some truffles, in the sense that they set up very truffle friendly areas, and plant trees treated with truffle spores, but the whole thing takes a long time to mature, and may never bear truffles in farmable quantities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
