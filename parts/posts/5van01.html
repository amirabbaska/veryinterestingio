		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've never heard of this ever happening out side of video game titles. </p>
<p>The reason why it happens in video game series is because the generic titles of &quot;Series+Year&quot; was started with EA and when a new studio wanted to make similar sports games they needed to differentiate their version from EAs version (for example NHL 2k6 vs NHL 06 from EA) So they created the 2K version of sports games.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, linguist here and you've definitely brought up a pretty interesting point. The usage of shorthand is actually a product of cultural socialization that has happened with generation y and z; with the death of distance and instant messaging becoming more prominent with social media platforms it's often much easier for various shorthands and trends to spread; having said this 2k16  and now 2k17 is actually derived from the verbal shorthand of the year. Reading it out loud in English feels  shorter when you replace the the &quot;twenty&quot; or two - zero with 2k because 1000 is socialized to be shortened by simply the letter k. In a sense because we're so used to seeing it it spreads and provides a &quot;easier read&quot; in our minds. It's kind of like reading 1k998 when The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
