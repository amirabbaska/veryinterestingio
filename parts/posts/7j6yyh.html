		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't appear cyclic to the human eye.  It appears cyclic to the human <em>brain</em>.  </p>
<p>Our eyes can detect 3 &quot;regions&quot; of color: red, green, and blue.  If we detect some combinations of those, we typically perceive that as an &quot;in-between&quot; color.  For example, orange light stimulates both the red and green sensing cells in our eyes.  So stimulating the red and green cells is what we perceive as &quot;orange&quot;.  And, interestingly, if we just use red and green light (no orange light), we can stimulate those cells exactly the same as orange light, and so we still see orange.  In fact, that's the basis for how computer and phone displays work:  They only emit red, green, and blue light, and our brains perceive combinations of those as other colors.</p>
<p>But here comes the strangeness!  What happens when you stimulate the red and blue cells in the eye with red and blue light?  Well, your first guess is that we should perceive the color that is &quot;in between&quot; red and blue on the spectrum.  But that color is green, and we're specifically <em>not</em> stimulating the green-detecting cells in our eyes.  However, your brain isn't really capable of seeing it as two different colors (red and blue) simultaneously, so it invents a new color!  Purple!</p>
<p>That's right, purple, the color that allows our sense of the spectrum to be cyclical, <em>isn't a real color</em>.  There is no such thing as a purple photon of light.  Purple can <em>only</em> be perceived by the human brain as a side effect of the limitations of our visual system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add something extra to the excellent explanation already provided...</p>
<p>Our color vision is usually a matter of our vision system interpolating between the colors detected by our three flavours of cones in our retina. Think of it like a triangle, with red, green and blue in the corners and all the other colors somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>But then consider that a small percentage of human females are &quot;tetrachromats&quot;. For them, there are 4 types of color receptors in their retina. For them, the perceived color is interpolated between 4 different points. You have to imagine this in 3d now, like a 3 sided pyramid with 4 point of detected color, and some interpreted color point somewhere in the 3d space of the pyramid.</p>
<p>Tetrachromats may be able to distinguish 100 million colors ...</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pink/ magenta bridges the gap between red and blue. Usually there would be no specific wavelength to represent pink, however our brains made up a colour to find the average wavelength of red and blue . It couldn't be green, since this new colour should be the opposite of green. There's a great explanation by minute physics on the topic.</p>
