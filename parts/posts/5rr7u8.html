		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was playing some catch the other day with a friend of mine. He would run off down the field, and I would throw the ball, and 90% of the time it was an accurate throw to him. The other 10% was due to wind difference, so I would adjust the throw and make it to him. All of that is done automatically in our brains, and it works pretty fast. </p>
<p>Now, why is it that when we see the same situation, but on paper, it takes time to calculate all of that information. Is it because our brains see the actual numbers compared to real world events that are happening right there? Or shouldn't our brain be able to pick that information and automatically translate it, as if it were happening right there? </p>
<p>Edit: fixed wording. But man, this blew up, and got a lot of great responses for this. Initially had it marked as physics, but I see it got changed to psychology. Very interesting. Thanks for all that took time, and made the explanation better for me! </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't really compare the two.</p>
<p>In one circumstance, the brain coordinates the bodily effort required to manipulate a known object in familiar conditionsâ€”a task for which it <del>was purposely</del> evolved. In the other, you're abstracting an event into physical concepts, using the &quot;foreign language&quot; of mathematics. And even though it can be conceived perfectly in the mind in a moment, it still takes time to write it on paper.</p>
<p>What's more, no person alive could produce these results on command without years of training and practice. The mechanics of throwing a football had to be learned, just as the underlying physics had to be learned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is very powerful and good at doing that kind of parallel rough estimation - in a single instant it keeps your balance, comprehends what you'e searing &amp; hearing, makes a decision about the best way to throw the ball, etc.  Your brain is much slower at doing precise serial computations, where it has to do each step precisely before it can move on to the next step (math calculations). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no reason to believe that our brains are calculating the trajectory from a formula as we do on paper. It's much more likely that the brain is just extrapolating from its memories of other times you have thrown an object or seen an object be thrown.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read a very interesting article recently about how we know where to stand to <em>catch</em> a cricket ball or baseball. This isn't the same article, but it covers the same ground:
<a href="http://www.livescience.com/3445-baseball-players-catch-fly-balls.html" target="_blank">http://www.livescience.com/3445-baseball-players-catch-fly-balls.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Physicist Seville Chapman proposed a model to explain how players manage the path of a fly ball so that  they arrive to intercept it at just the right time. His theory, called Optical Acceleration Cancellation (OAC), used the acceleration of the ball through the vision field as a guide for player movement.</p>
<p>As a fielder watches the ball rise, he moves either forward or backwards so that the ball moves at a constant speed through his field of vision. If he moves too far forward, the ball will rise faster and may eventually fly over his head. If he takes too many steps back, the ball will appear to rise slower and will drop in front of him. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not exactly what you were asking about, but it does show what kind of mechanisms are at work, which we are quite unaware of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, your brain is not necessarily crunching numbers while you're throwing. Just adjusting muscle recruitment and motor function as necessary.
The actual on-paper physics are indeed complicated. Your body just makes it seem like it should be a no-brainer!</p>
<p>EDIT: That is to say, your brain is not inherently aware of the math behind the motion. We invented the math to articulate what forces are at play.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
