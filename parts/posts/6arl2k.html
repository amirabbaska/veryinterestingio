		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've done some research, here is what I've found:</p>
<p>Epitaxy, for those unaware, is a crystalline growth on top of a substrate (think seed). This also requires it to be grown with regard to the growths orientation, as opposed to free- forming non-epitaxal growth. There are four sub- groupings of this, depending on whether the substrate is the same as the crystalline growth, and whether you're making a mono-layer growth (often used in making silicon wafers for semiconductors) or 3d structure similar to what you'd imagine when thinking of a standard crystal growth in nature. </p>
<p>There are many ways of accomplishing this, using a vapor,  liquid, or even an amorphous solid. Vapor is the most common (in industrial usage) and is what we care about here. Note that when making a silicon layer, they use a compound such as silicon tetrachloride and hydrogen as a &quot;doping&quot; agent (what the vapor they're intending to grow with is comprised of) at a high temperature (1200-1250C). This chemical process depends highly on the proportions of the amount of each chemical compound present, as having too much of the hydrogen chloride (the result of having the silicon deposit itself) will begin reversing the process.</p>
<p>However, this is not the only way to create a silicon wafer, which is important when answering your question. Quartz is made up of silicon dioxide, and is the most abundant mineral on Earth. When creating a wafer with SiH4 instead,  it creates an oxidizing species which can contaminate the intended pure silicon with SiO2. (Quartz.)</p>
<p>When looking at examples of Quartz from nature, you see the primary difference is that the branches of growth are not properly aligned to become epitaxial. If you were to cleave a substrate into a flat plane, leave it in a suitable environment for growth to germinate, and didn't have any outside interference, you would likely get symmetrical even growth above it, which by definition is epitaxal.</p>
<p>You could do this in a lab in the same way as you make silicon wafers. Use a chemical compound to dope a substrate with silicon, allow it to oxidize into quartz, and viola. Ultimately we do not do this because there is no demand for it. We are already capable of obtaining quartz naturally very easily. (Again, most common mineral on Earth)</p>
<p>Also interesting to note is there is a product called &quot;liquid glass&quot; which actually sprays a very fine layer of Quartz onto products as a way of keeping them sterile/clean since the crystalline layer inhibits bacterial growth and makes cleaning easier. </p>
<p>Tl,dr: You can, but there is no real reason to. </p>
