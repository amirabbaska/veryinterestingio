You can observe this when salt is put on frozen streets.
It does not heat up the streets, but reduce the freezing point of the water on it, thus removing the ice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finland here. The coldest I've been out in is about -35°C (-31°F) and can absolutely confirm that your eyeballs don't freeze, probably due to the salt as others comment.</p>
<p>However, you do have to blink slightly more often (I actually found myself squeezing my eyes closed a little, about once a minute, the same as you do when you've been staring intently and avoided blinking for a while and they get dry), and you can definitely feel that the fluids are denser.</p>
<p>You'll also find that your breath instantly coats everything around it with frost. Frosty eyelashes are annoying as fuck.</p>
<p>Anything warmer than -20°C is just like any other frosty day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Winnipeg Canada here. Can confirm eyeballs don't freeze even when it's below - 40 though everything on your face tends to get frosty and if you wear glasses almost instantly ice over. Once it's around - 50 with wind if you aren't in the right layers you got about 10 mins before you freeze like a popsicle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know nothing about eyeballs but a few things about heat transfer.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of energy to change the temperature of water because of it's high heat capacity. It also takes additional energy to change the phase of water. Basically this means water can loose a lot of <em>heat</em> before it changes <em>temperature</em>.</p>
<p>Also water is a good conductor of heat, so if the front of the eyeball is exposed to cold, but the back of the eyeball is exposed to a heat source, heat can be conducted from the back of the eyeball to the front to keep the whole eyeball at a somewhat uniform temperature.</p>
<p>All of this was based on the assumption that an eyeball is a small bubble of water, which obviously can't be true. But I know they must also have blood vessels, which is an additional means of transferring heat around the eyeball. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Warm blooded creatures like snow leopards (and you) generate heat.  Skin and the surface of eyeballs doesn't get cold enough to freeze (hopefully).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
