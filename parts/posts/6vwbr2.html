		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I worked in politics, and the short answer is: it's corrupted by deceit and incentives from media-consumers. </p>
<p>And in short the phenomenon is this: there is immense social pressure in politics to not say something unacceptable (gaffes, politically incorrect, etc.). It comes with extreme punishment. At the same time great social reward to say something that gets clicks (outrageous, awe-inspiring, conflictual). So what you get out of those incentives is outrageous lies. </p>
<p>So in politics most people when they speak don't say what they actually think, they say what they think is likely to be close to what the result will be after negotiations, slightly to their side. This is not just true in the media, but also in closed political meetings, unless it is only their very closest friends present. </p>
<p>This culture of deceit makes everyone living in a constant tiring flow of lies. This has some benefits by the way, a great thing about being criticized for something you don't believe, is that you don't have to take it personally or even seriously. It wasn't your thoughts anyway. </p>
<p>When journalist usually follow-up on something they know to be untrue, they only expect another lie. So what they are watching for is actually not lies, but off-message somehow. They are looking for things that transgress the social reward mechanism of political speech.  </p>
<p>This is something which has begun to change. The corruption of untruth seems to have made people incredibly thirsty for ANY politician who say what they actually mean and actually listen to criticism. </p>
<p>I actually think this is the common thread of appeal among their supporters between wildly different politicians like Corbyn, Trump and Macron. (I know, I know, they aren't telling the truth, etc. But the point is that it often seem like they are actually saying what they think - however wrong that may be. As compared to normal politicians which usually will never say what they actually think on a subject). And if I were to advice someone doing a political campaign, I would do the same: say what you think as well as you can. </p>
<p>Same with journalists by the way. It's a corrupted culture. Any journalist could at any time stop lying, and start questioning the things they really didn't understand, or thought were false. And if you're a journalist, I would recommend doing it! You'll find yourself in a very attractive niche very quickly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of responses to OP deal with asking 'hard' questions.</p>
<p>That is a different subject.</p>
<p>What is being said is that when a journalist hears an obviously untrue answer to a question, he/she seldom challenges the politician with the lie. </p>
<p>In the UK (can't say about the US) one of the standard techniques used by politicians is to ignore the question, and simply make a statement advancing the official version.</p>
<p>&quot;Why are there no construction specifications preventing the use of highly flammable building materials in tower blocks?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's important to remember that the materials used in the construction of this block all complied with relevant regulations and/or were passed by the fire brigade and/or building control.&quot;</p>
<p>WTF? That's a totally unresponsive answer. </p>
<p>What should happen is that the interviewer should say: 'That's not what I asked. Could you address my question please?'</p>
<p>But he/she knows that the politician will simply rephrase the official line. (Can't remember which one, but one of the Republican candidates made himself a laughing stock during a candidates' debate when he repeated the same formulation 3 or 4 times, thus revealing himself incapable of paraphrasing the policy point 'on the hoof'.)</p>
<p>Since the journalist can probably read the politician well enough to know that he/she will stonewall, and since there's probably on 3 minutes 30 seconds allocated for the interview, and since the journalist probably has other questions, perhaps on unrelated matters, to ask - what does he/she do? Use up the whole allotted time in proving that the politician isn't answering the question, or ask one more time and then move on?</p>
<p>I think I would do something like this: ask the question again, move on to the other questions, and then 10 seconds before the time slot closes, say: &quot;Well I asked 7 questions during that interview and viewers/listeners will have noticed that you didn't answer 3 of them. Thank you - and now: this.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The documentary &quot;Journey with George&quot; touches on this topic pretty nicely if you want to give it a watch. A journalist (I forgot her name) follows George W Bush around during his election campaign, and becomes fairly good friends with him. </p>
<p>At one point during the film she asks a question during Bush's press conference about a recent scandal of his. Bush proceeds to completely shuts her down, refuses to answer any future questions she asks, and basically stops interacting with her at all for the next several weeks. Other journalists with her, who she had become acquainted/friends with, also began avoiding her. They feared that any association with her might put them in George's bad graces as well. It put her job in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Asking the wrong question not only isolates you from the politician, but other journalists. It becomes much harder to get a story after that, so generally they stick to the easy questions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Journalist here. I've only worked at the local government level so things may be different at higher levels. </p>
<p>When you interview someone for the most part there is a &quot;sensitive&quot; topic you want to touch on. (There are exceptions as always)</p>
<p>The difference between a good journalist vs. a mediocre one lies within eliciting answers to those questions.</p>
<p>You need to build up to questions about the sensitive issue and slowly gain the subjects trust. That's how they open up. People want to see that your there to objectively report the facts/their side of the story too, which I believe to be fair. Everyone deserves to have a voice. </p>
<p>If I just brazenly and immediately ask a question that could be seen as offensive, my subject will most likely shut down and the interview is ruined. Not just for me either, I may have done damage to my entire organization or other media outlets entirely in that persons mind. </p>
<p>For example, I had one interview with a chief of police in regards to an officer under his command caught molesting a child. The reporter originally assigned to that story told me he was a stone wall and would dance around any questions specific to the officer. I talked to him on the phone and began my interview with just a few general questions. I asked him things like &quot;how are you doing?&quot;, &quot;Are you ok?&quot;, etc, but just basic human questions. The man broke down, spilling his guts to me. In all the previous interviews media did with him everyone just asked him ballbuster straight to the facts questions and it was obvious he was close to the officer and it was weighing heavily on his heart. I got the answers that I needed and felt that I helped the man get some things off his chest that he seemingly had no other outlet for. </p>
<p>One thing people tend to forget, especially in media, is other people's humanity. At the end of the day we're only human. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Journalists and organizations that make a habit of asking hardball questions tend to get blacklisted from asking further questions. There are smaller media outlets that are more critical but you need to seek them out and they tend to rely less on interviews with politicians directly. </p>
<p>If you want a more in depth analysis of the issue, &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; by  Herman and Chomsky is pretty good place to start. If you don't feel like reading the book, <a href="https://youtu.be/AnrBQEAM3rE" target="_blank">the documentary is free on YouTube</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
