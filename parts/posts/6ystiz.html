		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is definetely <em>not</em> better to entirely relax on impact. This is a myth and I have no idea where it actually comes from.</p>
<p>For example in a car crash where you drive straight into something (the most common one), if you relax entirely your head will be whipping forward and back again really fast like a whiplash (you can probably guess where this is going...) and this may cause severe whiplash damage <em>to your spine</em> in the neck. This may cause all kinds of aches (if you are lucky) or partial paralysis if you are less lucky. By tensing you neck really hard (best thing to do is to push it back against the head rest or whatever it is, I think) in order to counteract the whipping motion of your head. Sure, you may sprain your muscles and what not, but that is <em>always</em> preferable to spine damage and will probably automatically get well after some time.</p>
<p>I am definitely no expert in the area and I hope that someone who is comes here and gives a better answer, but I do know that you should definitely not relax on impact.</p>
<p>EDIT: I removed the last edot because I learned chiropractics is not real science. English is not my main language so I originally thpugh it meant some legit thing. We don't have chiropractics in my country...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is so much bad speculation in this thread. I'm going to answer the question from my area of expertise, which is impact biomechanics, most specifically with respect to car crashes.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to remember is that in all reality, you wont be able to brace. A slow car crash of 35mph (~56 KPH) is over in roughly 150ms, which is faster than an average humans reaction time. Bracing only rarely can come into play like if you were run off the road or something and were going to crash into a tree.</p>
<p>The next most important thing is that biomechanics like me use 3 main things to design the safety systems (seat belts, air bags, etc) of cars: dummies, cadavers, and finite element models. None of these things have working muscles. The seat belt pretensioners and airbags are carefully timed to fire at the right time to cushion the crash of these effectively complicated ragdolls. There is a possibility that if we knew how bracing effected the impact, we could design cars to accommodate that, but we cant test volunteers at levels that would be useful.</p>
<p>Final point. Lets say you brace. That low impact of 35mph could easily have your body accelerating relative to the car by 30 g's. For reference, a g is the strength of the gravity on earth. The sun has gravity of 28 g's, so unless you are strong enough to do a pushup on the sun, your arms could still snap like spaghetti if you are braced with your arms locked. If you dont have your arms locked (but are still using them to brace), you just delay your body moving, and you can actually increase the accelerations your brain (and the rest of your body) is exposed to. This is supported by research showing that with volunteer impacts, some of the accelerations/forces are increased when the volunteers are given a countdown prior to the impact so they can brace.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your statement about being relaxed in impact is way too general. Like in many things in life it depends on the situation. </p>
<p>But before going into it, the first thing to note is one of Newton's laws, from which the equation F = ma comes from. It means force = mass * acceleration. </p>
<p>So in the case of falls which you specified in one of your comments, if you were to remain rigid - locking your knees for example - when you hit the ground you would almost instantly decelerate to a stop. This would mean the force acting on you would be immense, which would cause injury. </p>
<p>Rather than staying relaxed, it would be more accurate to say that prolonging the time in which you decelerate would lessen injury. Just like how people who do free running roll after a big jump. </p>
<p>As an example, let's say you take 0.1s to completely decelerate to a stop when rigid and 0.4s to stop if you roll. You would reduce the amount of force acting on you to a quarter of its original value. Of course this is a very simplified version but this is more or less the point. </p>
<p>In the case of things like punches and such, it is better to tense up like other redditors have mentioned. This is because even if you reduced the force by relaxing and allowing the punch to create an impact over a larger time, the force would be distributed over your internal organs which would cause injury. </p>
<p>By tensing up your muscles, even though the force is much higher it is almost fully absorbed by your muscles as they now act as a hardened barrier - akin to armor - protecting your more squishy parts. And muscles can take a lot more than punishment your squishy parts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This idea might come from the belief that drunk people get less serious injuries in accidents because they're more limp.</p>
<p>But it would appear that this is not the case - rather, <a href="https://www.livescience.com/24979-alcohol-injury-outcome.html" target="_blank">a study found drunk people are likely to suffer the same level of injuries, but are more likely to survive</a>.  The reason, as a matter of speculation, is that alcohol blunts the body's injury response, which is actually what kills people who have suffered trauma.  Our injury response might have been helpful in less severe injuries, but in injuries that would have been deadly before, they become counterproductive to modern medical intervention.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medic here. It is NOT good to completely relax and it is indeed dangerous. Let me give a example in what we call whiplash. In a whiplash incident we have your head going forward then aggressively back again. The problem is your brain is still going with the momentum cause what is called a cou / contra-cou injury. Your brain smashes against the front of your skull then the back of your skull. If you were to tense up in say a forward collision putting your weight into the seat. You will probably have a sprain but will most likely avoid the whiplash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
