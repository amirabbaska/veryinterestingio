		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chemist - There are lots of acids that could damage a jacuzzi, depending on what it's made of.  There are specific interactions to watch out for, but as a general rule, higher concentrations cause more damage. Perhaps you could specify what you are doing?</p>
<p>There are a number of acids that you can get for household use: vinegar (acetic acid), muriatic acid (HCl), battery acid (H2SO4), and many rust removers (usually phosphoric acid). Plastics and glass generally tolerate acids in low concentrations well, but plastics shouldn't be used with nitric acid, because it is a strong oxidizer. Metal components will react with strong acids like HCl and H2SO4. And if your jacuzzi is made of stone/marble, avoid acetic acid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>OTOH, I had a black spa that peeled in places due to being empty and exposed to sunlight on a 40 deg C day. Looked like someone had poured acid on it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Manage a pool store.</p>
<p>Anything below 7.0 pH will accelerate the breakdown of the heat exchanger. 7.0 is &quot;neutral&quot; pH anything below it is considered acidic. Metals dont like acids and break down into the water. As more metal enters the water the pH continues to fall into a sort of &quot;downward spiral&quot; it's not the end of the world and can be managed.</p>
<p>Most hot tubs are acrylic and fiberglass. The chemical used to lower the pH in the spa is sodium bisulfate. Sulfates are slowly built up in the water but are not a problem for the tub.</p>
<p>BTW use a scale control to help that heat exchanger last a little longer, hot water will &quot;push&quot; the calcium out of the water in the form of scale (like your shower head or faucets) having a nice layer of calcium on the exchanger coats it like your house plumbing helping to protect it from the water. You just dont want too much so the control helps.</p>
<p>If you're on a well be sure to test your water for pH, alkalinity, metals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>These caustic chemicals wouldn't normally be in a hot tub unless they had serious plumbing problems often (sulfuric acid), we're etsy soap kingpins (lye), or were tyring to make a giant batch of meth (uses both).    </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey! I know I'm late to the thread, but I work at a pool store and I don't see anyone here mentioning Phosphates. They're in lots of household cleaners like spray counter cleaner. The phosphates in the cleaners &quot;eat up&quot; any chlorine/bromine/biguanide in your spa so you won't get any sanitation (which is the most important step in keeping your spa clear). The sanitation is the residual of chemical that is constantly kept up at about 1-2ppm if chlorine, 3-5ppm if bromine, and ~50ppm if biguanide. This constantly is killing algae and bacteria so you don't suddenly wake up one morning with a cloudy/green spa. Just stay far away from phosphates. And to go off of other posts, you shouldn't be too worried about acids in your spa as long as your pH doesn't fall below 7.0 for an extended period of time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
