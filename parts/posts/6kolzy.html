		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In your specific example of large companies being bought, there are generally two forms of consideration (payment): cash and/or stock.  In the case of stock, the acquired company will be issued stock in the acquiring company.  In the case of cash, the acquired company generally doesn't care where it comes from, just that it comes.  The sources could be cash on hand, or raising debt or equity from a 3rd party.  In terms of how the cash is transferred, it's almost always via Fed wire.  Someone above mentioned using escrow agents, but they're usually only used for a portion of the purchase price held back for post-closing purchase price adjustments (working capital or indemnification).</p>
<p>Source: used to do large M&amp;A transactions.  Still have a copy of a $60 Billion wire I sent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest banks in the world does handle multi billion dollar transactions on a daily basis. But of course you may want to handle these types of transactions with care as you do not want that amount of money sitting idly in a bank account for long. What you do with it depends a lot on how the economy of your business is structured and what type of transaction it is. Normally when you buy a business there are a lot of different investors who are the recipient of the money. So there is not a lot of money going to each one. And the money may also be in form of stock in the buying company so that the investors have the option to continue their investments.</p>
<p>However in normal business deals that end in a huge transaction the transaction is expected and the company will have time to arrange how to spend the money. Some of it may be given out as dividend to the investors as soon as the transfer is complete. Most likely the money will be spent to pay down loans or bonds. If there are plans to spend the money on a later date it is usually invested on the money market.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Surprisingly, it's pretty mundane - pretty much just transferring money from one account to another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are often done in the form of escrow services by banks. If a company wants to purchase another, a mutually agreed upon bank will act as the escrow agent. There's also the use of MT799 and MT760. These are messages sent by one bank to another as a &quot;proof that x amount of funds exist in this bank account&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
