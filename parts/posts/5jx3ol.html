		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, to tell the truth, they do, or at least <em>can</em>. If you said &quot;That's gotta be at least a megameter from here&quot;, it might take a moment to figure it out, but most people familiar with metric measurements would understand after a moment's thought.</p>
<p>The reason we don't see such terms in common use is mostly because we generally use terms of measurement for values that we would commonly work with- it's easier to say &quot;ten megabytes&quot; instead of &quot;ten thousand kilobytes&quot;, so when we started working with larger values of storage, the word fell into common usage.</p>
<p>Also and even more importantly, because kilometers and kilograms are used to measure values we can physically observe, we've started thinking of them atomically- that is, when you think of a &quot;kilometer&quot;, you're not really thinking &quot;a thousand meters&quot;, you're just thinking &quot;1 kilometer&quot;. Breaking it into smaller pieces simply doesn't happen. If it's less than a kilometer you'd probably think &quot;half a kilometer&quot; instead of &quot;500 meters&quot;.</p>
<p>As an aside, back in the early 80's, &quot;megabyte&quot; was the biggest value for anything computer-related. I remember when I first saw a hard drive measured in gigabytes- it was a strange moment because I had no idea what it meant for a moment. Now, it's the most common term for computer memory storage because they're all measured on that scale.</p>
<p>Anyway, back on track. We don't say &quot;megameter&quot; and &quot;megagram&quot; mostly because in our minds, &quot;kilometer&quot; and &quot;kilogram&quot; are the base units. We may know intellectually that, yeah, a kilometer is a thousand meters, and a kilogram is a thousand grams, but we still think of them as single units, so it's easier shorthand for our brains to say 1000 kilometers and 1000 kilograms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Megagam and Megameter exist. We just don't use them frequently because they don't really apply in out day to day lives.</p>
<p>Power and Computer power increase so fast that what we use in our day to day live increase with it. We used to have MB hard drive, then GB and now TB is common place, so the word we use the most vary over time because the technology change over time.</p>
<p>But a Megameter is 1000 km. We just don't travel this distance very often. In most of our live we could use Megameter in some occasion like when we travel in planes, but it represent such a small percentage of the distance in our lives that we just don't bother with Megameter and stick with Km.</p>
<p>Astronomer would use Mega and Giga meter more often because they speak a lot more about vast distance than most human do. Just like people that work on a small scale use nanometer often so they use that term a lot more than normal people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do. The SI prefixes can be used with any SI unit - the megameter and megagram are exactly what you'd think they'd be. You just don't see these units used as frequently. We don't talk about distances on the scale of megameters very often, and when talking about masses on the order of megagrams, the word &quot;tonne&quot; tends to be used instead (though this is actually the same unit - 1000kg).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything here is a prefect explanation but I would like to add that for memory(kilobyte) we kind of just do what we want. The normal metric system prefixes are <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.enotes.com/5a145e1aacdd809cec35342ffef9cf4011753f2c_thumb.gif" target="_blank">HERE</a>. Metric starts 10^±1 and goes to 10^±18. We don't really use deka or hecto cus they are kind of redundant for common speech. In the case of memory things start at base or to the 0th power and go up to the 10^24 or 10^80 (Decimal and Binary). There is no deka or hecto and the last is yottabyte which is not part of the metric system.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually do use megameter all the time, at least in my own thinking. I find it's an extremely useful unit for driving distances. Half a megameter, three megameters... Also for shorter-range space applications. The moon is 380 Mm away, instead of 380,000km. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
