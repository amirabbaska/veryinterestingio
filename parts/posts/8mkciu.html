		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body's process to synthesize vitamin D from the sun is self regulating, consequently you can't synthesize excessive amounts. Supplements bypass this regulation and humans can get hypervitaminosis D -- too much vitamin D. It's rare, but certainly a difference between the two.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In terms of the mention of overdosing on Vitamin D for typical adults...</p>
<p>Overdose causing some noticeable symptoms and negative effects, can occur if you take 60,000 IU per day. </p>
<p>Since many Vitamin-D bottles contain 1000 IU per capsule... </p>
<p>you'd have to take like 60 pills per day, over the course of many weeks, or a few months to experience an over dosage! </p>
<hr />
<p>For a more dangerous overdose you'd have to consume 1,000,000 IU per day, over the course of several days... </p>
<p>which is like 1000 pills per day! (so several bottles PER DAY worth). </p>
<hr />
<p>NOTE: </p>
<p>Some people react strongly to certain vitamins in ways that others do not. So if you notice any ill effects what-so-ever, obviously you will want to lower the dosage, or stop it all together. </p>
<p>But in general, from what I've read, it is recommended that you do NOT exceed 10,000 IU (10 pills) per day, just to be on the safe side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you do not have working kidneys, there is no difference since the body cannot convert Vitamin D to a usable form; that process takes place in the kidneys. Thus you must take a Vitamin D analog - prescription only - that is the usable form.</p>
<p>It's not an exact science. Vitamin D allows the absorption of calcium but if your serum calcium is already high you can run into hypercalcemia, though you'll likely get sick before that happens and adjust your dose downward. Any kind of Vitamin D supplementation - whether prescription or OTC, such as D3 - is going to affect three things: your calcium, your phosphorus and your parathyroid hormone (PTH). These are all minerals associated with bone metabolism. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Orally supplemented Vitamin D usually comes in a D2 and D3 mixture. D2 (ergocalciferol) usually comes from plants, and D3 (cholecalciferol) is what our body &amp; skin makes and what we get from meat/fish/milk.</p>
<p>Both are absorbed, activated, and used by the body in the same way. So to answer your question specifically: They both affect the body the same way.</p>
<p>The difference is just that oral supplementation comes with the risk of overdose. which would result in several symptoms associated increased calcium in the blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There should be no difference between the two, you don't actually absorb vitamin d from the sun, your cells create vitamin d when exposed to certain wave lengths of solar radiation which is then used throughout the rest of your body. </p>
<p>Vitamin d is nothing more than a chemical that we have since learned to synthesise so that if you are ever in a situation where you can't be exposed to a sufficient amount of solar radiation to meet your vitamin d quota or your body has a problem creating a sufficient amount of vitamin d then an oral supliment just introduces the same chemical your body would have created on its own, just without the radiation </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
