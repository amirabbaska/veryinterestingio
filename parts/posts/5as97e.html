		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't, and it's a myth perpetuated by Arm &amp; Hammer because it sells baking soda.</p>
<p>The idea is that the sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) molecules will latch onto drifting smelly molecules, blowing around in the fridge, reducing the smell. But there can be a lot of smelly molecules in your refrigerator, more than will happen to drift past the baking soda. Something that would aid this process is a LARGE SURFACE AREA. This means the molecule itself having a large surface area, and that it's spread out over a large space, like a cookie sheet. But everyone leaves the baking soda in the box, leaving a very small effective surface area.</p>
<p>The baking soda has to be replaced regularly because it does a better job absorbing moisture and getting moldy. And because Arm &amp; Hammer says so. Literally. Their commercials say put it in your fridge, open the box, and change it every 6 months. Assholes.</p>
<p>If you want to effectively filter the air in your fridge, you would be far, far better off using activated charcoal (a very common filter medium) that has a huge molecular surface area (hence why it's called activated, and not just charcoal), and spreading it over a cookie sheet.</p>
<p>If you want to actually effectively fight the smells in your fridge - clean your fridge regularly and wipe up condensation. And don't let frost build up in the freezer - that alone can be the source of smells you won't believe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept is that volatile organic chemicals react irreversibly with sodium bicarbonate. Butyric acid (from rancid butter) would react with sodium bicarbonate to produce carbon dioxide and sodium butyrate which is non-volatile and consequently doesn't smell. Many stinks are caused by organic amines and would not react with baking soda. Maybe it would be more effective to use a non-volatile acid (vinegar might be too volatile) and baking soda in separate containers. Kickstarter here I come!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not about baking soda, but I worked for a rental company, and the fridges we'd get back could be pretty--well, <em>really</em>--stinky.</p>
<p>This works on an empty fridge: Unplug it, get some newspaper (or save up a few weekly circulars, as long as it's that cheap newsprint paper). Crumple up the sheets and stuff the refrigerator and freezer. Shut doors. Next day, remove the newspaper and the horrible odors are gone, including fishy smells.</p>
<p>Be sure to wear an old long-sleeved shirt and plastic gloves, and have a big trash bag ready. The ink on the newsprint gets all runny, so it can be a bit messy. </p>
<p>Wipe down the interior with your basic cleaning spray, and it's like new.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've just watched the episode of The Simpsons when a bear is loose in Evergreen Terrace and Homer says he'll be ok locked inside the house as long as he's got beer.  He looks inside the fridge and all there is are boxes of baking soda. I didn't understand that until this thread.</p>
<p>I had no idea putting baking soda in the fridge was a thing people did. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
