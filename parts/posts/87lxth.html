		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>N.B. - This answer is oversimplified for what OP wanted. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/87lxth/say_we_scale_down_an_aircraft_proportionately_say/dwe4msv/" target="_blank">Correct answer was given in the following comments</a></p>
<p>Volume has a cubed relationship with length, surface area has a squared relationship. </p>
<p>Weight reduces faster than surface area when scaling linear dimensions, which means smaller objects require less lift per unit area. </p>
<p>In air disturbances become more severe at small sizes because of the loss of mass/inertia. </p>
<p>These are general statements, but they should illustrate that a linear scaling does not hold at all. <del>I think drag coefficient on wing profiles will stay constant but almost other variables change.</del> see below </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
