		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> <em>Dust mostly is gone because the wind dies, air is moister and cooler and so conducts smells better, there's not as many &quot;bad smells&quot; that you get from a hot sun, and a lot of plants that bloom at night smell awesome.</em></p>
<p>So, lots of reasons. Let's get started.</p>
<p>The first reason is that evening air during the summer usually comes with a reduction in wind. If you're living in a dusty area, such as a city with lots of concrete or a rural place that's off a dirt road, all the wind dying means the dust or grit settle out, and the air &quot;feels&quot; cleaner and no longer carries the smell of all that dirt.</p>
<p>Second, sun bakes asphalt surfaces and makes any spilled gas, tar or rubber on them smell stronger. At night, this heating effect goes away and so does its acrid smell (as does a lot of car exhaust). You might not notice it being there during the day, but you will likely notice it not being there as much at night.</p>
<p>Next, the air's moisture content goes up and its temperature goes down. We smell things much better when the air is moist. You can see this yourself by going out of a room where someone had a shower with scented soap and then going back into it - the wave of moist air smells a lot stronger - or going into a room with an indoor chlorinated pool. This can be amplified a LOT if there's a late-day shower that passed through.</p>
<p>And a lot of night-flowering plants like jasmine have really nice smells because they rely on scent rather than visible light to attract the types of creatures that pollinate them. A summer's evening near a jasmine hedge is wonderful.</p>
<p>Probably other reasons too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something like smell is quite objective really. Likely, it’s connected to memory and the whole nostalgia. I read somewhere that olfactory sensory perception (smelly sense) is connected to memory somewhere. So it’s probably the smell reminding you of pleasant memories in which you reminisce in the nostalgia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey this is a great question! I live in Kerala, India and it’s known as “God’s own country” and constantly has this peaceful feeling which seems to be atmospheric- it is present in the daytime as well as the night. I don’t know why it is like this, maybe all of the greenery and trees. It isnt any particular scent like jasmine, just the air FEEL PEACEFUL. I dont have any answers just hoping some genius might be able to answer this question for both of us. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not quite the same but this article offers some insight and has sources. We tend to have sensory favor to things that others around us do as well as the ability to associate sensory impulses with past experiences. I knew someone who was triggered by the color red as they had a traumatic experience involving that color. I’m sure someone who had a traumatic experience when they were experiencing that smell, they would not have the same emotional response. Thank god no one murdered my family around fresh cut grass or right before a spring rain :)</p>
