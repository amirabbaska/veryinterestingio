		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surgeon here:  big misunderstanding in these comments.  The fat of the abdominal wall (that able to have les invasive liposuction) is cosmetically displeasing, but not generally what is considered metabolically harmful. Visceral fat is that surrounding organs, filling the body.  That fat is usually implicated in metabolic disease.  This fat would be extremely dangerous to remove as it would put major organs at high risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Visceral fat is not necessarily dangerous in and of itself but is associated with insulin resistance leading to type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.</p>
<p>Secondly, visceral fat doesn't exactly pile up in specific spots. If your organs are rocks, visceral fat is kind of like the dirt packed around them. It's all over the place and fills a lot of space. This is compared to subcutaneous fat that can be removed  in liposuction, because it's found just under the skin and is kind of in a different layer from the vital organs.</p>
<p>Another issue is that fat is vascularized, meaning that it bleeds. Surgery is performed with a specific goal in mind and is planned to achieve that goal in the least invasive and most efficient way possible. We've stopped cutting people wide open to remove an appendix and instead do these surgeries laparoscopically (could be it's own ELI5) because the least damage possible is done. Surgery is very much something we do when we can't accomplish something in a different way.</p>
<p>Removing visceral fat would be a very long, very bloody surgery that would basically be like digging up a lot of dirt in a lot of places. Think tearing up your backyard. If you did it, it would be a big operation with lots of bleeding and a horrendously long recovery. It's just not practical. Surgery is very traumatic to the body, and this would be a massive one.</p>
<p>There are far more practical options - namely lifestyle modification. It's free, no medicines, no surgery, and has the best outcomes. Bariatric surgery to promote catabolism would also decrease visceral fat if lifestyle modification failed.</p>
<p>Tl;Dr - Cutting things out is kind of a last resort. Cutting out visceral fat is not practical and would be very dangerous because of where it is in the body (everywhere).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of misconceptions. First, visceral fat covers the visceral organs. Removing that could be dangerous. The kidneys in particular need that fat to maintain their position in the body. Second, surgeons don't routinely remove anything that doesn't need to be removed in surgery. Third, open abdominal surgery is anything but routine. If at all possible, scopic surgeries are safer and don't require the massive trauma of opening the part of the body that contains so many vital organs.</p>
<p>One last thing, fat is incredibly vascular. Cutting into body fat makes a bloody mess. It could lead to serious hemodynamic complications.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Visceral fat typically exists in places like the mesentry - a connective tissue that carries the small blood vessels too and from the bowel. You can’t really ‘cut out’ the fat cells that are intrinsic to this tissue, and also there is huge risk to damaging the critical vessels to the bowel. You can take out big chuncks of fat in your subcutaneous tissues because that’s all there is in that space between the skin and muscles/deeper tissues</p>
<p>And as other people have said, it’s the cause of the visceral fat that puts you at risk for heart disease etc, not the fact that you have visceral fat</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
