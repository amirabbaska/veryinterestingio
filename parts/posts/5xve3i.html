		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't bad for our health.  They are essential for life.  When we lived in the wild those were the things that retained water best for us (salt), and had the highest calories (sugar and fat).  Our brains don't know they live in a time where food=fridge in a sense, so it is still in 10,000 BC where when you find sugary and fatty food you pig out on it to gain fat to hold over until you can get your next bit of fat.  </p>
<p>Think of a gas engine.  Give it gas, and it functions.  Give it 40L of gas and it will function longer.  Give it 100L of gas and it will function even longer than with 40L. Sure, it'll weight more having a bigger tank attached to it, but It'll just keep humming along for that much longer because it has that much more gas.  The gas engine will only last as long as it has gas, and because it doesn't have knowledge of when it will consume some again it will allow you to fill it as much as possible.  Exactly like the body.</p>
<p>That part of the brain only functions in the now you could say, and that is why it goes &quot;FAT/SUGAR/SALT!!!! GIMME GIMME!!!!!!!!&quot; because it knows that eating 1lb of those foods will make it survive far more than foods with very little of it.  So due to being &quot;cut off&quot; from the other parts of the brain that could think &quot;we can just eat more in 3 hours....fat ass&quot; it will just forever crave it as long as it knows it's in front of you.  </p>
<p><strong>Edit/sidenote:</strong>  It's trans fats that are bad for us, processed sugars(in relations to it often being found in empty calories), and TOO MUCH of those.  All those metals we need in our body do wonders for us, but my god can they do damage to us if we consume too much of them.  Much like anything we consume: moderation.  It's all good in moderation, and all bad without. Look at fibre.  It can constipate you, but can also give you diarrhea.</p>
<p><strong>Edit2:</strong> Should've mentioned a bit more detail about sugar.  Its the only energy source for the brain. While people explained to me we, as mammals, can make our own. With that being said, it is still easier to just consume some instead of making the body do it all itself.  </p>
<p><strong>Edit2b:</strong> I have been informed by many of you that recently science has discovered that the brain can survive on ketones made by the liver with fats.</p>
<p><strong>Edit3:</strong> Thanks for the gold and the upvotes everyone!  </p>
<p><strong>Edit 4:</strong> Many people pointed out I screwed up on my explanation when I said sugar=high calories. What I should've/wanted to say was that sugary foods were highly beneficial to our survival due to often being rich in nutrients (apples, berries, etc), and being found in abundance (apple tree with 800lbs of apples).  I didn't mean to make it sound like gram to gram sugar (carbs) has more calories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As humans, we're only separated by about ~20,000 years from our hunter/gatherer ancestors. That period of time is extremely short in terms of evolution so although we live completely different lifestyles, our bodies have not changed much.</p>
<p>We crave sugar, fat, and salt because they were &quot;healthy&quot; back in those days just because of how rare those things were to our hunter/gatherer ancestors. Being able to eat the calorie dense sugar and fats means that we would be able to survive more days without food, improving our overall &quot;health.&quot; We needed salt to replenish all the salts lost through sweat because humans are built for endurance running (early human hunters would jog along until the prey runs out of energy). The humans who didn't crave sugars, fats, and salt would not build up enough energy and wouldn't survive as well as those who did crave them.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the food industry takes advantage of our primitive brain cravings to sell us more food. Normally, a person only eats a constant amount of food. If that was the case, for the food industry, the profits will never increase. They have to make people eat more food to generate profits. Thus, there is a strong incentive to put more sugars, fats, and salt in our foods so we eat more of it, regardless if it was healthy for us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not bad for our health, in the amounts we &quot;naturally&quot; get it.  </p>
<p>We're programmed to seek out the biggest bang for the buck, nutritionally speaking.  For most of our history, resources were scarce, so we needed to be encouraged to seek out the stuff that would do us the most good.  That's why we like those flavors.</p>
<p>The problem is in modern time, that scarcity doesn't exist anymore, but we're still programmed to act like it does.  If you eat &quot;bad&quot; stuff in moderation, you'll be fine.  It's only when you regularly gorge (eat more than you burn) that it really becomes a problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our instincts and tastes evolved long before we became civilized and technologically advanced.</p>
<p>In our natural, pre-mega-technological state, things that are bad for us to overeat were rare and valuable to our diet - salts, sugars and fats were hard to get, and virtually impossible to get too much of. </p>
<p>In small amounts they are all vital to our health, making us strong and powerful. This positive effect became a strong selective force that pushed us to evolve the instinctual desire to eat them.</p>
<p>Lethargy and bad body habits were also difficult to achieve - you didn't have a choice to sit in an air-conditioned apartment and binge netflix. You had to interact with community/nature for food, materials and entertainment. Any extra rest you could 'steal' was a bonus, so we evolved to desire lethargy even though we couldn't maintain it. It used to be impossible.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2017, we mass-produce everything and live cushy lifestyles. The impossible combination of sloth and overeating is now possible. Our instincts are outdated, but they don't kill us before child-bearing age. Thus we are unable to evolve a counter-balancing set of instincts, stuck in the loop of the desire to eat chocolate cake until diabetes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt is only bad for you if your organs already don't function well and/or are unable to drink enough potable water.</p>
<p>Fats aren't bad for you, with the exception of artificial trans fats, which are only possible to make with modern industrial methods. With the exception of trans fat studies, there is a dearth of studies on the health effects of dietary fat that are focused on healthy populations, with control groups, that account for lifestyles and food quality in general.</p>
<p>Naturally occurring sugars tend to be fine because they're packed with water and fiber and it's neigh impossible to match a Western diet without processed foods. As with trans fats, processing makes them bad for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
