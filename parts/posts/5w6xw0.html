		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an international student in China who is also an American citizen. I go to an American international school with an American curriculum. </p>
<p>In my experience, people tend to stick with people of a common nationality. The Americans at my school stick with the Americans, the Koreans with the Koreans, and the local Chinese with the local Chinese. As a result, exposure to different cultures is dampened.</p>
<p>The main requirement to go to our school is that you cannot be a Chinese citizen- local Chinese are only allowed to go to our school if they get special permission from the Chinese government. As a result, the only local Chinese students that go to our school have strong connections with the Chinese government and therefore are not likely to rebel against their beneficiaries. (Believe me, our school wants to take in local Chinese to improve their numbers and to make money- especially as more and more companies are deciding to send foreigners who don't have families- but they simply aren't able to because the government won't allow them to).</p>
<p>American media has a very warped view of how Chinese people view government. People tend to not care about political issues until it directly affects them- for example, the only problem most people at my school actually complain about is the Great Firewall of China (we all use VPNs) and slow internet. </p>
<p>Chinese values also tend to put safety over freedom. I was at a family dinner recently with a couple of local family friends, and one of the girls there is at a top local private school and planning on going abroad for education at an American university. All anyone could talk about was Trump and safety (they were concerned about sexual assault in the US- the university she wants to go to is notorious for being an unsafe campus, although the education is superb). Another girl with a green card for the US hadn't gone back since Trump arrived due to safety and immigration concerns (she had gone to a top American university- Ivy League type- but I won't name it for privacy). So yeah, like you said, America is hardly a shining beacon of hope and democracy. </p>
<p>Many Chinese exchange students even leave the US after their education with a <em>stronger</em> sense of nationality- <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/magazine/the-parachute-generation.html" target="_blank">the New York Times has covered Chinese exchange students extensively</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Itâ€™s a common sentiment among Chinese students abroad, who find that their foreign experiences sharpen their sense of national pride. Over the summer, Korbin started delving into Chinese history books and training in kung fu. In America, he found his Chinese core.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TL;DR The Chinese government has it under control. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chinese students in America are not ordinary Chinese people. They are typically from well-off families, families who are well-off because they are connected to the government or part of it. Though China is experiencing a growing middle class and more ordinary people are likely finding it possible to send their children abroad, many Chinese students will be the children of elites. </p>
<p>As such, they are already benefiting extensively from the government and would see (consciously or otherwise) less of a reason to oppose it.</p>
<p>In my own personal experience, the students can also be insular. They stick to groups of Chinese students. That means less of an opportunity to be exposed to other views.</p>
<p>Additionally it's very easy for people to succumb to false equivalency. Regardless of your own political views, worldwide faith in the U.S. as a shining example of democracy has gone down considerably. Foreigners hear about how Clinton won the popular vote by 3 million yet isn't President. They hear about how we have the highest incarceration rate in the world (barring a tiny island country by the name of Seychelles). They hear about our government surveillance. It'd be exceedingly easy for a Chinese student to tune out any criticism of his native government when this &quot;shining example of democracy&quot; has problems like that.</p>
<p>So overall, no, I don't think Chinese officials are particularly worried. America has the top universities in the world, and China knows that to become the top dog they need an educated elite. It is also partly propaganda on our own end that we think the average Chinese person would want their government to be toppled if they only knew the facts. They're much more concerned about economic growth. As long as that chugs along, most people are happy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>TLDR: Nothing really, since it is untrue that Chinese people are heavily oppressed and interested in toppling the government as portrayed in US media.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you worried American/Western students might change their views? </p>
<p>Why not? </p>
<p>Most of what we know is what was taught to us by other people. That's true for everyone! That means we can never really be <em>totally</em> sure if something is truer or better than another thing except!... when we take the time to learn all about it and measure it ourselves. Whether that's about the number of your friends' toys or what's right or wrong... But none can actually measure everything! So we need to think about <em>why</em> we believe something someone else tells us!
Do they actually know better or is what they say made up so they can seem smart or wise? Does it match what other people say and, if not, what are the differences and where do they come from?</p>
<p>If your friend tells you baseball is better than football you wouldn't just believe him would you? But you won't know why he thinks that and what might be cool about baseball that you hadn't heard before until you ask her.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It is a shame there is so much anti-Chinese propaganda on Reddit.  The government isn't at all worried nor are the people worried about the government in daily life.  Westernization is seen as progress in most respects, with the decadence part the only one that is ridiculed.  The majority of Chinese people have already accepted some level of (specifically) American culture.</p>
<p>America does not have a great reputation among many countries in the world and yet we (the American people) and our government rarely worry about them (unless they are traveling to a Muslim country).  There are plenty of people throughout the world who believe that America is a country that was founded through the violent exploitation of natives and supported by slave labor until industrialization which then led to horrific conditions for factory workers, may of them who were immigrants, all the while polluting the lands.  After we wised up and realized &quot;Hey, why wreck our lands when we can go abuse other nations&quot; and launched military operations across the globe, and we then have the gall to criticize other nation's actions.  But our students show up in those communities mostly because they want to study and broaden their horizons, not because they are willing/able to be indoctrinated.</p>
<p>We just assume those kids traveled abroad to drink and party heavily in an exotic locale, and not that they have become radicalized against us.  Unless again of course they traveled to a predominantly Muslim country which then the government does have a critical concern.</p>
<p>Edit: Just a quick personal side note on the internet censorship in China.  I was able to play Runescape so I didn't give two sharks about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
