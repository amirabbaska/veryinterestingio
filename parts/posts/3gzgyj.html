		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 'cicada years' every 13 and 17 years in the eastern US, where cicadas emerge by the fucktillions and take over everything. </p>
<p>But there are a few cicadas every year. I find them and their molted shells all over my yard, and I hear them buzzing away. What are <em>these</em> cicadas? The ones that pop up even when it's not a 'cicada year'. </p>
<p>Are they the same species as either the 13 or 17 year cicada, but a year out of sync? Are they late comers or early bloomers whose development cycle missed a year and caused them to miss the party, and so they pop up without anyone else around to mate with? Or is there a stable population of these cicadas each year that have drifted out of sync thousands of years ago - if so, will they diverge into a separate species after enough time? It seems like this would be a remarkable sort of allopatric speciation that's happening- instead of the population being divided by a river, they get separated by a year in their life cycle. Or is that crazy because their life cycle is very rigidly 13/17 years and there's just no way in hell they're deviate from that?</p>
<p>Is it all of these or none of these? Or are the cicadas this year a different species entirely? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all Cicadas are on the 13 or 17 year cycle.  There are shorter cycle cicadas that show up every year in August.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada#Life_cycle" target="_blank">Most cicadas go through a life cycle that lasts from two to five years. Some species have much longer life cycles, such as the North American genus, Magicicada, which has a number of distinct &quot;broods&quot; that go through either a 17-year or, in some parts of the world, a 13-year life cycle.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The big 13 and 17 year broods, however, have a much higher population and are far more noticeable.  But every August around where I am (Chicago) I hear the regular whirr of Cicadas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several (hundreds?) of species of annual cicadas, and even the 13 and 17 year periodic cicadas (genus Magicicada) have different broods such that some will be emerging in most years. Each brood has a slightly different geographical range. This year, brood 5 was scheduled, with a range that covers NY, OH, PA, VA, and WV.</p>
<p>In addition, you're correct- there are both stragglers <em>and</em> early bloomers that can appear from the periodic species.</p>
<p>This late in the year however, you're almost certainly not hearing or seeing the Magicicadas. Their adult, above-ground lifespan is only ~4 weeks. Their emergence is dependent on soil temperature, and they are usually above ground by May or June and dead before the middle of July.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of the above. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are same-species broods of magicicada (periodical cidada) that overlap geographically, but are on difference cycles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are at least three species of magicicada in North America, but many more annual species.</p>
</li>
<li>Periodical cicada in the same brood do sometimes develop a year early or late. There are specific soil conditions they need to detect before they emerge and sometimes environmental conditions, mutations, or physical stress such as earthquakes or human development cause them to emerge early, late, or not at all.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those are the green and white colored cicadas that are out every late summer.  They are not on the elongated cycle like their famous cousins.  Also, everyone once in a while, you can find a random 17 year cicada.  There are sub groups that are &quot;out of cycle&quot; with the others.  Man, it must be so unlucky to be one of those guys.  17 years in the ground only to emerge and bam!!!  Nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid growing up I used to love catching these things.  I even had a bug book that explained all of this.  In Ohio where I live we have 1,7,13, and 17 year cicadas that I now of.  If you pick a dead one up off the ground you'll notice that it has 3 dots on it's head. The color of the dots will tell you what type of cicada it is.  When you only see a handful out it's a 1 year breed.  If you see a million of them then it's one of the longer cycle breeds. </p>
