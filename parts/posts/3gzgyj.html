		<h2><a href="/posts/3gzgyj" onclick="return false">This is not a 'cicada year,' but I hear one buzzing outside right now. Is there a small set of cicadas out of sync with the main population, or do a few mistakenly mature early every year? Or is this a different species entirely?</a></h2>

I find them and their molted shells all over my yard, and I hear them buzzing away. What are <em>these</em> cicadas? The ones that pop up even when it's not a 'cicada year'. <br><br>Are they the same species as either the 13 or 17 year cicada, but a year out of sync? Are they late comers or early bloomers whose development cycle missed a year and caused them to miss the party, and so they pop up without anyone else around to mate with? Or is there a stable population of these cicadas each year that have drifted out of sync thousands of years ago - if so, will they diverge into a separate species after enough time? It seems like this would be a remarkable sort of allopatric speciation that's happening- instead of the population being divided by a river, they get separated by a year in their life cycle. Or is that crazy because their life cycle is very rigidly 13/17 years and there's just no way in hell they're deviate from that?<br><br>Is it all of these or none of these? Or are the cicadas this year a different species entirely? </p></div>
