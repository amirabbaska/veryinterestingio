		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being a very heavy eater with a huge appetite, I usually like taking advantage of these promos. After recently victimizing a restaurant with unlimited sushi, tempura, and a whole lot of Japanese food, it got me thinking: how are they even earning from this?</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who takes advantage of these promos, as there are thousands of people out there who probably eat more than I do, and take even more advantage of these promos. It seems almost impossible how they're able to refill dish after dish on the buffet table, and <em>still</em> be able to pay their restaurants' bills.</p>
<p>How is this all possible?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The food you are eating costs much less than you are being charged for it. If I went to a pizza buffet and paid 8 dollars for unlimited pizza, I'd think that was a great deal! I can eat, what, 8-10 slices of pizza? Well those 8-10 slices would probably end up costing the company maybe 2 dollars total. So, they are still making a profit on you. Maybe less of a profit on you in particular, but still a profit. And even if a few people are able to pack away enough to outpace the profit margin, the vast majority of people will not, and that more than makes up for the outliers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's generally a lot cheaper to cook in bulk. Imagine how much work it is to cook 100 vastly different things several times scattered across the day. Now compare that to just preparing 20 single kinds of food <em>(some rice, some soup, etc)</em> and dropping that into a bucket. Also, those menus usually cost a bit more than the average person actually uses. That way they still make profit from most of the people. Sure, there's some who eat way too much, in which case they lose money, but generally people don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the current comments about pricing to the average appetite, buying in bulk, reducing the number of dishes and the rest are all correct. One factor not mentioned here is psychology. A well run buffet is really carefully laid out, and every dish and decoration is there for a specific reason: to get you to eat more of the cheaper ingredients.</p>
<p>First thing you see when you get to a typical buffet? Soups (one of the great &quot;trash disposal&quot; dishes), breads, and a salad bar and/or cold veggie dishes (sometimes cold meat dishes as well, but these tend to be &quot;trash disposal&quot; dishes like terrines). These cost pennies and fill you up fast. </p>
<p>Next up? The hot food. The meat dishes (the expensive stuff) will be displayed REALLY well, as that has been shown to discourage a lot of people from &quot;ruining&quot; the display by taking a lot, and they are surrounded by really delicious carbs and veggies. Effect? You take a lot of side dishes, and little meat.</p>
<p>Also, if the designer/chef is doing it right, clearly visible is going to be a bright and attractive dessert area. This adds the &quot;I've got to save room for dessert&quot; element which again reduces how much of the expensive main dishes you consume.</p>
<p>When you finally get to desserts you are full of soup, bread, salad and hot veggies. The desserts are all cut really small so you feel like you are getting a ton of dessert by picking 5 different kinds, but they actually only equal one normal dessert. </p>
<p>Lastly, the restaurant (as mentioned elsewhere) does mark up drinks way more than standard, but the will make sure that your water is full all the time. You take a sip? A waiter is there filling it up. Water makes you feel full faster, and makes you eat less. They want you drinking as much water as possible (assuming you aren't buying their overpriced drinks).</p>
<p>There are a hundred other little tricks that chefs use (directing your eyes using garnishes to dishes that cost less, using bone-in meats to increase the apparent volume of your food while reducing prices, using dishes that have lower-cost ingredients, saucing everything they can, etc) but those are the main ones. You couple that with clever pricing and knowing the average consumption and buffets can make you a killing, and tend to have way higher profits than plated restaurants.</p>
<p>Even those of us who consider ourselves to have a huge appetite, the likelihood of you actually costing the restaurant money is really low (at one place I worked, it would take 7 full plates of food to hurt us at all, and whenever someone managed it, they were such an outlier as to not matter at all to the bottom line)</p>
<p>The one thing that could potentially cost the place money? Time. Restaurants live on the fastest turnover of seats possible, and buffets tend to get people to linger. That is why you will never see a buffet without a time limit. That is not to stop people from over-eating, it is to get them out the door so another paying customer can sit in their seat.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suppose you order a spicy tuna roll at a typical Japanese restaurant. The raw ingredients are probably $0.50 - yes, sushi-grade tuna is expensive, but the amount in a single roll is tiny. Most of what you're paying for is the time for the staff to take your order, for the sushi chef to individually prepare your roll, and bring it to your table, then adding it to your bill, and everything else that goes with table service.</p>
<p>At a buffet, the chef is making dozens of spicy tuna rolls at the same time, which is far more efficient. They may even be using a machine to help make the rolls more quickly. They're probably also using lower-quality fish, so maybe $0.35 for the raw ingredients and a tiny fraction of the human labor. There's no table service and everyone pays the same amount so paying for your meal is very fast and efficient.</p>
<p>Finally, all-you-can-eat restaurants know that not everybody eats the same amount. Perhaps they lose a bit of money when you come in to eat, but if you like it a lot, maybe you bring your friends and many of your friends don't eat nearly as much so the restaurant comes out ahead on average.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
