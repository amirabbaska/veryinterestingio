		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I taught Improv for years and did a lot of research on what IS funny so I could be a better teacher.</p>
<p>There have been studies that show that the evolutionary need for laughter is to let everyone know it's ok.</p>
<p>Say something offensive, we all laugh because we are shocked and uncomfortable, but hey, we're still ok...no need to kill the guy.</p>
<p>Something surprise you? We will laugh to say it is ok, no need to attack.</p>
<p>Clever and witty responses are laughed at because we show that we get the connections, that we are part of the group.</p>
<p>So, I've found that most categories of funny can fit in this. An unexpected twist, a clever play on words, a shocking or offensive act or comparison. We all laugh to feel like we are part of the tribe. It is an involuntary response, but an evolutionary necessity.</p>
<p>Some people who have &quot;no sense of humor&quot; have different social constructs. If I make a funny joke about Jesus and his mom, and you're very religious, you need to NOT find that funny to stay a part of your tribe. You won't laugh and will probably be offended.</p>
<p>If you're of different cultural, intellectual, or socioeconomic backgrounds, you sometime &quot;won't get&quot; the joke. Think of a comedian you hate and a comedian you love. That comedian you hate but everyone seems to love - you're probably not his target demographic. The comedian you love probably jives more with you as a person.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a few theories, here. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A good joke usually subverts the conclusion you've been set up to expect. By surprising us, a joke might be triggering a sort of coping reaction to the realization we've been tricked. Rather than be angry or frightened, we laugh, since the situation holds no consequence. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good jokes tend to address aspects of society and culture. We recognize the aspects of society the comedian addresses, and feel a sort of tribal connection through the shared recognition. The laughter then serves as a tool to bond with the tribe and assert your own awareness of the rules of that tribe. </p>
</li>
<li>We all like to feel above average. So, when jokes are crafted to illustrate somebody else's failures, we feel a sense of pride (for better or worse), and laugh out of relief that we're doing better than the hypothetical person in the joke. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, tough question. I was a cognitive science major in school, and I don't think anyone fully understands this. <em>Humor</em> is kind of bizarre, when you think about it. Doesn't serve any obvious evolutionary purpose.</p>
<p>You have to understand that the vast majority of the weird stuff our brains do is more or less accidental. It's a huge complicated system, and there is a lot that can go wrong. And even now, it's not really optimized for abstract thought. We can hypothesize that even our simpler primate ancestors would have understood a pie in the face as being funny...But a more complicated joke with a long setup? </p>
<p>Think how much neural background you'd have to have to make that work. You'd have to understand language, society, human behavior, all the words and concepts in the joke, be able to follow it as it's being constructed, have enough memory to be able to hold the whole thing in your head as the telling is completed...And then some kind of magic to make it all <em>funny</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This should hopefully be a detailed, yet simple enough explanation.</p>
<p>I cannot answer why something is funny. Nobody can yet. As others have pointed out, and as anyone who does a little bit of research on the topic will discover, humor and laughing are part of human behavior that we struggle quite a bit to understand. </p>
<p>However, the way a brain understands a joke is through multiple &quot;pathways&quot; in the brain. You may have heard that certain areas of the brain specialize in behaviors, such as the back of the brain (occipital lobe) specializing in vision while the front of the brain (frontal lobe) specializes in executive functions such as decision-making, morality, etc. In reality, these specializations are more complicated due to the presence of memory, which is in itself complicated, but not the topic of this discussion. For simplicity, we will say that memory is largely located in the hippocampus, even though the truth is much more convoluted. Neurons are the most well-known cells in the brain that serve the function of communicating with each other via electrical signals. The signals travel across our body and to your brain and vice versa if external stimuli are present (such as hearing a joke), and the neurons and areas of the brain the signal travels through creates a &quot;pathway.&quot; Models exist that show how the signal travels through our brain to reach its destination and how it is converted from meaningless sounds in our environment (someone telling a joke) to us understanding it (processing the content of the joke and deciding to laugh). Here is an example of what a model of a pathway looks like, specfically our auditory pathway. <a href="http://what-when-how.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/tmp15F73.jpg" target="_blank">http://what-when-how.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/tmp15F73.jpg</a></p>
<p>So, as the sound waves travel to our ears, through our brainstem, and to our auditory cortex in our temporal lobe, there is NO understanding of the sound yet. When the sound reaches the auditory cortex, the auditory cortex sends further signals to areas in the brain responsible for memory as well as to speech centers (to store the experience, to compare it to previous experiences, to recognize the language and words), and since we often catch ourselves laughing without planning on it due to the joke being funny, it is reasonable to say that there is also communication between the auditory cortex and other areas of your brain responsible for reflexes and motor control. </p>
<p>That is my attempt of an explanation at an ELI5 level. My credentials are a B.S. in Psychology, lab experience, and preparing for med school, just in case you doubt my words.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll quote a professional of humor.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4xWuRyZuDE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=18m13s" target="_blank">interview</a> (in Spanish) comic writer Mauro Entrialgo described humor as a way to tell things based on omitting parts of the information that are necessary  to understand the discourse, parts that the listener already knows. The listener needs to actively seek and fit the missing parts to give a sense to it, it's a puzzle and solving it will create satisfaction and sometimes even joy.</p>
<p>That would be the base for every form of humor, he then talks about the literary mechanisms like exaggeration, metaphor... and cultural additives that can make a certain joke funnier to certain people. Taboos are good additives, sex, religion, death, sickness...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
