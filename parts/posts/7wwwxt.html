		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few different celestial coordinate systems, which tend to be used in different applications. Astronomers usually use an equatorial coordinate system, which describes the location of objects in the sky using two angles.  Right ascension describes where an object is along the celestial equator (basically longitude), while Declination describes the angle from the equator (basically latitude). The equator is aligned with the Earth's spin axis to make observations simpler.  Ecliptic coordinates work similarly, but align the equator to the plane of the Earth's orbit to work better within our solar system.  There's also a galactic coordinate system, which aligns with the galactic plane and center.
For describing orbits of objects in a solar system, such as asteroids, usually a set of six orbital parameters is used.  These parameters can be used to calculate where an object will appear in the sky at a particular time in an ephemeris table.  For small objects, these parameters have to be updated frequently to account for perturbations by larger planets.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There has been interest in using Pulsars as beacons. In the same way GPS is done. By measuring the timing of pulses of EM energy from known Pulsars. I have read articles where it has <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pulsat+space+navigation&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-1" target="_blank">actually been demonstrated</a>. This would allow navigation even at intergalactic distances. So direction would be relative to the positions of a catalog of Pulsars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would like to piggy back on this question, if you don't mind. </p>
<p>When using these celestial bodies to triangulate position, how much does the movement of the solar system matter, if at all? In relative terms, would the north pole be drifting faster than Sol is?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Port : left side
Starboard: right side
Zenith: up
Nadir: down
Ram: infront
Wake: behind
Obviously there has to be some predefined orientation.</p>
<p>A crafts direction may simple be specified in roll pitch and yaw. Usually the default plane would simply be as if you enlarge the surface sphere of the closest body to reach the craft. </p>
<p>Then in orbit you have prograde as the direction of the orbit. Retrograde as the opposite direction to the orbit. And orbit normal +/- as the perpendicular movements across the orbit sphere for the same altitude. The last two directions being up and down ;-)</p>
<p>As to cardinal dirextion, everything is referenced back to some body, either moon, earth or sun, basically just latitude longitude and altitude.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the stuff we have in space is orbiting earth and doesn't much care about the rest of the universe, so the same cardinal directions of  N, E, S, W, and up and down are useful. It is also important to keep track of which direction a satellite is traveling through space, which is called pro-grade, while backwards is called retrograde.</p>
<p>If you go beyond Earth, the main thing to look at is the plane of the ecliptic, which is the plane in which the planets orbit. There is an analogue to North and South, East and West, up and down. The same is true if you look at the whole galaxy.</p>
<p>A relevant reference point is chosen, typically at or around the center of mass of the system, and the directions are determined by the rotation of the system. We haven't gotten to anywhere without significant rotation, so I'm not sure what we will do if we find a place like that, but if there is nothing to make an intuitive direction pop out, an arbitrary one will suffice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
