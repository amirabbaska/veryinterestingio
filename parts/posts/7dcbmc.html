The better we match the language of those we speak to (like the accent/dialect, slang) the easier it is for both members of the conversation to understand each other.</p>
<p>If you travel to another location where the majority speaks different than you, you are encouraged to adapt their way of talking, because it is easier to adapt to the culture than to make the culture adapt to you.</p>
<p>The better you are at adapting your language to fit the recipients language, the better they will be able to percieve it the way you meant for it to be percieved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Because back in our Hunter geathering days if you were an outsider, you were much more likely to die.  Here is an interesting article I found on the topic that can explain better then I can.  <a href="http://socialpsychonline.com/2015/06/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-pay-more-attention-to-peoples-body-language-now/" target="_blank">http://socialpsychonline.com/2015/06/3-reasons-why-you-need-to-pay-more-attention-to-peoples-body-language-now/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To fit in with your surroundings. It's why we do a lot of things that don't make sense. Group mentality and also emulating someone you idolize or generally look up to. Ever seen a gaggle of girls all wearing the same outfit, have the same phone, talk the same way? One of them is the pack leader, the rest are emulating her to please her and fit in with the group. Guys do it to, &quot;jocks&quot; all wearing letterman jackets, skaters all wearing skinny jeans. Most people just want to fit in and be accepted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked in Ontario for two months, several years ago. I am from Southern Indiana. Within two weeks I was mimicking the vernacular, adding, 'eh?' to the ends of sentences, and was taking on the accent. It wasn't intentional. I believe that I was just surrounded by people speaking (mostly) the same language as me and I was subconsciously trying to fit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I love this question! I find that I'm usually the one adapting to my surroundings because I know internally I'm a lot different from my friends. I have a co worker that constantly says &quot;girl&quot; it drives me fucking crazy (pardon my language) ex. &quot;Hey girl how you doing today? Aw girl I'm having the worst morning, girl you would not believe what happened, someone cut me off in traffic and girl I was livid. Girl i wish people drove better&quot; and I find myself saying girl back to her a lot and now I just avoid her in general because I hate when she starts talking to my clients. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
