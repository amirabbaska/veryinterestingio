		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Night is longer in the winter, so depending on where you live it can be significantly more likely to snow at night. But most of it's that it's six to eight hours of not paying attention and suddenly seeing snow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you go far enough north, this isn't always true.  In places where it's warm enough for the snow to turn to rain, snowstorms are more likely to happen at night simply because it's colder.</p>
<p>Also, night is longer in the winter, especially as you go further north.  In much of southern Canada, for example, in December it's night 16 hours or more of the day, so snow is more likely at night simply because it's more likely to be night.</p>
<p>Really bad snow storms last long enough that they persist day and night.  We just had a 36-hour blizzard here this week.  It started around lunchtime on Monday and ended overnight Tuesday night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you sleep, that means ~8 hours of you not watching the snow accumulate.  So it seems like OMG sudden snow.  When it happens during the day, you see it grow gradually.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm in the northeastern US. It literally began snowing at daybreak, and it's still snowing now, almost lunchtime.</p>
<p>So I, for one, can empirically confirm confirm that snowstorms don't &quot;always&quot; happen overnight.</p>
<p>Others here have answered your question: nights are longer than day during winter, plus it's cooler at night, so more likely to snow vs. changing to rain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The temperature drops on average in the evening allowing snowfall to be more likely. The coldest time of day in my area is usually around 1 AM CST. Storms seem to thrive at the boundaries of warm\cold air as condensation with particulates drive precipitation. My best guess is that with the temperature drop, a threshold is hit and helps drives the snowfall more consistently over a large sample to be in the evening versus the day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
