		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK, so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj8Sg8qnjOg" target="_blank">this</a> is a fantastic video by numberphile. It explains the golden ratio, what we mean to say it's the &quot;most irrational&quot; number and how it's relevant to plants (the specific example given is with sunflower seeds).</p>
<p>So i'll try and break it down in a couple of sections. </p>
<p>First off, why do plants &quot;choose&quot; this number to begin with? The video I linked explains that the plant in question (the sunflower) tries to lay out its seeds in the densest possible way. This is important as it's beneficial for the plant to get the most seeds in the least possible area as it then uses less energy for the same task. So starting on the inside and growing out, let's say we place one seed every 1cm from the centre but we can choose how far to turn with each seed placement. If we take one full turn every time we place our seed we grow in a straight line. Once every 1/2 turn and we grow in 2 lines, once every 1/3 and we get 3 lines growing out from the middle. You should see the pattern. None of these are very efficient. We want to find a number which generates the least number of straight lines as this guarantees that we're taking up the least space as straight lines imply that there's area we're not using for seeds. That's where the golden ratio comes in.</p>
<p>The golden ratio is what we call an &quot;irrational number&quot;, an irrational number is a number which cannot be expressed in the form a/b where a and b are whole numbers. But the golden ratio is special, it's a number which is the <em>least well approximated</em> by two integers a/b. Simply put, if we want to get an approximation for the golden ratio to a certain number of decimal places then it's guaranteed that a and b will both have to be larger than if we were to try and approximate another irrational number to the same accuracy.</p>
<p>In the first bit we see that 1/3, 1/2 and 1/1 all produce straight lines and so we know that having our ratio in the form a/b is not a good choice. We now also know that the golden ratio is least well approximated by a/b where a and b are whole numbers. Connect the dots and we see that the golden ratio produces the least amount of straight lines and so is the best number for packing these seeds densely :). The golden ratio also has many uses in nature besides this example but you can often boil it down to being the most irrational number.</p>
<p>This is from memory so the explanation might be slightly butchered. The video I linked provides a bit more of an in depth explanation as to how we know the golden ratio is the most irrational as well as some fantastic animations showing the sunflower choosing different numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The golden ratio is a relationship that pops up when dealing with the most basic/simple additive series. Start with 0, then the next number is 1. Add the number before 1 to 1. That's 0+1, which is 1. Now add 1 to 1, that's 2. Add 2+1, that's 3. 3+2 = 5, 5+3 = 8, 8+5 = 13, 13+8 = 21, 21+13 = 34, et cetera. That's the Fibonacci series. Any series that follows that rule will eventually lead to the golden ratio (look up Lucas numbers). The larger these Fibonacci numbers get, the closer the ratio of 2 Fibonacci numbers right next to eachother gets to the golden ratio. Example: 34 divided 21 = 1.619, 144 divided by 89 = 1.617978, 987 divided by 610 = 1.61803.

<p>Most fruits that people eat form from a flower that has 5 petals (are pentagonal). Apples, cherries, pears, cucumbers, squash, pumpkins, peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, et cetera. What does that have to do with the golden ratio? The pentagon is literally FILLED with it.</p>
<p>Pentagons are literally just a shape of golden ratios.

<p>So, how is it applicable to how plants grow? Well, it's not really, not for most plants. There are exceptions, of course. When a sunflower is producing seeds it has to cram a lot of them tightly in a circle. There are inefficient ways to do that, and efficient ways as well. Doing it randomly would be a mess. So what happens is that they grow in an order to maximize space. A way to think of it is that a new seed will be placed a certain angle away from the most recent seed. If it were to put a new seed a half turn away from the most recent seed you would get <a href="https://i.imgur.com/S82AqYh.png" target="_blank">something like this over time</a>. That is 50% of a turn, or 180 degrees. Not very efficient, so much unused space. A third of a turn (120 degrees) is better, but not much better. What about 41% of a turn (148 degrees), or a fifth of a turn (72 degrees)? Better, but still not as good as it needs to be. What about using the golden ratio? What happens if a new seed is formed about 61%-62% of a turn away from the most recent one? What will that look like? <a href="https://66.media.tumblr.com/a0470d1f3f21ce167d12bfd291f2b1f4/tumblr_n2sutmu74c1r2geqjo1_500.gif" target="_blank">It will look something like this</a>,  <a href="http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/seedplot.gif" target="_blank">or this</a>.</p>
<p>Also, Fibonacci numbers pop up in nature often. The number of petals on a flower is often a Fibonacci number. For example, a sunflower or daisy often have 21, 34, or 55 petals. Vinca, larkspur, and columbine have 5 petals. Coreopsis, bloodroot, cosmos, and delphinium have 8 petals. Marigold and ragwort have 13 petals. Chicory and aster have 21 petals. Plantain and pyrethrum have 34 petals. You will also usually see spirals on the bottom of pine cones (left hand spirals and right hand spirals) - the number of spirals is USUALLY a Fibonacci number.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahXIMUkSXX0" target="_blank">This is a nifty video demonstrating how plants grow in relation to the golden ratio/spiral</a></p>
<p><strong>BEYOND THIS POINT IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE OP'S QUESTION, IT'S JUST MORE INFO ON THE GOLDEN RATIO</strong></p>
<p>φ (the golden ratio: 1.6180339887) is also cool because if you take 1.6180339887 x 1.6180339887, you get 2.6180339887. If you take 1 divided by 1.6180339887, you get 0.6180339887. So φ squared is φ+1, and the inverse of φ is φ-1. Kinda nifty.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.technologyuk.net/mathematics/geometry/images/geometry_0185.gif" target="_blank">Here are the 5 Platonic solids</a></p>
<p>I have found that the golden ratio is related to 4 of the 5 Platonic solids. I still haven't found it in the cube, but I could be wrong.
