<p>(Searched first, existing threads were not specific)</p>
<p>How is it that the materials making up its body aren't destroyed by structural stresses? </p>
<p>Would there not still be large pressure gradients over the irregular structures in it's body, even if for only brief moments?  It does have an &quot;internal&quot; body cavity which seems at least partially sealed.</p>
<p>Does it have some subsystem that slowly equalizes internal pressure uniformly with its environment?</p>
<p>Most sources cite cryptobiosis, which makes sense to me for tolerance of many conditions, but I don't see how it provides near immunity to extreme pressures.  </p></div></div>
