		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recall learning years ago the prevailing idea was that nomadic groups of people followed the migration of the megafauna they hunted. Looking at today's Inuit (eskimo), and other Arctic indigenous peoples, it's unlikely that winter conditions especially when such a large portion of the Earth's surface was covered by glaciers, would deter the movement of determined (read: hungry) humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People were already living in Beringia, where the Bering Sea now divides Asia from North America. The glaciation had lowered the sea levels and created a huge band of dry, cold steppes ranging from Europe to North America. Beringia, on the shores of the Pacific, would have been a little wetter, especially as the deglaciation occurred, but it was still fairly dry and not forested.</p>
<p>It wouldn't have been an especially difficult place for people to live; consider how Inuits were still living at a stone age level along the Greenland ice cap until very recently. And people in Beringia would have had good access to both marine and land animals to hunt, unlike the Inuits.</p>
<p>Once the glaciers blocking the route southeast into America melted, they could spread that way. No long journeys required.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't like all the humans there collaboratively decided to move to NA. It will have been small groups spreading, moving into new areas. There doesn't need to have been any impetus at all, apart from there being food there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The earth was slowly warming up from the last ice age, the last glacial maximum was around 21,500 years ago </p>
<p>I guess this is sort of related but the world is believed to have gone into a cataclysmic cooling period called the younger dryas period around 12,800 years ago lasting roughly 1200 years then a rapid increase in temperature to end the younger dryas</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing drove them to suddenly decide to cross, populations just tend to spread to new locations if they can survive there, because they'll face less competition from other members of their species. That's what drove most human migration up to that point, and what led humans to settle in Siberia in the first place. What changed 13,000 years ago is that they were actually able to cross, because the sea level dropped due to so much water being trapped in glaciers, which exposed the land bridge of Beringia. Small groups probably followed prey animals across it, those animals were crossing because vegetation was being exposed which had never been grazed before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
