		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that jet engines aren't <em>inherently</em> faster and more powerful than propeller engines (also, as pointed out elsewhere, most propeller driven planes use turbines these days). Rather, the jet engine as a concept has the <em>potential</em> to be much faster and more powerful. </p>
<p>Piston-driven propeller engines pretty much maxed out their potential in late WWII. They just had <em>so</em> many moving parts, weren't all that efficient, and required sophisticated turbo or super-chargers to climb to a useful altitude. Turbine engines can spin far faster, have far fewer moving parts, and can adapt to changes of altitude far better. Even so, the British flew a jet aircraft years <em>before</em> the famous German Messerschmidt 262 was terrorizing Allied bombers towards the end of the war. </p>
<p>But even though the Brits flew a jet in 1941, it took several more years before they could refine the design enough to even compete with the piston-driven fighters out in the field. It's weird today to imagine a jet that can't keep up with a piston+propeller plane, but that was where Allied (1941) and Axis (1939) powers were from for most of the war. They <em>had</em> jets in development, but they couldn't keep up with the far more refined existing technology, though that technology was reaching its limits, while jets were just starting to show what they could do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A propeller is able to grab the air with the curved blade and push it back on the air behind the plane. </p>
<p>It's exactly like how you paddle in water. You aren't &quot;pulling&quot; water towards you, you push it away. Both water and air are fluids and work the same way. You just need a lot more speed force to get air to care.</p>
<p>A jet engine will pull in a bunch of air in front of it (how the engine pulls isn't 5YOF) and squeeze it really tight inside a box. Think a pump nerf gun. Now light gas on fire (think water into mist, you get more &quot;volume&quot; because it's hot) with the high pressure air and you are blowing a massive fart behind you. </p>
<p>A propeller is limited to the air it can collect by moving forward. A jet engine increase the amount of air it pulls in, adds lighter fluid to the volume, and farts that. </p>
<p>TL;DR it's just blowing really hard like a fart you held in too long. </p>
<p>5YOF = 5 year old friendly </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very simplified:</p>
<p>So at the core of what we think of as jet engines (turbofans and turbojets) is the fact that we have a turbine which has blades (think its own propellers) that is spun by the exhaust from compressed air, compressed by a compressor, which is ignited. In fact, this <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/UEET/StudentSite/engines.html" target="_blank">NASA explanation</a> sums it up easiest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All jet engines, which are also called gas turbines, work on the same principle. The engine sucks air in at the front with a fan. A compressor raises the pressure of the air. The compressor is made with many blades attached to a shaft. The blades spin at high speed and compress or squeeze the air. The compressed air is then sprayed with fuel and an electric spark lights the mixture. The burning gases expand and blast out through the nozzle, at the back of the engine. As the jets of gas shoot backward, the engine and the aircraft are thrust forward. As the hot air is going to the nozzle, it passes through another group of blades called the turbine. The turbine is attached to the same shaft as the compressor. Spinning the turbine causes the compressor to spin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, a propeller based engine has to use the external propeller to &quot;lift&quot; the aircraft. If you look at a propeller, you will see that each blade actually like a mini wing in that it creates 'lift' - but in the forward direction, which we call thrust.</p>
<p>Propeller-driven plane have some significant limits though: as the aircraft moves faster in speed, the blades - spinning super fast- can see the tips reach supersonic speeds which creates a lot of other issues (drag, material limits, noise, etc.). So propeller driven planes can't reach the speeds or climb rates that jet planes can.</p>
<p>There is actually a thing that a lot of modern higher-end prop planes  use: the turboprop. It uses a turbine engine setup like a jet but at the front it is connected to propellers which can generate much larger amounts of thrust. </p>
<p>Of course, none of this comes free: jet engines can burn a ridiculous amount of fuel, and so they are fit on aircraft that need it for performance reasons.</p>
<p>For instance, in the T-6B Texan II, an 1100 horsepower turboprop trainer plane the Navy uses, to cruise at 240 knots, we might be at 80% power and burn 400-600 pounds of gas per hour.</p>
<p>However, in the F/A-18E Super Hornet, flying at 240 knots - which is roughly where max endurance is (most fuel efficient in terms of time you can stay aloft), we're talking about roughly 2600-3000 pounds of gas per hour... per engine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these comments are spot-on.  Here is a little longer explanation. </p>
<p>One thing that is missing is the pressure change mechanism.  Propeller has 2-4 cambered blades.  The camber, similar to the wing of an airplane, changes the air pressure between the front and the back of the blade.  This pressure change “pulls/pushes” the air as it passes the propeller blades.  Same principles as the lift vector of a wing.  The pressure differences between the top and bottom of the wing provide a changing lift vector.  (Many aspects affect the changes to the vector).  On smaller and slower prop aircraft, the blades are “fixed”, so you can only achieve so much thrust from that blade.  Adjustable pitch blades move to change the aspect of the blade optimizing the efficiency of the blades at different speeds.  Most turbo-prop aircraft utilize a smaller jet engine to spin the prop.  The prop will typically be a “fixed speed” prop (roughly 2000 RPM for the prop) and utilizing the adjustable pitch to accelerate or cruise at higher speeds and even act as a spoiler to slow the aircraft.  </p>
<p>The pressure change of the prop is not contained in any manner.  The prop spins in free space.  This causes a negative aerodynamic effects to the aircraft called P-factor (longer explanation for another time)</p>
<p>The jet engine, whether commercial airliner or fighter aircraft, have a contained compressor.  All the stages of fans in the jet engine have blades that are shaped to achieve the pressure change designed for the specific engine.  Depending on the design of the engine and the compressor, engineers can achieve more powerful thrust output or more efficient output.  </p>
<p>Airliners we see today, run a high-bypass engine.  This simply means a high volume of air is sucked into the engine and by-passed around the compressor.  A smaller amount of air is compressed, fueled, and ignited.  This does a couple:  the by-passed air is minimally compressed.  However it is a contained compression (thing of blowing through a straw verses blowing with no straw).  The ignited air is highly compressed and to achieve that it will pass through many sets of blades (typically called stages).  The compressed and ignited air also drives the entire fan blade system; both compressor blades and by-pass system. The end result is the by-pass air accounts for about 60% of total thrust, while the compressed and ignited air accounts for the remaining 40%.  So the Stage 1 blades (front of the engine) act as a very fast propeller, forcing air through a straw, and ejecting it at a fast rate than the air entering the engine. The by-passed air also provides a sound dampening effect for the combustion nozzle.  Think of the business-end of the engine as a donut. </p>
<p>Containing the pressure change of the blades cutting the air vastly improves the efficiency and power output of a jet engine compared to a propeller.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some bits of these are right but some are not. Both types of engine pull air towards them (~half the speed change in air due to the presence of a propellor happens before the air reaches the propellor itself).</p>
<p>Because it has walls and lots of blades, the jet engine can sustain high pressures through much more of the engine. With a prop, the pressure differences can only be sustained over part of the blade and slowly fades towards zero at the tip because air spills over to the lower pressure areas.</p>
<p>This large pressure helps drive a faster speed of air out the back of the engine which gives more thrust and also gives thrust up to a higher speed (you cant fly faster forward than the air comes out the back of the engine because you need the momentum to balance.</p>
<p>There is also a trade off between how much air you put through the engine and how fast you push it out, one with give higher max speeds but the other will give more thrust and efficiency at low speeds which is why you get turboprops with huge propellor blades, much bigger than any jet engine </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
