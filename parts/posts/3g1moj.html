		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is my jam!  Wait … not my jam, my PhD. </p>
<p>There are probably about three different types of mental exhaustion.  One, that has already been explained (to the best of anyone’s ability) is sleepiness.  Basically, that is when you start feeling tired and want to sleep at the end of the day (or other times in the day if you didn’t get enough sleep).  That is your brain telling you that you need to sleep for a while so that your brain can clean itself out and deal with memory consolidation.  Although the purposes of sleep aren’t entirely understood, it is definitely totally necessary for brains to function and it plays a role in solidifying important memories (and forgetting irrelevant things).</p>
<p>Another type of mental exhaustion happens when you’ve just been engaging in difficult and unenjoyable mental work.  So maybe you just finished a couple hours of awful homework, or had to be on your best behaviour during an uncomfortable lunch with racist grandparents.  Or something like that.  But you’ve been slugging along, doing something mentally difficult, and now you feel tired.  Although sometimes people want to sleep after this, a lot of the time people really just want to take a  break.  You want to check Facebook, eat something, laze around at your house.  That’s not the same thing as being sleepy, since you aren’t craving sleep, but people still refer to it as feeling &quot;mentally tired&quot;.  Researchers in this field are converging around this being caused by shifting motivations.  Basically, it’s good to spend some of your time doing things that you have to do, and some time doing things that you want to do.  Someone in the thread mentioned something about the brain running low on glucose … that was an earlier theory, that has been pretty thoroughly dismissed.  The quantities of glucose that your brain uses doing difficult math problem sets is less than you use walking around, but 10 minutes of intense math can make you crave Facebook much more than 10 minutes of walking. Glucose is also sent to your brain pretty darn quickly, so running out of brain “fuel” is not an issue.  You can get rid of this type of fatigue by taking a sufficient break, preferably doing something that you enjoy doing!  Meditation (as someone posted) has been shown to rejuvenate people, as has prayer, youtube videos, smoking cigarettes, reminding yourself about your values... the list goes on!</p>
<p>A third type of mental exhaustion, that was also mentioned in passing, is an attentional habituation.  If you do a single task for an extended period of time, your brain start to attend less to the relevant information in the task.  (Interestingly, doing a mentally taxing task not only makes you attend less to task-relevant information like the math question, but increases your attention to rewarding stimuli like food and comfortable chairs, which seems to support the above idea of a &quot;trading off&quot; of motivations).  At least one paper has differentiated between this habituation type of fatigue and the previous fatigue (last paragraph), but they still might be overlapping in many contexts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain cells (neurons), just like any other cells in your body, excrete metabolic wastes. During the day (or night) when you are active and awake, the brain is slightly swollen relative to when you are sleeping and this shrinks the amount of space between the gyri and sulci (mountains and valleys) of the brain. The less space, the less efficiently the cerebrospinal fluid is circulated and cleaned. With this stagnating CSF, the metabolites being released by brain cells just hang around the cells in the brain and this affects the metabolic functions of said cells. All of this occurs until we go to sleep, where the brain shrinks and more room is made for the CSF to be circulated and the metabolites to be cleared. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, inside a neuron, signals are carried by ions.  The ions pile up on one side, and take time to get back to the start.</p>
<p>Between neurons, there are larger molecules.  They exit the axons (long part) and connect with the dendrites (shorter part).  The connection is called a synapse.  </p>
<p>As a synapse is triggered, it becomes less responsive to being triggered.  This is because of recovery time for the synapse proteins, and the time to recover neurotransmitters, and because the ions inside are more depleted.  </p>
<p>The higher activation potential is good, because the neurotransmitters accumulate in the synapse, and you do not want the synapse locked &quot;on&quot;.  For an example of why that is bad, look up seratonin syndrome.</p>
<p>So, mental fatigue is basically running low on transmitters, and the activations reduce.  Using other parts of your brain still works, because they are not depleted.</p>
<p>You can recover fastest by not using those tired pathways temporatily, so they can recover.  Sleep, clearing your mind, or doing something else all help well.  Long term, more practice in mental endurance will cause you to build up more neurotransmitters, giving you longer time to use those pathways.  Also, you may duplicate pathways for load sharing.  Last, having a healthy diet can make sure you recover quickly.  Lots of different trace elements, proteins, fats, etc are used in the brain in small quantities.  Variety is the spice of life.</p>
<p>Reward seeking is because dopamine is a pretty pervasive override, and can reduce the amount of signal needed to activate many target neurons.  This can gelp short term, but it leaves you more depleted, requiring more recovery time.  Long term, it can be part of how you build mental endurance, but the pathways are different than through self motivation.  Memories slightly compartmentalize, and habits form.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Please take this with a Grain of salt or two </p>
<p>I trained as a clinical neurophysiologist. Any real neurophysiologist will tell you this means fuck all.  </p>
<p>But while I was doing rounds and attending lectures and reading books and all that.  Something was reinforced in many ways.  It seems novelty and variety are critical components to attention and interest </p>
<p>Some degree or stimulation and challenge is needed or our brains relegate the function to a non imperative area </p>
<p>Overall our  aware  brains are intersted in change.</p>
<p>Lacking novelty out subconscious pretty much takes over</p>
<p>Usually this is fine.  What happens in the past is  likely to recure</p>
<p>Your mental exhaustion is a physiological awareness of lack of novel stimulation </p>
<p>Now you ask. Why do people in a chronic state  of stimilatiion become exhausted?</p>
<p>According to one of my preceptors. We can't maintain a high level of awareness and attention for long periods. No creature is evolved for such activity </p>
<p>The creatures that survive conserve effort and energy </p>
<p>The ones that are always hyperaware are a problem </p>
<p>More a delusion and a paranoid person who sees threat and pattern In randomness.   </p>
<p>This is not good for people or tribes.  </p>
<p>We are better off.  Individually and in together with a fatigue response when we get overly focused on usuly random Incidents</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm basing this answer on some intro level anatomy courses and some extrapolation and educated guessing. I hope a better answer comes along. </p>
<p>So to start, the brain runs exclusively off glucose. Other tissues can convert fats or proteins to fuel, but the brain can only utilize glucose. Some some mental fatigue is low blood sugar. The less fuel there is the less activity, and hence a tired feeling. </p>
<p>Another thing that could be going on is the Reticular Activating System (RAS) is winding down. When active/stimulated the RAS is what wakes you up and keeps you alert. I think its pretty closely tied to your sleeping pattern. This cycle of being alert and stimulated and then winding down is most likely due to a negative feedback loop. I have no idea as to the actual pathway. </p>
<p>I would be happy to be corrected on anything I have stated above. </p>
<p>EDIT: It has been correctly pointed out that under starvation conditions, the brain can fun on ketone bodies. </p>
