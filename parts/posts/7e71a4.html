For the relatively short lunar missions it was easy enough to transport sufficient hydrogen and oxygen to power the fuel cells and the fuel cell exhaust—water—was useful too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One other thing to keep in mind (in addition to the already posted stuff) is that solar cells in the 1960s were kind of terrible. Very heavy, and didn't put off much power. Probably a modern day voyage would have some solar cells, but in the 1960s? Forget about it. Especially when you need to go to the moon, and it's easier to carry some fuel cells than a heavy solar panel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Solar power was in its infancy back then.  Fuel cells were cheaper and more reliable (Apollo 13 notwithstanding, but it wasn't really the fault of the cell itself it was a design flaw in the thermostat) and thus the better option.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
