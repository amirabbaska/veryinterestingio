		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your head secretes an oil called sebum and it still does so even after you lose your hair. Not washing your hair for a few days will make it oily, the same oil makes your bald head shiny without the hair. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When hair stops growing in men, it also means that the follicles (the pores where the hair normally grows out from) shrink in time. This makes the skin smooth. And then (as someone pointed already out), add the oils (sebum) which makes it look polished/shiny.</p>
<p>Add to that that she scalp is usually tight on the skull.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A combination of oil secreted and the fact that the skin is often pulled more taut over the skill than over other parts of the body. This is the reason people's noses get shiny.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
