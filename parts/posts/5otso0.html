		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is a combination of what /u/ajent123 and what /u/Mininni have said. </p>
<p>Ultimately it depends on the size of the studio.  A lot of porn studios are extremely legitimate and professional.  In that case, they pull permits for their scenes the same way any film studio would, and have a highly controlled environment, where extras have given consent, camera crews are standing by, as well as a full set of professionals for hair, makeup, etc.   </p>
<p>A smaller studio will most likely <em>not</em> do this, because it is difficult and costly, but also because they have less to lose.  A large studio is a legit operation, with insurance, payroll, probably investors and parent companies.  They need to be &quot;by the book&quot;, but they also have the money and legal teams to figure out the logistics and make sure everything is above board. </p>
<p>A smaller studio or freelance film crew can take the risk, film the scene quickly, and get out before they're caught.  If they are caught, they may face fines, and may either just pay them or get out of dodge, depending on what they get served for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh I have a small story about this.<br />
I went to a large public university (UCLA) and one time I saw these two blonds walking around in skimpy clothing (not much skimpier than normal since it was a sunny day in Southern California) but they were particularly standing out.  They were on Bruinwalk which was the main walkway towards and from the dorms.<br />
As I was walking towards them/back to my dorm I recognized one of them.......vaguely....They also had one guy in front of them shooting something on his large camera. No cones set up, no tape, just two girls walking and a guy filming them.   Didn't think much of it since there are lots of famous people that visit the campus so I couldn't pinpoint who it was anyway.     </p>
<p>Fast forward a year or two (can't remember how long) and I was watching this adult video and  whaddaya know, the &quot;setting&quot; was on a university campus and it was the same scene that those two actresses were shooting that day!  I tried to locate myself in the video and I could faintly make out my backpack in the background, it wasn't particularly crowded that time since it was during classtime. This was a large famous studio too, I can't remember the name of the video/studio though but it was easily recognizable, they didn't shoot the actual sex acts in public, it was just used as a setting.  </p>
<p>Also I've walked into many, many, many filming scenes of &quot;Lifetime Channel&quot; movies walking around campus, like literally into the front of the camera while it's rolling cuz they don't rope anything off. They give no fucks at all and it looks like they shoot without a permit or telling the school's administration. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actual porn star here who shot Mofos Public Pickups -- I was very much at an actual Bank of America during the day when we shot the intro and later the BJ was shot behind an actual apartment building in an alley with a production assistant standing guard because it was DEFINITELY not OK'd by anyone.. Porn budgets are notoriously low, especially for gonzo sites that shoot primarily in Miami, corporate tries to make the product as cheap but effective as possible. The third party directors who take more risks get better results and thus they get more jobs, encouraging them to break the law more. I know of one company who literally shot a full porn scene (not just intro) in the back of a car at the Las Vegas airport. Extremely risky shit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So they scout out a location that's not too busy, but also not completely dead.</p>
<p>You get the performers and the camera man and maybe a lighting guy do the video part, and the director/producer in the location.</p>
<p>Then there are a bunch of people that walk the perimeter and are on look out and they have walkie talkies.</p>
<p>They also said a lot of stuff is staged, on in areas that are dead. But yeah, normally just lots of planning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually they rent out the public space as a private staging area, and then fill the &quot;public space&quot; with extras that have consented to being there.</p>
<p>Movies do this a lot to with scenes filmed in public places. They create a controlled environment and give it the appearance of a public location.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
