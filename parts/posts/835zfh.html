		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. (And conversely if you ran spinward you would get &quot;heavier.&quot;) The force of &quot;gravity&quot; you feel is the floor of the station accelerating you inward and thus preventing you from flying of at a tangent. If you run opposite the floor at its tangential velocity, your tangential velocity in an inertial frame becomes zero, so you are no longer accelerating and will be weightless, just like if you were sitting in space next to the station but not spinning with it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you couldn't hover for long, since the air in the station would be trying to push you along with it, decreasing your velocity in the station frame/increasing it in the inertial frame, giving you weight again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marlsfarp is correct. Since the artificial gravity in this case is actually centripetal force, by going in the opposite direction you would be subtracting from that force. Subtract enough, and there's not enough force to push you away from the center of the rotation. You end up floating.</p>
<p>Edit: centrifugal force not centripetal force.
Thanks for the correction @astromike23 and @nevegSpraymaster, I learned something today!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The opposite is also true. If you were running very, very fast on the surface of Earth, you wouldn't feel the gravity either. The centrifugal force would balance out the gravity.
That's why there is zero gravity on the space station despite it is relatively close to Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This always bothered me about artificial gravity based on spinning: unless I am mistaken, there is no such thing as absolute orientation in space.  Therefore, by some frame of reference, the object in question would be stationary.  How would it then be possible to create artificial gravity if spinning is only based on assuming a specific frame of reference?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
