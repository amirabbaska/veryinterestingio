<p>I do, however, notice that if I'm online shopping for something like jeans, conveniently the ads on other pages are for those jeans.</p>
<p>A bit worried that my parents will soon be getting &quot;local girls want to fuck you&quot; ads.</p>
<p>Does this concern make sense, technically?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really.</p>
<p>A lot of ad services specifically will not advertise &quot;adult content&quot;. This is for a number of reasons, but one is that most sites don't want to be seen with that kind of advert.</p>
<p>For the same reason, most advertisers will go to ad services that prohibit use on 'adult' websites. This is what really leads to the difference in ads on adult and non-adult sites.</p>
<p>You won't likely see any ads for 'horny girls in your area' where you hadn't before, because they aren't really targeted at anyone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>well first this is something that has been going on for a long time already and a they don't really need your history. A lot of ad services can track you by your ip address and serve up relevant ads to you across multiple sites and devices. That said though there are limit's like you shouldn't be seeing porn ads show up on walmart for example and most porn sites are basically on &quot;fringe&quot; ad networks because many reputable advertisement company's / brands don't want to be associated with those sites for the most part. Long story short is you really should only be getting porn ad's on porn sites or super shady sites.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way Internet Service Providers are gathering your internet history is by simply tracking what websites you request and what is delivered to your network. If you request to see google.com then the ISP will see your request and route the traffic accordingly. And now they log that you requested google.com and can legally sell that to anyone buying. If they can see which individual computer is the one requesting the website is another story. It depends on how far ISPs implement in order to gather your history. If they have router access, Which is likely, than they can see which specific computer requested to see those luscious videos. </p>
<p>I believe this is a logical concern. But I do not think it will be a problem. As ISPs will likely have some sort of identifier (Say a local IP or MAC Address) for who wanted the traffic and target that person individually. It wouldn't make sense if sharon wanted shoes and they send bob some lovely coupons on his next pair of high heels. The targeted advertising wouldn't be effective then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
