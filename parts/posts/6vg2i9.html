<p>Yes that's not how we use the word &quot;real&quot; usually today, but it was a long time ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Real Estate, (probably) originally from the difference between the Entitlement (i.e. being declared Lord Bitobear of Landsdown) and the estate itself (i.e. &quot;Landsdown&quot; and the houses and crops thereof).</p>
<p>There's also &quot;Real Property&quot;, which includes real estate as a sub component, but also includes all my stuff from computers to stock certificates.</p>
<p>We now have &quot;intellectual property&quot; which is, by definition, <em>not</em> &quot;real&quot; property.</p>
<p>The definitions get really persnickety. For instance if I buy a computer, it's real property as a possession. If I mount it in a rack, it's still real property. If I bolt the rack to the floor of my house because I intend rack and computer to be there &quot;permanently&quot; the rack becomes reale state and so does the computer that is &quot;permanently&quot; installed.</p>
<p>But if I do exactly the same thing, but I know when I have it bolted in, that it's only going to be there for two weeks, it <em>doesn't</em> become real estate.  Why? Because of intent. If I intend the installation to be temporary then the bolts are just safety or convenience.</p>
<p>So as with most of the law, what something is <em>and</em> why it is, determines which &quot;kind of thing it is&quot;.</p>
<p>The distinctions rarely matter until someone complains. Let's say that I leave all my real estate to my daughter and all my fine art to my son. If there's a painting hanging on the wall by a nail is it real estate? (probably not.) But if I built a special frame for a couple of paintings right into the walls of the house and then bolted the frames closed around the paintings then maybe it is. And if it is, it remains part of the real estate even if it's been temporarily taken down for cleaning or maintenance.</p>
<p>And what I call out first, and whether I use words like &quot;remaining&quot;, come into play.</p>
<p>So the real reason you <em>always</em> need a lawyer is that the tune that all these words dance to is both simple and endlessly subtle.</p>
<p>So sometimes there's a distinction that makes no difference, and sometimes there's a difference that makes distinctions obvious. </p>
<p>In general you've got your land, your stuff, your rights (copyright, reciprocal licenses, contracts promised to you), your grants of title (fuzzy ownership stuff), and finally whatever <em>else</em> you can convince the court you have.</p>
<p>When I was learning this stuff (second-hand, this is not my S.M.E.) it was what I called &quot;precisely vague&quot;... but since I am not a lawyer, take that as a layman's translation.</p>
<p>If you google &quot;real estate versus other types&quot; you'll see that &quot;real estate&quot; is put across from all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Stick with &quot;if you can touch it, maybe with a stick, and it's supposed to be peppermint&quot; then it it's real estate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
