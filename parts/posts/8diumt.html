		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An alpha particle is a helium-4 nucleus resulting from the alpha decay of a radioactive nucleus. The typical amount of kinetic energy carried away by an alpha particle after an alpha decay is around 5 MeV. That's why alpha particles are ionizing radiation. </p>
<p>Atoms in helium gas at STP have typical kinetic energies on the order of 0.025 eV, so they are not ionizing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They aren't the same thing any more than a beta ray is an electron. Alpha particles are made of Helium nuclei and beta rays are made of electrons, but there is a unique context for both: high kinetic energy.</p>
<p>For the same reason a loose bullet (specifically without a casing and gunpowder) just sitting on a table is much less dangerous to you than a fired bullet traveling towards you at high speed with a lot of energy. The same reason a parked car is different than a speeding car at 200 mph.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
