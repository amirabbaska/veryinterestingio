		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their flight pattern <a href="https://www.livescience.com/7256-fruit-flies-find-wine.html" target="_blank">is consistent with Lévy’s distribution</a>, which is a mathematical algorithm.  As the insect alternates between flying straight and making abrupt 90 degree turns, it optimizes for the goals of detecting faint odors, and avoiding ending up in a place with no odors to track.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the simple answer is: They see motion better than shape or color and they can't see very far.</p>
<p>Humans can sense motion two ways: Something moves in relation to something else (like mountains in the distance far away move less than the tree you're driving past) and motion relative to the eye (if you look at the blue sky and a plane flies by, you can tell it's moving even with nothing in the background to compare to). So we can zoom right in on something and walk straight to it.</p>
<p>A lot of animals have eyes that are more sensitive to the second kind of motion sensing. When something moves in relation to their eyes, they see it 'better' than if it's standing still.</p>
<p>For an insect with compound eyes (hundreds of tiny eyes sitting on two eyeballs) each little eye sees a slightly different area of the whole vision.</p>
<p>As the insect flies past something, at first only the front eyes see it, then the side eyes, then the back eyes. The insect sees the object 'move' as different eyes see the object then don't see it.</p>
<p>As an insect flies forward, things in front are getting closer, but not changing much... not 'moving' in relation to the eyes. Things to the side, however, are whizzing by, so it sees them better. If a bee were to fly back and forth (left/right), things in front would be very clear and things on the side not so clear.</p>
<p>So if an insect flies forward in a zig-zag, it can see where it's going, what it's passing, and what's behind it pretty well. Here's an example:</p>
<p>Dogs follow a scent in the same way. Someone tested it by dragging a pheasant (with a light on it) through a field at night, then letting a dog (with a light on it) find it. He caught the whole thing on one piece of film:</p>
<p>It does a lot of zig-zagging.</p>
<p>Now.. why the random changes and even circles? Well, most insects can't see very far in the sense of focusing. The sun is VERY bright, so it's easily seen. A bee searching for flowers can sense big changes in light (Like white flowers next to dark green leaves) from a good distance, but they can't really tell if it's flowers or someone's tennis shoe lying in the yard. So insects do a LOT of searching around.. seemingly random movements, even circles, as they try to find something they want.</p>
<p>There are other things, too.. like the fact that they also follow smell.
Moths keep an eye on bright objects like candles and light-bulbs. If the moth keeps the moon on its right, then it'll fly in a relatively straight path as the moon is very far away. If it keeps a candle to its right, then as it flies past the candle it has to turn right to keep the angle the same. It keeps doing this and spirals right up to the flame.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer, that is true among the majority of species: it's easier for a predator to catch and eat something that's moving in a straight line.</p>
<p>This is especially true in fish, as 99% of the time only the biggest fish swim in a straight line. Almost all smaller fish zig and zag out of instinct to not be predictable to predators, such as bigger fish or birds or whatever predators may be around.</p>
<p>Wild animals are all about energy in (food) and energy out (movement). Thus, most predators would prefer to ambush their prey while using minimal energy. It takes much more energy to chase down something that is moving erratically compared to intercepting something moving in a straight line. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's a combination of things. As others have said, vision and scent tracking, but also avoiding predators. It's much harder for, say, a bird, to snatch them when they zig-zag, just like how soldiers avoid running in a straight line when fired upon.</p>
<p>Of course, it could also be that they have a microscopic brain and are just plain stupid. That would also explain why they are buzzing against a window pain for an hour, without noticing the open window right next to it...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other than how they sense things (already mentioned), I'd guess having a less predictable path helps avoid predation by birds or other flying insects. (And look at how maneuverable most flying insectivores have to be, such as swallows or dragonflies. If their main prey was easy to pick off in flight, they wouldn't need to be as agile.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
