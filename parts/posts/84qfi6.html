		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in two ways. Firstly when you send a voltage down a wire, if the wire is say, unconnected, the pulse can reflect at the end because of the impedance mismatch and briefly create a small voltage spike. This brief spike can be up to double the signal voltage so if your signal is high to begin with it can cause a problem. Even connected cables still experience this, so If you want a good signal on long cables they need to be impedance-matched to stop voltages bouncing back and forth at junctions and disrupting any data you are sending along the cable.</p>
<p>Secondly the rush of current along a cable creates a magnetic field around the wire. Depending on the orientation of the wire (kinked or wound) this can create opposing magnetic fields which push against each other. If the current is very high, the cable can move slightly, though most high current cables would be too heavy to notice much movement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvXom0FCrY" target="_blank">video</a> of what well-secured power cables can do when you send 156,000 amps through them.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytuwTkEYOa0" target="_blank">video</a> of what can happen when power cables are weakly secured.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other comments about electrical cables physically moving are true, but I want to share something a little more abstract.</p>
<p>We often make analogies between current flowing through wires being like water through pipes and the voltage being like pressure that forces the water to move. When you have water flowing then cut it of suddenly, that causes a higher pressure while energy stored in the inertia of the water is dissipated. That called water hammer, and can cause the hose to move. <a href="https://youtu.be/xoLmVFAFjn4" target="_blank">Video</a>. Similarly, if you have a wire carrying current and suddenly turn it off, it will cause a voltage spike. For low-power stuff that's typically not going to be much of an issue, but with higher power things, you need to be aware of that and have a way to dissipate that energy. For instance, circuit breakers for power distribution have to have a place for the energy stored in the transmission lines to go when disconnected, called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snubber" target="_blank">snubber</a>. In a hose carrying water, the mass of water in the hose and speed of flow will determine how much of a pressure spike there will be. For an electrical system the inductance of the system is like the mass of water in the hose and current is like the speed of flow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely!!! In adition to all these comments(most are right)
But transfering current also causes heat. Not much but enough to expand the wire ever so slightly enough that over 50, 100, 200 feet or more it can gain several inches if not feet.</p>
<p>When its in conduit (say a 70 foot run onThe exterior of your house to a new A/C condenser) this causes a perfectly straight wire to become zigzagged, which causes rattling when it starts up. </p>
<p>(Literally just dealt with this today, had to just tell the dude, &quot;physics is physics, there really is no fix&quot;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a very interesting read at these links about finding and then repairing a break in a 230,000 volt, 800 amp cable that is 10 miles long. The cause of the break was the cable moving from the load surges. Part of finding the break was a tool called a thumper which can make the break in the cable move, which can be heard on the street. It then goes into repairing the cable as it lives in a pipe filled with hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil.</p>
