		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know more about this than a lay-person should, but that's perhaps because I'm considering starting a business in this area. On this, you can AAMA - I know quite a bit.</p>
<p>I also know this is <em>way</em> more info than you actually care about, and nobody is going to care about this, but I enjoy talking about it, so, here goes:</p>
<p>The system you're talking about in tennis is called <a href="https://www.hawkeyeinnovations.com" target="_blank">Hawk-Eye</a> and the first time I saw it in use was during a cricket match being shown in the UK where the broadcaster had brought it in to understand very subtle decisions almost impossible to judge by eye (cricket has a rule called &quot;LBW&quot; which in particular, is hard to get right sometimes by sight), and it quickly got engrained into the top tier of the game.</p>
<p>There are other systems as well. Ever wondered how &quot;they know&quot; your favourite soccer player has run 18.2km this game? That's almost certainly from the <a href="http://chyronhego.com" target="_blank">ChryonHego</a> Tracab system.</p>
<p>When it comes to pass completion, shots on goal, etc. that data is probably coming from another system called Opta. That relies on a mixture of camera tracking and human event classification (they have people at games saying &quot;that frame was a pass, that frame was an attempt at goal, etc.&quot;</p>
<p>In Rugby the players are often wearing positional tracking devices that also track heart rate and letting coaches know how players are performing in real-time. I believe NFL does this too.  Basketball has a mixture of systems, and in cricket, they have even more toys (I'll come back to that). </p>
<p>You are probably also aware that in motorsports, the objective has become &quot;a driver moving as large a collection of sensors as possible around a track as quickly as possible&quot;, because the more sensors you have, the better you are at managing the data, the more likely you are to win. Hilariously, just this weekend, one F1 team has shown that their <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/alonso-qualifying-spa-honda-mclaren-945396/" target="_blank">positional analysis is easy to fool and can lead to stupid decisions</a>.</p>
<p>The positional tracking systems all have similar concepts: film something, then analyse each frame. In the case of Tracab and Opta, they're happy with 25 frames per second, the same as most broadcast TV systems. I would argue it's a little too low for accuracy.</p>
<p>Hawk-Eye is a much higher frame rate (500-1000 frames per second) that should aid with the accuracy. Each frame is broken down in terms of object recognition: here are the lines, here's the ball. Now look at the relationship between them and produce a data frame. The data frame will have x, y, z co-ordinates of a ball in relation to a line or some other aspect you care about, and can be fed into a piece of software that can call &quot;foul&quot; or &quot;goal&quot; or whatever you need.</p>
<p>Now, why has it not all replaced officials? It's obviously already used to augment officials. In some tennis competitions you can actually hear Hawk-Eye make a noise on fouls that is effectively taking the place of a linesman. In EPL games, goal line technology using something like Hawk-Eye (not ChyronHego, I believe), is used to let a referee know the ball just crossed the line in case it's not obvious to them.</p>
<p>For some scenarios then, it is being used to replace linesmen. There are three reasons it hasn't yet succeeded in removing them completely, I think.</p>
<p>Firstly: cost. It's not cheap. There are a lot of problems they have to take into account in getting this far. Wind, light, shadows, floodlights causing multiple shadows, they all need to be dealt with. That has led to R&amp;D costs being quite significant.</p>
<p>They are proprietary systems that cost a fortune to develop, and it's a bit of a closed-shop monopoly. Setup requires a fair bit of work and there is normally a team of people running it behind the scenes at each game where this technology is deployed.</p>
<p>That cost is not a problem with the top tier, but the top tier of every sport normally knows its future lies in lower rungs and &quot;grass roots&quot; forms of the game. It's important that even the second division (where these systems can't be used), look and feel like the top tier. And ideally, it should be possible to play the game on a Sunday afternoon down your local park without it seeming to be futile.</p>
<p>Human judges aid with that. They signal &quot;you can do this&quot;. The sports in which that's not possible (F1), still have alternatives, and there are some measurement systems (timing, speed, etc.) that are accessible to teens with a desire to soup up their Corolla.</p>
<p>Secondly: not all in-game events can be tracked using these systems. Hawk-Eye can track a ball near a line being foul or not, but it can't easily tell whether a player's foot is over the line it should not be when serving, for example. </p>
<p>Even in cricket where Hawk-Eye first made its reputation, detection of foul balls (when a bowler steps over a line) has to still be done by umpires and video review. Whether the ball hit a bat or not is done by audio detection (snick-o-meter), and heat-sensitive camera (as the ball brushes the bat, the friction warms it up enough to show as white hot on an appropriate camera). The technology isn't quite there yet to make it possible for these events to be done through camera analysis alone.</p>
<p>Thirdly: accuracy. It's pretty damned good in some scenarios but less so in others. I competed in the Manchester City hackday in July 2016 (was in the winning team, too) where we got access to Tracab and Opta raw data from some historical games. In some of those frames we were seeing the football travelling - according to their systems - at 1,500m/s - which is about Mach 5. It clearly didn't actually do that (I mean, I think Yaya Toure is <em>great</em>, but he's not <em>that</em> good), so where did the error creep in? </p>
<p>That casts doubt, and to my mind, just enough to not allow it to be determining the outcomes of games on which millions of pounds and entries in history books are determined.</p>
<p>Hawk-Eye's higher frame rate is likely to make it much more accurate, so you can see it making more inroads into official calls. It makes most sense in contexts of positional review (cricket, tennis, goals in soccer), and ideally in phased-play games where there is a lot of stop-start and reviews can be done without disrupting play.</p>
<p>Tennis lends itself to all this perfectly, so the only honest answer I can give you as to why it's not everywhere is quite simply cost and the fact some in-game events can't be done through hawkeye so they need the official anyway. They'll defer to humans allow Hawk-Eye on review where it has the time to churn the data rather than in real-time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It uses camera images. The exact location and specifications of the camera, tennis balls, field lines are known. Then by analyzing the size and location of the ball on the different camera images, they can determine its actual location. </p>
<p>Why hasn't it replaced linesmen? First of all it's extremely expensive to set up, so in the near future it's never going to be a universal system. Secondly I'm not sure if it's possible to have it activated in real-time, to call immediately when a ball is out. Given that in football goalline technology seems to work that way, it looks possible, but I don't know the details. Finally tradition is very important in tennis, which could hold back some possible advancements. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on p7r's magnificient response, the availability is really dependant on the costs and the situation. Currently in tennis, not every big tournament has the system implemented on each and every court. The system is used as a way to contest referees and linesmen calls and not systematically call every single ball inbounds or not. The whole rallies aren't probably saved for data storage purposes, but impact points can be used on broadcast to show statistics (such as where the services landed all-match), and if the system has a 99.9% accuracy mark, there's less likely to be a lot of wrong calls upon using it 1000 times rather than 100000 times.</p>
<p>Also the cameras are obviously situated 360° around, to be as accurate as possible in spotting whether there is a space as small as half of a millimeter between where the ball landed and the line  (which is basically the whole point, to see if the ball and line have a contact). Many cameras are essential because you wouldn't want the player's body to stand in the way of your only camera.</p>
<p>Finally, even if the human eye isn't as accurate as the machine, a linesman wouldn't have system errors or accidentally lose a file. While it's not common, I've witnessed tennis matches where the replay wouldn't be available for numerous reasons, so the game cannot be dependant uniquely on that system for now. Also, a human response is much quicker, and the players love to keep the flow going in a high intensity game.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of sports value tradition over technology so its important to still have people on the field saying yes or no. MLB didn't even allow instant replay until 2008 which was decades after it became prominent in other sports and that delay was detrimental to the game. But lots of people opposed it because arguing with the umpire over differences in opinion is fundamental to the culture of baseball. If you scrap the humans, then there is no one to argue with and it diminishes some of the excitement of the game. Tennis is somewhat the same and the drama is a lot lower if there is a computer making the calls. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
