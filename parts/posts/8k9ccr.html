		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three main types of hardware used.</p>
<p><strong>Pitons</strong> are hammered in, and left there.  You can't re-use old pitons that you find, because they suck, and may have started to work their way out from freeze-thaw.  In any case, almost nobody uses them anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Bolts</strong> (with hangers) are permanent fixtures.  They are re-useable, but they are drilled into the rock.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Trad&quot; protection</strong> is temporary, and consists of things that get jammed into cracks in such a way that falling won't pull them out.  This includes cams, hexes, nuts, and a couple varieties of specialty hardware.</p>
<p>EDIT: I forgot that pitons are still used in &quot;aid climbing&quot;, where one actually puts weight on the gear, rather than using it only to protect against a possible fall.  I don't know anybody who does it; I suspect that aid climbing is sufficiently rarified as to fall into the &quot;hardly anyone&quot; category.  :-)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most climbers these days use temporary protection in the form of cams (friends), nuts and ice screws. Usually people climb in pairs so one climbs placing protection in cracks and other secure points (leading) and their partner stays at the bottom and keeps the rope tight (belay) until the lead climber reaches a secure rest point and takes control of the rope. Then the belay climbs up to the lead, removing the protection (except the topmost piece that the lead is belaying from) along the way. They then continue up in the same fashion, sometimes leapfrogging each other to swap roles until they reach the top. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sport climbing equipment involves quickdraws which are retrievable immediately, but they're clipped into previously placed bolts which are not. Sport climbing bolts are still removable but only with proper power tools.</p>
<p>Trad gear is temporarily placed into cracks for protection and are removable afterwards.</p>
<p>Pitons are rare and are hammered into the wall, semi-permanently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day, people used to hammer in or &quot;nail&quot; hardware into the cracks of the rock.  These were called Pitons.  They were  sometimes left in and sometimes removed, but in spots where they were put in and removed repeatable, they caused damage to the rock and changed it.  Because of this, they are not very common any more.</p>
<p>Modern climbing has two &quot;styles&quot; of using hardware these days.  The permanent style attached the hardware permanently with either glued in or expansion bolt hardware.  Climbers bring their own temporary hardware to use with the permanent gear and then typically remove it when they're done.</p>
<p>The temporary style uses a variety of gear that is designed to be removed after use.  Sometimes this gear gets stuck though and becomes a part of the rock for a long time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trad protection can be recovered, but it can be dangerous in some situations. My climbing partner almost got himself killed making the mistake of trying to recover all but the top one on his way down, as he could not make it all the way up the cliff. The top one came out when he was a few meters above the ground, fortunately not earlier, so he survived. Although he had to be helicoptered out with a spine injury and never climbed again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
