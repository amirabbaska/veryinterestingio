		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are stages of sleep where you take in next to no outside information--you are dead to the world, basically. There are lighter stages of sleep where you take in more information and can be easily woken up. We cycle through many stages in a night of normal sleep, which means there will be several points during the night when sleep is light and you are more likely to be disturbed.</p>
<p>Your brain also doesn't remember much in REM/deep sleep, while you remember more in lighter stages of sleep. You literally forget that you hit deep sleep.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things that mess up deep stages of sleep: alcohol, sedative-hypnotics like benzos and z-drugs, some mental illness, some sleep disorders, etc. If you aren't hitting dead-to-the-world deep sleep, of course you will be woken up more easily.</p>
<p>Problems like hypervigilance can disturb sleep because you are basically scanning for a reason to find a threat, and it's pretty hard to fall asleep with that sort of anxiety.</p>
<p>Thay said, research suggests that outside of major sleep disorders, the difference between good sleep and bad sleep is highly subjective. Many people who consider themselves light or poor sleepers are actually quite average.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: this got bigger than I thought it would, so I would like to take a minute to get on my own small soapbox:</strong></p>
<p>If you are concerned about your own sleep, <em>please please please</em> talk to your doctor. There are thousands of things that impact sleep. Don't leave it to strangers on the internet. Your health and well-being are worth it. </p>
<p>/u/none_shall_pass touched on sleep apnea, which I didn't mention, but I think it warrants extra attention. [The Mayo Clinic has a good overview.] (<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/basics/symptoms/con-20020286" target="_blank">http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/basics/symptoms/con-20020286</a>)</p>
<p>If you are concerned about anxiety, hypervigilance, or anything else related to mental health, <em>please please please</em> think about reaching out for help. Doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors, social workers, mental health clinics, school counsellors, campus counsellors, online counselling resources, workplace employee assistance programs, mental health advocacy organizations, whatever is available in your area. Anyone can learn skills to feel better and handle the ups and downs of life more easily. And everyone deserves to feel well and healthy.</p>

<p>The short answer is, it's not fully known why this occurs. Humans have a wide range of variability in our species (by the way, current top comment keeps referring to subspecies of humans sleeping different, that's some false terminology), and thus behave and interact with the environment in an equally wide range of ways. </p>
<p>Add to this situational events such as lack of recent sleep, stress, or even familiarity with the area you are sleeping in, and it is more understandable why this variation occurs. That's not to say there is or isn't one overarching reason, but mainly that many factors influence how a person sleeps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's possible you were in this state permanently with your ex SO. You could ask yourself where you do sleep well, this might give a hint to the environment in which your alertness is switched off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It <em>highly</em> depends to what you wake up for.
Young mothers wake up to anything that sounds like baby crying. While some other sounds don't seem to matter at all.</p>
<p>For me, I'm a really deep sleeper and can easily shut down 7 alarms without even remembering I woke up to do this.
I once woke up, lit a cigarette, got long-time-no-nicotine-dizziness, fall asleep again and didn't even wake up when half of my duvet burned down. Thank god my dog started barking like mad due smoke.</p>
<p>But whenever I - before falling asleep - give myself mental command &quot;if it rings, get up, get up&quot;, I jump up like a spring, sometimes even a minute BEFORE first alarm. And like a fool, wonder if I have a superpower like Jack Reacher or something to tell time in my head. Even weirder that it has nothing to do with tiredness level, sometimes I play games till 5 and still jump up at 8, just because I told myself to do this before falling asleep. Telling yourself to wake up doesn't sound very convincing when you're dead tired, but for some reason, it works. For me at least. 90% of time or so.</p>
<p>There is antidote to this: cold room with super warm blankets. If that happens, and especially if room gets warmer in the morning, there's no sound or force in the world that can wake you up. My dad used to lit the stove in the early hours to warm the room up in our country house (military smarts, probably) and I remember those days as absolutely most luxurious sleep I've ever gotten. I woke up and felt like I've gained super health and energy.</p>
<p>I think It's how brain and conscious are wired. I think your ears don't really turn off while you sleep, but your mind wires what ears should consider important and what not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense for a communication-based species to have members that can be in constant &quot;guard mode&quot; in case of any overnight danger so that they can alert their whole tribe. But because most of the time there is no danger and the light sleepers will wake up because a cat meowed, you don't want everybody to be light sleepers, because fully rested members of the tribe are more efficient for the daily work.  </p>
<p>So basically what happens it that evolutionary speaking, a humanoid sub-species with only light sleepers will lose in combat or any less brutal competition to well rested enemies and, over generations, eventually go extinct. A humanoid sub-species with only deep sleepers will get regularly robbed from their resources overnight or even murdered in their sleep by predators/competitors; eventually going extinct. The subspecies with a mix of both, however, will thrive; and that's our ancestors.  </p>
<p>Like many evolutionary traits, sleeping variety is an artefact of a time it was more useful than in nowadays' society. But since it's not really detrimental to our survival, that characteristic is still around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
