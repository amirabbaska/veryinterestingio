But if they have charge, then thet have an electromagnetic field. But then electromagnetic fields are described that carried by virtual photons. But nothing can leave a black hole event horizon, not even photons. What am I missing?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just like a black hole's gravitational field, a black hole's electromagnetic field is not something that is communicated from within the event horizon. There's nothing traveling from inside the horizon to outside to give some sort of message &quot;this is what the field is&quot;. The field is already there.</p>
<p>(Also, virtual particles are not real things. It's just an unfortunately chosen misnomer for a mathematical tool.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way to convey information about black hole geometries is with a Penrose (or conformal) diagram. You can see the diagrams for a Schwarzschild (non-charged) and Reissner-Nordstrom (charged) black hole in the second picture on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_diagram" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>They are quite different in many ways, including singularity and event horizon structure. As far as I know, there is no clear explanation for how the Schwarzschild diagram would become the RN or Kerr diagram. Such a thing might happen in real life when a Schwarzschild black hole absorbs a radially infalling charged mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
