		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've actually Googled this, but the answers are so convoluted that I can't make real sense of it. They are apparently selling oil on the black market in Turkey, but that doesn't explain where the oil is going. Or how they can possibly make as much as $3,000,000 per day selling it. I just can't imagine that much oil simply disappearing or being dispersed fast enough that their opponents couldn't stop it.</p>
<p>Which leads to the next related question. With the money they make from oil, they are buying new, modern high-quality weapons. Who is selling them these weapons, including the ammunition? More importantly, where are they getting the continued support for these weapons?</p>
<p>It's all very confusing.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> While I absolutely, completely, genuinely appreciate all the responses, nearly all of them are guesses or assumptions about the region or the oil industry. Can anyone ELI5 with some real-world research?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong> Well look at that. I go to bed a wake up to an amazing set of detailed answers. Once I get to a computer (on my phone at the moment), I'll note some of the best answers by name, so they can get their deserved recognition. Some of the best ones are still buried with just a few upvotes, and they deserve more.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong> As promised, here are some of the best answers. Not only are they precise and factually-based, but they are clearly explained (which is the heart of this subreddit):</p>
