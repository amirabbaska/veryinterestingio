If you were close to the supernova, but have it still be in your field of view (and let's pretend you can't die, and that your eyes can handle it), wouldn't it appear to expand very slowly (due to speed of light limitations)? Would there be any red/blue shifting effects from the explosion on one side going away from you and on the other side coming towards you? What would an accurate animation actually look like?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how close you are. If you are very close, you see nothing and then suddenly you are in the supernova (because the light doesn't travel much faster than the matter behind it).</p>
<p>If you are more distant and don't get directly hit by fast matter, you see the expelled matter expanding very quickly. If you are even more distant, it looks slower. Whatever goes in your direction is blueshifted, but for human eyes it would look white anyway unless you are so far away that it appears as point source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
