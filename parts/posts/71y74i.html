		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The surface of the earth is collection of huge 'plates' that float over a layer of partly solid and partly molten rock called magma; collectively  referred to as  the earth's 'mantle'. These plates floating on the mantle are called 'Tectonic Plates'. They are in constant, if very slow, motion. Where the plates bump against each other there is friction and pressure. The 'Ring of Fire' is where the edges of the plates meet. The fire in The 'Ring of Fire' refers to volcanos  created when one tectonic plate is shoved under another. This movement of the ocean floor produces a &quot;mineral transmutation,&quot; which leads to the melting  of magma  bubbling out at a gap in the seams: that is volcanos.</p>
<p>Earthquakes are caused by buckling and cracking of the earth's plates caused by the pressure of them pushing together at the seams. The pressure is so great that 'something has to give'. One of the plates moves violently, and that is called an earthquake.</p>
<p>We know that the earthquakes are related in the sense that they occur because of a particular plate moving in a general direction. What we don't know is the specific reasons underlying the movement of any particular plate, the speed of the movement, or the specific amount of pressure required to cause a quake. </p>
<p>As for the danger to California, yes, someday there will be a disaster, and since we know where the plate seam is, we can roughly predict where. However, we don't understand enough of the variables to say <em>when</em>, even within an error range of a thousand years. </p>
<p>I prefer to take to the approach of the late Warren Zevon on the danger to me personally from 'the big one' in California.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>And if California should fall into the ocean, like the mystics and statistics say it will, I predict my hotel will stay standing until I pay my bill.....and I never will.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is called the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;. The whole region is unusually active compared to the rest of the world. With anything that is randomly active, you will always have periods of more activity and less activity than the average for that thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SoCal resident here - which &quot;media&quot; are you talking about? All I've seen is the usual &quot;This is a good time to make sure you have an earthquake emergency plan and supplies&quot; type of stories in the news. </p>
<p>Which is a great fringe benefit to being a camper - you pretty much always have earthquake supplies on hand....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Californian here who studied a bit of geology. </p>
<p>California building codes assume there will be earthquakes. We bolt our houses to their foundations and use materials that can handle ground movement. You won't see brick buildings in CA.  That being said, there are still a lot of old buildings that I would never live in.  Retrofit or not, I'd never live in a masonry building. </p>
<p>Having 5+ quakes is actually a good thing. They relieve stress on the plates. The more 5s we get, the longer it will be before we have an 8.</p>
<p>So, is there a lot of activity in the ring of fire?  Yes.  Should Californians be worried?  No, but they should be prepared.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The biggest earthquakes are along converging boundaries. Just do your research on the two. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
