<p>As far as voting goes, most regulations (including how votes are gathered) are determined at the state level in the US so standardization is very difficult to do.</p>
<p>Also making sure it's clear to you that there's no concrete evidence any votes were changed - this aspect of most voting machines and systems are fairly secure (but again, not unhackable)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skip the lotto machine example (yes, they're hackable!) and substitute ATMs. Because Diebold, the same company that <del>makes</del>used to make a lot of electronic voting machines also makes a lot of ATMs. </p>
<p>So: why have we had seemingly error- and fraud-proof ATMs since the 1980s while electronic voting is such a mess?</p>
<p>On one hand, banks are sophisticated, well-resourced commercial entities with a profit motive. They have paid a <em>lot</em> of money over the years to ensure that ATMs are, from the user's perspective, largely fool-proof, and they're in a position to insist that ATMs work perfectly each and every time (or close enough to it). And however many banks there are, all of them participate in one of very few interbank networks, most of which rely upon a defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8583" target="_blank">ISO standard</a> financial transaction messages, making things a lot easier. Oh, and there are probably millions of financial transactions per day, all of which fit the same pattern: take money from <em>this</em> account and either put it in <em>that</em> account or dispense it as cash. </p>
<p>On the other hand, elections are conducted by literally <em>thousands</em> of individual municipal governments, all of which are constantly hurting for funds, that are not subject to any kind of standardization even on the state level, let alone the national level. The constitutional structure of the United States--both federal and state--makes it almost impossible to change this. And elections happen no more than once or twice per <em>year</em>, but they're all different. Different offices, different candidates, and even different <em>numbers</em> of candidates. And don't get me started on things like referenda. So you've got an arbitrary number of decisions to make, with an arbitrary number of options for each decision, for each and every election <em>on the municipal level</em>. Paying to have ballots printed is bad enough. Paying to have ballots <em>reprogrammed</em> would cost one hell of a lot more. And this for entities that barely do anything nine month out of the year.</p>
<p>That's why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great, an ELI5 I can tackle. I work in infosec and specialize in offensive security (penetration testing, break-ins, doxxing, etc.), so I have experience in how hackable devices tend to be. Since you're likely referring to the voting machine hacking expo at this year's Defcon, I'll talk about that first. The voting machines present during that event were of several varieties and software, which meant that some were easier/harder to hack than others; in fact, the easiest one to hack took only 90 minutes! One thing that many people overlook though is that the first machine was already retired and not in use in actual elections—the machine was running Windows XP as its base operating system, and in the cyber security world, Windows XP is the mother of all Swiss cheese. We like to say that if you hook an XP box to the internet, it's already been taken over, simply due to how many automatic scripts are just crawling around online and looking for XP machines to infect. So that box was cracked after running a pre-built exploit to get into it, and wouldn't be used in an actual election.</p>
<p>Other boxes, however, had exposed I/O units (specifically USB ports), which would very much be an issue. If you wanted to hack these and had the resources (i.e. the software beforehand in order to write a script to hack it), you could plug in a Rubber Ducky (which is essentially a flash drive with a processor that will run whatever script you want and trick the machine into thinking it's a keyboard) and change whatever you want. However, voting machines use proprietary software and utilize the practice known as &quot;security through obscurity.&quot; Nobody has access to voting machine software, ergo nobody can go ahead and configure an exploit to break in with. If you want to do it on the fly, you'll need to bring a Raspberry Pi, a screen, a keyboard, a mouse, and a power source with you to the voting machine and then hope that the machine has USB ports and t<em>then</em> hope that you can hack it within ten or so minutes (yes, you can technically take as long as you want but people will get suspicious and figure out you're not trying to decide the fate of your country). So on that level, they <em>are</em> secure because they removed two things: extended access, and understanding of the inner-workings. It puts you into a time-limited black box, which means that your hands as a hacker are essentially tied. Hackers try to attack the weakest point of any system and voting machines simply aren't that point. It would be way easier to compromise people, or even faking paper ballots rather than trying to break into the boxes.</p>
<p>Now, the question on why the security is better in lottery machines (assuming equal access to both) is for a few reasons. The top reason is that lotto companies have a financial incentive to maximize their security, which will prevent them from losing both money and integrity with consumers. To call them &quot;unhackable&quot; may be a stretch (I wouldn't know—I haven't tried), but it's possible. A lot of hackers/pentesters will tell you that &quot;nothing is unhackable! Everything is vulnerable!&quot; The truth of that is that technically a system <em>can</em> be unhackable, but the point they're trying to get across is that those are so rare and infeasible to create, they might as well not exist (people are the weakest part of any system, then the services the technology is running, then finally the technology itself). Tangent aside, the government, unfortunately, is not quite as motivated by election integrity as companies are by money. Human greed is a huge driving factor and manages to make a lot of the things we have work, since everyone wants to make more money. The government may or may not have our best interests at heart (I don't want to get political here), but the sad truth is that they don't really know how to pass legislation to ensure the machines are secure, and don't really desire to do so. They're not tech-savvy, and don't ask people who are (though if any congressman is reading this, I'm available~). So overall, not much gets done in the way of security. The companies that make the machines are going to get paid whether they secure them well or not, so it doesn't really end up being their concern. And even if both they and the government wanted to, they'd run into one of the biggest issues the government faces, being that it's not exactly the fastest thing alive. Even if they wanted to deploy security patches, there's no telling how long it would take the government to put procedures in place to effectively do any of that on any level.</p>
<p>But fortunately, there's no need to fret, because the voting system <em>is</em> remarkably secure for what it is! I previously mentioned that the machines aren't the weakest point in the system, and fortunately, we've done a lot of non-tech things to make the system as a whole more secure. The boxes aren't connected to the internet, people do a lot to ensure that nobody that isn't trusted has access to the boxes, the boxes are being monitored until the government counts the votes, etc. It's not a perfect system, of course, but the government does do a decent job at gardening the system as a whole, even if the software leaves a bit to be desired.</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues is that they end up leaving it open to a Man-In-The-Middle Attack, where a trusted party ends up compromising the integrity of the data. Fortunately, the way that pre and post-voting is set up makes it difficult for any rogue hacker to get into the broader system and start tampering with stuff. However, the way that the code is set up does mean that the machines are very vulnerable to attacks by the manufacturers themselves. They have the source and we have no way to review that, so they could weigh the votes 55% for one party and 45% for another and we would have almost no way of knowing (we could find out, but it would be difficult). So if the companies that manufacture the voting machines have a vested interest in one candidate and are willing to violate some extremely serious laws (treason-level), then yes, they could feasibly tamper with the results and make their individual come out on top. But to do this would require wide-scale integrity-compromise and probably wouldn't swing the election unless you were able to corrupt the other voting machine companies as well (in the case of a national election), or your state happens to be able to swing the result, if the results happen to be close.</p>
<p>Opinion Time: I think that voting machine software being vulnerable to anyone, even to the manufacturers, could be solved if the software were made open source and available to everyone to review. If people can submit but reports and then the developers <em>actually fix them,</em> you can end up with some highly tamper-resistant machines that aren't in danger of being manipulated by the programmers themselves. Do a full-audit of every voting machine after the election to ensure that the software is correct, and you now have a system that is secure through exposure and trials. The downside is that if someone finds something big, they could theoretically hide it and save it for the election, given that nobody else finds it. But just put all I/O ports on the inside (or encrypt the communication channels so only special machines can actually interact with the software at all) and then place a tamper alarm on the physical box and you should be good to go. I don't think that electronic voting is inherently a bad idea, and I also think that it has some tremendous benefits compared to paper voting. But as are many things with the government, a good idea is turned into a poorly-implemented one due to incompetence, greed, or some other factor that corrodes the original intention of the concept that was introduced.</p>
<p>I hope this answered your question sufficiently. Let me know if you have any others and I'll do my best to answer them!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Voting systems need to fulfill a lot of criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>each voter gets one vote only</li>
<li>the voter needs to verify that their choice was recorded correctly</li>
<li>no one can find out a particular voter's choice</li>
<li>voters can monitor the counting process if they so choose</li>
</ol>
<p>With paper voting:</p>
<ol>
<li>you get official ballot paper at the polling place, mark it, then hand in the notification card you got in the mail and throw your ballot into the urn. Three people watch while this happens. </li>
<li>you can immediately see where you marked the paper, if you make a mistake, you can get a new paper.</li>
<li>after the ballot has been thrown into the urn, it becomes anonymous. For good measure, the urn is shaken after sealing, and before unsealing.</li>
<li>you can go to the polling station and sit in a long line, where all the ballots pass through, and make your own tally.</li>
</ol>
<p>With machine voting:</p>
<ol>
<li>the official enables the machine after verifying your eligibility. Three people watch while this happens.</li>
<li>the machine shows what you pressed. You have no way of verifying that this is recorded correctly. If you make a mistake, there is no way to correct it.</li>
<li>the order of ballots is recorded, so an observer could count people going in and de-anonymize voters this way.</li>
<li>you can go to the polling station and verify that the recorded data and the final tally match. Due to 2., there is no way that this must correspond with the actual votes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The machines are also very expensive compared to paper ballots, which makes allocation of voting machines to districts a hot topic. There have been several instances of large districts only having a single machine, which led to hour-long queues, putting anyone who was unable to take an entire day off at a severe disadvantage (in addition to several polling places closing before everyone voted).</p>
<p>In short: you cannot have a constitutionally sound election with voting machines, and with enough volunteers it is entirely possible to run an election without them. Don't fix what ain't broken.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
