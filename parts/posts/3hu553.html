		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay. I used to work for a credit card processor. Here's how it works. </p>
<p>Purchase:</p>
<ol>
<li>The customer buys something. The merchant's bank checks with the customer's bank to make sure the customer has funds in their account, and the customer's bank puts a hold on the account in the amount- this hold is called the authorization. <strong>This is what makes it appear as if the charge hits your card right away</strong></li>
<li>The merchant's bank has to settle the transaction. This costs money, so it's usually done in batches by the payment processor. They settle at least once a day. </li>
<li>The settlement takes up to 72 hours to process. Once the funds are sent from the customer's bank to the merchant's bank, the settlement appears on the customer's account, the funds are withdrawn, and the authorization is cancelled.</li>
<li>The merchant's bank updates the merchant's account to show that the funds have been received. This can take up to 24 hours. </li>
<li>It's been 1-5 days, and everyone has their money now. The transaction is complete. </li>
</ol>
<p>For a refund, the process is the same, but done in reverse:</p>
<ol>
<li>The customer requests a refund. The merchant's bank requests a refund transaction from the bank. The bank checks with the merchant's bank to make sure they have the funds, and puts a hold on the amount. </li>
<li>The customer's bank has to settle the transaction.  This costs money, so it's usually done in batches by the payment processor. They settle at least once a day. </li>
<li>The settlement takes up to 72 hours to process. Once the funds are sent from the merchant's bank to the customer's bank, the settlement appears on the merchant's bank's account, the funds are withdrawn, and the authorization is cancelled.</li>
<li>The customer's bank updates the customer's account to show that the funds have been received. This can take up to 24 hours. </li>
<li>It's been 1-5 days, and everyone has their money now. The refund is complete. </li>
</ol>
<p>This is the way the credit system is designed. Charges are &quot;instant&quot; because of authorizations. The authorization is a courtesy to show you how much you owe in pending transactions and help prevent you from overdrawing the account. It always takes time for the receiver of the payment to get the money - the Merchant gives you the stuff when they get the authorization, but don't get the money for several days. When you get a refund, the flow is reversed. </p>
<p>It's not a conspiracy to squeeze extra interest out of your payment, it basically just has to be this way so the credit system works inside the existing regulations and systems in place for bank-to-bank account transfers.  </p>
<p>Does that make sense? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different systems... First you have to realize there is a difference between authorizations and postings.   </p>
<p>A charge is only &quot;real&quot; against your account when it's posted.  It's posted when the merchant does their batch close (typically) except for debit.  When you do a credit transaction there is an authorization against your account but you don't &quot;owe&quot; the money until it posts.  </p>
<p>Refunds to debit if done at a POS terminal should be automatic (just like charges).</p>
<p>Refunds to credit take time because they go through the same path as charges.  If it took 3 days for your charge to post you can be assured it will take 3 days for the refund to post.</p>
<p>Now why don't they just authorize refunds?  I suspect because when you auth a charge no money has changed hands yet.  The bank [or credit company] still has the money they were lending you.  It only goes to the merchant when they do a batch close and post the transaction.  So if they did an auth refund there would be two copies of the same money.  You'd have your refund and the merchant wouldn't have had to cough up the money yet.</p>
<p>Now why do they take so long to do batch closes?  Probably because each close costs money (+ transaction fees and percentages).  So they do them every few days to save money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seeing some good answers here. I think you should look into what finance companies call &quot;float&quot;. On mobile right now - don't know how to link a good explanation. Essentially they are benefitting from the days the money is earning interest drawn on your account minus the days it wouldn't if they refunded your account. </p>
<p>As a simple test. Go to your online bank account. Transfer money from your checking to your credit card. It'll take a few days. Now transfer money the other way. Instant. They are floating your money. Same works transferring between high and low interest rate accounts (checking to savings or savings to LT money market) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In many EU countries this also used to be the case, the reasoning behind it was because in pre electronic days the banks had 5 days to complete their bookkeeping and  paperwork.  Now in the EU, you get your money the same day you  are refunded or get a transfer.  The reason  that in your country (I assume USA) this is not the case, is your federal government politicians or one of the larger states (e.g. California, Texas, New York which would cause a domino effect) have not changed those out dated rules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On this front, there has been a lot of pressure recently from consumer groups and the government to speed up the ACH (automated clearing house) system. This is the system that debits your bank account if you use your debit card. Essentially, these groups argue that there is no legitimate reason why these transactions should, in our modern age, take up to 3-5 days to post to your account. Same goes for credit, though not through ACH. Essentially they're saying if we're all using computers, there's absolutely no need to have a charge exist in limbo for several days. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
