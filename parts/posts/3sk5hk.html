		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers I've read are, at best, misleading. The most correct answer is really &quot;No, the body does not prioritize.&quot;</p>
<p>When you're acutely injured, the body does shunt blood to your brain and core to protect the more-important, internal organs. However, that wasn't your question. You asked about rate of repair, e.g., if I injure my liver and my arm, will my arm heal more slowly than if I hadn't injured my liver?</p>
<p>First of all, after a major trauma, there's a good chance that wound healing as a whole will be reduced due to consumption of platelets and other healing factors.</p>
<p>In terms of order of operations, the body does not prioritize healing one organ, such as skin, over another in the sense of a mechanism extrinsic to your organs. It's more determined by how well your circulatory system happens to be able to perfuse that particular organ. The caveat is that some organs will heal faster or more completely than others. For example, the brain is capable of very little healing, if any, while the liver is capable of tremendous regrowth; at the same time, an organ which has been cut off from its blood supply is going to fail to heal, and ultimately die, regardless of its importance. In that sense, one could argue there's some sort of intrinsic prioritization, but not in the most intuitive manner. If it were true prioritization, the brain would heal or, to use my example from above, your arm would stay wounded while your liver finished healing. Rather, what happens is that all organs heal simultaneously according to their own individual capability and to their access to vascular perfusion.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: Five-year-old version combined with TL;DR:</strong> After an injury where you lose a lot of blood, your body sends blood to your brain and internal organs over your limbs. However, in terms of actual healing, although some organs are better at healing than others, your body doesn't actually prioritize.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Fixed the first paragraph, you vicious, cruel pedants.</p>
<p>Edit 3: Thank you for the gold and the huge response! I'm doing my best to answer every question.</p>
<p>Edit 4: A few people have commented on their livers with respect to their affection for alcohol. The liver is capable of an impressive amount of healing, but both chronic and binge alcohol use can cause damage that can't heal and that will result in serious consequences. Please speak to your doctors if you <em>or anyone else</em> is concerned about your drinking habit.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 5: Just to be crystal clear, nothing in this post should be considered medical advice. Please consult your doctor if you have questions about your health!</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>does the body prioritize</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it does, sort of.</p>
<p>For instance, your body holds your abdomen and head to a much higher priority than your arms and legs.  If you have an injury in the abdomen, such as an injured internal organ, the body will shunt blood from the extremities to that organ to get oxygen, platelets, nutrients, and leukocytes to the injured area.  If you also have an injury on your arm, sure the body will try to compensate for that, but it's going to prioritize the abdomen, because your arm isn't essential to your survival.  This is the acute reaction to multiple system trauma in the body's attempt to stabilize itself.</p>
<p>However, if you're in an accident bad enough to cause multiple severe injuries, you're probably going to need to go to the ER to survive it.</p>
<p>EDIT:  u/massivecreature has pointed out a major flaw in my original response to this question in terms of the healing process of the body.  I hastily answered in terms of the body's immediate reaction to trauma and lost sight of the healing process after stabilization.  I'm not too proud to admit when I've made a mistake.  No, the body does not particularly prioritize one body system over another in the healing process itself, though yes, when trying to compensate for major trauma, the body's nervous system will prioritize essential organs over the non-essentials for sake of survival.  Refer to the aforementioned user's contribution to this thread for more information on the healing process.</p>
<p>As some other users have stated, <strong>the body is very good at not dying</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Was in a traumatic accident in 2008. The injuries included severe spinal damage.  I shattered some vertebrae and, partially severed my cord, as well as other broken bones and soft tissue trauma. </p>
<p>One of the things  the  Docs did was to, in a sense, focus the body's &quot;healing priority&quot; to focus on the trauma to the spinal cord. After the initial surgeries, 18 hours after injury, they put me on high oxygen and a cocktail of intreveinous meds an nutrients. Then through a mixture of a high ambient temperature (think hot yoga), heat pads, vacuum-pressure and traction  increased blood pressure and flow to the spinal cord and the surrounding tissue. By doing so, especially so soon after injury, really accelerates the healing process, at least in this case.</p>
<p>I was 90%-100% numb and paralyzed from about the nipple down for 18 to 24 months. Now I'd say I have 80%- 95% sensation and function. So hey, I've got that going for me. Billmurry.jpg.   [6]</p>
<p>I don't know how ELI5 that was, but there you go.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When she woke up, poison ivy developed all over her face. (The ultimate fuck you I guess). Turned out the tree was covered in poison ivy and when her body shut down the rash never developed until she woke up. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body doesn't prioritize healing. Different tissues just naturally heal at different rates. Fore example, the tissue of the cornea (the outer layer of the eyeball) heals very quickly. Nerve fibers, on the other hand, heal very slowly. Other factors affect how quickly tissue heals as well. Diabetics and smokers heal more slowly than others. </p>
<p>Skin heals faster than bone. So the cuts on your face will heal faster than the broken leg. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
