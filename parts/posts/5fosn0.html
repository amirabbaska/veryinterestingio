		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;First, the obvious reasons for sex’s somnolent sway: the act frequently takes place at night, in a bed, and is, after all, physically exhausting (often more so for the man than the woman, although this certainly varies). So when sex is over, it’s natural for a guy to feel sleepy.</p>
<p>Secondly, research using positron emission tomography (PET) scans has shown that in order for a person to reach orgasm, a primary requirement is to let go of “all fear and anxiety.” Doing so also tends to be relaxing and might explain the tendency to snooze.&quot;</p>
<p>Thanks google haha

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hormones coursing through the guy &amp; gal after orgasm are similar to opioids. It's nature's way of rewarding you for a job well done. It's why teenage boys masturbate as much as they do. Girls too will masturbate heavily if they figure out what makes them orgasm. The same opioids and the electrical pleasure centers going off in the brain give you a momentary high that takes awhile to come off of. This time is hopefully used for cuddling and for building a stronger bond with your sexual partner. But it's that hormonal rush that makes you want to sleep.</p>
<p>(side note: older people still enjoy sex but some report that their orgasms are not as strong as they once were. Changes in body chemistry over time seems to affect the natural opiates produced.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
