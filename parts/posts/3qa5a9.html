Oil was selling for the same price in 2004 and those countries were apparently operating fine then.  What's changed in 10 years?</p>
<p>UPDATE: I had no idea this would make it to the front page (page 2 now).  Thanks for all the great responses, there have been several that really make sense.  Basically, though, they're just living outside their means for the time being which may or may not have long term negative consequences depending on future prices and competition.</p></div></div>
