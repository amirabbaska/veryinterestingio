		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Various websites are reporting the Saudis and other Middle East countries are going to go broke in 5 years if oil remains at its current price level.  Oil was selling for the same price in 2004 and those countries were apparently operating fine then.  What's changed in 10 years?</p>
<p>UPDATE: I had no idea this would make it to the front page (page 2 now).  Thanks for all the great responses, there have been several that really make sense.  Basically, though, they're just living outside their means for the time being which may or may not have long term negative consequences depending on future prices and competition.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Population growth in the Middle East is VERY high:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=sp_pop_totl&idim=country:SAU:ARE:IRQ&hl=en&dl=en" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=sp_pop_totl&idim=country:SAU:ARE:IRQ&hl=en&dl=en</a></p>
<p>The govt budget doesn't come from taxes, it's all oil.  In Saudi Arabia, oil is 55% of the GDP but 92.5% of govt budget comes from oil.  They don't raise much at all from taxes off the GDP.  This actually meets an ideal of &quot;sharing the wealth for the benefit of the people&quot; but there's something perverse about that.</p>
<p>So when you're hardly getting any income from GDP, if the population doubles the non-oil GDP sector might double, but your govt don't get much additional income.  It was insignificant in the first place.  </p>
<p>But most govt spending is per-capita, so spending on roads, schools, health care, welfare, gasoline subsidy, etc must double, which means the per-capita govt budget is cut in half.  Even corruption scales.  If it was normal to buy off officials for $10K for a thing, now you need to buy off twice as many as govt grows and can only pay a $5K bribe to each. </p>
<p>Saudi population rose 29% since 2004.  US only increased by 9% in that period!  So the govt needs 29% more oil revenue to meet the same standard.  </p>
<p>It's pretty bleak.  There's really not a strong private sector and growing competitive non-oil industry isn't a strong trend in these cultures.  It seems like being educated and working is actually looked down upon, as the &quot;not-rich&quot; people.  </p>
<p>One can also wonder what sort of new non-oil mass economy is even viable there.  There is a limited amount of arable land and fresh water itself is in short supply.  A lot of key resources are in short supply OTHER than oil.  So just saying &quot;you people need to get to work&quot; doesn't have much meaning. </p>
<p>The fact that the population rose by 29% since 2004 isn't a general expansion.  It means 29% of the population is 10 or under.  Overall the young outnumber the old, big time, in a way that's difficult to relate to.  And that gets crazy when a huge portion of your population is ~20 yrs old and desperate for some way to make their name in the world but there are no jobs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine if you got a promotion, kept the position for 11 years, and during that time period took out a mortgage, bought an expensive car with big payments, and incurred other large expenses that you didn't have 11 years prior. Now imagine you lost that job and your salary went back down to what you were earning over a decade ago. You would probably have a hard time paying your big mortgage and expensive car off right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think looking at this answer in the form of a timeline probably makes the most sense. I'm going to be answering in reference to how the US is affected, but the same could be said with any country, I suppose.</p>
<p>1 - OPEC had a monopoly on the oil industry for a LONG time and pretty much set the prices on what it would sell for. Middle-Eastern countries made a killing.</p>
<p>2 - The US basically paid whatever OPEC asked because it was the main source for oil and demand required that we pay what they ask. Also, there was a hesitance to produce oil for ourselves due to several factors (environmental impact, for example).</p>
<p>3 - OPEC got too greedy and the US basically said &quot;fuck it, we'll get our oil from somewhere else. Maybe we will even start producing oil in our own country.</p>
<p>4 - US starts producing oil for itself.</p>
<p>5 - OPEC starts selling it's own oil for pennies (figure of speech) to try and drive US oil companies out of business. The plan is to drive prices back up once they own the market again.</p>
<p>6 - US doesn't care about lower prices. Cheaper oil techniques allow for US to compete at new, low barrel price.</p>
<p>7 - OPEC can't produce oil at lower price but sell at a loss anyway to try and win the price war (and middle-eastern countries are starting to run out of oil anyway). Start countdown at 10 years before OPEC runs out of money from selling at a loss.</p>
<p>TL;DR
The United States imported 27% of the oil it consumed in 2014, it's lowest import amount in over 30 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They adjusted their budget to match their income. The Saudis are determined to maintain market share. They are selling the same volume of oil accepting a lower price. So their spending budget is now greater than their income. They have plenty of reserves and they are adjusting their budget slowly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>SA and Arab states have massive amounts of natural gas.  Russia is the number one current seller of gas into Europe.  Saudis want their place.  What sits between Saudi natural gas and Europe?  Syria , Iran, Turkey.</p>
<p>What sits between Russia and Europe?  the Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania.  </p>
<p>Ok, so the Russians want to keep their gas flowing.  How do they stop SA.  Invest in their henchmen in Syria.  It's the number one geo blocker.  Shore up their north flow by dusting up problems in the Ukraine which was threatening to become part of the EU.</p>
<p>Saudi does not like being blocked in Syria.  They want to monetize their gas. Iran is a no go. Turkey is cool.  So its Syria that needs to be in the fold.  How do we destabilize pro Russian Syria regime?   Cut the Syrian money supply from Russia.  Crater oil prices to destabilize the Russian economy.  Subsidies stop flowing and the Russians.  It's a race to the bottom.  Curtailing US production is a &quot;nice to have.&quot; </p>
<p>And guess what?  Israel has tons of gas too.  The Leviathan field is loaded.   Lets get it to Europe! Damn Syria! Lets get involved with our buddy the USofA and get Syria &quot;sorted out of their brutal pro-Russian dictator.&quot;</p>
<p>TL;DR: Cut oil prices to destabilize Russian economy and thereby destabilize Syria so that pipelines can be built across it.  Cheap gas for Europe, Saudi, and friends make billions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
