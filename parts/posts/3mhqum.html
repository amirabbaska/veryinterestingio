Even though the hole itself keeps light from escaping, the mass has still attracted stars around it. The orb gives no light, but the stars pulled to it have light of their own and it's very dense at the center.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: Lots of stars</p>
<p>The black hole isn't the cause of the light, but it is the reason it's so bright. It attracts a massive collection of stars, but most of them are in a stable orbit. Either way, it's all the stars near the 'hole that provides all this light. It's a sphere where the core is pitch black, but the shell provides tons of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer for why the center of the Milky Way being bright, despite a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole" target="_blank">Super Massive Black Hole</a>, has been already answered. But black holes can be seen when they are in a feeding stage. This is when matter is being sucked in, and the matter is rubbing against one another, heating up and glowing. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Artist%E2%80%99s_impression_of_the_huge_outflow_ejected_from_the_quasar_SDSS_J1106%2B1939.jpg" target="_blank">They can get extremely bright</a>. </p>
<p>We have not really observed a black black hole. We only see their bright emissions. I think recently there has been photos of the event horizon of the massive black hole in the center of our galaxy, but that was with a very powerful telescope and a team who are specifically trying to catch the event horizon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The core of the Milky Way is about 30000 light years across, and contains a staggering number of stars at a higher destiny than the spiral arms. This is why it is relativily bright.</p>
<p>At galactic centre there is a supermassive black hole, but compared to the core it's a speck, and practically invisible since it's dormant.</p>
<p>As stellar objects go, black holes are tiny, dense objects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
