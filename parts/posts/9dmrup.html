		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because gravity bends space-time itself. </p>
<p>The light is still going straight,  by its own point of view, but the space-time is curved by the gravity,  so something traveling straight through curved space-time alters its direction relative to an observer outside the curved region. </p>
<p>Black holes basically curve space-time inward to the point that there's no getting back out of that gravity well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Now roll a ball straight across the mattress.</p>
<p>Oh, you can’t? The ball wobbles near the center where you’re pushing down?</p>
<p>But why does it? After all, you’re not touching the ball at all!</p>
<p>Same thing with gravity bending space. The light doesn’t change direction - the space it’s moving through is warped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's worth mentioning that even in classical mechanics, no quantum and no relativity, the equations of physics still say gravity should bend light. The only disagreement is how much of an effect gravity has (larger in relativity, but by extraordinarily tiny amounts. You need really sensitive equipment to measure it.)</p>
<p>Usually, things with momentum also have mass. In fact, one usual definition of momentum is (mass)*(speed). This starts to break down in classical E&amp;M, where electric and magnetic fields also carry momentum. I'm not saying electric fields move around charges and give them speed and momentum, I'm saying that there are ways to construct physical systems where particles begin and end with different total momentum, violating the holy law of conservation of momentum. The only thing that saves you is to recognize that the electric field also has momentum, which is sorta like saying that if you were to jump really hard in a direction that isn't just straight up, the Earth's gravitational field, not the Earth but rather just the gravitational field, would start moving around. If that sounds weird, it's because it is.</p>
<p>Light is just an oscillating electric field, so it definitely has momentum. Anything with momentum also has energy. In truth, these are the quantities that gravity acts on (and also pressure, but that plays no role here). You can take a look at Newton's equation of gravity and notice that if you have two objects and one of them has a mass of 0, the gravitational force between them is 0. That's very nearly true, the force on massless objects is very tiny, but this is just an approximation. Massless objects are very, very strange so it's useful to not use the more complex equations that describe objects with energy or momentum but no mass. However, this absolutely can be done inside Newtonian mechanics if you're more careful.</p>
<p>Again, no quantum and no relativity needed. The answers that classical mechanics are numerically incorrect almost all the time for the bending of light, but the basic jist of the calculations are there. Relativity can be looked at as a slight correction to Newtonian mechanics, and quantum can be looked at as a slightly different correction. Most of the time these corrections are negligible, here they aren't. But they just amount to adding more terms in the equations, there's nothing fundamentally wrong about Newtonian mechanics that these corrections bring to light, at least not in relation to your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the best way to answer this question is to accept that there is no gravity. Stay with me for a second.</p>
<p>We call the apparent force that mass has on time itself as gravity. But in reality it is just space-time. I never was able to grasp the idea of space-time until Vsauce came out with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc4xYacTu-E" target="_blank">this</a> video. It blew me away.</p>
<p>He concludes the video by saying, &quot;...you feel as though you're being pushed into the ground not because of a force called 'gravity', but because time is moving faster for your head than for your feet.&quot;</p>
<p>If that peaks your interest please watch the video.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
