How big would that ball of water have to be before its core turned to ice due to the pressure of the rest of the water from every direction around it?</p>
<p>I'm guessing the temperature of the water will have a big effect on the answer.  So we'll say the entire body of water is somehow kept at a steady temperature of 25'C (by all means use a different temperature - i'm just plucking an arbitrary example as a starting point).</p></div></div>
