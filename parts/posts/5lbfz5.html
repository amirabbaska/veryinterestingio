<p>None of this, though, changes the NOTES you produce. It changes the character of the sound, but not the actual frequencies comprising the sounds. It's like if you were to put a blanket over a stereo - it sounds different, but everything would still be in the same key. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Is it simply the frequency with the most power? Is it the mean power frequency? Or is pitch something more complicated than that?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really simple question which requires a lot of background knowledge in the physics of waves to totally understand, so here's a comprehensive wall of text with everything that you need to know, probably 2 or 3 college courses consolidated into 4 paragraphs or so.</p>
<p>One very important thing to consider when you're determining what something sounds like is its timbre and its pitch. A lot of people have mentioned that timbre is important but what's integral to understanding this question is knowing the difference between timbre and pitch, and also how these are effected by the traveling of sound.</p>
<p>A pitch is determined by the frequency of what we call the &quot;fundamental&quot;. For example, a 440 Hz sin wave creates  A4, or concert pitch. Now if you look at any instrument playing A4, you'll notice that its waveform is much different from a sin wave, and that's where timbre comes in.</p>
<p>Timbre is determined by the ratio of the different harmonics in the sound. A harmonic is the fundamental frequency multiplied by a whole number. We can also call the fundamental the &quot;first harmonic.&quot; Looking at the concert A4 again, the first harmonic is 440 Hz (fundamental X 1), the second is 880 Hz (X2), the third is 1320 Hz (X3), so on and so forth. </p>
<p>Now lets finally take a look at your question specifically. Sound waves have two important measurable properties; frequency and power. Frequency in this case is synonymous with pitch, and power determines how loud the sound is. In terms of the individual harmonics, what we observe when listening to a recording is that the power of the different harmonics has changed, but the frequency has not (or at least not enough to notice, funny enough the human brain interprets 2 frequencies very close together 1 frequency with varying power, called a beat frequency). This is caused by the environment in which the observer observes the sound, as well as the distance from the sounds origin. </p>
<p>We can assume that because your ears are inside your body, and that is where your sound resonates first, that you hear a much different ratio of harmonics than a recording or any other observer outside your body, which can contribute to part of how the sound differs. Also, the time it takes for sound to bounce off of walls and structures creates whats known as constructive and destructive interference, which is a fancy way of saying it makes certain harmonics more or less powerful, changing the timbre of the sound.</p>
<p>None of this, however, effects the frequency in any way. frequency of a sound can only be changed acoustically by changing the speed at which sound travels, which can only be done by changing the medium the sound is traveling in. practically, this could be by changing the content of the air or the temperature of the air. impractically, if you made the sound by vibrating water instead of air (which is bad, it requires breathing in water) then the pitch would be very different to anyone hearing the medium in air.</p>
<p>To recap, The timbre of your voice is different to you than it is to an outside observer because of the time the sound and its reverberations hit your ear as opposed to the observer's ear, but the pitch is not changed because you and the observer are both listening to the sound within the same medium. Quite a bit longer than I was anticipating but here it is, the complete answer to your question!</p>

<p>Edit: Completely forgot about the doppler effect, props to u/pdlourenco for bringing that up on a different thread. If you're moving or the observer is moving it changes the frequency of the wave, which would change the pitch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
