		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At least two reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Many jobs need to be covered for a certain amount of time, even if this includes idle time, and you can't speed them up. Examples include a receptionist, an on-call firefighter, and an assembly-line worker.</li>
<li>Many employers have not learned how to measure their employees' productivity, so time spent is the closest thing they know how to measure accurately.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That IS how some employers regard it, though: butt-in-chair time is meaningless, results and deadlines met are what matters. That's certainly the case where I work. If I walk in half an hour late and leave an hour early, my boss could not give less of a fuck, as long as I get my work done and my absence does not create an issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was a stock manager at a grocery store I would tell the guys &quot; just hurry up and get the job done and I'll let you ride the clock till your shift ends&quot;. Did they even listen? For the most part no. I did have a crew that followed this philosophy and the store looked great. No last minute half assed work so I was happy and they were happy they got to goof off. Plus of course I let them get away with certain things. Maybe a soda drink from the deli. Over looked when they ate damaged products. Never mind that extra time on break. </p>
<p>I see your point though. If I'm getting paid 8 hours to let's say put stock on the shelf and I get it done in 6 hours how come I can't get full 8 hours pay.  I guess that's the difference between getting paid by the hour and getting paid by the job. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are slowly coming around. Apparently it's one of the top &quot;requirements of a millenial&quot; so those managers who keep themselves educated on what's current understand this and get why it's important for both the employee and the employer. </p>
<p>I'm lucky enough to be under the president of the company who not only works from home himself 90% of the time but also only scores me on my goals we set out quarterly/annually.  I have a couple guys who work for me who are more task/coverage oriented and I treat them the same. Only difference is I ask them to make sure others whom they work with know they'll be out of office and that there is sufficient coverage (that could be somebody else covering for unexpected work or they take a workstation with them).  There are other managers who give the gears to employees who come in 20 minutes late regularly.  I tell them it's not a production line we are operating. </p>
<p>Most managers think employees will take advantage of the situation. In my experience the employees with the most freedom end up bending over backwards the most for the company. The employees who are on a tight leash put the company on a tight leash.  They'll never become a &quot;company man&quot;.  Manager looks over their shoulder, they pretend to work, manager looks away, they play.  They become disgruntled and are toxic to others around them.  Give an employee crap about coming in late 15 minutes and I guarantee you get no more than two solid hours out of the employee that day.  The first couple hours will be spent sitting at his desk staring at his screen wondering what wrong turn in life he made to end up dealing with your shit. Then he might try to start working but lunch will interfere. After lunch he feels less stressed and gets to work but nearing the end of the day can't help but think about it again and socialize with others about the situation and cause others to be disgruntled temporarily because that means they are subject to the same rules. He then finishes off the day updating his LinkedIn page on his phone while running possible career alternative he has through his head. </p>
<p>In the end great workers will continue to be promoted as shitty managers and hire shitty people who they'll blame is the reason employees can't have freedom. If it's not part of the culture now, it won't change. You'll have to find an employee that suits your needs.  I can tell you I've never been happier to work for somebody since my role went in this direction and I've never been so dedicated and motivated as an employee.  I don't even think about working elsewhere as I'm scared to lose this aspect of my day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're paid hourly, they obviously are going to want to know how many hours you worked. Not only that, but you're sure as hell going to want to make sure your employer knows how many hours you've worked! </p>
<p>There are plenty of jobs where you'd think they shouldn't care, but culture is such that we've established &quot;man-hours&quot; as a measure of worth. This is changing in many occasions, but something this fundamental takes time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
