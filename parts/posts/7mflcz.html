<p>Any genes where the parent was homozygous would still be homozygous. However, only 50% of the genes where there is heterozygosity would still be heterozygous.  The others would become homozygous.  </p>
<p>It’s this increase in homozygosity which causes the negative effects of inbreeding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

D being the dominant gene, and d being recessive. A child gets only one copy of each gene from each parent, so it could be that said child would get dd, and display the recessive trait.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This can't happen in humans (naturally anyway, maybe with some lab work you could make it happen) because identical twins are by definition genetically identical and therefore necessarily going to both be XX or XY.</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>It <em>can</em> happen in some other species where sex is not determined by chromosomes.  Specifically speaking, it often happens in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove_rivulus" target="_blank">mangrove rivulus</a>, one of the fish I did my PhD research on.  This species is one of only a couple of species of vertebrates that are self-fertilizing hermaphrodites.  </p>
<p>This species produces both males and hermaphrodites, with sex mostly controlled by temperature and maybe some other environmental factors.  If you keep a hermaphrodite by itself in an aquarium it will spontaneously produce fertilized eggs, as the gonads contain both eggs and sperm.  This is, genetically speaking, equivalent to identical twins reproducing with each other (you could also have actual identical twins in the species reproduce with each other, but it's easier to study self fertilization because it happens much more often).</p>
<p>So, to actually answer the question, here's what happens.  You don't get a clone.  Instead you essentially get a very inbred offspring.  This is because meiosis and the process of sex shuffle DNA around.  It's a bit tricky to explain without being able to draw, but bear with me and I'll do my best.</p>
<p>So to start out with, your identical twins (or self-fertilizing fish) have the same DNA.  We will represent this as a string of letters, showing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele" target="_blank">alleles</a> of genes.  If you've done any genetics in school you will probably have seen this before, usually in the context of talking about eye color or something or maybe with punnet squares.  </p>
<p>So here's our DNA string of the parents (it's the same in both, remember, because they are identical).</p>
<pre><code>BTArwFm
BtarWfM</code></pre>
<p>Note that there are two strands here...that's because the parents are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy#Diploid" target="_blank">diploid</a> and have two sets of DNA.  Note that each letter is present on both strand, but sometimes it's uppercase on one and lowercase on the other.  Each letter is a gene, but you can have two copies  of the same gene where each copy is slightly different from the other.</p>
<p>Now, we get to reproduction.  Egg and sperm DNA comes from one  strand of the parent DNA.  So from</p>
<pre><code>BTArwFm
BtarWfM</code></pre>
<p>We can get sperm and eggs with the DNA</p>
<pre><code>BTArwFm  _or_ BtarWfM</code></pre>
<p>Now, this alone would prevent many offspring from being clones because eggs and sperm meet up randomly, meaning that you <em>could</em> get clones with </p>
<pre><code>BTArwFm
BtarWfM</code></pre>
<p>but you could also get</p>
<pre><code>BTArwFm
BTArwFm</code></pre>
<p>or </p>
<pre><code>BtarWfM
BtarWfM</code></pre>
<p>both of which are quite different from their parent (for example, the parent had Tt at the second gene, the offspring have TT or tt</p>
<p>In reality, though, it's even more impossible to get clones because DNA is seperated onto multiple chromosomes and because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination" target="_blank">genetic recombination</a> during meiosis.  Basically, before eggs and sperm are formed, the DNA gets shuffled around.  So a cell that starts out with DNA</p>
<pre><code>BTArwFm
BtarWfM</code></pre>
<p>swaps some of the DNA when producing offspring (swapped DNA is bolded, EDIT sorry can't bold in code mode)</p>
<p>BT<strong>arW</strong>Fm</p>
<p>Bt<strong>Arw</strong>fM</p>
<p>Now this cell produces four sperm or an egg with the new genomes</p>
<p>BT<strong>arW</strong>Fm  or  Bt<strong>Arw</strong>fM</p>
<p>And this happens in different places every time.  So in practice you'll have, eg, a sperm cell with code</p>
<p>Bt<strong>Arw</strong>fM meeting up with an egg cell with code <strong>Bta</strong>rwFm</p>
<p>producing offspring with </p>
<pre><code>BtArwfM
BtarwFm</code></pre>
<p>compare to the parent</p>
<pre><code>BTArwFm
BtarWfM</code></pre>
<p>Ok, if you managed to make it through all that good job.<br />
So what <em>does</em> happen?  Well, offspring tend to be more inbred and homozygous, which means they have the same allele on both strands.  For instance, in our example above the parent was homozygous in one place: it had BB for the first gene.  All the other genes had differing alleles (represented by one upper and one lower case letter).  But the <em>offspring</em> was homozygous in four places! (BB, tt, rr, ww).  Why does this matter?  Well, most genetic diseases show up when you have two copies of the same allele (for example, tt might produce a birth defect, while TT or Tt do not).  This is a big reason why  inbreeding can produce bad outcomes for offspring in people an animals.  </p>
<p>However, in mangrove rivulus this interbreeding happens generation after generation and all the individuals with the deadly alleles get weeded out.  Eventually you get totally homozygous fish with genomes like</p>
<pre><code>BtarWfM
BtarWfM</code></pre>
<p>at this point their offspring <em>are</em> basically clones, because even if their DNA recombines it's already the same on both strands.  But you'd have to breed identical twins for generations to get this to happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Okay, so ignoring the fact that human identical twins are gonna be the same gender and all that, the answer is, oddly enough, <strong>no</strong>. Their offspring would be genetically different from either parent.</p>
<p>This comes into play with plant breeding. It's really easy to clone plants, and you can often stress plants into becoming hermaphrodites capable of reproducing. By doing that, you can breed a plant with a clone of itself.</p>
<p>The offspring, however, is going to be different. That's because genes come in pairs. You might remember the punnet square from high school biology - if you have two dominant genes or a dominant and a recessive gene, the dominant gene expresses itself, and if you have two copies of the recessive gene then the recessive gene expresses itself.</p>
<p>When reproduction happens, you basically pick one of the two genes from each parent at random, and then they're combined into a new pair.</p>
<p>So, say that the clone/twin has a gene for brown eyes and a gene for blue eyes. Both twins are going to have brown eyes, because that's the dominant gene - but the blue eyes gene is still there, lying dormant.</p>
<p>When the clones reproduce, the offspring could get both brown eye genes (one from each parent) a brown eye gene from one parent and a blue eye gene from the other parent, or they could get the blue eye gene from each parent. In the first two cases the offspring would have brown eyes, but in the latter case it would have blue eyes!</p>
<p>This is a bit more simplified than the entire picture (genetics can get complex) but the basic concept holds. The offspring of the twins will have a different combination of their parent's genes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
