<p>SpaceX experimented with using parachutes in the past (mainly for their Falcon 1 vehicles, but also on the first 2 Falcon 9 flights), but parachutes are poorly suited to this application, as extreme speeds and loads cause them to shred. Parachutes large enough to recover the stage are also quite heavy, a weight which could be used for fuel for a propulsive landing and for primary mission assurance. Parachutes also cannot be steered.  </p>
<p>Essentially, this becomes a problem of people overestimating the amount of fuel required to bring the stage back, underestimating the weight of the parachute system (which would be in the hundreds of kilograms at least), and underestimating the fragility and controllability of a parachute system.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>Parachutes would have to be big and heavy, and thus you wouldn't really save much mass anyway</li>
<li>You have very little control over parachute, and therefore the landing zone would have to be huge, and landing in water damages the engines</li>
<li>Obviously it's impossible to do &quot;return to launch site&quot; with a parachute</li>
<li>No simple place to attach the parachute. It would have to be at the top of the stage, but it's just  aluminum tube, and doesn't have enough structural integrity do hold this. You would have to reinforce the structure, and thus lose additional mass</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Parachutes are more efficient, but cannot be controlled as well.  So if your shooting for reusability, and you need to land on a barge in a specific static position, you don't want the uncertainty of a parachute.</p>
<p>Also, the parachute comes down too fast.  The booster could/would get damaged if that was the only air brake.  Hybrid solutions would be problematic because the chute necessarily would be long enough and large enough that it could interfere with the booster once it's deployed.  Especially if there is wind.  </p>
<p>The control flaps do a pretty good job slowing the decent as it is.  Adding a chute to brake assist would have marginal utility, but add extra complexity.</p>
<p>The onboard computational power to do a controlled landing like they are doing now didn't exist until recently.  Parachutes were the tried and true solution... but not ideal for a smooth controlled landing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another point that should be mentioned is that the goal of SpaceX has always been to bring people to Mars and more specifically to re-use the rocket that brings people to Mars. So, the rocket has to land on Mars, get refueled and then fly back to Earth (re-using the rocket will make the flights to Mars much much cheaper). In order to land on Mars, you can't really use parachutes because Mars has a very thin atmosphere that won't slow you down enough. The obvious solution to this is propulsive landing.</p>
<p>(Now of course the falcon 9 rocket was never supposed to fly to Mars, but it's always a good idea to test a technology first on Earth before you try it on Mars.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading about structural stability being a factor. For reusability you want to reduce wear and tear to a minimum. A parachute is going to create more tugging and lateral force on the top of the craft. An engine burn will provide a much smoother decent. Reinforcing the top of the craft will only add more weight and raise the center of mass, reducing both efficiency and stability.</p>
<p>I've also read that in cases where a parachute is viable, it's only slightly cheaper/efficient than fuel to begin with. Fuel is much easier to deal with logistically as well. No recovering of parachutes, less parts to deal with, less safety tests, less potential failures, etc. It may even be the cheaper in general to use fuel, depending on the scale of your operations.</p>
<p>There's a shitload of information/debates about this topic online and I highly recommend anyone interested in it do some deeper research.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
