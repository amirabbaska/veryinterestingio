		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They sleep more. In captivity it's around 4.5hrs: <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2869.1996.00010.x" target="_blank">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2869.1996.00010.x</a>  </p>
<p>In the wild animals sleep less than in captivity, especially those that tend to be prey. But giraffes are ruminants, if you watch a cow or sheep chew cud, they're not fully awake all that time. Eyes half closed, head hanging down, not moving besides the chewing, they're dozing off here and there, mixed with alert moments to check for threats.</p>
<p>So for one they can't afford to sleep very long at a time or they'll get eaten (long blood pressure drops would be bad too, giraffes have a rather weird circulatory system to keep the brain waaay up there fueled), but they have hours each day that can be spent with light dozing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This &quot;30 minutes per day of sleep&quot; for giraffes thing is a complete and utter MYTH, that keeps surfacing on Reddit multiple times!</p>
<p>All intelligent mammal brains need a significant amount of sleep per day. </p>
<p>For giraffes that is thought to be 4 hours per day, approximately. </p>
<p>(There are quite a number of humans that only regularly get 4 hours per day of sleep, so while not ideal, it's enough for many to get by.) </p>
<p>Dolphins have found an interesting work around, in that half their brain sleeps (the 2 opposite hemispheres take turns sleeping). But not giraffes! So again I don't know what the obsession with this giraffe sleeping myth is all about?!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
