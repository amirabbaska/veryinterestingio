		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Porn is still big business, though certainly not as big as it was. I managed a porn store for a few years about 4 years ago... and before I worked there, I thought the same... who is buying/renting these movies? As it turns out, lots of people. At least half our business was movies. </p>
<p>I often asked our regulars, who I got to know a bit, why they were in 3 times a week getting movies when free porn of any variety one could want is available for free on the internet. Some were old guys who didn't &quot;get&quot; the internet (some of the old guys were still on VHS tapes, which we had very few, as DVD players were too modern and scary). Some of them were guys who were afraid their wives would find out if they looked it up on their computer, so they snuck DVD's in to watch when the family wasn't around. The rest were typically younger guys who would rent about 5 DVD's at a time, take them home, and rip them onto their computers as part of their collection. </p>
<p>Even still, I don't really get it. I would think you would learn to use the internet and clear your history as opposed to wasting 100's of dollars a year on something you could get for free.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I understand what you are asking but the big studios are still producing porn to stream online for a fee. People are paying to have access to a certain theme, actors, or studio. If you are asking about DVDs, yes. There are still people buying them. Think of rural areas that have slower internet speeds or older porn buyers who aren't tech savvy enough to get online, let alone stream video.</p>
<p>It's a dying market but it's still there. In northern Texas right before the Oklahoma border, there are two big porn shops because Oklahoma's laws are too strict and it's popular with truckers

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Porn Giants like PornHub and Redtube will purchase rights from well known companies like RealityKings, Brazzers, etc. In return, they make the video public but attach advertisements where the reap a profit greater than they paid for the video. In short, creators receive purchasing rights from platforms and platforms make money from advertisers (typically from companies that don't sell rights). Companies that don't sell their videos' rights still rely on platforms like PornHub for brand recognition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nowadays people don't pay for online porn.</p>
<p>They pay for all the &quot;luxuries&quot; and extra's from guaranteed hd videos, fast stream/dl, ad free to knowing you're surfing on a secured website that won't have 15 popups appear ect...</p>
<p>But one of the most important thing: being able to find what the client wants fast and in a reliable manner.</p>
<p>A new performer joins the porn scene of your particular studio ? You'll be the first to know about it.</p>
<p>You want a video to fulfill your specific fetish ? You'll get a proper filtered list in just a few clicks.</p>
<p>You want to know if a certain performer released new material ? You won't have to stalk their social media (if they have any) and search multiple website for confirmation... or wait X amount of time to find a &quot;pirated&quot; version of it...</p>
<p>Now despite all that there's always exceptions to the rule, there's some performers who don't offer the package above because they decide to not sign with a larger studio or to go independent and do their own solo thing.</p>
<p>Yet are able to make a living by having a few &quot;love fools&quot; who will spend ridiculous amount of money trough donations or tiered program a la kickstarter just for a signed picture or shoutout on a video.</p>
<p>However if you've ever been on streaming websites non related to porn that shouldn't come to you as a surprise as some people are already willing to do that just for people streaming themselves playing games, cook, paint ect. </p>
<p>Anyway i'm derailing here, the point being people rarely pay for porn anymore for what's happening in front of the camera but rather for how they get to experience it from pre- to post masturbation.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong everyone has a preferred performer but at the end of the day they can and will get replaced, sadly some believe that their genitalia are made of gold and hence are vividly against &quot;free&quot; porn and often end up quitting partially because of it but that's another story.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without a subscription to a porn website its harder to find full length pornographic films. Usually they're just teaser clips. Paying for pornography will usually grant more feature length films. However, there are also websites that offer full length films for free. I think porn will always be a big business since people have fetishes and will always love sex. People will always pay to get their rocks off no matter how accessible it is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
