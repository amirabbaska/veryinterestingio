England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland are all defined as countries, but make up parts of a larger entity, whereas the US is one country. Do the countries self-govern in worldwide matters, such as war, trade, diplomacy, etc. or do they have to come to a decision as a group? What are some of the major political/government differences between states/provinces in the US/Canada and the countries that make up the United Kingdom?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory, US states and Canadian provinces are more independent than UK countries. This is because the US and Canada are federal states (power is shared between central and state/provincial governments) while the UK is a unitary state (all power is vested in the central government).</p>
<p>For example, the UK government dissolved the Northern Ireland government during the Troubles and ruled directly from London, which is legal under their system of government. Meanwhile, in the US, there is no legal way for the federal government to dissolve a state government. Not sure about Canada, but it’s probably the same.</p>
<p>In <em>practice</em>, however, the Home Countries of the UK (except for England) have a lot of power devolved to them by Parliament and they function much like American states or Canadian provinces. They’re called “countries” for historical reasons, it has nothing to do with how independent they are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea that &quot;states&quot; are lesser political units than &quot;countries&quot; is actually are relatively recent development. Any government can be thought of as a &quot;state&quot;. When the &quot;United States&quot; was formed, it was originally formed to be exactly that: a union of independent states. In this sense, the 13 states were basically their own &quot;countries&quot; just united together under a common goal/ideal.</p>
<p>When that didn't work out, they had to develop a stronger, central Federal government to fix some of the flaws. In doing so, those states had to give up some of their independence and autonomy but it was still believed that States had ultimate authority within their own borders and that the Federal government's power only really came to things that involved the country as a whole.</p>
<p>Then the civil war happened, which basically solidified the Federal government's supremacy over the States. Over time, the Federal government has grown and accumulated more and more power at the expense of the States' autonomy and sovereignty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like the fact that the distinction between mountains and hills, or continents and islands are fuzzy. The use of the term &quot;country&quot; is inconsistent. While there are trends (e.g. countries are often sovereign entities), there isn't a larger, 100% consistent pattern for you to find (e.g. the countries that make the UK are not sovereign).</p>
<p>In fact, the UK itself is sometimes described as a country, even though it is comprised of countries. Likewise, Aruba can be considered a 'country' that is part of the Netherlands, and Greenland can be considered a country that is a component of Denmark, among others.</p>
<p>Beyond that, they have vastly different government structuring. They can have low autonomy, or be almost entirely self-governing. </p>
<p>In short, Country is just a word we use to refer, generally, to a pretty distinct region. It often corresponds to sovereign nations, but doesn't, by itself, tell you much about governance. </p>
<p>Also, just to make it really confusing, we also refer to sovereign entities, and government, as <em>states.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Country&quot; is just a word with a vague meaning.</p>
<p>Despite being called &quot;countries&quot;, the parts of the UK are not comparable to an independent country like the USA.</p>
<p>Usually the word &quot;country&quot; means a sovereign state. Basically, a country which is a member of the UN (or at least could theoretically join).</p>
<p>The UK as a whole is one of those.</p>
<p>But the UK is made up of constituent parts, like how the USA is made of states and Canada is made of provinces. The UK informally decided to call those parts &quot;countries&quot;. I say informally, because the UK doesn't have an explicit constitution which defines them as countries. It's just the word that is commonly used to describe them.</p>
<p>The way the UK works is very different from the USA though. The only similarity really is that it's made up of distinct parts which have at least some different laws.</p>
<p>All the countries of the UK except England have their own government. Exactly what those governments are responsible for is different in every case. And in theory, the UK government can overrule them.</p>
<p>In practice, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are like semi-autonomous regions of the UK. While England is the non-autonomous part (and also has over 80% of the population).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a matter of terminology and the ways words have changed over time. The word country referred to just a geographical region originally, it still gets used occasionally in this sense but over time also became a synonym for a sovereign state. </p>
<p>State is a political entity which is used for a lot of things as well such as a sovereign state which is what the United States, the UK, France, Russia, China, Brazil etc etc all are. The word is also used to describe the sub divisions of the United States, obviously, and I believe (I could be wrong) that this comes from the revolution when the 13 colonies declared their independence as sovereign states under a very loose confederation and the name stuck even when the federal government became a hell of a lot more powerful and the 'states' basically stopped being sovereign.</p>
<p>There's also the word 'nation' which is unrelated to your question but it also has changed its meaning over time to become yet another synonym for a sovereign state as well as meaning a people.</p>
<p>As for the constituent countries of the UK; I guess it's a historical thing really and relating to the confusing different meanings of the word 'country'. Like Scotland is the land of Scots obviously, so it's the country where the Scots live in the geographical sense. There was the Kingdom of Scotland which was the state and that merged with the Kingdom of England in 1707, so whilst these two separate sovereign states were unified into one, the Kingdom of Great Britian, with a single government and parliament for both there was still a sense that they were kinda separate owing to their history and differences in culture and dialects etc, so they were seen as separate countries in the sense they were different lands although they were politically unified.</p>
<p>Before the English/Norman conquests Wales was basically a geographical term as the area was rarely ever unified under a single King, there was a bunch of smaller kingdoms that rose and fell, unified and divided over the centuries but the entire region is and was Wales (or Cymru in Welsh). The Welsh kingdoms were slowly gobbled up by the English and then the Normans over a few centuries and after a while the area was directly annexed into the Kingdom of England, but like with the Scots later on they were still seen as being separate historically, culturally and linguistically, so whilst there was a single political state, the Kingdom of England, the idea of Wales as a separate land and country stuck around.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland's more complicated involving Norman invasions, settlement by English and Scots, religious conflict etc etc but basically the same kind of thing. Ireland was administered as a separate Kingdom from England (and later Great Britain), in the early 1800s the Kingdom of Ireland was merged into the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, yet like before differences in history, culture, religion, language, and the physical separation by sea meant Ireland still being considered a its own land and country whilst being politically part of the British state. Then of course later, after various uprisings and political stuff, the Republic of Ireland became independent and for various reasons the northern counties remained a part of the UK.</p>
<p>Anyway, all these regions retained their separate identities as their own lands or countries even though they were all under a single political entity known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There was a single parliament and government that administered all this but during the 20th century there were various nationalist groups that rose up in Scotland and Wales that wanted independence or autonomy. </p>
<p>In the late 90s Wales and Scotland got their own political assemblies with various powers given to them (Northern Ireland had its own Parliament before but it was suspended for ages I think and I don't really know much about it so I'm kinda skipping it). So the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament had some control over these old geographical, historical and cultural countries and we call them (along with the Northern Irish which I'm still kinda skipping over because I dont know that much lol), along with England, the constituent countries or home nations (see earlier where the word nation has different meanings). </p>
<p>Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales all have a degree of autonomy and can self manage some of their own affairs through their political assemblies and can be seen as being somewhat similar to the US States or Canadian provinces, but I don't think they have as much power as the US States, and the central UK Parliament retains a lot more power (note that England doesn't have it's own national/regional assembly).</p>
<p>I probably haven't made much sense here and overcomplicated things but tl;dr is that it's basically just a matter of terminology and various words that have changed meanings over time confusing matters and the pedant in me really dislikes how state, nation and country all have original different meanings but can now all just be used to describe the same thing now! Bah.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
