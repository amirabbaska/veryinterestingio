<p>As Nick Knight explains for The Independent, your autonomic nervous system - the overarching system that controls other nervous systems like the sympathetic nervous system - kicks into gear, and causes a bunch of different reactions inside your body depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>This is the same system that controls your 'fight or flight' response along with other unconscious body functions like digestion. When this system switches to hyper mode, it first sends out oxygen all over your body to make it easier for you to punch something in the face, or run away in the opposite direction to safety.</p>
<p>To spread oxygen to all of your muscles, your body must first breathe it in. In an effort to take in more air, the nervous system tells the glottis - the opening in your throat that ushers air into lungs without taking food with it - to stay open for as long as possible. In other words, your throat opens wider than normal because a bigger opening means more air.</p>
<p>You don’t actually feel your glottis opening wide. If you did, everyday life would feel awfully strange. What you do feel, though, is muscle tension caused by your body trying to keep your glottis open even when you swallow.</p>
<p>Normally, when you aren’t crying, your glottis opens and closes when you swallow all day long. This ensures that food and spit go one way and air goes the other, with no mix-ups in between.</p>
<p>But, when you cry or are on the verge of crying, your glottis is trying to stay open, but gets forced close every time you swallow. This tension messes with the muscles in your throat, giving the sensation of a lump.</p>
<p>The lump feeling is actually referred to as globus sensation, and it happens to everyone in these stressful situations. Normally, this feeling dissipates quickly once you calm down and your glottis goes back to functioning like it used to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is called a &quot;globus sensation&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exact cause of globus sensation is uncertain. Some specialists believe that it is due to a problem with the co-ordination of the muscles involved in swallowing. Many muscles are involved in swallowing and they need to tense and relax in the correct sequence for swallowing to occur normally. In someone with globus sensation, when they try to swallow saliva, some of the swallowing muscles may not relax fully and so the sensation of a lump in the throat occurs. However, when food is swallowed, the food stimulates the muscles in a different way and normal muscle relaxation occurs.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dunno but ive got this thing called globus pharyngeas which basically means i constantly have that feeling, its theorized that its an anxiety induced disorder.
First occurred two years ago during a period of severe anxiety and never went away. Its much worse when im anxious.
After a while i learnt to live with it, and now i dont really notice it unless anxious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought this was just one of the many fight-or-flight responses.  Anxiety or panic tends to have a few physical symptoms, almost all of them to enable you to be more mobile, that is increased oxygen intake, increased heart rate, increased blood flow, and evacuating the bladder and bowels.</p>
<p>I always assumed that the lump in the throat was part of the esophagus widening to ensure plenty of oxygen was getting in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
