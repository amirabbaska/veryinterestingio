		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because humans don't follow the rules. </p>
<p>Every animal has a personal space bubble and they do &quot;alarm&quot; signs to show when another is getting in their bubble. </p>
<p>Example: A Robin is hunting worms. A deer is walking in the area. The Robin will stop feeding and look up at the deer. If the deer notices, it will shift course and go around the robin. If the deer doesn't notice and keeps heading towards the robin, the robin will stand up a little taller and maybe pump it's tail or fluff it's wings, using motion to show the deer, and any other animals, that he is not being respected. (Check out starting at 2:22) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8GBA7DmeM0&t=21s" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8GBA7DmeM0&t=21s</a></p>
<p>If the deer keeps coming, the robin may jump a couple feet to the side or into a bush above the deer's head - a larger motion to show alarm. Other animals will notice this and look in that direction (the same behavior the robin first used to get the deer's attention.) If the deer would have started running at the robin, or jumped at it, the Robin would fly further up into the tree and given off a little &quot;chirp!&quot; alarm while pumping it's tail and maybe wiping it's beak on the branch, using movement and sound to show alarm. Making noise is dangerous for animals, so it's only done when absolutely necessary to alert all the other animals around it. (around 3:26 in the video, you can hear the robin chirp when it flies off)</p>
<p>Birds close to the robin will fly up and observe, and the birds a little further away will stand up and look. This creates pockets or bubbles of alarms around the landscape - the stronger the alarm, the bigger the bubble.</p>
<p>Humans now, we don't see the robin stand up and look at us. We don't see it stand taller, or take a few steps to the side. We don't see it fly up just above head level. When we notice a bird, we get an alarm because we startled it pretty bad, causing the bird to fly up and tell everyone about it by alarming. We don't follow the common courtesies of the natural world and so animals can't accurately predict our behaviors. This scares them, so the scream in panic.</p>
<p>If you slow down, walk slowly and quietly, and walk around the birds when they show the first stage of alarm - the standing up and looking - you can move through the landscape without setting off alarms. </p>
<p>If you want to learn more about this or have questions, let me know - I teach it occasionally, as well as other survival skills, and enjoy spreading it around. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: We are rude, don't follow the rules, and this scares animals.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think its actually just fearing what they're not used to seeing. </p>
<p>I've worked in the woods, the more accustomed to humans animals are, the more likely they are to stick around. I've had packs of wolves flee and never be seen again almost a mile away from me. Yet, if I lived in their territory, I bet I'd have numerous/less positive experiences.</p>
<p>I've worked in the oil and gas industry in northern Alberta. I'd have jobs so remote, I'd have to be flown in with one other person by helicopter. When I'm working out there, I don't fear bears at all. They'll never stick around long enough to harass me. I know they'll watch me, but are so unsure of what I am that they won't go near me.</p>
<p>Then if I'm working on a plantsite, I have to be much more wary. I've had a bear come right up to me and try and pick a fight (he'd come about 10' from me, stand on his hind legs, and slap the ground). That bear was used to the mannerisms of people, and didn't see them as a threat.</p>
<p>I've had moose and elk watch me while I was working. A fox and a coyote have also followed me around before. Usually in that case there was human activity nearby. The ones that I'd only briefly get a glance of were in remote locations.</p>
<p>With animals, its always important to be aloof. Your actions dictate their reactions. They really don't know how to interpret people. So people that run away? You're food to them. You stand your ground but don't make aggressive actions/startle them? They'll probably leave you alone.</p>
<p>In NA there's only two animals I'd run from: bull moose in rutt (October) and pissed off wolverines. I wouldn't run from a Kodiak bear or a polar bear either, but I wouldn't like my chances if they were hungry and I didn't have food to distract them with.</p>
<p>Curious cubs are another thing to look out for. They don't really have the fear mechanism that older bears have, and just want to come say &quot;hi&quot;. Momma bears really aren't as big of a threat as people may assume. It's usually the bears that you don't see that are the ones people should worry about.  E.g.: if I come across a momma with her cubs, I'm slowly backing out and don't really worry much. But if I come across a momma and not know that she has her cubs nearby, that is much more alarming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
