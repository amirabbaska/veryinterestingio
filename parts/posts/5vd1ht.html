Since warm air is a prerequisite for a thunderstorm to form, it's not that surprising that thunderstorms are less common in the winter months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lightning requires two components to form in a storm: ice crystals and an updraft. This is because as the ice crystals rub against each other (near the updraft) they build up a static charge within the cloud that eventually discharges as lightning. The amount of lightning therefore depends on just the strength of the updraft and the amount of ice crystals in the updraft.</p>
<p>These requirements lead to a couple of interesting phenomena. </p>
<ol>
<li>As mentioned in another comment, thundersnow occurs in convective snow bands (such as lake-effect snow) due to strong updrafts and plenty of ice crystals in the bands. </li>
<li>Tropical systems tend to have less lightning than mid-latitude storms because they have fewer ice crystals present in the updrafts (the freezing level is higher in altitude).</li>
<li>In normal (mid-latitude) storms, the water droplets freeze as they move up the updraft into the middle to upper part of the storm where they rub against the falling ice crystals to build up the charge.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sorry if my explanation is a little off. It's been quite a while since I took a course in this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can happen but the conditions don't favor it. For the record though lightning during a snowstorm is one of the coolest fucking things I have ever seen. Every time a bolt would flash my entire field of vision would basically go neon blue for a second. 10 out of 10, would recommend.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
