		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>Depends on whether you have a terrible diet or a good (or even average) diet. They only really help if you have a complete absence of some nutrients; you'll get enough to get by if you eat a variety of non-junk foods like most of us do.</em></p>
<p>With a terrible diet, such as if you're a senior citizen that can't cook and eats very small portions or you live off of low-end ramen noodles or something, you're simply missing out on a ton of nutrients, particularly vitamins but also protein and fibre. </p>
<p>Since you're not eating any greens or organ meats at all and stick to inexpensive pre-prepared foods with soft drinks on the side only, you're not going to get any Vitamin A, C or K, for example. The first is important for a lot of stuff like vision and immune system, the second helps keep your blood systems healthy, and the last is critical to avoid a condition known as scurvy (but doesn't actually do much else despite what the marketers tell you). </p>
<p>(Omega-3's are needed in there too, but it's kind of overstated as to how much they help unless you have cardiovascular issues. Bad if you don't eat any fish at all ever, usually okay otherwise if you get a trace of 'em from that Tuna Helper casserole or have anchovies on that pizza.)</p>
<p>And there's lots of similar vitamins that can be missed if you go the other route and stay completely uniformly vegan too.</p>
<p>So if you have a really shitty diet, that once-per-day vitamin pill gives you SOME of those vitamins when otherwise you don't get any at all. That's good and helpful...</p>
<p>...but most people don't need them if they have a mixed salad once in a while or eat &quot;fortified&quot; foods which have them added. In that case, they get arguably limited value out of multivitamins. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vitamin D is typically included in multi-vitamins as well, although the dosage is inadequate for anyone who may need it in a dietary supplement.  We get vitamin D naturally from exposure to daylight, so some people in northern latitudes (or anyone who spends way to much time indoors - talking to you Reddit) can avoid a variety of conditions related to vitamin  D deficiency. Buying just vitamin D is a small fraction of the cost of multi-vitamins. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's very difficult to get scientific evidence on this. A person who takes the vitamin pill every day is quite likely looking after themselves in other ways too. For a comparison group, you'd need a variety of people living off things found in trash cans and lighter fluid, but who still remember to take the vitamin pill every day.</p>
<p>I've heard the phrase &quot;If you can afford vitamin pills, you don't need them&quot;, meaning your diet is likely enough to provide you with vitamins.</p>
<p>It's also debatable how well the vitamins get absorbed in pill form.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost everybody gets plenty of vitamins and minerals consuming an average full diet. There is very little compelling evidence which suggests that consumption in excess of this amount improves health. </p>
<p>Unless one is identified as deficient in something, there is essentially no benefit from consuming vitamin suppliments and a real monetary cost as well as small risks associated with consuming them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Science Vs.  just did their weekly podcast about this very question.  You should give it a listen.  The conclusion on multivitamins was that they don't do much, but they also do no harm, so why not.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
