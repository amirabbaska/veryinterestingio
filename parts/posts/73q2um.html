		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pediatric patients are fitted with eyewear based on prescriptions from mostly just the autofractors as jaimemaidana pointed out. This gives a really good estimation of the corrective lens prescription. A ballpark or rough estimation of the prescription.</p>
<p>Once someone learns his/her abc’s or sometimes shapes a phoropter may be used. The device that sits in front of your face, and you are asked if one or two, or a or b looks better as you are looking at an eye chart. This allows for an even better prescription to be determined. The phoropter may be used by itself or it may be used to fine tune the prescription that the autorefractor read, so you get the best possible vision.</p>
<p>It’s not that an adult’s autorefratcor generated prescription couldn’t be used, but your doctor wants your eyewear to have the best chance for giving you the best possible sight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Streak retinoscopy is an objective way to get a prescription.  <a href="https://youtu.be/kAreDffuVCQ" target="_blank">Here is a video showing it in action</a>. In short, you put lenses up until you perfectly focus a light beam on the eye.  That gives the objective prescription.</p>
<p>When the doctor is asking you &quot;1 or 2&quot; they are doing a subjective way of finding your prescription.  It is you saying what you like better.  </p>
<p>A doctor can use streak retinoscopy to get any ones prescriptions.  However, if the patient is able to speak, it is good to confirm, and tweak, if needed, the prescription.  A subjective prescription may not give the best vision, but it is what the patient likes the most.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am usually a lurker but I had to reply to dispell some mis-information in this thread. </p>
<p>As it has been brought up by others in this thread, retinoscopy (streak) is the definitive (currently) way optometrists and ophthalmologists calculate prescriptions in cases where verbal communication is not possible, i.e. babies, infants, young children, mentally challenged or elderly patients. </p>
<p>Retinoscopy works by shinning a retinscope into a patient's eye and observing the reflex of light that is reflected back. This system is built on the optics found in the eye, no different to the optics of a camera lens. There are two movements we expect to see, they are an against or with movement. An against movement means you need a negative lens correct (myopia) and a with movement means you need a positive lens to correct (hyperopia). You can also calculate astigmastism with retinoscopy, and this is where it becomes difficult. </p>
<p>In the hands of a capable operator, retinoscopy is far more accurate than any modern autorefractor (for now) as operators have trained many years to use a retinoscope. The problem with current auto-refractors is that they do not account for accommodation in the eye; think when you switch between looking at something far away like the horizon and then looking at your phone quickly. Do you sometimes notice it takes a microsecond or two to adjust? Thats your accommodation working, your eye lens physically changes shape in order for you to see your phone clearly; think chaning focal lenghts on a camera zoom. Accommodation breaks down around 40years old progressively until around 60 and this is why people need reading glasses. I digress. </p>
<p>Auto-refractors are still a very important screening tool in helping aid reaching your final prescription, however the results are not generally completely reliable. </p>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two ways that I know of, one being retinoscopy, and other being teller cards.<br />
Retinoscopy basically measures how the light fractures in your eyes, while the teller cards are more or less cards with things that looks either blurry or sharp, not 100% clear on that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctors/optometrists fit children with these prescriptions simply because there isn't a good way of doing it subjectively. Speaking as a pre-registration optometrist in England I will try and explain why this is the case as best i can.</p>
<p>Subjective results are generally better because we must control a process we call &quot;accommodation&quot;  i.e. the ability young individuals have to focus for near. Optics 101 also shows that you can use this additional focusing power to focus through some prescriptions, for example &quot;long sighted&quot; or plus prescriptions, this causes long term issues in patients because this requires effort and causes eyestrain. In children the ability to accommodate is very high. Trust me when I say it is much easier to relax this accommodation in someone who a.) Has less ability to do it and b.) Can understand subjectively when a lens makes no difference to their sight. These are both adult qualities, as a result we must do it differently for children. </p>
<p>The way we generally do it is by relaxing the accommodation with drops called cycloplegics, these drugs then have side effects which then make subjective testing EVEN harder. For example it makes your pupils larger which can then cause glare which could be mistaken for blur. We must then use objective methods to determine a rough estimate of the prescription because the patient cannot operate subjectively, it is by no means more accurate. </p>
<p>BUT that's not to say it is going to damage your child's sight, we tend to give these prescriptions simply to relax the child's eye muscles and allow for NORMAL ocular development. Normal ocular development shows that children tend to be slightly long sighted and become more short sighted until they have no prescription, this is normal because the larger your eye the more short sighted you become. It's obviously normal for your eyes to become larger as the body gets bigger. This is why we only correct gross long sightedness (we rarely intervene with short sightedness because glasses may not help much, specialist CLs are generally used for these children).</p>
<p>As you can probably deduce now, it does not matter if we leave the child slightly long sighted because they have a large amount of accommodation, so the fact our prescriptions will be slightly off when obtained objectively (which they will be) will not be an issue. It's all about reducing the amount of long sightedness to a point which will not cause the patient to accommodate TOO much, which will then cause eyestrain and even lazy eyes (accommodation also stimulates the eyes to turn in as well). Lazy eyes are the worst case scenario in children undergoing ocular development, because the brain is still malleable or &quot;plastic&quot;. Therefore, it can develop to IGNORE the visual information being sent by the lazy eye (therefore, the brain is avoiding double vision and blur) and cause very reduced vision in that eye in later life. </p>
<p>In my experience, I generally prescribe long sighted prescriptions causing problems (for example lazy eyes) then use further tests to monitor whether the prescription has removed the lazy eye at future visits. I refer short sighted/ different prescriptions in each eye (anisometropia) to specialists to fit contact lenses etc. Some children also need patching to remove this dominance issue which is undertaken by other specialists. </p>
<p>TLDR: we generally prescribe children to relax their &quot;accommodation&quot; to the point where it doesn't cause them any issues (lazy eyes/eyestrain). The long sighted child will see fine regardless of if a prescription is in place or not because their ability to accommodate through long sighted prescriptions is so good. Objective methods are not superior but are our only alternative. Prescribing for short sighted children or children with prescriptions which are different in each eye are more complex and require contact lens intervention. We prescribe for those children to slow the progression of short sightedness or to make the images formed by each eye more equal. Again, having the exact right prescription may not be possible for these children without subjective methods but we definitely allow the children's ocular development to be less affected by their incorrect prescription. The goal in prescribing for children is usually not to let them see clearly but to improve their ocular development.</p>
<p>Phew, that's hard to explain in layman's terms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
