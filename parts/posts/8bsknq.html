		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Gleeking (also gleeting, gleeping, glitting, gleaking, glicking, glanding, geezing) is the projection of saliva from the submandibular gland upon compression by the tongue.</p>
<p>In general, gleeking occurs when an accumulation of saliva in the submandibular gland is propelled out in a stream when the gland is compressed by the tongue. The stream of saliva is released in the general direction of the front of the mouth. If the mouth is open the jet may project several feet. Gleeking is more likely when the salivary gland has been recently stimulated, but even a residual amount of saliva in the gland may be released by gleeking.</p>
<p>Gleeking may occur spontaneously due to accidental tongue pressure on the sublingual gland while talking, eating, yawning, or cleaning the teeth. Gleeking can also be induced, for instance, by pressing the underside of the tongue against the palate, then pushing the tongue forward while simultaneously closing the lower jaw and moving it slightly forward; or by yawning deeply and pressing the tongue against the palate. Practice is usually required to induce gleeking consistently, and induction is more likely to be successful under conditions of salivary stimulation (e.g. by certain types of food or biting your tongue).&quot;</p>
<p>I always heard it called <em>geezing</em> growing up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
