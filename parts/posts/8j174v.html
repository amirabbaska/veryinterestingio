		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Proteins are shaped with hydrophobic parts of the molecule on the inside and hydrophilic parts on the outside, allowing them to be water soluble. When the egg white is clear, you're seeing a solution with dissolved proteins in it.</p>
<p>Proteins are very large molecules that are typically designed to function in a certain range (of temperature, pH, ...). For most proteins, that range does not include typical cooking temperatures. On a molecular level, the heat imparted by cooking is enough to undo some of the bonds that give protein its structure.</p>
<p>Then the protein loses its shape, so it is no longer water soluble. Then the proteins come out of solution as a solid. This solid happens to have a white color.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
