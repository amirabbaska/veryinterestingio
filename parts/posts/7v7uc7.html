<p>You can see loads of electrical wires going to the blades, which means there's a signal that's transmitted back to the helicopter (for control? information? lights at the tip? no idea).</p>
<p>Do you know how they transmit that through the rotation? Any wire will be torn by torsion and break if you rotate it like this. So do they use brush-like contacts? Or some magic fuckery I don't know about? Induction maybe?</p>
<p>Same this with pressure sensors in tires, how do they get their juice and send back their values to the car?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK, so this is the rotor head of a UH-60 helicopter.  I can tell you for a fact that wires you see in the pic are for the de-iceing system for the blades and droop stop system.  These don't transmit any radio but push electricity to heater mats under the surface of the blade.  this is done via a rotator stator with a brush system.  The brushes drag across a plate to transmit the power.  The system is disassembled and rebuilt every 960 flight hour(used to be 720 hr) to correct wear and erosion of the material.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is &quot;all of the above&quot;. Some systems, especially those needing to transmit a lot of power, will use slip rings, which are carbon brushes contacting copper rings.</p>
<p>Some systems will use induction. VCRs used that to get the video signal off the spinning drum with the video heads in it. Many types of motors and generators work that way too, of course.</p>
<p>For the pressure sensors in tires, they are battery powered and send the information via a radio transmission. That's for the &quot;direct TPMS&quot;. The indirect TPMS systems do not have any sensors inside the tires anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Inthe picture I would assume with a slip ring. This is also the case in cars with buttons in the steering wheel. </p>
<p>Basically you have the same as a 3.5 mm cable for your headphone in the phone. You can spin the plug and still listen to your music. </p>
<p>Edit: some people pointed out that in cars steering wheels indeed clocks prings are also commonly used. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey I know that thing all to well.  That's specifically the rotor head and swashplate / pcr set from a Sikorsky H-60 helicopter.</p>
<p>The only mechanical effect transmitted through the wires is the lockpin puller assembly condition and the drive motors for fold/spread operation.  You can see all harnesses emerge through the beanie on top.  Along with the puller status / spread/fold condition there is a separate harness to drive a heater mechanism for blade de-ice in cold weather conditions. There's only one blade heated at a time, cyclically typically.  All of this info is transmitted down the bellcrank shaft at different frequencies to a computer.</p>
<p>Not every harness you see in here is electrical. There are 4 hydraulic lines in the photo as well that serve to prevent blade hunting which is the forward and aft motion of the blade as it cuts through the air.  That is also managed just below the top beanie plate, above the bell crank and is, for the most part an non-managed system - as in it manages itself.</p>
<p>Then again, all collective pitch and cyclic motion is transmitted mechanically through the bridge (not pictured) which manipulates the blades directly through the swashplate (the bottom circle object) and the 4 pitch control rods that provide angle of attack control to the blades.</p>
<p>Ah helicopters, they're scary.  Especially when the spinny bit gets separated from the non- spinny bit.  Just keep in mind,  these things have a single hand tightened nut holding the spinny and non-spinny bits together. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I used to wonder the same thing, but in a simpler example: how do they make front brakes for BMX bikes that allow the handlebars to be spun around without tangling up the brake cable?</p>
<p>Of course, that's not exactly how it works for electrical cables, but same principle: two rings allow cables to run along spinning things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
