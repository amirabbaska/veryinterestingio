		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, assuming you actually go outside.</p>
<p>Your temperature preference should move with temperatures outside as your body's homeostasis primes itself for certain conditions. A good example is if you take someone from Michigan in the dead of winter and drop them in SC, their body is already primed to generate more heat than is necessary for SC weather.</p>
<p>The other big noted effect is the rise in depression and poor mood due to lack of Vitamin D production which is driven by sunlight exposure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Up until very recently, our bodies were very affected seasonally due to food availability. This affected every aspect of our ancestors' lives, including a sort of mating season (or a higher likelihood of copulation/shagging) when food was more available in the Spring. It's not just a factor of food there or not for energy reasons but also which food types. Science today is finding increasing amounts of research on how different food types affect our behaviour through different bacteria entering and interacting within our gut microbiome. Potentially this could mean that our behaviours may be influenced by the seasons from which foods were available to eat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I asked a while ago &quot;How do our bodies acclimate to how/cold weather?&quot; and got some great answers. Here's one from /u/salted_one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To elaborate on Petwins's post, this process is adaptive. Your body can control the speed at which you 'burn' calories dependent on environmental stimuli, chiefly temperature. As such, it might take you a little while to get used to a colder climate, but after enough time your body will naturally begin consuming food molecules faster to keep you warm. This, of course, results in increased appetite to maintain it. Here's some reading on the subject:</p>

<p>In the case of immediate and drastic temperature changes—for example, jumping from a hot tub to a frigid pool—the acclimation you feel is probably just due to your nerves becoming used to the temperature, and not due to a drastic increase in metabolism.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Your metabolism increases during colder months</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans might not have any &quot;year-long internal clock&quot; type thing going on (I certainly don't know of any such thing), but like any animals, we do respond to changes in our environment - which often happens to be linked to seasonal changes. This only tends to be noticeable on temperate and arctic regions, where seasons tend to be more extreme than on the subtropical and tropical regions.</p>
<p>Two main things that affect human physiology come to mind immediately: Different amounts of light, and different temperatures. Both of these cause physiological changes, ranging from hormone levels and circadian rhythms, to changes in our circulation and even body composition. </p>
<p>For example, exposure to cold causes our bodies to increase the ratio of brown fat to white fat, since brown fat is more effective at keeping us warm by being much more metabolically active than white fat.</p>
<p>Another thing that historically was very much a thing was the scarcity of food during winters, which naturally caused physiological changes ranging from weight loss to starvation. The lower energy intake definitely has an effect on human physiology, and it would have also affected people's behaviours during winter- such as preferably only expendeding minimum amount of energy for survival, like hunting for fresh meat, or gathering firewood, for example.</p>
<p>Then there are also cultural behaviours, which aren't necessarily tied to any seasonal changes via human biology, but are still tied to seasons, often due to other species' biology. For example, when agriculture became a thing, seasonal changes <em>definitely</em> started playing a big role in our behaviours. The fields had to be attended when it was the correct time to do so; this was also very work-intensive time. So people would work on the fields very hard for brief times a few times a year depending on how many crops they were able to grow during the year.</p>
<p>The rest of the year, between crops (or when the crops were just growing), people would do other things, like build pyramids or giant stone calendars to know when it was time to sow the next crop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
