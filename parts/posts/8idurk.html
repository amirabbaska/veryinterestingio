<p>Another interesting approach is Magnetised Target Fusion (lookup General Fusion) which could potentially do a lot better for Q value than traditional magnetic confinement approaches. </p>
<p>The idea is to produce a relatively low-temperature plasma, inject it into a chamber, and then rapidly compress it with mechanical means (pistons). This raises the plasma temperature very rapidly, and the heat of fusion is absorbed by some kind of thermal transfer material (in General Fusion's case, a molten mixture of Lead and Lithium). </p>
<p>In many ways, their approach is similar to Inertial Confinement (like the National Ignition Facility at LLNL), but instead of the liner of the fuel pellet imploding to compress the fuel, acoustic waves travelling through the molten metal act to compress the initial plasma. These techniques don't do ignition with a self-sustaining reaction - but it's early days for them yet, so watch this space...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To the best of my knowledge there are no nuclear fusion reactors currently that actually have energy production systems in place. That being said, you can compare the thermal output to the input to get a rough idea. For fusion reactors this is the Q value, the ratio of the fusion energy output to the heat energy added to the reactor to sustain the reaction. ITER is designed to have a Q value of 10, outputting 500MWth from 50MW auxiliary heating. Q&gt;1 is &quot;breakeven&quot;, but Q&gt;10 is important for ignition, the point where the plasma can heat itself, mostly from alpha particles, without having to have its energy harvested and put back into the system through some external heating.</p>
<p>A good approximation is that electrical output is about 1/3 thermal output, so if ITER achieves its goal it would be able to produce about 167MW of electricity from 50MW. However, in a reactor that can achieve ignition the input energy is only necessary at the beginning, not continuously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here is talking about the Q value which is good but from the way you mentioned economics it probably isn't what you're looking for?</p>
<p>At the moment all we can really say for certain is &quot;fusion will be expensive&quot;. The running theory at the moment with fusion reactors is basically bigger is better. This naturally means that the cost of a working fusion plant will run into the tens of billions just to build the damn thing. Then there's the Deuterium/Tritium fuel mix which needs to be sourced, kept and used as with any other fuel. We're looking at around 10x the current cost of electricity. Although there will be an economies of scale effect which kicks in as tritium production gets online, deuterium becomes more widely available and the materials needed to build a fusion plant turn from research materials with years of work put into manufacturing the damn things into materials which can be mass produced on a global scale. But even then it will still be expensive.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions (tokamak energy, ARK) who reckon they can get small scale fusion up and running with a large Q value, but these require the use of High Temperature Superconductors. I'm in the process of doing a PhD on HTS materials for fusion energy and honestly, we're a loooonngg way off of using HTS in a grid-ready fusion plant. They don't withstand radiation very well at all and they're incredibly difficult and expensive to make. The ARK/Tokamak energy people don't have a particularly strong background in superconductivity and it's really something they need to focus on if they want to get their small scale reactors up and running.</p>
<p>All in all fusion just won't be economically viable for a long time. Even as fossil fuel prices skyrocket we'll still have renewable energy forms which will be cheaper to build and run and the standard fission reactors are getting cheaper and safer every minute.</p>
<p>People like to claim fusion is the future of energy production but to be honest, in the western world, it really isn't. The big potential for fusion energy is in emerging economies. As Africa, Asia and South America begin to industrialise their energy needs will shoot through the roof. They can't use fossil fuels because us westerners used them all already. They won't be able to use renewable energy for everything because the low power density puts a pretty hard limit on the sustainable population of Earth (people reckon around 10 billion) and many of them won't want to use Fission for political reasons.</p>
<p>The economics of fusion is super interesting because the place for fusion in the energy economy isn't where you would initially expect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
