If we've discovered roughly 8 million, are there only about 75 million species on Earth? How can scientists know there are that many species on Earth but not know all of those species?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a general hypothesis that only so many <em>could</em> fit on the earth, so that being said, a rough estimate can be made about a conservative max number of living organisms on the planet. It’s basically like knowing the dimensions of your new bedroom, and by placing your bed in there you can roughly estimate the amount of other furniture that will fit in there without it being unreasonably crowded. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I guess you are taking about the estimate described in <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/08/110824-earths-species-8-7-million-biology-planet-animals-science/" target="_blank">this article</a>. I didn't read the paper, but it sounds like they tried to extrapolate from the rate at which species in each genus have been discovered so far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Indirect methods of population measurement are pretty straightforward, statistically.</p>
<p>When it's infeasible to count all members of a population, instead you'll catch some of them and tag them.   After some time period, you'll do it again, but some of the individuals you catch this time will already have tags because this is the second time you've caught them.   Lather, rinse, repeat for greater confidence in your estimate.</p>
<p>The proportions of previously caught individuals is a function of the relationship between your catch sizes (which you measure directly) and the total population size (which you can straightforwardly calculate).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very short answer: ecologists have come up with statistical ways of answering the question, “if we directly observe X species during a survey of an ecosystem, it turns out that there are really Y species there.”</p>
<p>The mathematical models are called “rarefaction curves” and the process of coming up with the number is called “rarefaction.”</p>
<p>The text of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rarefaction_(ecology)" target="_blank">Wikipedia entry</a> is understandable.  If you’re a little more adventurous, the equations are derived there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I haven’t noticed people mention is you also have to take into consideration of what  species is defined as.  If there are two birds, and they are both completely identical, except one has a slightly longer beak than the other, would that be two separate species or one?  Add onto that the fact that we’ve barely even explored the oceans (where probably 70%+ of species in the world live) and it equals a lot of undiscovered species.  If you take a stroll through the amazon rainforest, you’d probably find a dozen new species of plants and animals and bugs just walking for a few hours, if you knew what to look for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
