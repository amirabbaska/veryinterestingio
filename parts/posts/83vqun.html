<blockquote>
<p>Neurogenesis is the process of birth of neurons wherein neurons are generated from neural stem cells. Contrary to popular belief, neurogenesis continuously occurs in specific regions in the adult brain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but this recent study says the opposite. So what gives?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25975" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25975</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We conclude that recruitment of young neurons to the primate hippocampus decreases rapidly during the first years of life, and that neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus does not continue, or is extremely rare, in adult humans. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a new study that disagrees with previous findings, which is what science is all about. As a Nature paper, the strict length requirement on the paper unfortunately don't allow the authors to discuss the differences with previous findings in much detail. However, there is a <a href="https://media.nature.com/original/nature-assets/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/extref/nature25975-s1.pdf" target="_blank">supplemental discussion</a> (starts on page 5), something I have never seen before, that goes over several previous studies that found adult neurogenesis and explains why those results could be wrong. Clearly, the authors are aware that their results will be controversial in light of previous work on the subject. Most of their discussion seems to center on the methods used in the previous studies and why they could be unreliable or poorly suited for the job.</p>
<p>Maybe this study will shift the scientific consensus on adult neurogenesis and maybe it won't. Most likely, it will result in more research aimed at clarifying the issue. Eventually, consensus will shift, or it won't, depending on the data. This is how science works.</p>
<p>EDIT: /u/zmil posted <a href="http://snyderlab.com/2018/03/07/wtf-no-neurogenesis-in-humans/" target="_blank">this blog post</a> from another researcher in the field downthread, and I wanted to give it visibility here. It gives readable and reasonably brief summary of the adult neurogenesis controversy and the significance of this new paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, we would not expect a single scientific article to alter the content of an encyclopedia type article, although in the case of wikipedia, this might cause a restructuring of the encyclopedia article to include a list and/or discussion of studies showing evidence for adult neurogenesis and those showing the opposite. It isn't necessarily the goal of an encyclopedia to make a decision on whether a particular topic is correct or not, but rather to record the history of the idea and reflect on current thinking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other day, I ran across this <a href="http://snyderlab.com/2018/03/07/wtf-no-neurogenesis-in-humans/" target="_blank">really good blog post</a> on this paper from another researcher in the field of neurogenesis. It's very even-handed and readable for non-specialists.  </p>
<p>His summary of key points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-the quality of the histology is excellent, which is critical for interpreting any study, especially studies of human tissue</p>
<p>-the use of young samples is a plus, since this demonstrates that they are capable of identifying neurogenesis using the same techniques that are used in the older brains</p>
<p>-their definition of immature cells are those that express both of two markers that are commonly used in animal studies: DCX and PSA-NCAM. This is more stringent criteria than is common but it is warranted because they show that either marker on their own can be non-specific (and identify mature neurons or glia)
the downside is that there could be legitimate immature cells that only express one of the markers, that would be missed in the analyses</p>
<p>-given species differences (between well-understood animals and poorly-understood humans) and methodological differences between studies, more research is needed to reconcile these negative findings with previous positive evidence for adult hippocampal neurogenesis in humans</p>
<p>-it suggests a number of directions for future research: better comparisons between rodents and longer lived mammals, the possibility that neurogenesis is more relevant at earlier developmental stages, developing neurogenic strategies for repaired the damaged brain…</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Nature study asserts that neurogenesus is rare or absent in adult hippocampus, which is a specific brain region with a specific developmental trajectory. This does not eliminate or even directly address the possibility that adult neurogenesis may occur in other brain regions, or even in the hippocampus under conditions they didn’t look at. </p>
<p>Technological advances, particularly in optogenetics and scanning/visualization techniques, have had a big effect on what it is physically possible to investigate and at what level of detail, so this allows discovery of new evidence that sometimes contradicts evidence collected using older, less precise techniques &amp; technologies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My previous professor, who is prominent in the field, indicated to me that a rebuttal article is being crafted right now to put these results in context.  In their words, there are three lines of evidence that strongly support adult neurogenesis and its functional importance, and this work demonstrates a failure to reproduce one of the three lines, which they emphasize is the weakest line.  So stay tuned!  I wish I could give you more details, but it’s still ongoing.  Please do continue to follow this topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
