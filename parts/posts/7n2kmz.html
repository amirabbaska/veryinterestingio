<p>The same exact thing happens with hot air and cold air. The light is traveling differently through the two, so you can see the area where they mix. The mixing of hot and cold air can even resemble the shimmering of water since air is a fluid (fluid means something subtly different from a liquid) and moves in a similar fashion to water</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question!</p>
<p>I guess you can start with thinking about what temperature is. When something is hot, the particles in that material are moving faster on average than the particles in something that's cold. Because the particles are moving faster, they bump into each other more frequently and tend to have more space between any two particles. When things like gases (for example) are transparent, they can slow down light and bend it by an amount which is directly proportional to their density. </p>
<p>Since a hot material like hot air has more space between its particles, it has a lower density than cold air, and they both bend light by different amounts. When the two gases mix, they make images seen through the mixture appear distorted as all the rays of light coming from some object behind the mix aren't traveling parallel. </p>
<p>I should say that I have no idea why exactly light bends when it passes through a material boundary at some nonzero angle from the perpendicular, so I might go start my own ELI5 post.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same reason a straw appears broken in a glass of water.</p>
<p>Hot and cold air have different index of refraction, causing light to travel at different speed. This difference cause the rays of light entering the mixture exit at different angles.</p>

<p>Extra fact: the same principle of Snell law also explains how optical lens like those in eye glass and telescopes work by bending light. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Snell's Law. Light <em>always</em> travels the path of leaat time. Just like how light is &quot;bent&quot; when entering water, the difference in density (how close atoms/molecules are together) affects the path of least time. Imagine you're knee deep in mud and there is a road a few feet away from you with a finish line at the end.  You and a friend want to race to the finish line. Do you run straight to it through the mud or take a different path to get to the road where you can run full speed?</p>
<p>Here is an excellent video <a href="https://youtu.be/Iq1a_KJTWJ8" target="_blank">3blue1brown</a></p>
