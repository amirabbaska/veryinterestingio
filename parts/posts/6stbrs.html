Because of this connection, illnesses or infections to one of these body parts often affect the other.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was an otorhinolaryngologist for nearly 30 years. In the 60's, ENTs were also trained in eye surgery so lots of older patients recall the EENT specialist.  That grouping eventually involved too much knowledge to manage. . The 8&quot; cube that holds  so much of our sensory function is really fascinating because I got to deal with foreign objects in all 3 areas, cancers, congenital deformities, infection, reconstructing trauma, allergies, plastic reconstruction and renovation. Incidentally, most 3rd graders in Spanish speaking countries learned the word early on because it is the longest one in the Spanish language: otorhinolaryngologia  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Otorhinolaryngology, or more commonly ENT (ear nose and throat), is a surgical specialty. All surgical specialties operate on more than one body part. For example, General surgeons often work on all the organs of the abdomen, the breasts, and the esophagus. Orthopaedic surgeons work on all the bones and joints. Plastic surgeons work on the hands, the face, sometimes the skin in general, as well as doing cosmetic implants, etc. Some sub-specialties get very specific, and each specialty encompasses multiple more-specific sub-specialties. Specialties and sub-specialties often overlap and different surgeons may have procedures they concentrate on, and different hospitals may divide work differently. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thoracic surgeons treat the heart, lungs, and esophoegus. Usually they group into general thoracic (e.g. lung cancer) cardiac (open-heart surgery) and congenital cardiac (kids) subspecialties. Also, a cardiologist is not the same as a cardiothoracic surgeon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ents handle several different things that affect the ear, nose and throat.
I saw an ENT for a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy at 23. Same doctor treats people with sinus issues, ear issues and esophageal issues.
I've seen so many specialists its really inter how specific you can get in subspecialties.
I've seen a pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon, a thoracic surgeon that specializes in hepatologic medicine who mainly does pediatric liver transplants and surgeries. He wrote an article about me and my surgery that he performed. Check out the spring edition of pediatric surgery 2007. Im 16 year old female with giant hepatocellular adenoma secondary to oxycarbazepine therapy. Published by Drs Superina and Feingold iirc. </p>
<p>I've seen a pediatric/adolescent psychiatrist. Was so sad when I aged out because they're not very common and in demand so he couldn't keep seeing anyone once they turned 18. He's now head of peds psychiatry at that hospital.
I saw a pediatric rheumatologist and several infectious disease specialists. (got my pic in a medical book for that, it was cool) </p>
<p>As a transplant recipient I see a hepatologist (liver doctor) a dermatologist (skin) a neurologist/epileptologist (brain/epilepsy) and gynecologist (reproductive) now, as well as a GP. In pretty good health 8 years post transplant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
