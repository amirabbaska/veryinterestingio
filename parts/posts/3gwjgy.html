		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The truth is, racing sports all have their traditions. </p>
<p>For track (running) and swimming, getting a good reaction to the start is important; part of the game. For distance running like marathon, the start is a casual affair with runners starting in a group after a whistle blows. Big marathons, it might be minutes before someone in the back starts running. </p>
<p>For bicycle racing, the start on &quot;mass start&quot; (more than one bike starting in a group) is a pretty casual affair. For Match Sprints there's a whistle and the first guy starts when he's ready; second guy can't move until first guy moves. Longer races in a velodrome and on the road, the race does a casual start, does a neutral lap or length of road, then starts racing. On short road races, called &quot;criteriums&quot; and off-road bike races, the whistle blows and it's a mass scramble to get your bike in motion and your feet in the pedals. </p>
<p>In time trial events, the race typically starts when the person starts moving or using a rhythmic countdown. On a bike, it's a rhythmic countdown usually, unless it's a &quot;flying&quot; event on the track, and then the timer is started triggering on the bike crossing a line. In downhill skiing events, the timer starts when the racer flips the gate exiting the platform. </p>
<p>As you can see, it varies. Sports are all games that their core, and the rules of the games are arbitrary when you get right down to it. Starting track running events on a rhythmic count would change the way the game is played... and the game works just fine without doing that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem with false starts is that, in this case running, the runner can anticipate the start.  If you can time that anticipation properly, you can get off the blocks or the line as soon as the starting pistol goes off.  This is considered to be an unfair advantage.  So the starting pistol goes off at a &quot;random&quot; time so that getting off the blocks is based off of reaction which is considered a part of the race.  Your reaction/burst in getting off the blocks is a part of the physical challenge of the race.</p>
<p>If the countdown was rhythmic, the start would be more easily anticipated, and if you're perception of the tempo is too fast, you'd false start anyway, so it's better to take any thought out of the start and make it a pure reaction to a stimulus.  Even in rhythmic 3, 2, 1 countdowns false starts are much more likely because people think it's more easily anticipated.  With a random start, every one might be slower off the blocks, but you're not going to have anyone unfairly off the blocks quicker.  Everyone's at the same disadvantage.</p>
<p>In cross country, they do a SUPER long countdown.  They start giving warnings at maybe 10 or even 15min, then every 5min till the start of the race.  They'll warn you again at 1min, 30sec, 15sec, and then at 10sec they audibly call out the count down until they get to 5sec, then they stop counting aloud.  I believe that anywhere in that 5sec, or even past the 5sec, they can shoot the starter pistol.  This way the runners have absolutely no way of anticipating the start.  It could happen at 4sec or -1sec.  You're forced to start off of the starter pistol and your reaction.  At least in WI High School CC, a false start is an automatic disqualification, probably because it's a pain in the ass to reset 100 runners, and there use to be kids who would intentionally false start races (my mom did it, and then her younger brother did it when he started running, this was like the 70s) to psych out the other teams and get them to lose their initial burst.  The people who were intentionally false starting would hold back when going off the line, cause they knew it wasn't for real, which would give them a strong start, allowing them to get a better position in the pack at the start of the race.  They'd also be more loose and fresh for the duration of the run, while everyone else has already engaged their muscles and is freaking out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rhythmic countdowns actually encourage false starts. Hearing &quot;3, 2, 1, Go!&quot; encourages an athlete to start motion between the 1 and Go! But a simple &quot;Ready, Start!&quot; sequence of sounds leaves everyone on a level playing field of having no idea when the starting sound is coming, thereby reducing false starts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Fast reaction to the start gun is part of that competition. Motorsport usually does use a form of countdown,  but reaction time is still important, vitally so in the case of drag racing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
