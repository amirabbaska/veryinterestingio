		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We all know that your fingertips are ment to be EXTREMELY sensitive to touch, and this is no different to the rest of your phalange(finger/toe) appendages. Basically, your hands are comprised of dozens of tendons all stretching against each other in different ways. When you jam a finger on a basketball, you are irritating, if not damaging, these tendons in a way that your brain is telling you is VERY BAD, considering how important your fingers are to survival. They take a moment to resolve the pain because of the very sensitive nerve endings that are associated with these tendons, they will not let up the pain until it is sure that those tendons are okay, in a manner of speaking. Hence when you jam them on a ball they feel physically weak for a while and need to be clenched and examined to be sure that no injury has happened. Hoped this helped, however I am no expert.</p>
<p>Edit: tendon damage does not technically heal, you just kinda get used to it and it takes lliteral months for the pain to subside. however irritation, ESPECIALLY when you are young, heals rather quickly</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was reading this wondering what the actual hell people were talking about. Jamming a finger? Hurting yourself that way has never happened to me and yet so many people are talking about it. Then I realized that I have Joint hypermobility syndrome. There's a chance my fingers just bent or something instead of jamming. Anyone else know about this or have the same thing? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A “jammed finger” injury is compression of the joint, no real stretching of tendons or ligaments there since the injury is along the axis of the finger and no joint hyper flex ion or hyper extension occurred.</p>
<p>The injury is usually to the cartilage that makes up the joint or a compression fracture of the bone. In young patients with growth plates could also be a SALTER fracture. </p>
