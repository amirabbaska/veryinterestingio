		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't quite understand their business model. Do they buy up failing businesses and then just liquidate them to make a profit? If this is the case why are they required, couldnt to the previous owners do this and why would someone sell to them significantly less than what the company is worth liquidated?</p>
<p>I've also heard how they saddle companies with debt, how can this be profitable? Do they somehow exploit bankruptcy law to not pay it all back?</p>
<p>They seem almost cartoonishly evil, could someone possible also ELI5 why this is not the case and perhaps give a defense of them if possible?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/bucksalty is correct in his answer, but I'll add something.  If you want to take a look at a private equity buyout that is 1) similar to Toys R Us, 2) more typical (and successful) and 3) also participated in by Bain - take a look at <a href="http://www.dollargeneral.com/" target="_blank">Dollar General</a>, who reported earnings this morning.  </p>
<p>In 2007, Bain, KKG &amp; Goldman Sachs bought Dollar General which was struggling and failing, took it private, and completely fixed it.  They took it public again in 2009.  Since then, Dollar General has added ~7000 stores (and it will add 1,000/year for a while going forward), and has added 84,000 good-paying jobs (plus another 12,000/per year going forward) to ultra-rural communities where there are no other jobs.  This is obviously a positive thing.  Bain/KKG/Goldman, plus a host of other (myself included) have all profited from this turnaround.  </p>
<p>And before I get the &quot;you're just a shill&quot; bullshit - I'm not defending Bain at all.  I just want people to understand that 1) ch7 bankruptcies are pretty rare (if they were common, private equity wouldn't exist), and 2) private equity has fixed <strong>a lot</strong> of companies that you've never heard about.  Just be sure to consider all sides of the picture.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They buy businesses that have lost favor with investors and often that aren't being run efficiently.  After they purchase them they make changes (which often involve increasing their debt).  </p>
<p>Just like any investor, when they're right they make money (both profits during the time when they're running them) and usually a much larger profit when they sell the company, but when they're wrong they lose money.  </p>
<p>Many times, the changes involve increasing the debt, because a company with more debt is both riskier (the firm is more likely to fail than one with little or no debt) but also more profitable to its owners (higher returns on equity than one with little or no debt).  In the case of Toys R Us, they'll lose most of their investment (they make money when they are able to sell firms).  </p>
<p>They don't exploit bankruptcy laws, allowing failed corporations or people to not repay their debts is literally the purpose of bankruptcy laws.  </p>
<p>They're no more cartoonishly evil than everyone who owns stock in their 401(k) and votes, they just have enough money to buy the company in its entirety.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the case of Toys R Us, they made money because they were not the investors in the purchase, they acted more as a broker, so they just got paid for making the purchase happen. My understanding is that the actual investors will be losing money on the Toys R Us deal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They buy failing businesses and try to resurrect hem or sell off pieces that may be work more separately than as one entity.</p>
<p>They don’t always succeed. In the case of Toys R Us, they spent a decade try to turn around the company but were unable to do so. Part of that was due to the debt taken on to acquire the company, because they were unable to grow the company to cover those debt payments plus the operational costs (rents, inventory, wages, etc).</p>
<p>Had a Toys R Us turnaround been successful, they would have likely cashed out eventually by taking company public again or selling the chain to another company.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One missing piece in these comments. The private equity firms involved have taken hundreds of millions out of this company in the form of management and other fees. They have also taken hundreds of millions out as dividends each time they refinance the debt. What's crazy to me is that the banks holding the debt have allowed them to do that to a point where their equity is out and they have no vested interest in the company's success anymore. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
