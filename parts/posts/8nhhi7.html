		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I work in pancreas development so this is a topic I know fairly well, but don't directly study.</p>
<p>Anyways, pancreas transplants. First an important note- to treat diabetes, you don't need a whole new pancreas. In fact, you only need two percent of one! The pancreas is comprised of two tissue types- exocrine tissue, which aids in digestion, and endocrine tissue, which secretes hormones to regulate blood sugar levels. The vast majority of the pancreas is exocrine tissue, while the endocrine portion, comprised of approximately one million micro-organs called &quot;islets of Langerhans&quot;, is the only part that secretes the hormones you need to &quot;cure&quot; diabetes (including most notably insulin). The two components function largely independently, and it is rare that patients with diabetes have exocrine dysfunction, so actually you only need those darn islets and not the whole pancreas.</p>
<p>So, what then are the barriers to islet transplantation? The major issues are two-fold. First is getting (enough) islets. It is a non-trivial task to harvest intact and functional islets even in laboratory animals (mice), to say less of a much larger and rarer human pancreas. Remember how the vast majority of the pancreas aids in digestion? Well it does that by making digestive enzymes, and you can imagine what happens when a potential donor passes away- those enzymes get released willy-nilly and start breaking up anything nearby, including our precious islets. It's estimated by the NIH that <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/insulin-medicines-treatments/pancreatic-islet-transplantation" target="_blank">only slightly more than half of decedent donors, which are rare enough already, are viable for islet transplantation</a>. Even if you get a good donor, islet recovery rates aren't perfect and you usually get maybe half of the islets available, sometimes far less. This then necessitates pooling of islets from multiple pancreata (the fancy scientific plural of pancreas), which currently averages out to I believe two good donor pancreata per recipient. It also makes living donation of islets sub-optimal, since again a single donor is unlikely to provide enough viable islets.  </p>
<p>The other major issue is engraftment. To start with there are the usual complications with allo-transplantation- potential rejection, a need for immunosuppressants, etc. By contrast, one pro with islet transplants is that you don't have to connect a bunch of complicated blood vessels like you do with whole organ transplant- we've injected islets into the liver, kidneys, under the skin, even under the capsule of the eye, and had them engraft successfully. However, a great number of the transplants fail, and we don't know completely why- this is one of the hot topics of pancreas research. Perhaps it's poor islet <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24106517" target="_blank">re-vascularization</a>. Perhaps it's <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25777058" target="_blank">islet inflammation destroying islets</a>. Or a thousand other things acting in concert- I study a molecule called Hmgb1, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25058889" target="_blank">which is elevated in islets that engraft poorly</a>. The current debate is whether this is causational- do transplanted islets secrete Hmgb1, causing islet failure, or are islets secreting Hmgb1 because they are injured? Research seems to be leaning toward the former.</p>
<p>So to summarize- you don't need the whole pancreas, just the islets. However, it's hard to get enough islets for transplantation, and it's hard to get the islets to function properly/not die in the recipient. On a final note, this is why xenotransplantation (islets from other animals, usually pigs) and stem-cell derived islets are such hot topics in the field. They circumvent the first problem and in the case of stem-cell derived islets, a lot of the second. </p>
<p>edit: Several posters have astutely pointed out that getting new islets would likely not circumvent the autoimmune disorder that underlies most Type-1 diabetes cases, and would eventually result in transplant failure in that subset of cases. I didn't discuss that issue because 1) it's far outside my specific expertise, and 2) I didn't think of it. /u/SPACE_CHUPACABRA has a great comment below <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/8nhhi7/why_cant_we_perform_a_pancreas_transplant_for/dzvynnk/" target="_blank">addressing some of these issues</a>. </p>
<p>edit 2: Another common question is why not just transplant the whole pancreas then, if it's so difficult to extract islets. Whole pancreas transplant as you can imagine is a major surgery with major risks. Often patients suffering from advanced stages of diabetes or other pancreatic diseases are in bad shape, which increases the risks for complications even further. By contrast, islet transplantation is usually done through catheterization, sticking a long tube into your liver, which doesn't even require general anesthesia. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Type 1 diabetes has been treated with transplants of the pancreas islet cells which produce insulin. Interestingly, the cells are injected into the liver where they happily produce insulin. The problem is rejection and limited supply of donors. It is still experimental, but has helped people who had very unstable blood sugar levels. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islet_cell_transplantation" target="_blank">If the cells are not from a genetically identical donor the patient's body will recognize them as foreign and the immune system will begin to attack them as with any transplant rejection. To prevent this immunosuppressant drugs are used. Recent studies have shown that islet transplantation has progressed to the point that 58% of the patients in one study were insulin independent one year after the operation.</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many comments here point out that organ transplants to cure diabetes are possible, but carry high risk of rejection and medication is needed to suppress your immunity to prevent rejection.</p>
<p>Good news, there is a very recent discovery that pancreatic stem cells exist. These can be cloned indefinitely and differentiated to produce insulin. If we figure this out, we can take your own cells, modify them and inject them back into the pancreas to regenerate the tissue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former transplant professional here - A major consideration is the donor organ supply- pancreata do not grow on trees - they are a delicate organ we humans are very hard on (lungs too) with our lifestyles - add to that the sequelae that happens leading to the donors death and you’re dealing with very few ‘low quality’ organs going into very sick individuals - not easy to do at any scale -
When I left the field, stem cell sourced islet cell infusions looked the most promising - </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
