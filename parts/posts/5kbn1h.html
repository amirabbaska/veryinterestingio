<p>Edit: You guys are awesome. I think he was really asking if it were possible to 'put out' the sun, but I had assumed some sort of cosmic explosion, not a second star!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a source right now but if I remember correctly adding a massive amount of water to the sun would actually make it burn hotter. The reason is that at these scales we can't think of water as something that extinguishes fire. What's going on in a star is a nuclear fusion reaction triggered by the massive amount of energy coming from the combined gravitational pull of all the components of the star. So by adding a massive amount of water to the star you're adding a lot of weight which means more gravitational energy meaning more fusion. You're also adding fuel that can be fused in the form of water molecules. </p>
<p>Soeone please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm by no means an authority on the subject but I remember seeing something like this on a PBS spacetime video a while ago. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If we change the question to &quot;What would happen if a huge amount of water, with total mass greater than the sun, were sprayed onto the sun?&quot; (so, basically the same question but eliminate the &quot;ball problem&quot;), what's the answer?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>assuming a density of the ball of water of 1000kg/m^3, a ball of water of the size of the sun would weigh just a little bit less than the sun itself. Therefore such a giant ball of water cannot exist because it would collapse under its own gravity and simply form a star on its own. When two suns collide? Well think of the biggest explosion you can imagine? This will be biggger... soooo much bigger.<br />

We have been able to observe such a merger fairly recently as well. An article in nature about it can be found <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101207/full/news.2010.654.html" target="_blank">here</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To explain simply, normal fires burn chemically; while the Sun burns nuclear(ly). So, the sun can &quot;burn&quot; water. It would decompose into H and O (the sun loses energy) and then the H would go into fusion (the sun gains MUCH more energy). I'm not sure about O.</p>
<p>Essentially, the chemical structure doesn't matter; only the atoms inside matter.</p>
<p>EDIT: I forgot that it'd just directly break down into H and O; see /u/DrunkFishBreatheAir's [comment](it wouldn't decompose the water into H2 and O2. At least, where fusion is taking place, you don't have molecules hanging around, it'd just be H and O, probably ionized at that.

</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNO_cycle" target="_blank">Adding a ball of water the size of the sun would set off the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen fusion sequence, which would &quot;burn&quot; the oxygen in the water, making the sun much hotter, therefore bigger. Also the added mass would make the sun big enough to go nova.
