		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just about ingredients, the process is very important too.</p>
<p>Take sugar turned into caramel. The total length of time spent heating the sugar (total joules) and the temperature curve (at which point there were changes in heating) directly affects the flavor and texture. Too hot and it tastes burnt, too slow and it's all runny. </p>
<p>In the 90s Ruffles sales collapsed for a few quarters for no apparent reason. Frito-Lay used some very advanced processes, that included photographing every individual chip and rejecting (using timed puffs of air) those that do not meet color, size and shape requirements. </p>
<p>The root cause of the sales dip was a switch to a different blend of cooking oil. There's a delay between a change in process and a change in sales as new product makes its way out into the supply chain. A month later, sales started to really dip. They checked everything in the machines and the ingredients but the sales kept door dipping. It was only after a chance discussion with a consumer did they discover the oil change had altered the temperature curve, which in turn made the chips taste 'burnt' to some palates. But only some people could taste whatever new substance was now in the chip. </p>
<p>Tl;dr&gt; The process is as important as the ingredients and way harder to figure out, especially at scale. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Haven't seen the correct answer yet, so here goes:  </p>
<p>Coca-Cola itself is not that hard to replicate.  We have tools like mass spectrometers which can tell us exactly what proportion each ingredient represents in the recipe.  The reason nobody will copy Coca-Cola comes down to marketing and brand differentiation.  A competitor cannot compete on price because soda is really cheap to produce anyway, and the price above cost the consumer pays is pretty much entirely attributable to how much they like the brand.  </p>
<p>People like Coke because they trust Coca-Cola, and whether they recognize it or not, have some degree of emotional attachment to the brand.  That said, each brand needs to have a differentiated product, because if a consumer ever says, &quot;this drink tastes exactly like Coke!&quot;, then the market becomes a price war, and neither brand can charge a surplus for their product.  If the competitor is small, Coca-Cola will drive them out of the market due to economies of scale and cash reserves.  If the competitor is large (like PepsiCo), both companies' sales will suffer, and the board of directors/shareholders would lose confidence in leadership to produce a top return on investment and fire a lot of top execs.</p>
<p>As an interesting side-note--blind taste tests (can't remember which ones, sorry!) actually showed people ranked RC cola as the best tasting cola, so why aren't their sales as high as Coke or Pepsi?  Because most people don't actually buy cola due to pure taste, but rather due to brand relationship.</p>
<p>As another example of brand perception, think about which brand of cola you buy when you're hosting different kinds of events.  Do you pick different kinds of cola based on who's coming?  If a lot of people are coming, do you buy the cheaper in-store generic brand?  If only a few good friends are coming, do you buy the name brand Coke or Pepsi?  Why do you do that?</p>
<p>Source: My consumer behavior class and economics class which discussed this question from different angles.</p>
<p>TL;DR  People buy soda/pop/cola based on relationship with brand, not taste.  Competitors don't make identical flavor profiles because they need to create differentiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
