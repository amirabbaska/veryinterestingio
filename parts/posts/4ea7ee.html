		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the question &quot;where is the horizon?&quot; and &quot;what does the horizon look like?&quot; are different questions. Let's answer the first question.</p>
<h2>Where is the horizon?</h2>
<p>How do you find the horizon anyway? Suppose you are on a spherical object (like Earth). <a href="http://i.imgur.com/7NNgEj3.png" target="_blank">Here is a picture</a> to make things clear. The variables are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>R = radius of Earth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>H = height of vantage point (e.g., distance from your eyes to the ground)</p>
</li>
<li>θ = viewing angle (i.e., the declination angle at which you see the horizon)</li>
</ul>
<p>The farthest point you can see is the point where a line passing through your eyes is tangent to the circular cross-section of Earth. From the diagram, some simple trig shows that your viewing angle is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>θ = cos^(-1)[ R/(R+H) ]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With H = 6 feet, we get <a href="http://tinyurl.com/z4rhesh" target="_blank">θ = 0.043 degrees</a>.</p>
<p>What is your viewing angle for an infinite plane? Well, go back to the picture of Earth. Can the viewing angle be any positive angle? Nope. If you look exactly parallel to the plane, then your line of sight does not end on the plane. But as soon as you look down at even the slightest angle, your line of sight meets the plane. So your viewing angle on an infinite plane is always 0 degrees, no matter how high your vantage point is. So if Earth were an infinite flat plane, for instance, the horizon would be pretty much exactly in the same place where it is now (at least for low vantage points). The angle 0.043 degrees is imperceptibly close to 0.</p>
<h2>What does the horizon look like?</h2>
<p>Okay, so what would the horizon look like? For this, we need some physics. For reasons that will become clear, let's also assume that there are no other planets, no other stars, etc. The universe is just this infinite plane of uniform density (and you, I suppose).</p>
<p>An infinite plane with a constant mass density has a very simple gravitational field. It is uniform on each side of the plane, no matter how far you are from the plane. So if you are right on the surface of the plane, you measure some gravitational acceleration <em>g</em>. If you go up a height <em>H</em>, you measure the same acceleration. It is a completely uniform field (on each side) that always points towards perpendicularly toward the plane.</p>
<p>So what? What does this mean? Well, the path of light gets bent by gravity. Even the path of light passing by Earth gets bent, by a very small amount. (Deflection of light by the Sun is a classical test of general relativity.) The same happens for an infinite plane, but the difference now is that it has all the time in the world (or I suppose, distance) to deflect right back to the plane itself. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/yhT8MJY.png" target="_blank">Here is another picture.</a> Light emitted from the plane will eventually curve back to the plane. Yes, it takes a very large distance for this to happen for, say, a gravitational field as strong as Earth's gravity, but that's fine: the plane is infinite. When the light finally is received, it is received at some angle. Our brain always perceives light to have traveled a straight line. So even though the light path is curved, we will perceive the light to have come in from some point in the sky.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this means that the entire sky is entirely filled with images of the surface of the plane some distance away. (This is why I assumed there were no other planets, stars, etc. so that light rays do not get obstructed.) In other words, it looks as if the entire world has curved up around you and closed at the top. So it looks like you are actually in some very large spherical planet, for which the &quot;surface&quot; is the interior of the sphere. But remember that images above you are really emitted from points on the plane <em>very</em> far away. (The point directly above you is infinitely far away.) So as you walk in a straight line on the plane, you won't really see the entire sky rotating around to meet you like you would expect if you were inside a spherical planet. For instance, the point directly above you never appears to move. Try as you might, you will never reach the point where the image directly above you was emitted.</p>
<p>By the way, what <em>does</em> the point directly above you look like? Well, it's where all the points infinitely far away from you are sent by ray-tracing all of the light back. But points infinitely far from you in this world make up the horizon! So instead of <em>seeing</em> the horizon exactly where it is now on Earth, you would see the horizon directly above you all crunched up into a single point.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>edit:</strong> A few people have (falsely) noted that a 45-degree launch angle maximizes horizontal range and that all the photons start with the same speed. So you end up only seeing some finite portion of the plane around you. This is not correct. That line of reasoning treats light as a ballistic particle in a Newtonian uniform gravitational field. Light cannot be treated in Newtonian gravity: it is neither affected by nor affects gravity in the Newtonian framework. For one clear difference, note that the light paths in a uniform field are not parabolas; they are actually semicircular arcs. </p>
<p>Also, the oft-repeated statement &quot;the speed of light is constant&quot; is simply not true in GR if you take it at face value. The speed of a light signal next to you is always <em>c</em>, sure. But the local speed of light for distant light rays, in general, depends on the coordinates. This is not a contradiction; it is an artifact of the freedom of choosing coordinates in GR.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>edit 2:</strong> I have to admit that I have committed a cardinal sin that I absolutely hate to see committed by others: indulging hypotheticals that are sort-of unanswerable.</p>
<p>If we do everything in a Newtonian framework, then the first part of my response is just fine. The horizon is at 0 degrees, which is barely less than the Earth horizon at about 0.043 degrees for the height of a typical person. For the second part of my response, I did two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>used Newtonian gravity to deduce that the gravitational field of the plane is uniform</p>
</li>
<li>used GR to determine the paths of light rays in a uniform field</li>
</ul>
<p>(Now, technically speaking, there is no metric in GR that has all of the desired properties of a uniform field from Newtonian gravity. There are several candidates though. I just used the simplest of them, which is Rindler coordinates for flat spacetime. But that is a small technicality that doesn't matter too much.)</p>
<p>There really is no metric that describes an infinite plane of uniform density, at least not one that I can think of or calculate. Perhaps there are some good GR models of such a matter distribution. Anyway, my error of combining the two frameworks of gravity was subtle, but important enough to point out. So take what I said about what the horizon looks like and light deflecting back to you with a grain of salt. There are some unphysical assumptions that go into that.</p>
<p>Better... just assume that the infinite plane of uniform density is not there. Assume space is just a vacuum, but there is a uniform gravitational field nevertheless. (You can have non-trivial metrics even in a vacuum, e.g., black hole, so this is not a contradictory statement.) If the field is in the <em>z</em>-direction, then we can talk about what happens to light emitted at points on the plane <em>z</em> = 0. That is a more physical problem that can actually be answered in GR somewhat. Just don't think too hard about <em>how</em> we could produce such a uniform field with matter.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answer is waaaay too complicated. I mean, I noped out quick on that. Let me give you an engineer's answer.  Standing on a plane you look around and you immediately have three points. The point you're standing on (or the point directly below your eyes for people who lean like Michael Jackson) we'll call A, the point where your eyes are we'll call B, and the point that you're looking at we'll call C. Line AB will always be perpendicular to line AC which makes the angle at A=90°, and for those unaware the angles in a triangle equal 180°. Therefore, if angle A=90° then angles B and C must sum to 90°. The moment angle B=90° you are no longer looking at the plane because your line of sight is parallel to the plane. Therefore, making the assumption you could see that far and there are NO obstructions, the &quot;horizon&quot; on an infinite plane is always always always at eye level in all directions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent question! I recently spent some time thinking about it for a drawing I was doing. It's pretty simple actually!</p>
<p>And <strong>the answer is that it would look (basically) exactly the same</strong>! So why?</p>
<p>Let's take some inspiration from computer graphics, where the notion of an infinite place is well defined. In this image the monkey's head is on an infinite plane: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oXV8A.png" target="_blank">http://i.stack.imgur.com/oXV8A.png</a>. As you can see there is a perfectly normal horizon.</p>
<p>In order to understand why this is let's do a thought experiment. Imagine you were standing on this infinite plane and looked straight at the horizon. Then you shot lasers out of your eyes. The laser beams would be perfectly parallel to the ground and they would also be in the center of your vision. They would also however appear to meet the horizon as they get further and further away. Therefore the horizon must be exactly in the middle of your vision. Here are some diagrams for reference.</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/ZZI3v" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/ZZI3v</a></p>
<p>In computer graphics that v shape that indicates the viewing volume in the image is called the frustum. You can see that as we move further away from the view, the distance between the ground and the laser becomes smaller and smaller <em>relative</em> to the frustrum's height at that point. This means that the two lines will appear to meet in the image, which is the basic concept of a vanishing point.</p>
<p>Note that this also means that camera or viewer is always as tall or high as the horizon line relative to other objects in the image, as long as the camera angle is parallel with the ground.</p>
<p>So why then does the horizon look like it does on Earth? Well, when you look at the horizon on Earth your gaze isn't perfectly parallel with the ground. It's looking down slightly. How slightly? Well as /u/Midtek calculated, about 0.043 degrees. Not terribly noticeable What if you were standing on an exercise ball instead? Yep, that's going to be noticeable. In fact if you look at an angle tangent to the ball (parallel to the ground), you probably won't even see the ball at all!</p>
<p><strong><em>The key difference is that on an infinite plane, it looks same no matter how tall you are but on a sphere it matters how tall you are relative to the size of the sphere.</em></strong></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the book Ringworld works on this subject. At least practical and philosophical.</p>
<p>If I remember correct the curvature of the ringworld is so small that the people living on it, don't even know that they live on a ring world.</p>
<p>The curvature is so small that they can't see where the ringworld goes a measurable distance up, so they assume that they live on a flat plane.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
