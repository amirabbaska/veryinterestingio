		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is still significant research to be done and hurdles to overcome with this. However, US Patent application ID US 12/990,420 is for a magnetic radiation shiled. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to provide an effective shield, the strength if the shield magnetic field at the source is perferably at least 1x10^-4 Tesla. To obtain a boundary between the shield magnetic field and a typical solar wind background magnetic field of around 1x10^-7 Tesla at a distance of up to a few hundred meters from the spacecraft a field strength of less than .1 Tesla at the magnetic field source will be generally sufficient. Allowing for effects if field persistence in the plasma environment, average electrical power from about 100W to 10kW, and more preferably from about 500W to 5kW may be provided by the power supply to drive the magnetic field source to generate the shield magnetic field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would be for a spacecraft about the size of a desk. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Photons are not charged, and are not bent by a magnetic field.  </p>
<p>The only way to shield from Gamma Rays is having lots of material between the Radiation and what you want to shield.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a physics perspective this is possible, yes
At least the charged particle part.
The power consumption is not really a problem.</p>
<p>The challenge lies in extra weight and complexity, effect on everything and anyone on board, and perhaps heat.</p>
<p>It’s easier to just live with the particles bombarding the ship. I read somewhere that the ISS use cpu’s from the 90’s because the 90 nm (or there about?) process can take far more beating from particles going trough the ship, than the modern 14 nm process.</p>
<p>Does anyone know more about this perhaps?  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that hasn't been addressed yet in the context of this discussion is the subject of magnetic reconnection, and more broadly the fact that the solar wind direction and speed, as well as the Interplanetary Magnetic Field alignment vary quite a bit. It's more than possible that your magnetic shield that just barely balances the dynamic pressure of the solar wind could collapse to a very short range, if not entirely disappear, during a shift in the IMF. Reconnection events have the potential to drive any proposed plasma shield into the craft it's protecting, so that's equally as &quot;difficult&quot; to sell. Really though, the (nominal) solar wind ain't the killer for space travel. It's those darned cosmic rays and solar energetic particles that kill most electronics. Solar flare induced x-rays don't help the situation either. The current consensus is as most people have described: Put a bunch of dense stuff between us and space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of studies about this. Google: active radiation shield.</p>
<p>There are several problems to overcome. It should be an extremely strong magnetic field, typically they propose 4 Tm or more. The effects of such strong magnetic fields on human health have not been thoroughly studied. Usually they propose coils arranged in such way that most of the magnetic field surrounds the spacecraft while in the inside they (almost) cancel out.</p>
<p>In order to achieve such a field you need superconductors. Keeping them cold in space isn't easy. As magnets attract each other they could produce crushing forces on the spacecraft. And if anything goes wrong (one of them getting its temperature out of range) things could fail catastrophically.</p>
<p>The main advantage is that they would be way less massive than a passive shield (i.e. a thick wall of a shielding material). An active shield could be launched with a realistic budget an probably support a two year long human mission with a an acceptable dose under current standards for astronauts (500 mSv per year and 1000 mSv per career).</p>
<p>However, due to the possibility of catastrophic failure, space agencies look at these things with suspicion. Generally speaking passive techniques are more reliable, and radiation shields are no exception. When you weigh the cons of each hypothesis, the probability that astronauts develop a cancer due to radiation and the probability that the die because the spacecraft was crushed... it isn't an easy trade-off. Keep in mind that a shield wouldn't really &quot;save&quot; them from radiation, it would just reduce the dose, and the numbers acceptable for astronauts are way higher than those for radiation exposed workers on Earth. The energies of cosmic rays are just too high to be safe from them.</p>
<p>Certainly more research is needed.</p>
<p>Magnetic fields have no effect against EM radiation. Fortunately that's not a concern in space, most of the radiation is from charged particles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
