		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can feel the friction and stickyness of oily skin. You can feel your blsy being unclean because skin touching skin, or skin touching clothes, feels kinda sticky and clingy.</p>
<p>When you've showered, your skin is dry to thr touch, and there's almost no friction or stickyness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For one thing, you get rid of some smell and possibly replace it with better fragrances. The sweat, oils and dirt are gone. These tend to stick to your clothes so that sense is removed. I think the skin &quot;breaths&quot; better too without the pores being clogged with debris.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Believe it or not your body has a mind of its own. That's why you feel good/rewarded after you shower/sleep/exercise. It's all the neurotransmitters being sent to your brain. Come on, unless you actually, consciously smell odors from yourself all day long something is wrong. It's not a conscious process to feel good/rewarded after taking care of our body. It's our body thanking us for taking care of it!</p>
<p>We sleep because we know we will feel rejuvenated afterwards. Whether you feel the affects of sleep on a great or minor scale is well, up to how well you sleep. Same thing with showering. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
