		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This thread has been locked. Please remember when you are commenting on askscience that we have very strict commenting guidelines in order to maintain the quality of conversation: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep it scientific.</strong> Answers should be based peer-reviewed journal articles and textbooks. Personal opinion is never relevant and should not be used as justification for a post.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refrain from speculation.</strong> Do not guess. If you are unsure of an answer, ask a question instead. Uninformed (layman) speculation will be removed by the moderators. Our goal is to provide expert scientific responses to questions. Any speculation should come from those with strong scientific background in that field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not post anecdotes.</strong> Anecdotes are by their very nature unscientific. At best they are amusing, and at worst they are inaccurate or misleading. Anecdotes are often enjoyable to read and can be enlightening - so much so that there’s many subreddits devoted almost exclusively to sharing them, including one of the biggest: /r/AskReddit. However, in AskScience our goal is employment of the scientific method, and an oft-quoted truism is that the plural of anecdote is not data. As we cannot verify the truth of a story, no accumulation of anecdotes is going to answer a question in a scientifically rigorous method. This includes posting personal medical information. Violations to this rule may result in a temporary ban.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>No medical advice.</strong> Asking for or giving medical (or veterinary) advice is inappropriate. It is impossible to accurately procure and assess personal information over the internet without speculation. There are far too many variables that can lead to incorrect diagnoses and harmful advice. For more information, please see our policy on medical advice. Violations to this rule may result in a temporary ban.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is very possible to feel &quot;high&quot; without using psychoactive drugs. These feelings are caused by a temporary increase or divergence from homeostasis of endogenous neurotransmitters. Here are some ways an individual may feel &quot;high&quot; from a sober state:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sleep Deprivation</strong>: We've all been there; after just one sleepless night, you may feel extra restless, jittery, and perhaps even <em>extra</em> happy. Individuals may even experience <a href="http://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/hypomania-mania-symptoms" target="_blank"><em>hypomania</em></a>, a state characterized by elation and hyperactivity. <a href="http://www.sfn.org/Press-Room/News-Release-Archives/2008/One-Sleepless-Night-Increases-Dopamine-in-the-Human-Brain?returnId={0C16364F-DB22-424A-849A-B7CF6FDCFE35}" target="_blank">Researchers found that just one sleepless night increases dopamine in the striatum and the thalamus.</a></li>
<li><strong>Runner's High</strong>: Long-distance runners can experience a state of euphoria commonly referred to as the &quot;runner's high&quot;. <a href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/11/2523.short" target="_blank">Current models predict the &quot;high&quot; is caused by activation of the body's <em>opiod receptors</em></a>, the same sites to which drugs like codeine, morphine, and oxycodone bind. <a href="http://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/Abstract/2003/12020/Exercise_activates_the_endocannabinoid_system.15.aspx" target="_blank">Other research suggests the endocannabinoid system may contribute to this state of well being</a>. Perhaps this feeling is a combination of the two systems working synergistically.</li>
<li><strong>Falling in Love</strong>: There's no feeling quite like being mutually in love with someone. It is no surprise, then, that researchers would try to explain the neurobiological basis of this feeling. In <a href="http://www.hdbp.org/psychiatria_danubina/pdf/dnb_vol26_sup1/dnb_vol26_sup1_266.pdf" target="_blank">this report</a>, researchers scanned the brains of people in love using fMRI and PET scans to measure levels of various neurotransmitters. They found that the feeling of love is contributed by an increase in hormones vasopressin and oxytocin -- known for playing central roles in human pair-bonding and (of course)  an increase in the levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. </li>
<li><strong>Meditation</strong>: <a href="http://www.freemeditation.com/meditation-basics/" target="_blank">Meditation</a> can be described as &quot;a state of profound, deep peace that occurs when the mind is calm and silent&quot;. Such practice is becoming a growing topic of interest in the field of neurological research. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9142560" target="_blank">One paper</a> found that &quot;With regards to identity state meditative experience was found to produce statistically significant changes in terms of intensity in meaning (P &lt; 0.05), time sense (P &lt; 0.05), joy (P &lt; 0.05), love (P &lt; 0.05) and state of awareness (P &lt; 0.01).&quot; What does this mean? It implies meditation introduces a state of altered consciousness. These experiences may be similar, but distinct, from those caused by psychedelic drugs such as LSD-25 and psilocybin mushrooms.</li>
<li><strong>Deprivation</strong>: This includes both sensory deprivation and oxygen deprivation. Sensory deprivation tanks or <em>isolation</em> tanks operate by floating the subject in salt water at body temperature, resulting in a subjective feeling of floating and overall senselessness. Thus, these devices can be used to aid in meditation or as a vehicle for relaxation. This <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sbp/sbp/2004/00000032/00000002/art00001" target="_blank">has given way for use as an alternative therapy to treat pain and stress</a>. As far as oxygen deprivation goes, all methods pose some danger to the user and I do not recommend doing it, therefore I will not bother to elaborate.</li>
<li><strong>Flow</strong>: [Flow](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology</a>), also known as <em>the zone</em> is a mental state in which a person is fully immersed and involved in doing an activity. Individuals can enter this state from performing challenging or attention-grabbing tasks, such as completing a puzzle, solving a difficult math problem, playing video games, etc. The possibilities from which a person can enter this state is endless. <a href="http://www.enhancingpeople.com/paginas/master/Bibliografia_MCP/Biblio02/FLOW%20THEORY%20AND%20RESEARCH.pdf" target="_blank">In their paper published in <em>The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology</em></a> researchers J. Nakamura and M. Csíkszentmihályi identified six factors as encompassing an experience of flow. Distortion of temporal experience (time dilation) [5], perceiving the experience as rewarding[6]? I would qualify this as being &quot;high&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Intense and focused concentration on the present moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merging of action and awareness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A loss of reflective self-consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A distortion of temporal experience, one's subjective experience of time is altered.</p>
</li>
<li>Experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding, also referred to as autotelic experience.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: The term &quot;high&quot; refers to any altered state of consciousness. In a broader sense such states can also be achieved through exhaustion, pain, heat (sauna, sun, native American sweat lodges), music and dancing (rhythmic beating, drum circles), falling in love, the list goes on. Of course this will vary from person to person. So yes, changes to ones mental state can be made independent of substance use.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Formatting</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: <del>Bah how could I forget to mention meditating! Experienced meditators can enter a state similar to those elicited by dissociative and psychedelic drugs. I'm on mobile but I'll add it to the list when I get back to a computer.</del></p>
<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: Added section on meditation.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 4</strong>: Added section on sensory deprivation. Thank you for all the support.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 5</strong>: Hello! Woke up to this thread being locked :( If you have any questions or suggestions for add ons, please PM me I will try to get to it. Added TL;DR. (SO to /u/Transfigurations)</p>
<p><strong>Edit 6</strong>: Added section on Flow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The feeling of being &quot;high&quot; is caused by the interaction of whichever drug you have taken with neurotransmitter receptors in your brain.  If a drug does not interact with these receptors, it does not produce any psychoactive effect.</p>
<p>These receptors are only present because they have a matching endogenous compound in the body.  As an example, THC (the psychoactive compound in marijuana) interacts with cannabinoid receptors in the brain, specifically receptors that match with the compound anandamide. </p>
<p>If the body produces an excess of an endogenous compound, it is possible for an individual to experience the same feeling as being &quot;high&quot; without the use of psychoactive drugs.  This is commonly seen in people who frequently run.  After running for an extended period of time, the runner's body will begin to produce heightened levels of dopamine, contributing to the &quot;runner's high.&quot;</p>
<p>EDIT:  For more information, please see /u/2014justin's post below.  He lists several specific mechanisms that can produce this effect and cites his sources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I would like to point out is &quot;high&quot; is a generic / non-specific term for an altered state of consciousness. Different drugs produce profoundly different &quot;highs&quot; even within the same class of drug, and stimulants / depressants / psychoactive drugs are even more different. </p>
<p>Separately, all drugs are doing is activating or blocking receptors that already exist in the brain, and are already activated or blocked by normal biological processes. The point is, your question can be approached from two aspects - &quot;any chemical that doesn't originate in the human body&quot; (which gets complicated, due to things like eating and drinking) - or the legal aspect of your question - &quot;any chemical which isn't classified as an illegal drug&quot;. Nitrogen narcosis as already described is a great example of this confusion - it's 79% of what we breathe in and would hardly be considered a drug and is definitely not illegal. But when diving or in a hyperbaric chamber, the same chemical can have incredibly intoxicating effects. Whether you classify that as a drug or not is as much a question of semantics as anything else. Finally there are substances from caffeine to alcohol to kratom which are very clearly &quot;drugs&quot;, and have the capability to produce a &quot;high&quot;, but are not explicitly illegal in many places. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another way that I can't find in the replies, though I don't recommend anyone try it out, is near-death experiences. Many reports of near-death experiences are identical to psychedelic experiences induced by psychedelics (LSD, magic mushrooms, mescaline cacti, DMT, etc.) and other compounds (ketamine, high doses of cannabis, for instance). Light at the end of a tunnel, seeing one's life flash before one's eyes, epiphanies, time-dilation, etc.</p>
<p>Many people that have near-death experiences, also exhibit identical symptoms of emotional processing of the experience that psychedelic users go through. There are theories that these experiences are caused by the release of endogenous DMT, but it's still speculation.</p>
