		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit all I'm seeing are a lot of terrible explanations or non-explanations. So I'll give it a go.</p>
<p>The type of TV that the OP is referring had in it what is known as a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT). The &quot;tube&quot; was a large, hollow piece of glass, part of which was the screen you actually looked at. The tube was under vacuum (no air inside). On the inside of the glass, forming the viewing screen, was a layer of phosphorescent material, laid out in a grid, of individual elements that would light up red, green, or blue (much the same as pixels on an LCD are actually made up of red, green and blue portions).  At the other end of the tube was the source of what actually made the color cells light up: an electron beam source.  This was literally a special piece of metal that would heat up to get red hot when electric current passed through it. When it got hot enough, it would throw off electrons (pretty much all materials do this, just some materials shed electrons more easily than others).  The phosphorescent material I mentioned earlier would then have a very high positive charge applied to it, and because electrons naturally have a negative charge, they'd be pulled very rapidly toward the screen.  Around the outside of the neck of the tube were electromagnetic coils. As the electrons are attracted toward the screen, a magnetic field is setup in different shapes by these coils to &quot;steer&quot; this beam of electrons toward a very specific spot on the screen.  The electrons striking that spot would cause one of the phosphor color cells to light up.  The magnetic field from the electromagnets would get energized in different ways to cause the electron beam to move back and forth, up and down, across the screen lighting different spots to form the picture (this process is called &quot;scanning&quot; the screen, and is where the term &quot;scan lines&quot; comes from, which make up the image).</p>
<p>The reason for the phenomenon the OP mentioned is because of what I said about the high positive charge on the back of the screen (which pulled the electrons toward it).  The voltage potential between the back of the screen and the electron source was often 10s of thousands of volts.  Because of the high charge on the back of the screen, together with the insulative property of the glass, negative ions from the air near the front of the TV would also be drawn to the screen, just as the electrons are that generate the image.  When you touch the screen, you cause the area of the glass that you touch to discharge those ions off the glass through your body to ground.  This is exactly the same effect as building a charge by scuffing your feet on carpet and then touching a metal door knob. Except in the latter case your body is the charge source and the door knob is the ground path, and in the case of the TV screen, the glass is the charge source and your body is the ground path.  The reason you could &quot;wipe&quot; the screen to remove the static charge was because the pull of the high voltage potential behind the glass was enough to hold most of those free ions against the glass and only ions very close to where you touch could get pulled off the screen and through your body.  Naturally, as long as the TV was turned on, more free ions from the air would get attracted to the screen and eventually the screen would have a complete layer of &quot;static&quot; again.</p>
<p>TL;DR: TVs had a layer of static because of the very high voltage potential on the other side of the glass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Old cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions have an <a href="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/question694.htm" target="_blank">electron gun</a> which fires electrons at the back of the screen. And the screen is coated with <del>phosphorus</del> <em>phosphors</em> which emit light whenever struck by an electron. The side-effect of this process is that each electron increases the static charge of the screen, and over time as the image on the TV changes it increases the charge. Meanwhile, rubbing your hand, which has a slight negative charge, across the screen will remove some of this built-up static.</p>
