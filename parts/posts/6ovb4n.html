<p>Well I was thinking is this somehow a linear capability. Say we have an Uranium atom orbiting an Earth mass black hole 2cm above the event horizon. Ignoring time diliation, would the Uranium be more likely to give up a helium nucleus (alpha decay) due to the nucleus being pulled apart by the black holes tidal force?</p>
<p>Could such a scenario even make an otherwise stable isotope unstable? A Roche limit of sorts, but instead of breaking apart objects held together by gravity, orbiting closer than this limit breaks apart objects held together by the strong force.</p></div></div>

<p>A very rough estimate: Tidal gravity scales with GM/r^(3), the alpha nucleus would need to see something like 1 MeV/fm force over a distance of 1 fm. We get relevant tidal forces if GMm/r^3 = 1 MeV/fm^(2) where m is the mass of the alpha particle.
The closest stable orbit around a non-rotating black hole happens at 3 times the Schwarzschild radius, or r=6 GM/c^(2). Plugging that in, we get M = sqrt(c^6 m/(1 MeV/fm^2 G^(2))), roughly <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt((speed+of+light\)%5E4*+4*940+GeV%2F((1+MeV%2F(fm\)%5E2\" target="_blank">10^15 kg</a>+(gravitational+constant)%5E2))). The corresponding Schwarzschild radius is just 4000 fm. Large enough to have nuclei orbiting it, it might work, although the range of possible black hole masses is quite narrow. Smaller black holes work as well but at some point the orbits don't get well-defined any more. It is unknown if there are black holes smaller than a few solar masses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

However I don't believe that tidal forces matter though because the nuclei of atoms are extremely small, so the tidal forces should be very small as well. Smaller on many orders of magnitude compared to the other fundamental forces. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that OP said &quot;Ignoring time dilation&quot;, but what if we do consider it?  Wouldn't a particle orbiting near the Schwarzchild radius be moving at near the speed of light?  And wouldn't this prolong the life of the particle as far as radioactive decay is concerned, from the persepecive of an outside observer?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
