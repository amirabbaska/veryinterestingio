I can think of a lot of tech things it will impact, but what about how animals and plants and geology will react? Will the Van Allen belts be messed up? Will the Northern Lights be affected? This kind of event would probably touch on a ton of different hard sciences, so it might need responses from more than just one person.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer seems to be we really don't know, but there are several hypotheses.  From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal#Hypothesized_triggers" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some scientists, such as Richard A. Muller, think that geomagnetic reversals are not spontaneous processes but rather are triggered by external events that directly disrupt the flow in the Earth's core. Proposals include impact events[33][34] or internal events such as the arrival of continental slabs carried down into the mantle by the action of plate tectonics at subduction zones or the initiation of new mantle plumes from the core-mantle boundary.[35] Supporters of this hypothesis hold that any of these events could lead to a large scale disruption of the dynamo, effectively turning off the geomagnetic field. Because the magnetic field is stable in either the present North-South orientation or a reversed orientation, they propose that when the field recovers from such a disruption it spontaneously chooses one state or the other, such that half the recoveries become reversals. However, the proposed mechanism does not appear to work in a quantitative model, and the evidence from stratigraphy for a correlation between reversals and impact events is weak. There is no evidence for a reversal connected with the impact event that caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.[36]</p>
