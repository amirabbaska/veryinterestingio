		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great topic and I think others are answering it better than I. But, my own perspective as someone that grew up with the strip is that Charlie Brown is so relatable, and that this contributed to his success as  character - so many of us could sigh &quot;Good grief!&quot; right along with him. The visuals, as was pointed out, also contributed - not just for their cleanliness and beauty but for the suburban life it accurately depicted for many of us, those clean lines, garages, and small wildernesses just a step away from our yard.</p>
<p>btw why do you think Charlie Brown was abused? By his friends, you mean?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, first of all, ignore newer Peanuts from the 1960s on, as that's there because of the fame and fortune.  The Peanuts strips from the early and mid 1950s are what count... they had a somewhat different look and a different kind of storyboard.</p>
<p>One reason it did well because it was simple.  Take a look at the comic strips from earlier... they looked like <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FIi5mvfeJwI/VPJeH-zl2_I/AAAAAAAAn60/XhbaNwBOev0/s1600/YP04%3Ajane%2Bjun%2B27%2B1938%3ADM.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> and were very busy visually.  Early Peanuts looked like this: <a href="https://schulzmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pe531125Resized.jpg" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="http://c0389161.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/dyn/str_strip/238649.full.gif" target="_blank">2</a>... much cleaner and simpler design.  The use of whitespace was a huge visual draw -- when browsing the newspaper in the mid-1950s, your eye went right to this strip.  Here is an <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zH2tB4a7PVg/T_GlvDwtwvI/AAAAAAAAE5A/SCtPrgnRV34/s1600/latimes53059comics.jpg" target="_blank">example</a> from 1953 and you can see how Peanuts stands out from all the busy, jumbled strips with lots of text.  Many times Peanuts had even more whitespace than this.</p>
<p>Also you've got an interesting blend of grownup situations wrapped into kids mischief and a dog.  Again, simple, without gimmicks, adventures, or Tom &amp; Jerry situations.  There was a boy &amp; his dog narrative, baseball games, ice cream cones, being teased -- things everyone can relate to.  It was like a slice of life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Later <em>Peanuts</em> strips were so schmaltzy you'd be surprised how subversive the early ones were.  The essential humor of it was taking the self-seriousness and self-doubt of neurotic adults, beaten down by life, and transplanting that onto a group of school kids.  It caught on because grown people saw themselves in it, and the kid metaphor allowed them to without it feeling like the sort of self-indulgent wallowing the characters themselves exhibit.  Instead you laugh at it and maybe don't take yourself so seriously either.  Early <em>Peanuts</em> was pure catharsis.</p>
<p>Snoopy was ultimately kind of a misstep.  He makes sense in context: he's a dog, and not subject to all the crap that besets the humans.  When he's sad, it's over something really worthy of sadness.  He otherwise never lets the bastards get him down and knows how to live authentically in a way none of the human characters does.  It made him an icon, and was a great contrast particularly early on when Snoopy couldn't speak (even in thought-balloon form).  Over time, as he took over, Snoopy's character undercut the whole original point of the strip.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Schulz didn't want to create a cutesy strip that was all rosy and fun, because that's not how life is. Children in particular are mean to each other all the time, and there's no point trying to gloss over that.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown is an &quot;everyman&quot; character. Anyone who has ever felt disappointed or insecure at some point -- and let's face it, that's most of us -- will identify with him. And it's that identification -- the thing that makes you think, &quot;Yep -- story of my life&quot; -- which drives the success of that particular strip.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, something I can actually answer having read a biography of Schultz and being a student of graphic lit.</p>
<p>When you're talking about American comic strip writers there are two artists who sort of rise above the rest in terms how seriously they took their creations artisticly. Schultz and Waterson.</p>
<p>Both of these guys were totally all about the art, but they expresses that in totally different ways. Waterson focused more on the physical art and using the strips to reflect not just his own personal life but also the political and emotional realities of every stage of life (at least for Americans).</p>
<p>For Schultz however the strip was personal in a different kind of way. Not only did Charlie Brown generally represent all of Schultz' fears and anxieties, but as the strip grew every character tended to represent some part of Schultz or his psyche. Now obviously this isn't the case for every character in every strip, (when you write the same comic for 50 years the characters tend to take on a life if their own) but as a generality it works. Schultz was quoted as saying something along the lines of &quot;I suppose if someone was very clever they could read all of Peanuts and understand exactly who I am.&quot; (That's a paraphrase as I don't have the quote next to me.)</p>
<p>So to answer your question, the strip was successful, among other reasons, because Schultz was pretty depressed for a lot of his life and he put all of himself into an art form he had been practising since childhood. This made the characters so relatable and the strip so much deeper than anything else commercially available at the time. It was kind of a no-brainer that it would be popular.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Schultz didn't pick the name &quot;Peanuts&quot; and in fact he hated it.</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite subjects and if you want to know more about Schultz and the ways he compares with Watterson I'll gladly keep talking and point you toward some great resources</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
