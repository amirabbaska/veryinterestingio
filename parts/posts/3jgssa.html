Why do we have these 2 completely opposite reactions in our body?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has a internal thermostat, called the hypothalamus. This thermostat can be adjusted. Sweating occurs when your body temperature is above thermostat level to cool your body down. When you have a fever your thermostat is set higher than normal. This is why you can feel cold even though you have a fever, because even though your body temperature is higher than normal it is still below thermostat level. When your fever breaks and the thermostat goes back to normal level, you will start sweating as the body temperature is now above thermostat level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Tldr</strong> Your sweat response doesn't know why you're heating up. So it fights it automatically. This is a good thing, you could overheat otherwise. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.sharecare.com/health/infectious-disease/how-fever-help-fight-infection" target="_blank">https://www.sharecare.com/health/infectious-disease/how-fever-help-fight-infection</a>.</p>
<p>That link has several doctors answering a similar question.</p>
<p>The increased body temperature speeds up our white blood cells in some fashion. (unclear if they mean the physical speed, the rate they react to the threat, the rate they're produced or some other more specific fashion, or all of the above.)</p>
<p>It does this while decreasing the effectiveness of certain invading bodies. So it's a win-win. </p>
<p>The sweating and other methods of cooling your body employs (like the discomfort you feel which compels you to find external ways to lower your temperature) work normally, or close to normally. </p>
<p>This seems counterintuitive but high fevers can run up to the point where you can die. So the balancing is necessary.</p>
<p>Nurses trying to cool overheated patients must do it very slowly, because any drastic temperature change can trigger yet <em>another</em> counteraction from the body, where it tries to warm back up again. Carers for people at risk from overheating are warned that trying to cool the ill person too rapidly can push them over the edge into serious overheating trouble. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, hypothalamus controls temperature like a thermostat. The body is not intentionally making a fever, it is from things like cytokines and other chemicals that are released while fighting the infection. Some fever is good, as macrophages and other components of the immune system actually work better at slightly higher temperatures. However, the temperatures get too high for extended periods of time, then enzymes start to break down.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Minds have purpose. The human body is a complex system of multiple systems which sometimes work at cross purposes driven by evolution.</p>
<p>You heat up from inflammation fighting the illness, which is done whether it's a local infection or a full-body infection. If you heat up enough all over your body, the other system that keeps you cool kicks in to keep you from getting too hot. This isn't one coherent conscious effort to do things this way. It's multiple unconscious bodily functions working at different tasks hopefully achieving a balance that lets you survive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
