How much would a big ocean-going vessel (say, a US navy Nimitz-class aircraft carrier) notice a tsunami in the middle of an open ocean, thousands of miles from shore?<br />
Would it be a destructive wall of water moving rapidly towards the ship, or would merely be a (un)noticable rise of the water level which a ship could pass over?<br />
Assume the tsunami in question is the result of an earthquake with a rating of 9.0+ on the richter scale similar to the 1700 Cascadia or 2004 Indonesia earthquakes, both of which generated massive, ocean-crossing waves.</p></div></div>

<p>a tsunami does not really &quot;present&quot; itself as a wave until the water depth is about &lt;1.3x the height of the wave itself.  the drag on the bottom of the ocean slows the flow and the top moves ahead and creates the circulation we see.</p>
<p>When you look at a regular ocean, it looks pretty calm, but when it gets to shore, things become more violent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way to think about it is that a typical wave in the ocean is generated by wind and only effects the top few meters. That can move along with the water underneath undisturbed until it hits land. Once the depth on shore is less than the wave it builds up and breaks (oversimplified here but stay with me).</p>
<p>A tsunami involves the bottom shifting so you get the entire depth of the ocean to shift up say one meter. </p>
<p>Big deal, a one meter wave in the mid ocean. The problem is that this wave will not stay put and now will travel at hundreds of kms per hour. Also it is not really a wave but a whole block of water from the surface to the bottom (say 2500 m) that was moved. </p>
<p>At smaller depths, this becomes a problem as the water wants to be 2500 m deep. All the displacement energy of the water at full depth must be absorbed so we end up with a much higher, wider wave in shallow water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They would see a sea swell of about a meter over several minutes fowled by a dip. Note that this is very much a slow swell. A carrier wouldn't actively notice any change. A smaller class ship such as an Arleigh Burke class destroyer would hardly notice such a change depending on the sea state. Maybe if the water was glass, but most of the time it's too choppy for such a thing.

<p>Further reading: check out rogue waves. I don't know much about those, but they would probably interest you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As some other comments have said, it depends on the ship's location relative to both the coast and the depth of the ocean beneath it. Far out to sea and you wouldn't really notice, but if the ship is close to the harbor, depending on the size of the quake and the degree of uplift generated, you'd absolutely notice.</p>

When he got back he told me about how there were these 2 massive swells of water that hit them but they didn't really think much of it until they got back to shore later that day and saw the mass destruction that the tsunami had caused.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
