		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The correct answer here is the horizontal nature of sleep.</p>
<p>When we're awake we're on our feet and a lot of fluid can collect there. If I had to guess 500cc per leg on average. </p>
<p>You can check this by examining the skin at the border of your socks after a day of standing. There's a ridge at the border of your socks because the tension of the elastic has kept some of the water from distributing entirely there. </p>
<p>When you lay horizontal that fluid redistributes. Some gets pissed out. Some <del>good</del> goes to your head and neck. </p>
<p>Both head and neck are particularly susceptible to minor changes in hydrostatic pressure. Thus, puffy eyes and cheeks, deepened voice, even blurry vision. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert by any means but I believe the primary cause is dehydration throughout the night. When you're dehydrated your skin tends to look more flushed and puffy.</p>
<p>In addition to this your facial muscles have basically been relaxed for an extended period of time and due to your positioning the fluid that is in your body is redistributed a bit (similar to how ankles will look more swollen if you're on your feet all day)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>i usually jump out of bed within 2 seconds of waking up .
when i look at the mirror (about 10-15 seconds) after waking up ,i look normal.</p>
<p>on rare occasions when i wake up from &quot;heavy Sleep&quot; (usually weekends) ill definitely see my face different .</p>
<p>its actually odd when im thinking about it ;/ </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
