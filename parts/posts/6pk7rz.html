		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question. </p>
<p>When people go to a quick casual restaurant the price you see is the price you get. This is hopefully the optimum price for owners and customers, and the employees are paid a wage dependent on the local market.</p>
<p>It makes a lot of sense from a supply and demand perspective, including labor and production. Customers pay a price they are willing to pay, workers work for the most the market will bear, and owners make as much profit as they possibly can. The system is based on the constant push and pull, ultimately leading to $8.50 burritos.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t this transfer to sit down restaurants? Denny’s all the way up to a steak house, waiters are paid around $2.50 + tips, while at a Chipotle it is reasonable to expect a starting wage at $9.50. Both are providing basically the same product, food. Why shouldn’t people be paid the same?</p>
<p>The question we should ask isn’t “why shouldn’t people be paid the same”, rather “why aren’t people paid the same”. It is always more useful to understand why before asking if things should be different.</p>
<p>So why are people tipped? The idea when you first look at it is ridiculous. Every single waiter in the country is an actor, playing their part, and at the end of each performance they receive a grade. Their tip. And arguably the better your performance the better your tip. Is this why people tip? Mostly no. If someone tips 20% at every meal the chance they will tip less than 15% is highly unlikely. And just as unlikely is tipping 25%. The same can be said for someone who tips 10%, or 5%. People go into restaurants with their own idea of what is appropriate and tip accordingly, regardless of service.</p>
<p>This is not to completely diminish the importance of competent waiters, good service and hard work matter. They just don’t matter nearly as much as many people would like to believe.</p>
<p>This misconception is important explain tipping’s staying power. It fits nicely with American ideas of hard work and individualism. It also makes it easier to manage a wait staff. The carrot is nicely held in front “do good work, be diligent and friendly, you will be paid more”.</p>
<p>That isn’t the only reason for tipping, full service restaurant economics might be more important. For those unaware full-service restaurants are expensive operations. If you buy a plate of pasta for $20, reasonably you can expect 10% to 15% of the bill to go to rent, around 25% to 30% to go to the cost of food, between 20% and 25% of the bill is labor. Just with rent, labor, and COGS a restaurants margin is somewhere between 45% and 30%. This does not include management, cleaning, maintenance, marketing, utilities, and dozens of other small expenses. When all is said and done, most sit down full-service restaurants make anywhere between 4% and 7% of gross income. That pasta made the owner somewhere between $.80 to $1.40.</p>
<p>Should you pity the restaurateur? Probably not. It can be a good living and owner operated locations often have the benefit of not “paying” for management and some labor, meaning someone can run a $600,000 a year restaurant and bring home around $80,000 to $120,000. But for big corporate chains the reality is margins are low compared to other businesses, operating cost are high, and there is a nasty little industry secret.</p>
<p>They don’t make money 80% of the time.</p>
<p>A slow lunch on Tuesday doesn’t keep the lights on. It might only cover the cost of rent. A good example is Twin Peaks, a chain similar too Hooters. Each Twin Peaks has a very expensive building, in an expensive areas, with expensive cooks, high management costs, and only makes money after 5 PM Monday through Thursday. Those high-volume times are so high they pay for the rest of the “dead time”.</p>
<p>This is typical for many restaurants, some are busy for lunch during the week, others are big breakfast places, others need have a good Friday or they can’t pay their suppliers. Whatever the pattern of customers it is very rare to find a restaurant which can support a full staff 100% of the time. Here’s the kicker, customers expect and demand the same service level 100% of the time.</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>You need cooks in the back, at a minimum labor is $10 an hour (probably more, in large Texas cities a good line cook makes at least $11.50 an hour). You need managers, contrary to popular belief they do things. Here is where tipping makes a lot of sense. The cooks and the managers jobs are the same Monday through Sunday. Yes, they may be busier sometimes, but a manager can do inventory on slow times and a good line cook is always prepping for busy times. They can spread their labor around, and as such it is unreasonable to expect a them to be paid less in a slow time.</p>
<p>Now for the waiters, they can’t functionally spread their labor to other times. You can’t build up waiter capacity and use it when needed. A waiter is only useful to a restaurant when a customer is in the building.</p>
<p>The cost of running a restaurant are fixed (even labor and management to a certain extent) but the revenue is inconsistent. Tipping allows restaurants to meet the expectations of customers, high quality service always, and allows restaurants to pay waiters only when they can afford to pay them. The waiters get to earn a percentage of their sales and give up a standard paycheck in return for more control over their salaries.</p>
<p>There are plenty of holes in the argument and it raises a lot of question. Why don’t restaurants find out what the actual hourly wage is for servers and pay them accordingly? Why don’t restaurants staff employees more effectively? Why don’t customers accept higher prices? Why don’t restaurants raise prices to just pay people more?</p>
<p>All the questions are worth answering, but it always gets back to supply and demand and human behavior. When people look at the price of a menu they decide to purchase the food or go to another restaurant. And with Yelp and Google price comparisons are easier than ever. It means if a restaurant charges $15 for a burger it had better be at least 2X as good as $7.50 burger. Higher prices must correlate with higher value. And as much as every restaurant claims to have “the best….” there is a market price for a burger and for a steak.</p>
<p>But almost all Americans know the price you see is not the result. We don’t have VAT, we factor in tax and tip. We are all taxed the same, but we don’t all tip the same.</p>
<p>Tipping functions the same way as a coupon. Tipping allows customers to receive the same service, eating at a restaurant and ordering the same food, while paying different prices. There is an efficiency to the system. Those who are price conscious and less willing to tip are more enticed to a restaurant with low prices, while a less price conscious person is attracted to the same restaurant. The owner gets the business of both customers and the wait staff gets functionally an average tip from both customers.</p>
<p>At this point it is worth pointing out how many redditors have said “while I was in university I waited tables” or “while I was in college I worked the bar” and they made “well over minimum wage” because “they worked hard”. This is a generalization and as a rule should be avoided. Except in the preceding sentence. But they hint at a very uncomfortable truth about the service industry, educated, young, and attractive people can make very good money from tips (big assumption, redditors are young, attractive, and well educated). I assure you, you are not better at your job than the middle-aged waiter at Denny’s, but you will get paid more. The ability to access higher paying jobs in the service industry is based on your background, your looks, and how you speak.</p>
<p>What is the conclusion? Should we abolish tipping? Outlawing tipping might make waiters at lower cost restaurants get paid more (this makes sense, tipping is a function of a percentage of sales, lower cost food leads to a lower cost per transaction, leading to a lower tip, and lower wages), but it certainly would impact a lot of college educated people capitalizing on their social skills. It might make a lot of restaurant radically readjust their labor, with some restaurant surely closing. It might make an entire industry segment, sit down restaurants (which are losing sales and business at a fast clip) less attractive to customers, lowering sales and lowering overall wages.</p>
<p>Personally, I see tipping as a bad system, not from an economic standpoint but from a moral standpoint. People shouldn’t have to sing for their supper. They should do a job, get paid for the job, and whether some jerk tipped shouldn’t affect whether you make rent. But it is much more complicated than that. Many restaurants have tried to change tipping culture, and none has met with much success. Certainly there hasn’t been a brushfire of “de-tipping”.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before the Prohibition of alcohol, tips were basically bribery so some customer could get better services like bigger plates of be given food faster. When the Prohibition of alcohol came, restaurants saw a huge income decrease and they encourage their waiters to accept tips so they could get paid, instead of readjusting the whole prices so the money before spent on alcohol was driven to food and non.alcoholic beverages. </p>
<p>This become so strong that now reataurants can pay little no nothing while their customers live out of tips. In reallity, they can accept the tips and if they dont get to minimun wage, they can legally ask the money to their employer so they can get minimun wage.</p>
<p>This is something just in USA and maybe some other countries. In Spain, where i live, tipping is not mandatory but is somewhat encouraged if the service is good, fast and take more orders than normal, if the table was big, if they bring bread and tap water instead of bottled when we ask for it... In Japan is even considered of bad education to give money as a tip cause is seen as a way to show off how much money you have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A local brew pub recently switched to a &quot;no tip&quot; model here in the US and received  quite a bit of backlash about it. The owner wrote a pretty extensive <a href="http://www.7thsettlement.com/beyond-hospitality-included/" target="_blank">blog post</a> about why he did it and how he hopes to see it play out. </p>
<p>Some of his key reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>There is enormous inequity in pay between the servers and the kitchen staff.</li>
<li>Tipping promotes discrimination and harassment.</li>
<li>Tipping has an ugly history rooted in classism and racism.</li>
<li>Tipping has very little if any influence on the quality of service</li>
<li>Earning tips is the source of motivation is only half the truth</li>
<li>A major cost for any restaurant is turnover</li>
<li>Working in hospitality is a respectable career that deserves a respectable pay</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: I know this doesn't directly explain the OP's question, but if you read the blog post it does a good job explaining some of the history and why America should change it's ways. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This will, of course, get lost or downvoted to oblivion.</p>
<p>I'll put the TL;DR first...</p>
<p>TL;DR The tipping system creates higher potential wages, lower operating costs and a less expensive dine in experience for customers.</p>
<p>On average in my business my tipped employees make 19% off of my gross sales. That's one hell of a lot better than what I make off of it. And, I'm the one shouldering all the risk. I work the most, work the hardest and went years without income to build it.  Even if the business is losing money, the tipped employees still make a percentage of gross sales.</p>
<p>So, the plebe assumption seems to center on &quot;Those cheap owners, why do I have to pay their staffs wages?&quot;. Not only does the customer have to pay the wages, they have to pay the rent, utilities, food costs, insurance, trash pick up, water ect. If customers do not pay at least 100% of the costs of a business to operate that business closes.</p>
<p>The next plebe argument is &quot;Just raise menu prices to cover tips so I don't have to feel bad about not tipping&quot;. And here is where they've really gone off course because that would actually cost customers MORE money than the current tipping culture/system.</p>
<p>The assumption is that I can just raise my prices 19% (to cover the tip rate) and eliminate tipping and servers/bartenders can make the same amount of money. Here is why that is wrong.</p>
<p>1) Sales Tax: There is no sales tax on tips. But, if tips were rolled into the menu price the cost of the meal not only went up by 19%, sales tax also went up 19%. The cost of the meal is now 21% higher.</p>
<p>2) Insurance premiums: The premiums of the various types of insurance a restaurant/bar must carry (with the exception of insuring the property itself since that's based on its appraised value) are based on gross sales. Assuming that at the higher price, total volume remains the same (which it won't but I'll get to that) gross sales increase so insurance premiums increase. That cost must also be added to the cost of the meal (increasing the menu price and the total sales tax paid again)</p>
<p>3) Employer payroll taxes: This costs about 13% of payroll. The increase in payroll increases the amount of employer payroll tax (which increases the menu price and total sales tax paid again)</p>
<p>These are the big three. It is, therefor, cheaper for the customer to pay a lower menu price and tip.</p>
<p>Now lets talk about what happens at the higher price point.</p>
<p>Restaurant/Bar spending is highly elastic. What does that mean in economics?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If a small change in price is accompanied by a large change in quantity demanded, the product is said to be elastic (or responsive to price changes). Conversely, a product is inelastic if a large change in price is accompanied by a small amount of change in quantity demanded&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the higher price point, volume will decrease. You may achieve the same gross sales but the volume moved to get those sales is lower (less items sold at a higher price). This reduces the demand for labor. There will be less hours available to work.</p>
<p>At a higher price point, the size of the customer pool a restaurant/bar has to draw from will shrink. Tipping creates a sliding price scale for customers. One customer may pay less than another customer for the same meal because they tip less. Our average tip rate is 19%. Some customers tip 40%, some 20%, some tip 0%. A $10 meal costs customer A $10 and customer C $14. If you eliminate tipping and raise the price to $12, customer B will still come and probably still tip while customer A has been eliminated from your market. (decreasing volume and the need for labor)</p>
<p>Now lets talk about the employees specifically.</p>
<p>Tips are federally protected wages. I can't touch that money. It must go to the tipped employees. If I raised my prices and eliminated tipping, that money is now MINE to do with what I please. There are plenty of operators out there that would just slide some of that money into their pocket.</p>
<p>With regards to inflation: Because tipped employees make a percentage of their gross sales, a big chunk of their wages are directly tied to inflation. If my costs go up 3% and I have to raise my prices 3% they make 3% more in tips. Flat wages instead of tipping uncouples tipped employees wages from inflation. So, keep that in mind when you hear a server complain how they are making the same hourly wage they did 10 years ago, because they are not. Their tips have increased with inflation.</p>
<p>Then there is the issue of fair compensation between tipped employees. Tipped employees make a percentage of their sales volume. If tipped employees made flat wages instead, how many would be clamoring to work a Friday or Saturday night, deal with all that volume and stress when they can just work Monday and make the same amount of money? I'd rather be off on the weekends! Our lowest total hourly wage tipped employee averaged $16.13 an hour (tips + hourly) last year and our highest almost $30 an hour (tips + hourly) last year. But, the $30/hr employee worked the toughest shifts, handled more stress and offered more flexible hours (aside from just being a better employee period). The tipping system directly accounts for the difference in how much effort the two employees put in last year. How do you account for that in a flat wage system? And don't tell me I have to do additional hours of payroll acrobatics with fluctuating hourly payrates based on demand.</p>
<p>With the tipping system in place now, the highest value, most talented and hardest working employees are directly compensated by making a percentage of their higher gross sales and they are directly compensated for working the toughest, highest volume shifts.</p>
<p>TL;DR The tipping system creates higher potential wages, lower operating costs and a less expensive dine in experience for customers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>not sure if anyone has said this yet, but this gives some background on how the idea of gratuity arrived in America from Europe. this is an excerpt from something i wrote for my job. </p>
<p>According to the New York Times, the idea of tipping was conceived in 17th century Europe. During the late-1700s, private homeowner’s would open their homes to upper-class travelers, sort of like a snooty, prehistoric Air BnB. Following their stay, the guests of these private homes would leave money for the host’s servants, thus inventing the idea of leaving monetary compensation for being waited on. So, what started as something that only rich people did, soon spread to other classes of European society. Here’s a fun fact: according to the same New York Times article, the term ‘Tip’ is actually an acronym that stands for “to insure promptitude.” So, back in the day, if you wanted your tea and biscuits ASAP, you’d slip a nickel in your waiter’s knickers to insure the promptitude.
So how did Europe’s strange practice of insuring promptitude make it to to America? War. In the late-1800’s, following the Civil War, wealthy American’s began vacationing in Europe and, in turn, picked up on the aristocratic practice. When they returned home, they brought tipping with them in order to show off how high class they were. Unsurprisingly, not everyone was stoked about handing over more of their hard-earned cash. So, tipping came along and a lot of Americans weren’t feeling it. They thought it promoted classism and aristocratic ideals, something they had just freed themselves from. In fact, an 1897 New York Times article compared the spread of tipping to the spread of ‘evil insects and weeds.’ The fear, was that the incentive of tipping would lead to waiters and waitresses going to extreme lengths to appease customers. By 1904, the Anti-Tipping Society of America was founded. Their mission? No tipping for one whole year. Anti-tipping sentiment grew and grew until Washington state became the first of six states to make tipping outright illegal. But, as is turns out, the psychological effect of not tipping turned a lot of people into walking piles of shame aka the laws weren’t followed, they were rarely enforced and almost never held up in court. Once 1926 roared its way in, anti-tipping laws were extinct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
