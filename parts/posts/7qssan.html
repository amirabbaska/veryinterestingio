		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the skin around joints stretches and contracts a lot more than all the other skin, so there is more skin there, and the short end of the joint will be compressed, causing the skin to rub against itself.</p>
<p>So it's a combination of having more skin that can flake, and more rubbing to cause the flakes.</p>
<p>Also calluses make this even worse, because calluses are just really thick dead skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The skin is made up of several layers, some of which have a distinctive refractive index. In thin skin (ie. most skin, aside from soles of feet and palms of hands) the layers are fairly similar in terms of refractive index so skin colour in these regions are fairly consistent in terms of colour and appearance over the entire body (except the thick skin regions I've named just prior on the hands and feet, and the very thin skin regions on the lips).</p>
<p>It could be that in regions of the body more exposed to mechanical stress (knees, elbows, soles of feet, palms of hands) the skin is more readily damaged and so it shares characteristics, and hence appearance with the thick skin regions mentioned earlier for the purpose of protection against injury (this is very apparent in people with dark skin, where thick skin regions are markedly paler/ashier looking compared to the rest of the body). In fact, thick skin has an additional layer of skin cells near the surface with a different refractive index than the rest of the skin cell layers that you would find in other places on the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
