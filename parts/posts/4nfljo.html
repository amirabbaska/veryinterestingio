		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normally when you invest on the stock market, you can invest in single stocks of specific companies. However this can be quite risky and will consume a lot of your time to manage your investments.</p>
<p>You could hire an investment manager to do this work for you but this is costly and isn´t really feasible for the majority of private investors.</p>
<p>Investment funds are basically a collection of managed stocks and assets that you can invest in as a whole. In essence you and many others share a common investment manager (represented by the fund) who manages a diverse portfolio of stocks and assets for you.</p>
<p>This way you gain access to risk management, diversification and economies of scale you would never have access to as an individual investor.</p>
<p>Hedge funds are special cases of investment funds, instead of being open to the public with many smaller investors, it´s basically a private group of investors.</p>
<p>So hedge funds like normal funds invest in stocks and assets (like buying and selling other companies) to grow capital. Unlike normal funds their capital does not come from issuing out &quot;shares&quot; to many smaller private investors but from a small host of private investors.</p>
<p>For example, imagine five rich guys each investing $1M into a hedge fund, that hedge fund now has a capital of $5M which it will invest in diverse assets to try and grow the capital.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>To add, because it has been pointed out several times (and quite rightly) another defining feature of a hedge fund is that they are less regulated. As hedge funds are not publicly traded they are subject to few regulations and can use a wider variety of financial instruments that mutual funds cannot (e.g. shorting).</p>
<p>Edit2:</p>
<p>Because it is a FAQ, hedge funds are not mutual funds. Unlike mutual funds (as they are commonly understood, it's bit a legal term) hedge funds are not publicly traded and are subject to less regulations (e.g. what type of assets they can actually invest in).</p>
<p>Broadly speaking hedge funds are a special type of mutual funds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been a partner in a hedge fund for almost 20 years. A hedge fund is very similar to a mutual fund except, as others noted, its closed to the public.  There are less regulations on hedge funds so investors have to be &quot;educated&quot; and rich so they don't lose their life savings.  Also hedge funds aren't allowed to advertise at all for this same reason.  The attraction of a hedge fund vs a mutual fund is that you are paying for smarter people and better returns supposedly.  Before 2008 our fees were 2% and 20%.  Which means that we charge you 2% on your investment regardless of performance and get 20% of any profits.  Those days are over and the hedge fund industry is shrinking fast.  People are realizing that overall performance has been similar to mutual funds that are a fraction of the cost to the investor.  ps &quot;Hedge&quot; is just a term that caught on...most funds don't hedge any of their positions because there is no &quot;alpha&quot; in that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A hedge fund is similar to a private equity fund or mutual fund in the sense they are all money managers, but generally there are 4 main differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hedge Funds are more speculative (riskier investments) to generate high returns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hedge Fund are not necessarily limited to public markets or any specific asset class. In fact, their investment strategies may be purposefully vague.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their investment term is relatively short (&lt; 1 year), including some that may make investments for just a few seconds (like arbitrage opportunities)</p>
</li>
<li>Investors in hedge funds are generally restricted to high net worth individuals or institutions</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no real textbook definition, so these are all generalities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tried to make a dumbed down version since some of these answers are a bit convoluted- </p>
<p>Hedge fund where you give money to a person (or team of people) and they will invest it in all sorts of different shit for you. The &quot;fund&quot; is just the group of all the people's (like you) money combined basically</p>
<p>A mutual fund is essentially the same thing. </p>
<p>The difference between them, is that hedge funds are mainly for rich people because they are less regulated and have more freedom in how they can invest and what rules they can make up . But for that reason, the people who make the rules for investment industry don't let poor people invest in them cuz they'd probably get fucked over from having no clue about what's happening (even the rich people probably have little clue what's going on but at least they are not gonna be homeless if the hedge fund loses all their money) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK Let's ELI5 this whole thing.</p>
<p>Suppose your mom lets you keep all the change she gets when you both go shopping for groceries. You grab all your coins and as a bubbly 5-year-old would do, keep them on a piggy bank.</p>
<p>Now one day at school you come across Joey, who's a couple years older than you and you talk to him about the toys you wanna buy and how you're gathering fortunes in your piggy.</p>
<p>Joey then goes like: &quot;Hey, since you got so much money in your piggy, why not let me lend it to other kids for a while so I can make more money for you and you can buy more toys?&quot;</p>
<p>You think about it for a bit, almost 5 seconds, and concludes that an absolutely genious idea. More toys are always better than less toys, right? </p>
<p>Alright. So there's some caveats to this. Joey obviously won't do this for free, and will take a few of your coins in exchange for his &quot;service&quot; every month. Also, if Joey manages to make too much money for you, he gets to keep some of it to buy his own toys.</p>
<p>(As you can see, Joey's got very attractive, upside-only risk exposure.)</p>
<p>Anyways, the school rules regulate how kids can lend their money to each other, and Joey's got a special certificate which allows him to lend it to bold kids with bold ideas which might not work at all, but if they do, there will be an avalanche of coins (high-risk assets).<br />
It also allows him to pull off very complicated lending structures, like signing an agreement to buy Dorito's for 10 coins from Mary in 12 months, then selling that agreement to someone else (structured derivative products).</p>
<p>Other kids can't do those things. Joey, however, cannot advertise his services on the school's news board.</p>
<p>You probably don't know all of this, but you probably should, since your piggy is so important to you and you really want your toys real bad.</p>
<p>After talking to your mom, and after she explains all these things to you, you realize there's a chance you might lose all your coins, specially since you don't recall Joey explaining any of those things to you. You then decide to keep them stored safely in you piggy and go back to gathering change, and live happily ever after!</p>
<p>That's a hedge fund.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
