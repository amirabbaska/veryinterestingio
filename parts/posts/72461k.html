I know the reason for the universe being bigger than 28 billion light years (or so) is because space can expand faster than the speed of light, but how exactly can we measure that the observable universe has a radius of 46.1 billion light years, when we shouldn't be able to see that far?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, while its true that the furthest object is 13.3 billion light years away, we can actually see stuff 13.8 billion light years away. This &quot;stuff&quot; is the beginning of the universe, back when everything was just one giant hot soup of matter and energy, rather than distinct objects.</p>
<p>Second, when we say we see something &quot;x billion light years away&quot; what we really mean is that we are seeing light from something x billion years ago. This is relevant, because it means that the thing we see is not happening in &quot;real time&quot;. So, its location in space that we see it right now is, say, 13.3 billion light years away from us, but that was (roughly) 13.3 billion years ago. In that time, the empty space between us and that galaxy has expanded, meaning if you could send an instantaneous probe to wherever that galaxy was now, it would have to travel much further than 13.3 billion light years to reach it. </p>
<p>We just get the number 92 billion light years by assuming the universe expands at a constant rate, and calculating how far away the edge of the observable universe is today (instead of back in time when we see it). </p>
<p>Also, the universe is <em>at least</em> 92 billion light years. It could definitely be bigger, but 92 billion is just the largest we have a reference point to calculate from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine someone (Alice) standing 14 meters away. They roll a ball toward you at 1m/s. It takes 14 seconds to reach you. That would be light in a universe that isn't expanding. Alice was 14 m away when they rolled the ball, it took 14 sec to reach you, and they're 14 m away now.</p>
<p>Now imagine next to that person, a second person, Bob, standing on an infinite treadmill moving away from you. Bob also rolls a ball toward you. Imagine both balls reach you at the same time. The first thing you'll now is that Bob must have been closer to you than 14 m because his ball has been moved backward by the treadmill. (Remember that all balls (light) move at basically the same speed) So we can figure out that light we see from 13.8 gya (giga years ago) was actually emitted by objects closer than 13.8 billion light years away.</p>
<p>However, Bob is also on the treadmill. On an arbitrary treadmill where different regions move at different stores, it would be possible that Bob is still less than 14 m away. For example if the area near us were moving faster.  However, our treadmill (i.e. universe) is actually moving faster the farther away it is. We can calculate therefore that Bob is now actually about 47 m away.</p>
<p>So, the way we can know about objects 47 billion light years away is that they were much closer to us when they emitted the photons we're seeing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
