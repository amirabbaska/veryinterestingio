		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Archimedes knew the volumes of cylinders and cones. He then argued that the volume of a cylinder of height <em>r</em> and base radius <em>r</em>, minus the volume of a cone of height <em>r</em> and base radius <em>r</em>, equals the volume of a half-sphere of radius <em>r</em>. [See below for the argument.] From this, our modern formula for the volume of the half-sphere follows:  <em>r</em> * <em>r^(2) π - 1/3</em> * <em>r</em> * <em>r^(2) π</em> = <em>2/3</em> * <em>π</em> * <em>r^(3)</em> and by doubling this you get the volume of a sphere.</p>
<p>Now, the core of his argument goes like this: consider a solid cylinder of base radius <em>r</em> and height <em>r</em>, sitting on a horizontal plane. Inside of it, carve out a cone of height <em>r</em> and base radius <em>r</em>, but in such a fashion that the base of the carved-out cone is at the top, and the tip of the carved-out cone is at the center of the cylinder's bottom base. This object we will now compare to a half-sphere of radius <em>r</em>, sitting with its base circle on the same horizontal plane. [See <a href="https://blogs.adelaide.edu.au/maths-learning/2014/07/24/archimedess-integrals/" target="_blank">here</a> for pictures of the situation.]</p>
<p>The two objects have the same volume, because at height <em>y</em> they have the same horizontal cross-sectional area: the first object has cross-sectional area <em>r^(2) π - y^(2) π</em> (the first term from the cylinder, the second from the carved-out cone), while the half-sphere has cross-sectional area <em>(r^(2)-y^(2))π</em> (using the Pythagorean theorem to figure out the radius of the cross-sectional circle).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Cavalieri's Principle</p>
<p>Slightly longer answer: You can find the volume of a sphere inscribed in a cone and cylinder using some pretty basic geometry. I won't go into all of the details because it's outlined perfectly on the Wikipedia page for Cavalieri's Principle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cavalieri's_principle" target="_blank">here</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An essential point has been left out here. he already knew the volume of a sphere. The Rhind Math papyrus, ca 1600 BC, translated in the 19th C. at the British museum has been known for some time.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhind_Mathematical_Papyrus" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhind_Mathematical_Papyrus</a></p>
<p>As far as Pi was concerned the Egyptians knew that to at least 3-4 decimal places tho they used integral fractions to express it. They used 4 (8/9 sq.) as a computational approximation, giving about 3.16... for pi. And so did the Greeks!!!</p>
<p>If the ancients knew this answer, so did Archimedes. So he was arguing and creating an answer which he already knew. Knowing the answer already is highly influential upon one's methods.</p>
<p>That fact must also be considered very seriously in this case.</p>
<p>the values which could NOT be exactly computed without the calculus are the cross sections, volumes of parabolas  and conic sections. That's the real addition to math which Archimedes' palimpsest has shown, as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Palimpsest" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Palimpsest</a></p>
<p>These are important points to consider, as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the question about the sphere has been answered, it is also worth noting that Archimedes was also able to a find the area between a parabola and any intersecting line (not just horizontal). </p>

<p>The article is the second proof. I find the first proof through the method of levers also very interesting. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few things: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Archimedes, like all the other Greeks, did not know the concept of infinity, or number like we do today. For the greeks numbers were always &quot;lengths&quot; of a side and 2*3 for example would be the area (which is why they also never went above 3 dimensions). The greeks could only calculate what was real, what existed and what they could see. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Archimedes can not have used limit in the modern sense, because limits require the usage of infinity. The greeks already had problems accepting and understanding irrational numbers , anything resembling &quot;infinite&quot; would have seemed foreign to them. </p>
</li>
<li>They also didnt have the concept of the number 0 - so comparing Archimedes to Riemann sums is very lacking, since Riemann sums depend heavily on the difference becoming 0 - while greeks are generally lauded as excellent real geometers, our modern functional mathematics originates in India (where we find the oldest abstract notions of 0 , variables etc.) </li>
