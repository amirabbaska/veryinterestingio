		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are methods that can be used to approximate roots and logarithms using pen and paper. Calculators also use such approximation techniques, but can perform them much more rapidly, so they can produce much better results.</p>
<p>For square roots, the oldest known approximation method is the Babylonian method. This method works by taking, for the square root of an input value S, an initial guess, x0, for the solution (perhaps the nearest integer root, but any guess works). You then compute the average of x0 and S / x0:</p>
<p>(x0 + S / x0) / 2</p>
<p>This value you call x1 and you repeat the process with x1 instead of x0. This can be iterated until the desired accuracy is reached, as the estimate comes closer to the actual solution with every iteration.</p>
<p>Approximation methods for logarithms are a bit more complex, but follow the same pattern of iterating a set of simple operations until the approximation reaches the desired level of accuracy.</p>
<p>Note that in the past, people working with logarithms often used so-called logarithm tables, large tables containing many precalculated logarithm values.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you know how to check if something is the right answer, you can usually get to it by trial and error.</p>
<p>/u/Rannasha has already covered this but I'll make more of a worked example, calculating sqrt(7). First, guess a number, in principle this will work with any number, so why not just use 1?</p>
<p>x1 = 1</p>
<p>7/1 = 7</p>
<p>Now if this was the right answer, 7/x = x, because x^2 = 7 if x = sqrt(7), so we know it's not the right answer. We take the wrong answer and average it with our guess</p>
<p>average(1, 7/1)  = 8 / 2 = 4 = x2</p>
<p>7 / 4 = 1.75 (obviously you can get to this with long division which we'll skip here)</p>
<p>x3 = average(4, 1.75) = 2.875</p>
<p>7/875 = 2.43478..., average(2.875, 2.43478...) = 2.65489... = x4</p>
<p>7/2.65489 = 2.63664...., average = 2.64576... = x5</p>
<p>As you can see difference between each step gets smaller and smaller. Sqrt(7) is actually 2.6457513 so we were accurate to two decimal places with only 4 calculation steps, you just have to do a lot of long division, which is why people worked these out ahead of time and made books of the values for each possible answer (google &quot;log tables&quot;!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Immediately prior to electronic and mechanical calculators, slide rules (sliding vernier scales with site-lines. were used to calculate logs and natural logs. Trigonometric functions (<em>sin cos tan arcsin arccos arctan</em> etc) were first measured to develop tables.</p>
<p>I first learned the use of a slide rule in physics and mathematics in HS.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind this is <strong>not precise</strong> unless you memorize quite a few more digits than I did, but far better than nothing when without a calculator or other means.</p>
<p>The log (any base) of a number is the sum of its factors.
log xy= log x + log y</p>
<p>Memorize a few logs:</p>
<p>1/log e = 2.3 (multiply your final result by 2.3 to give the natural log as opposed to the base 10 logarithm)</p>
<p>log 1.1= 0.04</p>
<p>log 1.3= 0.11 (only use these if facing issues factoring and have to approximate)</p>
<p>log 2= 0.30</p>
<p>log 3= 0.48</p>
<p>log 5= 0.70 </p>
<p>log 7= 0.85</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>log 168= log 2 + log 2 + log 2 + log 3 + log 7</p>
<p>= 3 (0.3) + 0.48 + 0.85</p>
<p>= 2.23</p>
<p>It's actually 2.225. </p>
<p>I would typically only pay attention to the first few digits so:</p>
<p>log 46,523,466 = log (465 x 10^5)</p>
<p>= (log 465) + 5</p>
<p>= log 3 + log 5 + log 31 + 5</p>
<p>[I don't know log 31 but it looks a lot like 5 x 5 x 1.1 x 1.1 or even 10 x 3]</p>
<p>~ log 3 + log 5 + (2 log 5 + 2 log 1.1) + 5</p>
<p>~ 0.48 + 3 x 0.70 + 2 x 0.04 + 5</p>
<p>~ 7.66</p>
<p>It's actually 7.68, so the somewhat obvious lesson is that you can get a pretty accurate result without going too deep but if precision is key you'll need to memorize a lot more than what I have here. Either approximation for 31 gives the same answer anyway.</p>
<p>I wouldn't rely on it primarily for tests but I had professors who let it slide since I at least showed I knew what I was doing and made an attempt. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
