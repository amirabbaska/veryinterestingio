		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do, in terms of the actual shape, but they're not stupid or flexible enough to pull it tight, so they just unravel themselves. Snakes aren't string, they have a spine and ribcage to consider and have limited flexibility. Any knot they manage to tie in themselves is loose and easily slithered out of.</p>
<p>Source: had a snake for a few years, fascinating to watch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To make a knot in rope the ends have to move in opposite directions in order to secure the knot. With a snake, both ends are moving in the same direction similar the the motion you use to untie a knot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My cornsnake got in a knot once. I had just fed him, and I did something else, came back ten minutes later, and he's in a knot holding the mouse in his mouth, not wanting to let go, still trying to eat it. If he would have just dropped the mouse he'd be fine. Had to untangle him for him.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
