		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are various places in physics where the idea of multiple universes arise, for a bit different reasons. I'll write a bit about two of the main ones. </p>
<p>First, lets talk about the one coming from an interpretation of quantum mechanics, which roughly says that every time a quantum measurement is performed, the universe &quot;splits&quot; into multiple branches, where each branch has its own result of the measurement. This is called the many world interpretation, for obvious reasons. That somebody came up with this comes from how the math of quantum mechanics looks like: the state of a system is described by a wave function. The wave function &quot;spreads out&quot; over different classical values, and normally we think of this as giving probabilities of the various possible outcomes. When we then take a measurement, we see just one of the values, and the wave function &quot;collapses&quot; to the value we found. But the many world interpretation says that the wave function is actually real; so all the different outcomes actually all happen, they just happen in different &quot;branches&quot; that doesn't talk to each other. Then there is no collapse. So in a way this comes out of taking the math of QM very seriously. </p>
<p>The other version of multiple universes comes from cosmology (the study of the very early universe). The common model believed today is that of inflation, which roughly means that the universe underwent a very rapid expansion closely after the big bang. This seems required to explain various observed features. Then some people observed that it is natural for this inflation to actually go on forever, something that is called eternal inflation. In this model, the rapid expansion only randomly stops in small &quot;bubbles&quot;, that because of quantum fluctuations &quot;freeze out&quot; of the surrounding inflating universe. Each such bubble becomes its own universe, and the randomness of the freezing should give each new bubble some new random laws of physics. This also ties in with the anthropic principle, which is an attempt to explain why the universe looks the way it looks. The logic of this goes that of course the universe has to look this way and be such that it supports human life, since if it was any other way we wouldn't be here to ask the question. This combined with a multiverse is a possible answer for why the laws of physics look the way the do and so on. Of course many (probably most) physicists are not satisfied with this &quot;answer&quot;. Some people also use the anthropic principle to argue for a multiverse without pointing to any particular physics model. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: Its the result of a thought experiment in regards to the dimensional nature of reality - completely untestable and purely philosophical at this point in time.</p>
<p>I believe the original argument arises while examining the measurable dimensions of the universe... Each new dimension you add to your viewpoint takes the entirety of the dimension(s) below it to create a singular &quot;unit&quot; in the next dimension. For example - You need two points (0-dimensional) in order to determine 'length' (1-dimensional), and you need 2 length measurements to determine the 'area' (2-dimensional), etc.</p>
<p>If we look at time as a linear measurement, akin to length, you can break our existence down to a series of 3-dimensional 'moments' in a 4-dimensional space-time. (Much like how a CT scan creates 2-dimensional slices or 'moments' of a 3-dimensional object.)</p>
<p>With this in mind, we can take it a step further and add another dimension. In order to do this, we have to take the entirety of the lower dimensions (all moments of time in a 3-dimensional space) as a single unit in the next dimension. That leaves us with the entire lifespan of our universe as a single unit.</p>
<p>As we continue to add dimensions, we find ourselves having to add entire lifespans of an infinite number of universes together, and thus the multiverse hypothesis was born.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics? If so it's one of a few interpretations of what's going on behind the physics of quantum mechanics. </p>
<p>Short version:
Some aspects of quantum mechanics appear to be non-deterministic. Basically every cause does not have a single possible effect and no matter how much information we know about something we can't predict the possible outcomes. Radioactive decay is one such example. By all appearances when an atom undergoes radioactive decay is random. We can talk about it in terms of statistics (after this much time this many atoms in a sample this big will have decayed), but we can't look at an individual atom and go &quot;this will decay in exactly 0.05 seconds&quot; </p>
<p>This is not something we really like. That's not to say there's some particular reason why it isn't actually non-deterministic and the prefered interpretation of QM is based on the fact that yes these events are actually non-deterministic, but for a lot of people there's a what amounts to an emotional distaste for it. </p>
<p>The many worlds interpretation gets around this by saying that that appearance of non-determinism is subjective. Every single possible outcome of an event happens and defines it's own separate &quot;history&quot; or world. Which means that the universe (or multiverse) is a superposition of every possible quantum state it could be in, all existing separately and independently.  </p>
<p>Is it true....well we don't know. It's a mathematically consistent theory and it produces the result we'd expect from QM quite well. However this is also true for the De Broglie–Bohm interpretation. And the Copenhagen interpretation. And quite a few other interpretations. They all work, and none of them thus far make a false predictions, or make a true prediction that the other theories don't. Which a person prefers right now is...fairly philosophical. </p>
<p>Copenhagen gives up determinism and partially gives up locality (basically an object can only be influenced by it's immediate surroundings. With General relativity that means an effect can't happen faster than the speed of light allows), but it preserves a consistent and single timeline. The many worlds interpretation gives up the single timeline but keeps determinism and locality. the De Broglie–Bohm interpretation gives up locality completely but preserves determinism and the single timeline. Which interpretation you prefer depends on which major principle backing our understanding of the universe you're willing to give up. Also for right now it doesn't matter because the math all works out regardless of what you like best. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The earliest examples I could find are from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism" target="_blank">Plato</a>, the Hindu <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puranas" target="_blank">Puranas</a>, and <a href="http://www.wollamshram.ca/1001/Vol_5/tale132.htm" target="_blank">The Adventures of Bulukiya</a> from <em>One Thousand and One Nights</em>. The earliest recorded reference to the multiverse in the scientific community was in Dublin in 1952, during a lecture given by Erwin Schrödinger.</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse#Classification_schemes" target="_blank">several types</a> of hypothetical alternate universes. There's far too many to go into here, but basically the idea is that ours is not the only universe. There are other universes that run &quot;parallel&quot; to our own. Some of these are very similar. Others are vastly different. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Hugh Everett III (November 11, 1930 – July 19, 1982) was an American physicist who first proposed the many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum physics, which he termed his &quot;relative state&quot; formulation.</p>
<p>This guy had a lot of math to back up his theory and only after his death did people take it seriously.  His son went on to rock fame in the EELS.</p>
