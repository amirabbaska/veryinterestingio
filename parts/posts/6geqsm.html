		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who's spent 4 years studying, researching and working clinically with eyeballs, here's my guess: </p>
<p>You're likely forcing your focusing system to focus through as much blur as it possibly can, assuming that while you &quot;blink enough&quot; you're concentrating your gaze, at a single object or direction. Both your cornea and your crystalline lens will change shape in order for you to be able to focus; younger people, especially kids, have a much greater dynamic range for focusing then do older folks, so if you're young, that's probably most of it. If you know you have terrible vision, meaning a high prescription in one and or both eyes, you definitely should not do this. In that case, you'll probably get headaches if you do it enough. Just use glasses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could be that blinking hard, your eyelids are pressing on your cornea enough to flatten them, essentially making your nearsightedness less. The effect lasts until you blink again, and your cornea resumes its usual shape and the clarity in your vision disappears.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is because you spread layer of sticky tears on your cornea.  It just happens to be concave at the right spot ( assuming you are myopic ). </p>
<p>Usually this layer is convex and just worsen the vision. I sometimes have flush my eyes to restore precise vision. I do not understand why the liquid is sometimes stickier causing these problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because when you blink you momentarily relax your eyes in darkness. During relaxation the eyes are no longer under strain or stress and go back to the shape they are supposed to be, thus proper vision returns.</p>
<p>People get so used to straining their eyes that their vision decreases over time from constant stress. You can actually return your vision closer or all the way back to 20/20 if you do the proper exercises daily. When I got my license I failed the eye tests and was required to wear glasses to drive. I practiced relaxing my eyes and doing exercises and when getting my new license I passed the test and no longer need glasses to drive.</p>
