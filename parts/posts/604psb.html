		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Memory may not be <em>completely</em> understood but the basic understanding of it is there. Essentially, memory is just associations between neurons firing at the same time. </p>
<p>The saying in neurology is &quot;Neurons that fire together, wire together.&quot; What this means is let's say you smell smoke and hear someone says &quot;I smell the campfire&quot; and your eyes take in the imagine of a campfire. <strong>The following neurons are firing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The neurons in your olfactory part of your brain that register the smoke smell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optical neurons recognizing the visual pattern of a roaring fire</p>
</li>
<li>Neurons in the temporal lobes that heard the vocal words &quot;<em>I smell campfire&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Those three sets of neurons all fired at the same time and now have a faint connection with each other. Now if just one of them fires (e.g. You smell smoke) it will trigger the other two sets of neurons and you'll think the word <em>campfire</em> and get the mental image of it.</p>
<p>Repeated exposures help build stronger and stronger connections and make the &quot;memory&quot; more concrete. If someone always says &quot;<em>Hello, my name is Bob!&quot;</em> every time you see their face, you're going to very quickly associate their name with their face. Everything you know as memory is just associations between neurons that wired together because they fired together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neurons, the cells that make up your brain, have an input and an output. The input is the output from other neurons. They're all interconnected, and that creates a huge network! Inputs and outputs are electrical signals: there either <em>is</em> a signal, or there <em>isn't</em>. If a neuron receives an input of 1, meaning the connected neuron <em>fired</em>, then this neuron might also fire. But that depends on the chemical composition of the neuron. This is really complex. If the chemical composition inside a neuron requires a lot of connected neurons to fire before it fires, it has a high threshold. When it only requires one or a few neurons to fire, it has a low threshold. This chemical composition can change, thus altering the neuron's threshold. This is how memories are made! When a memory is created, some neurons will have their thresholds lower, and some will have their thresholds higher. Let's say you see the color blue. Photo (light) receptors in your retina fire when they come into contact with blue light. At the same time, neurons in your ear hear the word &quot;blue.&quot; An association can form over time between the color perceived and the word heard by altering the chemical compositions of neurons!</p>
<p>This is obviously an extreme simplification of how the brain works (it is extremely complicated, and I don't know nearly enough to do this question justice), and the other comments are right: how memories are made and stored is still an active area of research, but we know this is how it works on a chemical level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is that we do not know. The study of the human brain and how it actually works is in its infancy, we honestly do not know very much about it.</p>
<p>That is why we cannot even definitively say why we need to sleep. We know the brain needs it. We have theories that sleep has to do with storing and processing memories, but on a physical level we cannot even tell you why you need to sleep. </p>
<p>The answer to what memories are, and how they work is something we are not going to have an answer to for awhile. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, memory is made up of connections between different parts of the brain.</p>
<p>I don't remember the specific term, but there's a phenomenon in psychology that, when a memory is recalled, the &quot;strength&quot; of the connections that make it up increases. This is the basis for learning things, the more you think about it, the stronger the memory becomes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
