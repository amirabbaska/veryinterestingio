These cells are not neurons and therefore divide like other body cells.   </p>
<p>There can also be secondary tumours which arise elsewhere e.g. lymphomas and metastasize to the brain.</p>
<p>Primary neuronal tumours (neuromas) can also occur but usually involve peripheral nerves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What everyone else said is true. But brain cancer <em>can</em> actually be caused by cancerous neurons as well. This is how:</p>
<p>1) All cells in your body contain the same DNA (except for reproductive cells in your gonads, e.g. sperm or eggs, which each have only a randomly selected half of your DNA).  </p>
<p>2) Cancer is caused by a mutation in the DNA of a cell, more specifically, the mutation is in a region of the DNA which is responsible for encoding how the cell is supposed to replicate. </p>
<p>3) Therefore, if a neuron's DNA gets mutated (e.g. possibly by flying particles from a nearby radioactive object), and if that mutation is in the replication-related region of the DNA, it would be possible for that neuron to start replicating even though it was previously programmed to not replicate. This has been illustrated in a 2012 scientific study which found that by putting the proper gene into a neuron (i.e. simulating what could happen by random chance from a mutation), the neuron can revert back to a replication-capable state, and cause cancer.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neurogenesis (production of new neurons) still happens in the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus. </p>
<p>Also, cancer arises from mutations. A mutated cell that doesn't get suppressed by your tumor suppression genes is free to do as that mutation dictates. </p>
<p>Also, cancer can start somewhere in the body can migrate. </p>
<p>The problem with this question is that each cancer type is different due to the specific mutation that takes place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, there are more than just neurons in your brain. Besides neurons are types of cells classified as “glia”. The names aren’t particularly important but they are astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. These cells perform a wide varietiey of processes in the brain, including metabolic support, fighting infections and inflammation, generating myelin, etc. Almost like the secretary to a boss, glia help the neurons function to the best of their ability. These glial cells routinely divide, and as such can develop into cancer if they obtain mutations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
