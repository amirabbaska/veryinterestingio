		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light: Nobody knows. Its a fundamental limit of the universe. When we say &quot;the speed of light&quot; we're referencing light moving through free space or a &quot;vacuum.&quot;</p>
<p>As for sound: The speed of sound has to do with the material that sound is moving through. Sound is made up of waves that propagate (move) through a medium (material). Basically the waves are areas of high energy and low energy, like the crest and trough of an ocean wave. In free space, sound can't exist. The speed of sound in a material is determined by how heavy the the particles of the material are and how dense or closely packed those particles are. For the fastest speed of sound you'd want a really dense material with low particle mass. For the slowest speed of sound you'd want a material with very heavy particles that are not closely packed.</p>
<p>This pattern is because the energy of the particles has to be transmitted through physical contact between the particles. They &quot;push&quot; eachother in the direction the sound is traveling. A heavy particle is hard to push because of inertia so it moves slower, a light particle moves easily. Highly packed particles transfer energy faster because there's less space between them to travel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order for any wave to propagate through a medium, that medium has to have some relaxed position, that it wants to return to (equilibrium). </p>
<p>How much the medium wants to return to equilibrium, and how fast it wants to return to equilibrium are what determine wave speed. </p>
<p>For sound, as it is a physical wave, the speed is determined by spring and damping attributes of a material. A soft sponge will have sound traverse slower than a hard steel cube. </p>
<p>It has been observed that in a vacuum, there is a resistance to a change in magnetic field. It was also observed that in a vacuum there is a resistance to changes in the electric field. It was originally believed that these resistances were associated with a medium known as the 'ether', but none has been discovered so far. However, combining the two resistances with induction formulas (also derived from observation), it was determined the speed of the wave solution is c (speed of light). Initially the hypothesis made was that light was this exact wave solution. I don't know off hand, but I'm sure very many experiments have attempted to test this hypothesis, and so far everything agrees. </p>
<p>So at the end of the day, the speeds are what they are based on the nature of the medium (it's just that it appears that light can travel through a vacuum...and that the vacuum possesses certain properties). </p>
<p>Of course, in the light situation, it is not known if the resistances are the cause or the effect of the speed of light... It was observed that the speed of light stays constant regardless of reference frame. The only mathematical solution to keep physics consistent for all observers (since everyone has to agree on exact events), are the Special and General Theories of Relativity. </p>
<p>If you lay out the math for the special theory of relativity, which describes exactly how certain aspects of our local space dilate (time/length/mass), it becomes evident that some aspect of reality scales down actual speed (0-&gt;infinity) to observed speed (0-&gt;c). In that respect, c isn't just the speed of light that everything is clamped to...it's more that c is the upper scale limit, and anything without inertia (such as a photon), will instantly 'accelerate' to 'infinity' (observed to be c). </p>

<p>For there to be a set of laws for electromagnetism that can work in all inertial frames of reference (which it would be since magnets don't change by simply being thrown), there needs to be a finite and specific speed limit. That limit describes the speed at which electromagnetic waves propagate through the universe which includes light. Gravitational waves and other massless particles also travel at the speed of light. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light is more or less the speed of causality in the universe, and the rate at which it can understand, decode, and change due to spreading of information. </p>
<p>It's not that light only &quot;travels&quot; at the &quot;speed&quot; (in MPH) of light, but, more so that light is limited by the universes fundamental understanding of itself, for lack of a better synopsis. Photons are a timeless particles, they do not experience time in the conventional sense that we do. When a photon is emitted, from it's frame of reference, the distance it is travelling, be it 2 feet or 2 billion light years, is done instantaneously. There is no time between being at point A and point B when measured from the photons reference frame. However, as an outside observer we measure this speed at 299,792,458 meters per second (in a vacuum). </p>
<p>Due to special relativity and time dilation, the closer you travel to the speed of light the slower your reference frame clock ticks. It's a  bit of a pickle to try and explain without using all sort of weird words and quoting theorem and formulae. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light moves at the speed it does because it is the rate at which changing electric and magnetic fields induce magnetic and electric fields, respectively. What's really interesting about light is that, since it's based on fields and doesn't have to move through a medium, like other waves, it's speed is constant for everyone. This means that, if you watch someone riding by in a relativistic train (with a laser pointer), their clock must be moving slower. This leads to all sorts of strange effects and means that the speed of light is the maximum speed at which a causal connection can be possible. We can say now that light can't be faster because relativity demands it.</p>
<p>Light is massless. It carries energy, but it doesn't have mass in the classical sense of the word (Perhaps it's a little more exact to say it has no REST mass). The only way light can have momentum or energy, while still being massless, is if it moves at this maximum speed of causal relationships, or causality (physicists just call this &quot;c&quot;). This arises out of the relativistic definition of energy- a body's energy approaches an infinite scale of its mass as its relative speed approaches c. For a massless body, this energy is zero unless the speed IS c.</p>
<p>As for why the speed of light is the actual NUMBER it is... That's simply because of the values of  fundamental constants of the universe. These are arbitrary (in a sense), so c too is essentially arbitrary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
