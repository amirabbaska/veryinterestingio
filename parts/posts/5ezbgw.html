<p>It would be more technically accurate, though less cool, to call it a steamout. ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you're not actually getting combustion of rubber, your vaporizing what are essentially petroleum by products and polymers in the tire. For a bit of perspective the low end for rubber combustion is about 500F that's where you'll start potentially seeing the tire burn, most burn out temperatures like for instance the ones you see drag racers do before lining up will get the tires to around 200F, a formula one car's tire operating temperatures are generally around 100-120F.  The lost tread during a burn out ends up mostly being left on the pavement. It's actually quite difficult to get tires hot enough to burn with a car and usually takes a relatively long time to do along with doing some things that really arent so good for some of the other bits of your car. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a cool FYI, there are now colored smoke burnout wheels.  They add some chemicals to the rubber to make the different colors.  They're for show though, not really driving.  They're made out of soft rubber so it's easier to do a burnout and wear out really fast.  They also aren't cheap, in the video I linked a guy says they're $400 a pair.  Just google colored burnout tires and you'll find lots of videos and pics. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGUsOVQNsRQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGUsOVQNsRQ</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
