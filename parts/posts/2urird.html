		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a vaccinated person becomes infected with the live virus, can s/he still spread the disease while their immune system produces antibodies against it? In other words, if I got vaccinated for measles as a kid, and came in contact with my roommate who is sick with measles, while my body is killing off the live measles virus with antibodies, am I still spreading it around even though I show no symptoms?
EDIT: I don't know if my question is clear enough.... Are vaccinated people contagious if they encounter the real virus out in the world? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
