Or does the moon's location in the sky not provide enough information to be able to conclude that? What other data could be plugged into the equation so as to allow us to come to such a conclusion? Would the time of day and year help?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the answers here are saying that a photo of the Moon alone won't give you any information. That's not entirely true - you can still get some latitude information from the Moon's orientation and location in the sky:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At mid-to-high latitudes, the Moon will never pass directly overhead. Only the range of latitudes between -28 to 28 degrees latitude can ever have an overhead Moon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Closer to the horizon, the angle the Moon's features make with the horizon, you can easily tell if the picture was taken in the Northern or Southern Hemisphere. The lunar highlands (brighter white) generally appear towards the bottom of the Moon's disc in the Northern Hemisphere, and towards the top in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
</li>
<li>If you know the Moon's position in the sky, local time of day, and time of year, then you can get much more precise, to within 5 degrees of the exact latitude the picture was taken. For instance, the Full Moon at midnight on equinox will always be at its highest in the sky and within 5 degrees of zero declination. That means that 90 minus the number of degrees from horizon to the Moon will be within 5 degrees of the photographer's latitude (and you can use the Moon itself as a ruler, since it spans almost exactly half a degree).</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, it won't tell you the location from which the photo was taken. What you'd actually need would be an image of the stars in the night sky, but even that would only narrow it down to a latitude, unless you knew the UTC time the photo was taken.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is possible. Don Olson, a professor of astronomy at Texas State University has done a lot of this. Google him and you will find more several articles about the work he does. He uses the Sun, the Moon, and the stars I believe, to determine the date, time, and location of photographs and paintings. One that I can think of off the top of my head, he validated the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/08/14/story-behind--kiss-vj-day/31676791/" target="_blank">famous picture of a couple kissing on times square after Japan surrendered in WW2.</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The moon itself does not provide enough information.  However, if you had a wide angle shot showing the moon, a bunch of stars, and the horizon, it should be possible to work it out, especially knowing the time of day and year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of my professors in college would actually study the position of the moon in different historical paintings, and from that, determine the exact location, date and time the painting was created (or at least the scene the artist was depicting. Here's an article I found, just the school paper, but still interesting</p>
