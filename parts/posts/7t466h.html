<p>The reason is that while the tidal force scales linearly with the forcing body's mass, it also scales inversely as the distance <em>cubed</em>.</p>
<p>Let's scale our units so that the <strong>Tidal Force of the Moon on the Earth = 1</strong>. In those relative units, the rest of the planets' tidal forces on the Sun shake out as...</p>

<p>In other words, <strong>the largest tidal force on the Sun comes from Jupiter</strong> (with Venus a close runner-up), and <strong>it's 325,000x weaker than the tidal force exerted on the Earth by the Moon.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of them do. Rather than the sun and only the sun, physics actually shows that any two massive bodies orbit around their center of mass, called the barycenter. Also, especially massive objects like Jupiter sized planets and planets larger than Jupiter (dubbed &quot;Super-Jupiters&quot;) cause a bulge around their parent stars that in some cases can be used to indirectly observe new planets.</p>
<p>Taking Jupiter for example, it and the sun orbit an axis that actually lies <strong>just outside</strong> the sun's atmosphere. So yes, any object that exerts a gravitational force (that is, any object with mass) can cause &quot;tidal forces&quot; of sorts that may simply be immeasurably small and therefore negligible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is conceivably possible, but looking through the literature it doesn't really seem to be the case. There was a <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1900MNRAS..60..599B" target="_blank">proposal in 1900</a> that this could explain the sunspot cycle, but that turned out not to be the reason for them. The idea isn't totally ruled out, there's a recent paper on whether Jupiter and Saturn influence the sun's output <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364682612001034" target="_blank">here</a>, but I'm not sure how seriously this is taken.</p>
<p>There is more theoretical interest in tidal interactions between &quot;hot Jupiter&quot; exoplanets and their host stars, which are typically stronger than in our solar system because A. the planets are closer and the tidal force is inverse-cube, B. it's easier to detect planets that are bigger than Jupiter and C. it's easier to detect planets around smaller stars like red dwarfs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Withe the gravity effect being so small, how do they manage to measure such small perturbations at such huge distances (and the viewing platform moving in several ways)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;absolutely correct answer, technically&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, any object of mass in the universe exerts gravitational force on every other object of mass. Tidal forces are aeasure of the change in gravity, so anything in relative motion exerts tidal forces on each other.</p>
<p>So the technical answer is that most things in the universe, even you, exert tidal forces on just about everything else.</p>
<p>The useful answer?</p>
<p>Effectively no, the tidal forces are so small for most pairs of objects as to have no perceptible difference between them being there or not.</p>
<p>To give a noticeable difference, you need a few things.</p>
<p>The first is distance, tidal forces reduce by an inverse cube (1/n^3, where n is the distance) so even the sun, massive though it is, doesn't put much of a tidal force on Earth. The moon has a strong enough tidal force to affect our waters, but by a relatively tiny amount. This is possible due to its relative closeness to Earth. This isn't just that closer in there's a stronger force, but since we're measuring the difference in force between points A and B, closer in has a larger linear difference, if equal cubic difference.</p>
<p>The second is mass, tidal forces are, again, a measure of the change of gravity. So you need a fair amount of gravity in the first place to cause any significant tidal forces. The moon, for example, us a mass of about 7.2128Â x 10^23 kilograms. That's pretty damn big, an average human is on 7 X 10^1, the earth is more like 10^25.</p>
<p>The third is structure. The Earth effects tidal forces on the moon, way more than the moon does in the Earth. The reason you can't notice it as well is that the moon is largely rock, which resists the stresses caused by tidal force than water does. Hell, the moon's tidal forces are so weak that it can barely affect leaves on trees, it's only because these things can't resist the stress on it as well that you can even detect the difference. It takes a <em>very</em> precise measurement to find the difference</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
