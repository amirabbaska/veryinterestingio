		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, marijuana is not a drug itself. Marijuana is a plant that harbors a range of chemicals we call cannabinoids. We have identified more than 85 different cannabinoids.</p>
<p>Marijuana may either induce or alleviate anxiety.
Your brain already has cannabinoid-like compounds that it uses all the time. When marijuana is ingested, new mixes of cannabinoids are introduced and they can bind to differing receptor cells. Long story short, the anxiety-response of the brain is based on the initial biochemical conditions of the brain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our naturally occurring cannabinoids, anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) have effects much like 9-tetrahydorcanabinol (THC). Cannabinoids may cause increased or decreased anxiety levels. Anyone who has experienced feeling &quot;paranoid&quot; while smoking marijuana has felt the effect of increased anxiety, while others report feeling &quot;mellow.&quot; These disparate effects are also produced by our naturally occurring cannabinoids. AEA and 2-AG have been called &quot;promiscuous&quot; molecules, as they bind to CB receptors, but also bind to other types of receptors; locking-on to different receptors leads to different effects. In general, CB receptors mediate the &quot;calming effect&quot; of THC-like molecules. In contrast, anxiety increases when cannabinoids bind to other receptors. One example is a receptor called TRPV1. When either THC or naturally occurring AEA/2-AG bind to TRPV1, anxiety symptoms increase. These different effects of cannabinoids on the brain have complicated the study of marijuana and are responsible for the different effects from one person to another.</p>
<p>It has also been shown that our internal cannabinoids have different effects in different parts of the brain. In some areas of the brain, such as the periaqueductal gray matter, stimulating CB receptors leads to increased anxiety and depression. With increased use of medical marijuana in California, the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) has tracked increased rates of suicide, up 9% between 2010 and 2012. While we can't say for certain that marijuana makes people suicidal, there is an association between marijuana use and suicide that has been seen in other studies. In the past few years, hospitals in California have seen an increase in people treated for cannabis-induced psychosis, where individuals may report hearing voices, among other psychotic symptoms.</p>

<p>All in all, these chemicals are actually very poorly understood. The US federal government's Schedule 1 status for marijuana has severely handicapped, if not outright stalled, medical research into marijuana for decades.</p>
<p>As a marijuana user (Colorado, recreational), i would not recommend marijuana as a treatment for anxiety even though i have found it to be useful for my own anxiety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are <em>very</em> different drugs with utterly different modes of action. In the case of marijuana, which acts on the endogenous (body's own internal system of) cannabinoid receptors, people can experience changes in their thinking and perception which can lead to paranoia. </p>
<p>Amphetamines are <em>much</em> more pernicious, and paranoia tends to emerge as toxicity emerges with the rapidly increasing dosages needed to get high. In essence, amphetamines burn the candle at both ends, rev the engine into the redline, and... well... you break. Your brain is chemically overworked and depleted, your cardiovascular system will be stressed, and it causes a host of terrible effects including paranoia. </p>
<p>In fact, prolonged use of strong amphetamines can cause full psychotic breaks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines cause paranoia because of it's action on the noradrenaline receptors, which also fire off when you get something like an anxiety attack, think of it as a flight or fight reaction. They're also very active on dopamine receptors which cause a constant urge to redose because of how quickly they become depleted. This causes a lot of people to go a few days that can cause them to become psychotic (stimulant psychosis), and a lot of people will hallucinate seeing shadows and become paranoid because of the realness of the hallucinations.</p>
<p>Us stim users call them &quot;shadow people&quot;.</p>
<p>Am stoned though so I explained it like a 5 year old to a five year old</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With Marijuana much of it has to do with the simple fact that it's illegal in many places, but more than just being illegal it's socially frowned upon by many and that social pressure combined with the actual psychoactive effects of the drug can lead to a psychosomatic kind of paranoia that starts in a users subconscious. </p>
<p>There was a study a while back in which people who were told a drug could induce paranoia or people who came into the study with such a preconceived notion were much more likely to experience paranoia as a result when all they were given was aspirin. </p>
<p>I don't know about other drugs but when it comes to Marijuana there simply isn't evidence that paranoia is an actual side effect of the drug itself and not an emergent phenomena from cultural factors as many of us believe. In fact the evidence we do have seems to point to almost all of the negative side effects of Marijuana (Paranoia yes but also the fact that it does seem to cause a Psychotic episode in some very small number of users, mostly male and with a family history of psychosis) are related to a preexisting disposition in the user. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The paranoia from coke comes only after massive binges and frequent use. Cocaine leaves users both physically and mentally drained after long periods of heavy consumption:
Physically, it drastically increases your heart rate and overstimulates your central nervous system.
Mentally, cocaine depletes your brain of dopamine and can affect its ability to produce more in the future. </p>
<p>When you combine the above mental+physical stresses of coke with a lack of sleep and a history of many similar binges (without proper recovery time) -it can cause severe paranoid delusions in some users. Especially in users who already suffer from mental illnesses such as OCD or bipolar disorder. </p>
<p>The cocaine high itself, when enjoyed sparingly, has the opposite effect of everything I just described. It fills the user with confidence and empathy and joy, and is unlikely to leave any sort of lasting impact on a healthy user.
That being said, moderate users may still experience mild to moderate anxiety or depression during the crash that occurs when the high wears off. </p>
<p>I hope that answers your question :)</p>
<p>(I didn't feel the need to address weed because other people have already done so quite nicely)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
