<p>As a counterpoint to bats, apparently black bears have a really low mortality rate during hibernation, ~1%.  (Seems like that would actually be lower than their mortality rate during the summer!)</p>
<p>ETA:</p>

<p>Wow, I did not expect so much enthusiasm for bears!</p>
</li>
<li>Although it apparently has been a topic of controversy, there does seem to be scientific consensus that bears hibernate:

<p>Hibernation actually increases lifespan and likelihood of an animal dying during this period is quite low.</p>
<p>/r/dataisbeautiful</p>
<p>Edit: TL;DR: Overall, monthly survival probability was higher (by a median of 0.08) during the hibernation season in 37 (93%) out of the 40 within-group (i.e. sex and age) comparisons. When survival estimates for sexes and ages were averaged for each of the 19 species, a phylogenetically informed model included a significant and strong effect of season on survival</p>

<p>Predation is not actually a huge risk for most hibernators - the biggest cause of mortality during hibernation is not having enough  fat (or food) stored. This is a bigger problem for smaller animals who don't eat over the hibernation season, since they have less room to store fat. Golden-mantled ground squirrels have about a 25% mortality rate for this reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has worked with bats in North America, I'll point out <a href="http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/white-nose_syndrome/" target="_blank">white-nose syndrome</a>.   It's a rapidly spreading disease that routinely wipes out entire colonies of hibernating bats, typically at a 100% mortality rate.</p>
<p>It was introduced to the US from Europe by cavers within the last decade, and has been spreading at a frightening pace ever since.  It poses the threat of making the hibernating bats of North America extinct.  That's not a joke.  It's extremely sad.</p>
<p>Because we know so little about bats (they're very difficult to study), the ecological consequences (and the effects on YOU, other humans) are very hard to predict.  According to <a href="http://payload251.cargocollective.com/1/15/483921/7324788/White-Nose-Syndrome3_o.png" target="_blank">this infographic</a>, bats save us from the need for an extra $4 billion in pesticide use each year.</p>
<p>But that's just one example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_services" target="_blank">ecosystem services</a> that bats provide.  Just like honeybees, our lives would be a lot more difficult without them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
