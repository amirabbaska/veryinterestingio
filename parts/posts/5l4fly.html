Some people experience DOMS where they don't get sore for 2 days. Any reasoning for this? Does it relate to how fast the body repairs damaged muscle fibers? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doms is likely cause by microtears created during eccentric movements (studies found that concentric movements alone do not cause doms). Therefore it seems likely that a (or the) major cause of differentent amounts of doms are caused by how much someone emphasizes eccentric portions of lifts. This may also explain why leg day always causes the most soreness, as many of your major lower body muscles are placed under very high stress during the eccentric portion of the squat. </p>
<p>Other factors such as nutrition and hormonal levels, which influence how muscles are rebuilt, are probably other major factors as well, though afaik the specific mechanisms of doms and recovery are still unknown . </p>
<p>I also don't know why the delay varies from person to person, but it appears that continuing to do light exercise helps lessen soreness due to doms, so you may just be more sedentary when not st the gym </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is a weird thing.</p>
<p>But it only seems weird because we don't readily grasp everything that's going on at once. </p>
<p>DOMS is an interesting thing, because very rarely does our body <em>delay</em> feeling something. Adrenaline will delay certain senses for a short period of time (ie shock). A pregnant woman will delay releasing certain hormone doses (pictosin) until it's time to really push. Most everything else is processed as soon as it can.</p>
<p>First, we know that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alfred_Goldberg/publication/22014852_Effects_of_insulin_glucose_and_amino_acids_on_protein_turnover_in_rat_diaphragm/links/55b279ca08aed621ddfe0d38.pdf" target="_blank">insulin has a profound effect on muscle growth, preventing both degradation of already synthesized proteins and fueling further synthesis. Contrast this to just glucose, which will fuel synthesis but not help prevent degradation of current proteins</a>. Second, exercising <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Henrik_Galbo/publication/20028956_Effect_of_physical_exercise_on_sensitivity_and_responsiveness_to_insulin_in_humans/links/560954fd08ae4d86bb11c60d.pdf" target="_blank">both makes insulin more effective, and can reduce insulin production by the pancreas for 48 hours</a>.</p>
<p>How does this fit with DOMS? Muscle Soreness is really just light pain - mild discomfort caused by disturbances in your nerves electro-chemical balance. We can readily expect that any type of tissue repair would produce such an effect, so the question then becomes 'why do certain exercises have different effect on people as to when their bodies enter a certain phase of tissue repair?'</p>
<p>I believe the answer lies in their insulin sensitivity. The more insulin sensitive the person, the quicker they hit DOMS because the effect of the new exercise both doesn't suppress their insulin production <em>as much</em> during the 48 hour period, nor do they become glucose starved in their bloodstream as a result of the insulin spike that happens immediately post exercise.</p>
<p>If you want to hit DOMS quicker, eat something that you know triggers an insulin response (and have carbs with it). If you want to push back DOMS, don't eat the things which trigger your insulin response. The difference in the length of delay is noticeable enough if you have a set schedule and keep good notes. You should also find that as you progress through your regimen, your time till soreness and period of soreness both decrease until they plateau at some steady state. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
