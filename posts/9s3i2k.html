<p>The vast majority of pacemakers are programmed in what we call a demand mode - we set a base rate,  and the pacemaker only triggers to make sure you don’t drop below that rate.  </p>
<p>Most devices these days have an option called rate responsiveness - these use a variety of strategies to get a sense of when you are exercising and need a higher heart rate, when it meets a specific criteria it will increase the base rate.  There are two main methods - some companies use accelerometers (I think that’s Medtronic),  similar to one in your phone, if it sense you are moving around it triggers a higher rate.  Other companies measure “thoracic impedance” - changes in that reflect how hard/fast you are breathing and use that as a marker to up the heart rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Asked a pacemaker rep this just a few weeks ago. A lot of the older models didn’t change their rate, so patients had to make sure they didn’t exert themselves too much. Sucks, but beats dying. Some people’s hearts still have a natural pacemaker that works, it’s just that the signal isn’t getting to where it needs to go. So the pacemaker picks up that signal, and copies it with implanted wires to where it needs to go. Some people have no working natural pacemaker. So the newer ones can sense increased activity. The rep said it kind of works on the same idea as a Fitbit. When it detects increased activity, it ups the pace. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most pacers are demand pacemakers.  Basically they are set at a static rate of 70, and if the heart rate drops below that then they’ll take over and keep the rate steady. However if the heart rate is faster than 70 the pacer doesn’t fire and allows the heart’s natural pacemaker to operate. Most pacers don’t increase their rate with activity, so over exerting can be potentially dangerous. Unless the heart is healthy enough to respond to the body’s chemical triggers and increase to an accelerated rate that takes over for the pacer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a cardioverter/defibrillator. Mine will pace at 47bpm (my normal resting heart rate is around 56-60). It will also cardiovert (aka shock - think the paddles, but directly attached to my heart) when I get an irregular heart rhythm (most common for me) or when it's going too fast (have walked into the hospital at &gt;300bpm (360, but who's counting)). It will basically shock me to stop my heart, then shock me to start it up again, and then force pace. It's weird to sit in a chair at the heart function clinic and have a nurse speed up and slow down your heart.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some pacemakers detect other factors that are associated with an increase or decrease in heart rate. For instance, if you're physically active (or even angry), your blood pressure increases, and if your heart is working correctly your heart rate also increases. Blood pressure is controlled via smooth muscle surrounding blood vessels and certain modern pacemakers can sense the associated electrical signals telling that muscle to contact and increase heart rate accordingly.</p>
<p>So not only do they respond to increased physical activity, but they also respond to emotional states.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
