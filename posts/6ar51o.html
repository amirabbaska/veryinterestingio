		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Personal debt and national debts aren't really the same thing. Governmental debt is typically issued through things called bonds. When a bond is bought, the government guarantees that the owner of the bond will be paid interest for their investment into the government. Most of this 'debt' is owned by the public. So in this way, national debt is more analogous to a a stock: People will buy bonds (like they buy shares of a company) and get paid in interest (like some companies issue dividends to shareholders) over a period of time, usually 10+ years. However, interest rates for these bonds are typically very low, right now a 30 year bond has interest rates of 3.1%, which is far below what you would expect to average on the stock market. So why would anybody purchase a treasury note or bond? Because you are essentially guaranteed your interest payments; the US has <em>never</em> defaulted on a single payment like this. So it becomes very attractive to people, countries, or organizations that want an extremely safe place to stash their money and have it grow. Of course, it's entirely possible for countries to default on this stuff, it happened to Greece a couple years back. As I said before, the US has never defaulted, and if they do start defaulting, you probably have more to worry about than getting paid your 3% interest rate.</p>
<p>So the TL;DR is: People investing in the government is what generally creates national debt. Investing in the US government through bonds and notes is essentially the safest place you can put your money and still earn reasonable interest on it, as it has never failed to make a payment. Though it's possible for countries to default on their payments, creditors can't simply walk up and demand all of their owed money.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h1>Core Answer</h1>
<p>Taxation cannot quickly adjust to momentary financial demands. Changing the tax rate typically requires an act of governance. Changes in economic output happen based on uncontrolable market forces - and wars, and weather, not just locally but around the world.</p>
<p>In short, taxation is not like salary, it defies close prediction.</p>
<p>So any given year (or quarter, or whatever the monetary collection cycle is) the taxation received is either equal to, more than, or less than the expenses. Equal too is basically unheard of so that leaves one to assume that every period one will either be over or under funded.</p>
<p>When over funded, the government coffers experience a surplus.</p>
<p>When under-funded, the government must take out a loan.</p>
<p>Those loans are the deficit and they typically have a repayment period of years, like five or ten, to smooth over predicted variations in income.</p>
<p>Basically the revolving credit of the government is used to smooth over the ups-and-downs of its income. </p>
<h1>Politically Biased Rant</h1>
<p>In the United States we've developed a rather pathological problem.</p>
<p>The Republicans tend to &quot;Borrow and Spend&quot;, and the Democrats tend to &quot;Tax and Spend&quot;. One of the things the higher Democratic taxation has paid for is buying off the Republican debt.</p>
<p>Now all administrations take out <em>some</em> debt, particularly because our taxation scheme is resistant to change and our populace doesn't pay attention to our budget.</p>
<p>The american people are like the flighty children of rich parents. They want their services and they want them now, but they don't want to contribute to the family effort if it can be avoided.</p>
<p>So the cycle is thus:</p>
<p>Republicans get elected on &quot;small government and lower taxes&quot;.</p>
<p>Republicans &quot;reduce the budget and lower taxes&quot; but they do this understating or not including entire budget line items. For instance the entire &quot;Iraq War&quot; of the G.W. Bush administration was financed as &quot;emergency spending&quot; instead of budget items. This means that they've created debt but they can <em>publish</em> &quot;visibly smaller&quot; budgets.</p>
<p>This shell game includes cutting social programs because the average american citizen thinks twenty-million dollars is &quot;a lot of money&quot;. It's a lot of money for a family of four, but for the total cash flow of 2/3rds of a continent it's peanuts.</p>
<p>With the Republican &quot;more cops, less aid&quot; programs in force the tax base tends to shrink and the total taxable income goes down.</p>
<p>With Republican &quot;trickle down&quot; policies, which have <em>NEVER</em> worked, the tax income from businesses and rich folks goes down.</p>
<p>So with crappy job numbers and breaks for the rich the actual deficit spikes even as the rhetoric promises that the deficit should be going down. The representatives all shrug like &quot;nobody could have known this would happen&quot; even though it's happened every time.</p>
<p>Then we get a Democratic administration. It includes the current loan repayments in the budget and restores the funding of cut programs. This involves cutting things like military spending to reapportion the money into the previously cut social programs. That twenty-million is huge in food stamp terms, but peanuts to the line items like military spending.</p>
<p>With socially conscious programs restored the income tax basis rises.</p>
<p>With the expiration of tax breaks for the rich and corporations, the tax basis rises again.</p>
<p>Democrats budget for what they <em>really</em> spend, so the budget expenses &quot;visibly rise&quot;.</p>
<p>The people get all pissed off because the Democrats raised revenue, while ignoring the fact that they, the individuals, just returned to status quo after the little debt-induced spending spree.</p>
<p>So at the end of the Democratic dominance we've got surplesses and a shrinking deficit... which the Republicans characterize as &quot;waste&quot; and &quot;high taxes&quot; and the pendulum swings back for another go.</p>
<h1>Systems Theory Analysis</h1>
<p>The cycle isn't really caused by taxes and jobs, it's caused by mathematical problems with the U.S. voting system.</p>
<ol>
<li>We lack plurality voting</li>
<li>We have a 50% plus one guy requirement to win the presidency.</li>
<li>We lack mandatory voting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of these three failings we have &quot;cicada voters&quot; who only show up once every four or eight years to vote when the presidency is at stake. Then they just disappear again.</p>
<p>These cicada largely just vote for &quot;whichever party doesn't hold the presidency&quot; because nobody fixed their entire life for them in the last four years.</p>
<p>These cicada just vote for &quot;different&quot; or &quot;in protest&quot;, so we get the &quot;I voted for Brexit because I knew it would never pass but I wanted someone to listen to <em>me</em> for a change&quot; effect. But we get it every four or eight damn years.</p>
<p>So we are stuck vacillating between two stupid extremes with no chance of moderation because our system <strong><em>mathematically</em> <em>requires</em></strong> the pendulum to swing from Coke to Pepsi and back, and none of the other sodas get a chance to break into the big leagues.</p>
<p>If voting were mandatory...</p>
<p>If there was more than two <em>workable</em> choices...</p>
<p>If a three-way split for president could be resolved without simply handing the decision to whichever party was in control of the House of Representatives...</p>
<p>Then the &quot;two party system&quot; wouldn't be mathematically required and the polar oscillations would be dampened instead of amplified.</p>
<h1>Back on Topic</h1>
<p>So all governments need credit/debt to function.</p>
<p>And no government generates sufficient surplus to repay loans early as they typically have a backlog of things that need money spent on them.</p>
<p>The question is one of equilibrium between the demands for taxation, usually lower taxes; increased or improved services; and the waste expense of paying interest on the loans.</p>
<p>TL;DR :: Economics is tricky shit. People want governments to do magic without cost. Debt lets things be smoothed out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, but this has two parts. </p>
<p>Debt, in the US for example,  is mostly owed by the government to it's own citizens.  </p>
<p>Also,  a country can have debt owed and owned at the same time, even to the same country.  The US government could owe a German company money while a different company owes our government. </p>
<p>Debt can be a good thing.  It allows you to create opportunities now that will create more cash flow.  It can certainly backfire if you owe to much.  But at this point,  US debt is only a concern.  Not a crisis. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of these answers are in part right, but there's more to it.  This isn't ELI5 - more like ELI15 (some of this is copy/paste from other comments I've made):</p>
<p>The way a government uses debt is very very different from the way you and I use debt. Regular people use debt to change the timing of when you buy something. Take a house (and this is a huge simplification): you save for 30 years and buy the house in cash in the year 2047 OR you get a mortgage today, buy the house today and pay off the mortgage in 2047. What you've done is shifted time. Debt, to an individual, is basically the ability to separate acquisition of something and the payment for the something.</p>
<p>For a national government that controls its own currency, increasing the debt is the most efficient way to <strong>increase its monetary base</strong>. A US Treasury Note/Bond is fully exchangeable for a $100 bill, and from an economic/finance perspective <em>they are identical</em> (eg 'print' a $100 bill or create a bond - it doesn't matter). The only real argument comes in the practical application (good luck paying for your mocha frappachino with a 30yr US treasury bond). </p>
<p>The interchangeability of bonds/cash means that the inflationary impact from printing cash is identical to printing a bond. There is a concept called 'moment of inflation' (eg when inflation hits an economy) and the moment of inflation for cash and bonds are identical - its the second that cash/bond enters general circulation. </p>
<p><strong>So the TL;DR here is:</strong> countries run debts b/c its an extremely efficient way to expand their monetary base to fit the economy (eg an economy of size X needs a monetary base of size Y).  When countries need a bigger monetary base, they print bonds (eg debt) they are never going to payoff.  </p>
<p>When you expand that base too far too fast, you run into trouble; however, debt in the right ratio is perfectly healthy and, in many ways, necessary. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
