		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I really don't like a lot of these answers. /u/nofftastic comes closest to answering the question in full while keeping it ELI5, but even they fall into the mistake of concluding that some people are 'just stupid'.</p>
<p>I'm going to keep this explanation as simple as possible, but <strong>before I go any farther the ELI5 is as follows:</strong> Your questions makes a bad assumption that there is a difference. Instead of trying to clearly define the differences in these two things, we need to try and be more understanding of individuals and their circumstances. Every single person you meet has an entire world inside of them, it's probably not a good idea to decide that some have real barriers to their learning and others are just stupid.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the name of the game is intersectionality. Some people we perceive as 'just stupid' can have a lot of minor issues that compound with each other. There can be a lot of complications in navigating those issues, and the core of it might end up being a lower aptitude or interest for a given thing. For example, I have dysgraphia, a learning disability that affects my ability to write and process information through writing. I'm lucky to know about that at all, and if I had never been tested for it I might not have even gone to college. The way I interact with the written word is different than the way other normately-abled people do, but that doesn't make it any less valid. It takes me quite a it longer to write even a simple paragraph than it does people without dysgraphia. It's a physically and mentally taxing activity, and often times I'll just quit writing one something despite having something really valuable to say. That's frustrating as hell to feel like you're fighting with yourself to get a though on paper before it disapears, but if I didn't even know I was dysgraphic I could easily see myself giving up and just 'accepting that I was stupid'.</p>
<p>Now imagine that you had a much, much milder version of my disability. Would you always register that it was an issue? What if you also have touches of ADHD, Dyslexia, and lack of interest in a given subject? What if you were just exceptionally tired that day, or were a child from a poor family who was stressed because of poverty.</p>
<p>All of those things interact with each other to help explain how smart or stupid you are on a given day or in a given circumstance. All of these things are way too complicated to boil down into either-or disabled or stupid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a learning disability, so let me see if I can't shed some light on what the experience is like.</p>
<p>As a child it was readily clear something was amiss because I excelled in some areas and struggled immensely in others. In 2nd grade they thought I was a math prodigy, but in 4th grade, once I had to start writing down steps to solve problems, I began failing and continued to do so for the next 5 years. Similarly, it wasn't until I was 14 that I began reading at my grade level.</p>
<p>The last time I took the battery of intelligence tests to assess my LD (Learning Difference is the politically correct term), I was 18. My overall scores for verbal, math, and working memory were all in the 99th percentile. My processing speed was abysmal. My subscores were across the board; there were some tests where I scored at a savant level and others where I scored at the level of a 10 year old.</p>
<p>A LD is not at all a commentary on intelligence but simply describes that you learn a little bit differently than others. My situation was rare in that everything just clicked at some point. I learned to be methodical and precise. I learned how to determine when I understood something and when I didn't. This precision comes at a cost, however, and that cost is speed. If I try to work quickly, my comprehension and accuracy plummet. Nevertheless, I was able to be enormously successful, and the only thing I really can't do is perform well on standardized tests with time limits. Ultimately learning disability is term used to describe a broad range of symptoms that vary wildly from person to person, but these people themselves probably have little in common with regards to the way they learn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Intelligence is very hard to nail down. What's the difference between someone who can follow advanced logical arguments and someone who can't? Probably that the one who could was introduced to the basics before being shown something more advanced. </p>
<p>Even then, is the only factor having the foundation to build upon, if two people were given identical educations, with identical supporting experiences, would they be equally as &quot;smart&quot;? Probably not, and this difference is what is generally referred to as &quot;innate intelligence&quot;. But it's impossible in practice to have two people with all the same experiences, so we must rely on other means to tell who is smarter.</p>
<p>Before age 7, children must learn to perceive the world in ways most of us take for granted. <a href="http://childdevelopmentinfo.com/child-development/piaget/" target="_blank">Here is a table detailing the growth by age</a>. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiT7HFj2gv4&amp;index=6&amp;list=PL58CD3A73AFD20DF8" target="_blank">video shows children failing to realize that other people can see and perceive the world differently than they do</a>. Also in the same playlist is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtLEWVu815o&amp;index=4&amp;list=PL58CD3A73AFD20DF8" target="_blank">this video, demonstrating children's perception of the amount of a thing changes with how it is represented.</a> One more famous example is the Sally Anne test, <a href="https://youtu.be/41jSdOQQpv0?t=1m12s" target="_blank">where a young child is unable to separate their knowledge from what they expect others to know</a>. Sorry for linking so many videos, but the development of the mind in children is just incredible. They aren't just &quot;small adults&quot;, their minds do not work in the same way. And interestingly enough, when most people think back to their childhood the change in cognitive ability doesn't seem so drastic.</p>
<p>But beyond just developing from aging, people can train themselves to think differently as well, to change what seems intuitive to them. Being able to follow arguments about limits, as something approaches another thing, but never quite gets there, is not trivial to someone who has a very formulaic understanding of mathematics. <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2015/09/21/the-dad-who-wrote-a-check-using-common-core-math-doesnt-know-what-hes-talking-about/" target="_blank">That's the type of thing common core is attempting to address</a> by making students think more about what numerals represent rather than just how to mash them together. By prodding students to think from a different angle, they become much better equipped to attack a wider range of problems (one of the more accessible measures of intelligence).</p>
<p>Now down to the question at hand, how does being dumb differ from a learning disability? We can define being dumb as not being able to approach a problem from different directions. Someone with a learning disability has impediments to learning beyond just not having a concept properly explained. In some cases, some sensory might not be interpreted by the brain, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIaNxmG9JOQ" target="_blank">as in this case</a> (borrowed from in the thread), or overly interpreted, interrupting attempts to perform other tasks (ADD). In others, a mode of thinking that comes easily to most might just be entirely incompatible with the architecture of their mind. Generally, in a learning disability the brain is preventing itself from acquiring knowledge. In someone dumb, they don't think about the knowledge they are trying to acquire in the right way.</p>
<p>tl;dr Understanding how the brain works at childhood life stages is important to defining intelligence, which is important to answering the question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here you go:
Im told that i have a learning disability. Apparently, it is the source of my shitty handwriting and poor short term memory when it comes to tasks.  My boss will say &quot;do this first thing&quot; and if I don't write it down, I will forget. It drives her nuts.</p>
<p>I have ridiculously good memory other then that. I typically didn't study in college, because after going over the material, I could somehow &quot;remember&quot; it... Like see it on the board, and that would be enough to pass tests.</p>
<p>If I really wanted to &quot;study&quot; I would record myself reading the notes. Then I would listen to myself reading the notes on the way to class.  Again, I could treat the question, and see either the physical location of the information on my note sheet, or remember where I was while I was driving and that would help jog my memory.</p>
<p>Job: respiratory therapist...  I've made life and death decisions multiple times in my career.</p>
<p>I also can type one thing while having a conversation... I'm told that's weird.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
