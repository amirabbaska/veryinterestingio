		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Protesting isn't about getting the government or entity you are protesting to change because of the protesters. They will always be dismissed as a minority opinion and troublemakers. It is about getting a larger group of constituents (the ones who would never actually go to the protest) interested with the issue.  It is about attention and media coverage and creating a groundswell.  You hope by having 100 people show up you get 5000 to write their congressman.  You hope by staying in place for a month that you get 50,000 to care.  In short you hope to influence a larger group, create pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all protests work.<br />
It's about the impact they have on the public, more than the entity they protest against.<br />
In Milan, in Italy, the public transport company employees were asking for better conditions, to no avail.<br />
They organized a strike, which lasted for less than a day, but that was enough.<br />
The economy of the city, which is the most important economy in Italy, was struck so hard that the transport company gave in to their demands.<br />
There wasn't even need to go on the street shouting, they just didn't show up at work, <strong>none of them</strong>, and the municipality told the company to fix it...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a french I've made my share of demonstrations, a few comments with my french bias (but most of them are generic for democratic countries) </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In most of the case the government, the corporation, the whatever don't give a shit about protest. I've read that there is like 1500 demonstration a year in Paris, obviously most of them are 3 hippies asking for piece and free love or 2 nazi asking to deport the <del>jews</del> muslim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big protests  are a place where some people go for the festive aspect, teenager having an excuse to skip school, student going there to smoke pot and ask for the peace, worker bored of the machine wanting to do something else, and demonstration are full of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6_7Mbp76jU" target="_blank">happy people singing for a better world</a> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big protest are a place for political activist to do some networking, <em>you are interested in global warming, that's great we're organizing a conference where African peasant will talk about how the climate change affect them</em>  which let political group hiring new members and spreading their ideas (As I became older during demonstrations I don't buy drugs to a weird punk but books from various think-tanks) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's a way for parties and union to show their relative strength which is important for the various elections </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are representing 1 000 000 people who accept to leave their home to go protesting on Sunday morning you have a certain credibility to talk in the medias and can at least get appointment with government officials, sometimes it's possible to negotiate something sometimes nothing, As an elected body you have to think about these 1 000 000 voters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually after at most few weeks, the protest stops, worker have to earn money, students have exam to pass. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, it really doesn't, and that's rarely talked about. We notice when it does, and notice less when it doesn't (which is more often), which through confirmation bias leads us to (wrongly) believe that it's a lot more effective than it is, and more often.</p>
<p>In reality, protest of any kind needs to be unusually prominent (usually meaning very large scale) or sustained or widespread to get meaningful attention from anyone who's in any position to effect any actual change that it calls for. Most of the time, it's reported on the news but shrugged off by decision-makers as just a bit of whining (which, let's be honest, is often the case), if they even know about it at all (which they often don't).</p>
<p>In terms of energy and time invested to meaningful gain derived, public protest is often the least efficient way possible to get desired results. However, it does have its place, so I'm not knocking it. Just pointing out that as a go-to tactic, it's usually (but not always) misguided.</p>
<p>Decision-makers will commonly tune out small-scale protest as fringe-group whinging. Because, as I said, if often is. To get real results, you need at least the implication of a large-scale movement of some kind -- something sufficient to have real democratic effect. Decision-makers aren't doing this because they're assholes who don't care, but because let's face it, humanity as a whole is kind of childish and reactive, and they're trying to deal with it the way parents do. If you jump every single time the two-year-old screams, you'll never get anything done, and the kid will never figure out how to solve things on their own.</p>
<p>There must be reasonable balance between what's really called for and what's just someone's bored complaining. College kids, especially, are very good for manufacturing drama. (Anyone tempted to downvote me for saying that, spend a few years living in the shadow of any urban college, and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.) There's even a very reliable market built around that well-known effect: Glenn Beck didn't schedule and publicise a book event walking distance from Brown because he was unaware that they'd likely protest it. He was counting on that free marketing, and he got it.</p>
<p>None of which is to say that protest is pointless or that decision-makers are all good and decent people. Some protest really does work, and plenty of decision-makers are assholes who need it. But by and large, the majority of protest I've ever seen is cathartic street theatre with little or no productive value, and sometimes the opposite. If the public's not largely already on your side, you can earn a lot of new opposition by blocking roads and irritating people.</p>
<p>Historically, public protest was a show of force, demonstrating that large numbers of citizens were ready to Do Something about something they objected to. Before modern times, that had real and immediate political effect because it was, in essence, a possible rehearsal for civil unrest and violence. For the better part of a couple centuries, though, it's pretty much inconceivable that any mass of people could really threaten 'government' in the way that they used to. What <em>is</em> true in our time, though -- and wasn't in those earlier times -- is that <em>very</em> large-scale protest demonstrates a very real <em>democratic</em> threat, and is therefore taken seriously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
