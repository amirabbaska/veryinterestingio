		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are telling you the answer... slicing v. chopping, shear force and pressure over area... but not really describing the difference. </p>
<p>A human neck for example doesn't have a super tough skin, but there are tougher bits relative to other bits.  And the bits are often discrete, meaning if you succeed in cutting one bit, you can chalk it up as job done and move onto the next bit, one at a time.</p>
<p>Imagine you are cutting a tomato.  The skin of the fruit is somewhat harder for a knife blade to get through compared to the 'guts'.  Now if you take your knife and press <strong>down</strong> your blade will compress the soft 'guts' and you will increase the length of blade that encounters the skin.  Its like your blade is staying as sharp (or dull) while the skin is getting tougher!</p>
<p>But what if you take your knife and, like the famous guillotine blade, angle it to the direction of force/resistance?  You drastically lessen the amount of blade that can come into contact with the skin if it compresses.  Its, not perfect of course, but it does the best job of keeping more of the force directed on singular points.</p>
<p>Why aren't <em>all</em> blades like this?  Well they often are, but not always.  When you angle the blade you increase the surface area drastically.  And if you are cutting a super-duper sized neck, well then friction starts holding your blade back.</p>
<p>Imagine cheese.  Not particularly hard to cut (fart joke!).  But if you use a butchers knife it will seem difficult.  The cheese &quot;sticks&quot; to the big flat blade holding it back and making your job difficult.  This is why cheese cutters are often skinny little pieces of wire.  the wire isn't particularly sharp, it doesn't have to be.  Nor is it very strong, there are no vertebrae in a cheddar wheel.  But it has almost no surface area, so it can just slide right through!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>so it slices, rather than chops. The angle blade makes it so that the blade slide across the neck, rather then just having a flat edge chop down.</p>
<p>If you have it just chop down, you stand a much better chance of just crushing the neck rather than having the head get cut off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's so it slices through the neck quickly with one drop of the blade. There are several ancestors of the guillotine that have straight blades but it took several strikes to successfully remove the head</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called a &quot;shearing angle&quot; and is used in everything from woodworking  to cutting off peoples heads. </p>
<p>It makes an automatic slicing action even though the blade is travelling in a straight line, if it was not angled it would function more like an axe, which would need a lot of blunt force behind it. It's kind of like how you have to pull and slice with a samurai sword rather than just hacking at things straight on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a myth that it was the King of France, Louis XVI himself, who upon being presented the new contraption by Dr. Guillotin, suggested that the blade be angled in order to better slice through the condemned one's neck. The video demonstrates the failure of the horizontal blade as well.</p>
