		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have suffered my whole life from those terrible canker sores. About 10 years ago I discovered <strong>Hydrogen Peroxide</strong>, and it has absolutely changed my life.</p>
<p>The moment you feel the slightest inkling of a canker sore coming on (or you bite your cheek or otherwise injure your mouth), immediately rinse with standard H202. Do this a few times a day until the threat has passed. I just take a swig out of the bottle and swish it around for about 30 seconds. I don't rinse with water (or drink water) for at least 15 minutes afterwards.</p>
<p>Using this method I have been mostly canker sore free for years. Even when one gets started, prompt and consistent application of Hydrogen Peroxide makes the sore heal quicker and be much less intense.</p>
<p>Hope this helps you fellow sufferers!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is a great question! The mouth and eyes tend to swell more than other parts of the body (like the back, for example) likely for a couple of reasons. One the eyes and mouth have many many blood vessels which means there is going more edema (fluid leaking) and more inflammation (more immune cells which release chemicals or cytokines that can promote swelling). Second, both the areas have very thin skin which means the swelling is more pronounced. That why if you get punched in the eye or lip (vs the back), the area swells fast. Clinically it changes the way I practice. For example, when I do surgery around the eye/upper cheek or do filler in the lip, I have the patient ice for a few hours immediately after to reduce the swelling. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am a dermatologist but I can't offer medical advice via Reddit, and anything I say is not a substitute for a personal consultation with a doctor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From Wikipedia:  </p>
<p><em>The cause is not completely understood, but involves a T cell-mediated immune response triggered by a variety of factors.</em></p>
<p>T-Cells are big part of your body's response when you have an allergic reaction or are fighting an infection.  So it makes sense that, since canker sores are caused by that action, that they would swell up (and hurt and be hot) just like a cut that is infected.</p>
<p>It's basically your body having an infection reaction without actually having an infection (since research has shown no evidence of bacterial causes).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm in my late 30s and I had at least one canker sore 50% of the time since I was a little kid.  Nothing helped.  It was the bane of my existence. </p>
<p>Then one day a few years ago I finally made the connection.  I'm allergic to tree nuts.  I had no idea.  I quit eating tree nuts and boom: the only time I ever get canker sores now is when I bite my cheek or eat an accidental tree nut. </p>
<p>TL;DR:  Find out if you have an allergy.  This knowledge would have saved me decades of pain and sometimes embarrassment. </p>
<p>(I'm pretty sure I missed out on a lot of snogging opportunities too) . </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've suffered with them for my entire life,  to the point of not eating/drinking/speaking. I was miserable and they would became much worse as my cycle would approach each month. That is until i happened across an article about a university study that had found vitamin b12 to be very beneficial.  I began taking b12 every day and I only get one or two a year now and that's usually because I've failed to take the b12. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
