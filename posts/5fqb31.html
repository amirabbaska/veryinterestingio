<p>Here is the gif. This is something I have been wondering about a lot recently, seeing this gif made me want to ask. Chemically, something must be happening that is causing the cells to move to that position, some identifiable substance from the parasite or something, but can cells respond direction-ally to stimuli?</p>
<p>Edit: thank for you for the responses! I will be reading all of these for quite a while!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A quick, incomplete answer since I'm in class. What you're talking about is called chemotaxis, and describes how white blood cells &quot;call for reinforcements&quot;, but also any movement of a cell due to a gradient in some stimulating chemical. When some types of WBCs encounter trouble, they'll release chemotactic chemicals such as chemokines. When these diffuse into the surrounding tissue it creates a gradient that other cells can use to tell the direction from and will begin moving in that direction. There's a lot more to it, but that's a start.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The chemicals you are asking about are chemokines and cytokines, which in this case is likely to be cytokine IL-5, which recruits eosinophils (a type of WBC) to kill the parasite. Cytokines are proteins which bind to receptors on the eosinophil. Once bound a lot of things go on inside the cell, including phosphorylation of proteins causing remodelling of the internal structure to make it move in a direction. I'm deducing a bit here as my knowledge is rather undergraduate, but I imagine higher concentrations = more transcription = more movement = goes in the right direction by biased random walk kind of deal (someone please feel free to correct me).
These cytokines are produced by other white blood cells (in this case T-helper cells), which are responding to either more white blood cells or due to the adverse effect that the parasite is having on the surrounding tissues such as epithelium, which causes the production of different cytokines. The cytokine that activates T-helper cells is IL-4 but no one is quite sure which cells produce it in this kind of response.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your guess is correct - this gif is a very good example of the human immune system's response to parasitic invader (looks like C. elegans to me).  </p>
<p>Lots of things are happening and I'll try to explain it in an understandable way - but you need to realise that in order for this to happen (and for this NOT to happen when no harm is done, for example auto-immunity), the pathways behind this need to be quite complex!  </p>
<p>What happens is when this parasite breaches your skin, the epithelial skin cells that are damaged cells will release certain proteins (chemokines and cytokines, for example IL-25 and IL-33, the most important ones). These will trigger white blood cells to migrate to the location of the breach via a process called &quot;chemotaxis&quot;: the white blood cell just goes in the direction where the protein concentration is highest (its source).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>T cells have all sorts of ways to kill. Antibodies can gum up critical surface proteins. T cells can produce huge amounts of reactive oxygen species and other reactive chemicals which act like hydrogen peroxide and bleach, outright denaturing proteins, causing dna damage, and even triggering apoptosis in the target. They also produce porins which when they hit the target membrane link together to form huge holes in the cell wall causing everything to spill out. </p>
<p>And finally they can engage in phagocytosis, enveloping smaller organisms and the debris of their battle, ingesting it and even consuming it. And even then they like to 'cook' their food, flooding the engulfed vacuole containing the victim with all sorts of nasty enzymes and reactive chemicals to turn into a soup.</p>
<p>So white cells engage in chemical warfare, blow gigantic holes in their victims and then eat the dead. That nematode is gonna have a bad day.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of responses here are confused with the functions of chemokines vs. cytokines.  Chemokines are what attract other cells to a danger signal.  Cytokines activate or potentiate a cellular function.  So, what you're observing in that .gif is chemokines being produced to attract granulocytes/neutrophils to kill off the parasite.  These types of cells have pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on their surface that naturally recognizes invading pathogens.  Once triggered they release their payloads housed within intracellular compartments to kill off the invader.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
