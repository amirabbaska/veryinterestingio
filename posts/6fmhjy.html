		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Few Reasons - </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lying down allows your blood and lymph to circulate more easily because your heart is not fighting gravity to get blood and lymph to your brain and head. When you're sick, you want to make it easy for your body to fight the infection.  </p>
<p>Blood and lymph carry important substances/cells to the site of infection (nose, throat, ears, stomach etc).                      These substances identify the infection and attract other immune cells to the area.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we're sick, a lot of what we &quot;feel&quot; is our own body telling us to rest as it fights pathogens. For example, your body causes its own fever, it's the one that's filling you with snot, and the congestion you feel in your head too might be from this. Throwing up is also your body's fault. It's trying to get rid of contents in the stomach.</p>
<p>So basically, your body is also indicating to you that you should probably not do anything. Sometimes lying down makes us feel better because we're allowing our body to do its thing, and then it quiets down. Or maybe subconsciously we know what's going on and once we lay down, we're satisfied we did the right thing </p>
<p>Lying down is the most conducive to rest and sleep, which are often very important to recovering. Lying down is better when you have not got the energy to sit up.  In many illnesses being propped up is better than being on your back.  But if you just need to rest to get better, and do not have breathing problems, or parts of your body that are harmed by lying down, then being prone is fine.  Most of us are accustomed to sleeping that way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As for lying on floor specifically</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Well lying on floor has been proven to improve health and posture. When we sleep on a firm, flat surface our body, and especially our spine, gets a chance to realign to its natural posture much more easily. When we don’t have a mattress hugging our body, far more spaces open up between us and the floor. On the floor you experience a vast increase in body awareness. Lying on floor aligns hips and shoulders in perfect position plus keeps the lower back in shape </p>
</li>
<li>Remember that sleeping is the body’s natural way of healing, so sleep in a good resting position to enhance the process of healing. A good posture also tells your brain it is happy (Because there is nothing there to take the shape of your body, your body cannot sink into the mattress, so you don’t need to tense up, you can actually relax and let go of tensions in your body.) while slouching tells your brain it is unhappy and sends stress signals towards your brain.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who spent last night on the cold tile floor in front of their toilet instead of in bed, can confirm feels better. Not sick, think I got food poisoning last night. Just severe abdominal pain in any position but curled up on the tile until my body finally decided enough was enough around 5am and purged itself. Now I just feel shitty from lack of sleep which sucks as I can't afford to be missing work this week. Bills due and I don't get sick days..sigh.</p>
<p>Edit: I keep getting comments concerning me not getting sick days. Here is my reply to someone. In my case it isn't the work place not caring. I'm not a salaried employee, I work 100% commission. There are upsides to it, but also down. This happens to be one of the negatives. The company itself is great. I just happen to be coming off a family emergency that wiped out my emergency fund so a short week isn't a fun time. Just bad timing is all, it happens. Only thing one can do is roll with the punches and try to be better prepared next time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add another dimension to this explanation. Nausea is usually accompanied by the feeling of vertigo or &quot;head spinning&quot; . This is due to semicircular canals of the inner ear going haywire. Think of them as 3 small hula hoops filled with a liquid. Now imagine a cube's corner. It has 3 faces meeting at that corner, each hula hoop occupies that face, i.e. the length, breadth and height of the cube. This is how the brain knows where it is in 3 dimensional space in time. Due to the liquid splashing about based on gravity, these tubes help in balance as well.
Now when you are sick with a blocked nose and high fever, it affects your inner ear as well, thereby leading to nausea and sometimes the 'falling' feeling that one experiences. As there is an eustachian canal from the nose and throat that connects the ear canal. When you are sick, this canal fills up with fluid and if it affects the semicircular canals, it'll make you throw up as well. Also, alcohol leads to inhibition of the area in the brain that gets feedback from these tubes. Thus, that spinning feeling, resulting in throwing up (apart from the body's response to excessive alcohol ejection to prevent poisoning).<br />
Now why does lying on the floor helps? This is due to the fact that the brain gets information from the rest of the body about its position w.r.t. the ground. So it doesn't need to rely on the information coming from the semicircular canals to maintain balance. It lessens the spinning feeling and makes you feel better.<br />
Edit: thanks u/puddlesofsweat for pointing out I needed an ELi5 tldr, so here goes..<br />
Tl;DR - The inner ear has an organ which is used for balancing and knowing the head's/body's position. This is affected during sickness and causes dizziness. Lying on the floor lets the brain know the position of the body and helps you feel better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My non-scientific take: From what I remember of the last time I had a horrendous norovirus, lying on the floor felt better than the bed because it reduced the number of contact points between my body and the surface below. My whole body was achy, and lying in bed just head to foot misery.  But sprawled out on the floor on my back reduced that contact area greatly.  Still hurt to be touched, but there was less of it overall. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
