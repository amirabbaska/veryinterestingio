		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually knew a guy who did this.</p>
<p>A business owner in NYC. Whenever we'd go out (he was my client) he'd just park his BWM anywhere.</p>
<p>Street corners, handicap spaces, fire hydrants, whatever. </p>
<p>He came out to a ticket every time. He just tossed it in the back and handed it to his assistant when he got to the office. </p>
<p>He figures he spent 4 to 5 thousand a year on fines. </p>
<p>But he made 2 million.</p>
<p>So his parking costs were just 0.25% of his income. </p>
<p>One quarter of one percent.</p>
<p>Which is basically what you probably pay as a percentage of your yearly income parking legitimately at meters or in garages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Ever wonder why people with super expensive cars often quadruple-park, besides to show off their obviously massive manhood?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually yes, and it happens. Steve Jobs was notorious for constantly parking in handicapped spaces even before his cancer made that justifiable, and he ducked California's mandatory license plates law by <em>trading in his car for the exact same model every six months.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on where you live.</p>
<p>In BC, Canada, where I live, parking violations are civil bylaw infractions. They have nothing to do with your driver's license. If you pay, they go away. If you don't pay, you get sent to collections. You can never go to prison for parking tickets in BC. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the UK there is the criminal offence <em>Leaving a Vehicle in a Dangerous Position</em> , for example on a blind corner. This can be punished by 3 'penalty points' as well as a fine. That wouldn't apply to things like parking in disabled spaces though. Accumulate 12 penalty points in 3 years and you normally get banned from driving. Drive while banned and you can be put in prison. For some context, other common offences that earn 3 points are mild speeding and running red lights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
