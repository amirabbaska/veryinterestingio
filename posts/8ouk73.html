		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is the simplest explanation I can make.</p>
<p>A layer of water sits on top of the fibres.
This re-refracts the light thatâ€™s bouncing off the fibres back onto the fibres, instead of a single refraction like what would normally happen when the material is dry.</p>
<p>This allows the material to absorb more light, making it appear darker. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Refractive index</strong> of a material is the ratio between speed of light in vacuum and speed of light in that material. Light tends to bounce back when encountered with a sharp change in refractive index. Being wet means that there's a water film covering the material, mediating the change in refractive index,  resulting in reduced reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>
<p>Part 2 of the story</p>
<p>Apart from index mediation, the water film does something else. For rough/fibrous surfaces, the reflection will be <strong>diffuse</strong>, i.e. visible from all directions. When a water film is present, the surface becomes smooth, and the reflection will be <strong>specular</strong>, and only visible in one direction. So in most directions, the material will appear darker.</p>
<p>Conductors are a completely different beast. The reflection off of metals are not solely dictated by the refractive index.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't get darker it gets more shiny. Suppose a certain quantity of light hits a a dry, matte (dull) surface. If it is something like chalk, than off the 100% of light, an even distribution of of light bounces off everywhere (10% here, 10% here, 10% over there, another 10% over there and so on... some percentage is absorbed too of course, but the stuff that &quot;scatters&quot; scatters evenly)</p>
<p>Water &quot;reflects&quot; light better than &quot;scatters&quot; it. When a wet surface is hit with light, instead of evenly scattering it everywhere, it specifically reflects more of it in the direction having to do with how/where the surface faces. So while less light is going off in all directions, more light is bouncing off in a particular direction. </p>
<p>This is called &quot;conservation of energy&quot;. That the amount of light that leaves a surface has to be less than or equal to the light hitting it. (less than, because some of it can be absorbed - when an object appears green, it is because it is absorbing red/blue light but bouncing of green, and dark green means absorbing more light) </p>
<p>Edit: so if you look at the object from a good number of angles it will appear dark, but if you look at from small select number of angles, it will appear &quot;shiny&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the light hits on an object, some portion of it get bounced back, that is how we are able to see them.</p>
<p>When something gets wet, water molecules are attached phsically (not chemically) to that thing's molecules. The water molecules tend to get excited by the photons(and absorbs the photons) due to their low excitation energy. When the excited electrons return back to their original state, they release a photon again with closer to but lower than its original energy. As a result of that, photons that bounced back lost some portion their energy, hence you see darker colors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
