		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a myriad of hypothesis to explain how sexual reproduction first developed. I did my undergraduate thesis on yeast epigenetics (gene regulation through histone modification) so I'm only going to discuss the theory pertaining to that.</p>
<p>In short, it was an accident. A cell developed the ability to share genetic material and through this was able to survive/leave more offspring. Sexual reproduction was likely gradual, with the sharing of some genetic information at first followed by full chromosomal recombination after. Sexual reproduction creates diversity and helps eliminate bad genes from the gene pool. This is typically a net positive despite the increased costs of sexual reproduction. Therefore cells that could do sexual reproduction generally had higher fitness than those that didn't.</p>
<p>Early evolutionary versions of this can be seen in certain bacteria. Bacteria use a sex pilus, basically a tube that sticks out of the cell. The first cell pokes a second recipient cell and the two fuse. Genetic material is then shared between bacteria. </p>
<p>For yeast, this is different. Yeast have the option of reproducing asexually and sexually. They can bud, basically producing an identical copy of themselves or under certain conditions they can undergo sexual reproduction and even class switching (kind of like male to female and vice versa). For yeast, they can have a haploid form (non duplicated genome) or a diploid form (duplicated genome). The diploid does sexual reproduction. The haploid does not. It's likely that during some point a cell that reproduced exclusively via budding was able to combine genetically with another to form this diploid cell. These diploid cells may have existed for quite some time before one received a mutation causing it to split again into 4 haploid cells. Then over time, the process evolved until a point where we have yeast cells that could undergo meiosis (sexual reproduction) as we know it today.</p>
<p>So to summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Development of sexual reproduction occurred gradually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything began as a single celled organism that reproduced asexually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A random mutation occurred that allowed this cell to fuse with another and share genetic material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over subsequent generations this fusing and sharing of genetic material developed.</p>
</li>
<li>Eventually this process would lead to meiosis (sexual reproduction) as we know it.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one knows much about the origins of sexual reproduction. I'm sure there are ideas, but it's all just speculation. It's very difficult to definitively find out how something evolved over a billion years ago.</p>
<p>As for how life formed before sexual reproduction, that's easy! For single-celled organisms, the cells grow until they reach a certain size, then divide into two smaller cells and keep on growing. Many non-sexually-reproducing (asexual) organisms are single-celled, but there are some multicellular organisms like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_\(genus\)" target="_blank">hydra</a> that reproduce by new organisms budding off of older ones and just breaking away when they are big enough. Most (all?) types of fungi and some plants can also reproduce asexually, although they usually retain the ability to reproduce sexually under certain circumstances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Obviously there's no confirmation of the exact process (like with any early development) but all you really need is the concept of multiple cells sharing information to create new cells, which doesn't sound too out there. Like anything with early evolution, it would just be random mutation, with so many different simple organisms you get a monkey on typewriters scenario and something dominant emerges to set the trend for the next process of evolutionary development.</p>
<p>This could obviously fail enough times, until it happens and two cells combine information in such a combination that it creates a new cell that's superior enough to survive, and also possesses the characteristic to seek out a completely separate organism. Presumably once you get to that point it can just continue from there.</p>
<p>Presumably lots of potential sharing of genetic information between different numbers of bodies was possible, but natural selection favored a binary system - complex enough that it can create favourable combinations of genes, but simple enough it doesn't become too limited by those conditions.</p>
<p>From there sexual dimorphism appears, where of the two types, they begin to exhibit different purposes in the reproductive cycle, creating the male and female distinction that is also then passed down (typically classed as the female &quot;bearing&quot; the offspring in some way). In a way this is easily the more interesting question of how exactly this came about, of at what point the two sexes would be pressured by the environment to function differently and how this was somehow a strategy that made those organisms more successful than others without dimorphism. </p>
<p>Sexual organs would develop depending on an exaggeration of those sexual differences, with females overall taking on the greatest burden of reproductive time and males overall taking the lesser amount. This would continue to affect organ development, and then much later the behavioural and societal roles caused by the simple difference in time required to make new life.</p>
<p>I am no biologist though, so feel free to correct me as I could be wildly wrong without a formal understanding backing up those ideas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before sexual reproduction, there was asexual reproduction- basically self-cloning or mitosis. However, this process makes populations susceptible to diseases/bad mutations/etc. When more advanced cells emerged, they &quot;discovered&quot; that swapping DNA and getting some diversification in there was better than simple self-cloning. And as cells got more and more advanced, so did sexual reproduction get more and more advanced, eventually resulting in distinct sexes.</p>
<p>On &quot;discovered&quot;: these DNA swaps only became the reproduction status quo because the more genetically diverse offspring survived/thrived at a higher rate. There wasn't discovery so much as there was happily beneficial accident that became widely adopted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Questions of this kind, until we get some actual evidence say from genetic lineage reconstruction etc, are best approached as trying to find plausible paths of evolution rather than trying to answer a single definitive 'how'. That in mind, something like the following is among the most plausible sequences..</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the very first organisms didnt even have nuclei, they simply 'grew', both their cell bodies, and nuclear matter, and split into pieces that each continued to live separately... thus multiplying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>once nuclear matter became more organized, 'splitting' or 'budding off' became a bit more sophisticated and under tighter nuclear control, where a mechanism for duplication and separation of nuclear matter would have developed (which in its modern form, still exists as mitosis or cell division in modern organims).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>errors in such 'splitting off' would have produced cells/organisms that ended up having multiple copies of nuclear matter but otherwise normal. This (i.e. polyploidy) is actually still fairly common, with some estimates that 30% to 80% of modern plants are that way, and happens with animals as well (and occassionally even in humans!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over time, polyploid organisms can have the copies of nuclear matter diverge just enough from different mutations/changes accumulating in the different copies, that they now have an interesting possibility... combinations of the two copies of the same chromosomal matter might create even more fit versions of organisms with newer or extra capabilities. So organisms with sloppy enough nuclear control that they start mixing up their copies of genetic matter now have a distinct long term advantage in evolving faster to suite the environment and develop new capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This would inevitably lead to something starting to look like 'meiosis' that we see in gamete production in modern animals today, where the nuclear matter that are similar or 'homologous' line up, intermix, then separate out into daughter cells. Now at this stage this would still be reproduction just unicellularly/asexually, but really, this genetic mixing of copies of genetic matter is at the root of sexual reproduction (even now!), regardless of whether the genetic mixing happened only with copies of material retained internally or with external partner too!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, having come this far, getting to the actual next stage of 'sexual' reproduction with a partner is actually very easy and obvious. Since the cells internalls already have the mechanism for properly sorting and mixing genetic matter, even something as simple as one cell engulfing another and having their genetic matter combined together would lead to their genetic matter mixing in the next cell splitting phase, thus leading to sexual reproduction. Such behavior would be selected even more strongly in evolution as it would bring together different genetic toolsets which might have evolved under separate environmental pressures or lineages. And soon the ritual 'engulfing' could become some specialized 'fusion' or 'exchange' of sorts. (Although in fact, if you look at the sperm entering the ova, one might thing it is still being engulfed too).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rest of the way is just a matter of organisms becoming multicellular, having specialized tissues and functions, and evolving more specialized ways of achieving the same genetic matter sharing process as they evolve. </p>
</li>
<li>The crux is, sexual reproduction isnt very magical, nor would it have required any fancy leap of ability or 'lucky break' to allow it. Indeed, it would be almost inevitable and very strongly pushed towards by evolution because of how fundamentally straightforward it is, and how big an advantage it offers by allowing different genetic variants to be combined together to patch together new abilities for the organism.</li>
