		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Effexor has a short half-life, meaning it is processed through your body quickly, so if you stop taking it your body will experience withdrawal symptoms just as quickly. Prozac is easier to stop taking because its half-life is much longer, so withdrawal symptoms are not nearly as extreme because it's still in your system while you come off of it. </p>
<p>Think of it this way: you give a kid a lollipop and just as the kid is really into the lollipop, you snatch the lollipop away and the kid cries. Your brain is the kid, and the meds are the lollipop.</p>
<p>Source: I've taken both, felt withdrawals for both, and this is essentially how my doctor explained it to me. </p>
<p>P.S. I would not advise coming off of medications without consulting your doctor. They'll slowly ween you off by gradually lowering the dosage until you're no longer on any, which is much easier for your body and brain to handle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Effexor has a strong effect on two neurotransmitter systems, and also has very short half-life compared to Prozac. Effexor is metabolized and removed from your system very quickly, and the sudden lack of stimulation of serotonin and norepinephrine receptors causes intense withdrawal symptoms. </p>
<p>Tramadol, an opioid painkiller, is very chemically similar to Effexor, and has similarly severe withdrawal symptoms. I know, I've been there, and it is easily one of the worst things I've ever experienced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies are very efficient. This is why drugs are so addictive: one way or another the brain sees a surplus of neurotransmitters, and the body says &quot;w00t! don't have to waste any energy making <em>those</em> anymore.&quot; So it's also why coming off of drugs is so difficult: when the external source/mechanism is cut off, the body has nothing to fill the gap. It takes time for it to be convinced that no more external deliveries will be made, and to ramp production back up.</p>
<p>Ramping down off of Effexor was one of the worst experiences I have had with medication. I had heard bad things about Prozac, so I tried to ride the withdrawals out... a couple of days later I went back to the doctor and agreed to the Prozac. I had none of the side-effects I had been worrying about, it did greatly reduce the slope of the ramp, and the ramp from coming off of it was gentler too.</p>
<p>YMMV, I've known a few people who come down off of Effexor without much hassle. But two of them said they didn't think they had really needed the Effexor in the first place, so I suspect their experience has something to do with their natural production of the relevant neurotransmitters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I took effexor for 5 years.  I moved to pristiq.  it is a newer, more advanced version of effexor without the brain shocks.  I have been on pristiq now for about 7 years.</p>
<p>I was able to get off effexor XR by road cycling.  I found that lowering the dosage was very easy when I could pedal the norepinephrine occilations and withdrawls out. I was off all meds for one year and then my anxiety hit the roof and I literally couldn't do anything wit freaking out.</p>
<p>Pristiq is smoother if you need to be on a norepinephrine inhibitor.
Generalized Anxiety Disorder can return and its even worse 2nd time around. Its more expensive and is a designer drug, but ask the doctor.</p>
<p>Pritiq can change your life if your body reacts well to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
