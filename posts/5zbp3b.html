		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The future of healthcare is being driven by rapidly advancing technologies and breakthrough developments in medicine, neurology, biotechnology, stem cell research, and the explosion of digital information for diagnosis and rapid analysis. From 3D-printed organs to organ regeneration - from point of care to &quot;lab on a chip&quot; diagnostics, synthetic biology and new gene-based therapies - our life, and quality of life are being changed by technology. Ask me questions about what new technologies are being employed or on the horizon for prevention and better diagnosis, stem cell research and understanding how new developments in brain monitoring algorithms will allow physicians to make rapid life-saving clinical decisions in the operating room.  </p>
<p>Dr. Daniel Kraft is a Stanford and Harvard trained physician-scientist, inventor, entrepreneur, and innovator with experience in clinical practice, biomedical research and healthcare innovation. Dr. Kraft has chaired the Medicine Track for Singularity University since SU's inception, and founded and is Executive Director of Exponential Medicine, a program that explores convergent, rapidly developing technologies and their potential in biomedicine and healthcare. Following undergraduate degrees from Brown University and medical school at Stanford, Daniel was Board Certified in both Internal Medicine &amp; Pediatrics after completing a Harvard residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital &amp; Boston Children's Hospital, and fellowships in hematology, oncology and bone marrow transplantation at Stanford.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Dr. Kraft, </p>
<p>Since we've mapped the genome, there has been discussion for universal mapping and eventually it's implications for health insurance i.e. Patient has P53 mutation and is more prone to a multitude of malignancies and is therefore a more risky subject for insuring. My question is 2 parted. </p>
<p>1) do you feel each person will have their genome mapped as a standard of care soon?
2) do you believe this will have implications for health insurance? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
