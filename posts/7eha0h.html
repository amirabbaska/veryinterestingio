<p>And, to keep everybody's hopes up, allow me to highlight the following quote: &quot;<em>It is concluded that although reaching the object is challenging, there seem to be viable options based on current and near term technology.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Can we get on board of this? Special shoutout to Redditors from JPL, ESA and other space agencies .... Any ideas?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest problem here is a realistic launch date.</p>
<p>The longer we wait to launch this mission, the faster a spacecraft will have to travel to reach it. The worse-case-scenario outlined in the cited paper is launch in 2025, which is still massively optimistic - consider that the Cassini mission was first considered in earnest around 1982, and didn't launch until 1997.</p>
<p>A launch date around 2025 puts the spacecraft-asteroid encounter somewhere around 2055, well past the orbit of Pluto. The big problem there is that the relative velocity between spacecraft and asteroid then becomes an issue - the spacecraft is moving much too fast to realistically slow down and do much science, much less land on the object.</p>
<p>One option considered in the paper during such a fast flyby is the release of an impactor from the spacecraft to be followed up by mass spec readings. In other words, hit the asteroid with something and watch what comes out. We've already done something like this with the Deep Impact mission, so this is flight-proven technology.</p>
<p>This is probably the most important science that could be done there, since we already have spectra (albeit not great spectra) of the outside surface. That's basically just looking at the weathered crust of the asteroid, though - after traveling hundreds of thousands of years through space, cosmic rays have heavily resurfaced the outer layer of the object. Knowing the internal composition of the asteroid, though, is probably the most important piece of data we could collect, as it gives us all kinds of clues to its origin, its formation, etc.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Any realistic launch date means the spacecraft must have a very fast flyby. Out best bet is to hit the asteroid with something during that brief flyby and watch what comes out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of people don’t realize how long it takes to design/build/test/launch a spacecraft/payload. It takes a LONG time (&gt;10 yrs sometimes) and a LOT of money (billions), and usually it takes a long time to even get the money. We’re still working very hard to make Mars sample return a reality, and that has been decades in the making. Not to burst anyone’s bubble here, but we’d need some space race style unification, prioritization, and funding to make this happen.</p>
<p>Also, something that is not commonly understood is that the level of technology we feel comfortable flying is about a decade behind industry (not to mention research). Likely, this rule would apply to the use of these new propulsive technologies mentioned. They would be a hard sell for a mission of the scope/cost described without being thoroughly proven first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If 3 of these are entering and leaving the solar system at any given time and there are 10,000 out there would it not be more practical to first work on some sort of tracking and identification system rather than chasing the first one identified (assuming such a technology can be developed or is even possible). Then we could 'choose' the right target at the right time with more favourable conditions. Like object x will be at this nearest location in 20 years etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rather than talking payloads, high-velocity, and up-close/traditional missions... can we chip off a sample using a more ham-fisted approach?</p>
<p>If a high-energy concussive force can break loose a few chunks, maybe one will stay in Solar orbit.  We'd have more time to analyze and retrieve the sample.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  Engineering intuition frequently involves &quot;Can't we just blow it up?&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
