		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So say a population of birds goes off and splits in two, through some random environmental means such as a major storm pushes them into unfamiliar but beneficial territory, or the group just wanders off.</p>
<p>Those two isolated groups will then interbreed amongst themselves, and their respective gene pools will tilt toward one prediction or other.</p>
<p>Eventually, through all this interbreeding and mutation etc, those two bird populations, originally of the same species, are now separate species. This means they can no longer produce viable offspring, or if they can produce living offspring, said offspring cannot produce viable/living offspring of their own. This is known as a post-zygotic isolation.</p>
<p>Pre-zygotic isolation is when the group(s) somehow diverge in habitat, behavior, temporal and mechanical parts/traits. There is also gametic isolation patterns that can come into play here. Generally this means that the birds can no longer inhabit the same area of space, their mating signals differ slightly enough to discourage interbreeding, they wake/sleep/mate at different times, and their genitalia are no longer compatible. Any of these isolations can create speciation within a group over a period of time.</p>
<p>Speciation can occur in a group that is split as well as a geographically identical population. Any manner of these pre-zygotic (before mating period) isolation factors can occur in either of these instances.</p>
<p>Sorry if not clear, on mobile.</p>
<p>Edit: wow guys I'm glad this got the discussion flowing! So I'm still on mobile, and I am currently a passenger in a car and I get sick if I look down too long, plus I have to go to school early in the morning. </p>
<p>SO, if anyone feels like answering the comments or whatever then feel free, I'm far from an expert. I'm actually attending school for a BA in Biology so that's how I managed to answer this very fundamental question.</p>
<p>That being said, any flaws in my logic, please feel free to correct them! Sources would be very helpful for things like case studies, as I find this really interesting and would love to learn more about this subject!</p>
<p>I'll try to get some more info from my professor tomorrow if you guys would like, so yeah! Thank you for this question to OP and thank you for all the additional information!</p>
<p>Edit: Wow so this really blew up over night...
I guess to summarize, one species can become two or more through various processes such as geological splitting and behavioral differences, and this happens over a long period of time, and is not a concrete explanation, as many have felt free to point out.
I guess if you want a better answer then you can check out the evolutionary biologist's comment thread.
Again, NONE OF THIS IS CONCRETE, just a single explanation in a sea of multiple explanations to similar sets of questions. This is also what I learned in class, and again I am not an expert.
This is also ELI5, not Scientific Discourse 410. I know my explanation was a bit more complicated than what one would tell a 5 year old (not that I would know, I don't talk to kids much anyway), but it's the simplest I could make it while typing it out on a tiny screen on an hour drive and trying to get as much relevant information as possible out there.
All that being said, I think this will be the end for me here. Just wanted to say that I acknowledge defeat, and I look forward to continuing to read what you all have to say. Thank you for all your replies! It'll be slow going, but I'll try to read them all!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kinda late here but as an evolutionary biologist I thought I would add my input.</p>
<p>The question you are asking is essentially: When are 2 living beings different enough to be considered different species?</p>
<p>The short, and frustrating, answer is there is no one definitive way. Makes sense though, the natural world doesn't act in absolutes, but we as humans like to. I'll explain how we do it, but first let me ask you a question to think about: When does red become orange on the color spectrum? Surely it does as anyone would agree, but exactly where? Tough to say. Depends on who's looking, who you're asking, how you define red and orange. Lots of different things come in to play.</p>
<p>Anyway. The most agreed upon way is that if 2 animals can reproduce and have a viable AND fertile offspring, then they are the same. Otherwise they are different.</p>
<p>Viable = able to live.</p>
<p>Fertile = able to reproduce.</p>
<p>So, for instance, if a human and a horse attempt to reproduce, they would have an inviable (and therefore infertile) offspring. So they are different species.</p>
<p>If a Donkey and a Horse reproduce they actually have a viable offspring. A mule. However, a mule is not fertile, so therefore cannot reproduce, so we call horses and donkeys different species.</p>
<p>And finally, if 2 horses reproduce they have a viable and fertile offspring and are therefore considered the same species.</p>
<p>This is why ALL dogs are considered the same species according to a biologist, despite the remarkable differences between a chihuahua and a Great Dane.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, there are exceptions to this. One example is in Giraffes. There are considered to be a handful of different species of giraffes in Africa (5 or 6, can't exactly remember). But the only difference between them are subtle differences in the patterns of spots in their hide. If and individual of one species got together with an individual of another and decided to reproduce they would produce a viable and fertile offspring. So why don't we say there is one one species of giraffe in Africa, similar to dogs? Because, as far as we can tell, these different species NEVER reproduce with each other naturally. They all mind there own business, have their own territories and are all separate from each other, so we go ahead and say they are different species.</p>
<p>Similar exceptions can be found all over the world. And of course it gets much more complicated when we start trying to differentiate between single-cell organisms/bacteria/viruses especially are very odd and full of exceptions to our rules.</p>
<p>Anyway, hope this helps!</p>
<p>Speciation is the term you should do research on if you want more info. It's actually a very interesting area of evolution and is often overlooked!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an analogy. There is a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Color_gradient_illustrating_a_sorites_paradox_with_labels.png" target="_blank">color gradient</a> that starts green, then every pixel, becomes slightly more red. Between every 1, 2, or even 10 pixels, there is no noticable color change. However, if you look at the colors between 10,000 pixels, there is a change. So where is this &quot;line&quot; between green and red drawn? Well, you can't draw a line. There is no distinguishable boundary between the two colors.
Let's pretend that the green color is the predecessor to the horse, and the red a horse. Every pixel represents a generation. Each generation is essentially exactly alike to its offspring and its parents. Yet over time, there is change. </p>
<p>When talking about species, the term almost abitrary. Although horses and donkeys are considered different species, 100,000 years ago, they were the same. They would produce fertile offspring 100% of the time. Then 90,000 years ago, they were 90% likely to produce fertile offspring, so on and so forth. Even today, there is a small chance that a donkey and a horse can produce a fertile offspring. When is the line drawn? As you can see, it's is quite tough to categorize species, especially when looking at them in such a micro point of view. </p>
<p>tl dr there is no one clear &quot;line&quot; that separates 2 species. Instead, think of evolution as a gradient, where over hundreds or even thousands of generations there is change, but no clear cut single point. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since nature doesn't give a shit about the human affection for neat categories, the idea that there's a bright clear dividing line where you can say &quot;Yep, those are different species.&quot; isn't really true.</p>
<p>The mechanism underlying whether speciation (i.e., two populations of the same species are becoming separate species) is occurring is called &quot;gene flow&quot;.   </p>
<p>If there is adequate gene flow between two populations, the genetic structures of the populations are unlikely to diverge enough for them to speciate.</p>
<p>If gene flow is inadequate, then the genetic structure of each population starts accumulating their own unique mutations.   </p>
<p>Past a certain point it may be the case that mating between members of the two population <strong>can't</strong> produce viable offspring, but it can also be the case that hybrids are entirely viable but, under normal circumstances, the two populations simply <strong>don't</strong> interbreed.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species" target="_blank">Ring species</a> are an interesting example of the concept.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From Richard Dawkins' <em>The Tyranny of the Discontinuous Mind</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a time machine could serve up to you your 200 million greats grandfather, you would eat him with sauce tartare and a slice of lemon. He was a fish. Yet you are connected to him by an unbroken line of intermediate ancestors, every one of whom belonged to the same species as its parents and its children.</p>
<p>“I’ve danced with a man who’s danced with a girl, who’s danced with the Prince of Wales”, as the song goes. I could mate with a woman, who could mate with a man, who could mate with a woman who . . . after a sufficient number of steps into the past . . . could mate with ancestral fish, and produce fertile offspring. To invoke our time machine again, you probably could not mate with Australopithecus (at least not produce fertile offspring) but you are connected to Australopithecus by an unbroken chain of intermediates who could interbreed with their neighbours in the chain every step of the way. And the chain goes on backwards, unbroken, to that Devonian fish and beyond. On the way, about six million years into the past, we would encounter the ancestor we share with modern chimpanzees. It so happens that the intermediates, like the common ancestor itself, are all extinct. But for that (perhaps fortunate) fact, we would be connected to modern chimpanzees by an unbroken chain of intermarrying links. Not just intermarrying but interbreeding – producing fertile offspring. There would be no clear separation between Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes. The only way to maintain our human-privileging laws and morals would be to set up courts to decide whether particular individuals could ‘pass for human’, like the ludicrous courts with which apartheid South Africa decided who could ‘pass for white’.</p>
<p>And of course the argument extends to any pair of species you care to name. But for the extinction of the intermediates which connect humans to the ancestor we share with pigs (it pursued its shrew-like existence 85 million years ago in the shadow of the dinosaurs), and but for the extinction of the intermediates that connect the same ancestor to modern pigs, there would be no clear separation between Homo sapiens and Sus scrofa. You could breed with X who could breed with Y who could breed with ( . . . fill in several thousand intermediates . . .) who could produce fertile offspring by mating with a sow.</p>
<p>Humans are clearly separable from chimpanzees and pigs and fish and lemons only because the intermediates that would otherwise link them in interbreeding chains happen to be extinct. This is not to deny that we are different from other species. We certainly are different and the differences are important – important enough to justify eating them (vegetables are our cousins too). But it is a reason for scepticism of any philosophy or theology (or morality or jurisprudence or politics) that treats humanness, or personhood, as some kind of essentialist absolute, which you either definitely have or definitely don’t have. If your theology tells you that humans should receive special respect and moral privilege as the only species that possesses a soul, you have to face up to the awkward question of when, in human evolution, the first ensouled baby was born. Was it when the first Homo sapiens baby was born to parents belonging to whatever species is considered to be our immediate predecessor (erectus, ergaster, heidelbergensis, rhodesiensis, no matter, the argument stands regardless)? There was no such baby! There never was a ‘first’ Homo sapiens. It is only the discontinuous mind that insists on drawing a hard and fast line between a species and the ancestral species that birthed it. Evolutionary change is gradual: there never was a line, never a line between any species and its evolutionary precursor.</p>
