I for example, sneeze very violently and loudly no matter how much I try to control it. Other people I know are able to sneeze soft and quietly. What is it that accounts for these differences?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your questions refers to a violent sneeze and a loud sneeze, which are two different things. Others have discussed the reason for a violent sneeze. </p>
<p>However, the noise we make when sneezing is entirely social. We mimic what other peoples sneezes sound like, or at least what we think it should sound like. More than likely if your parents yell loudly when sneezing, you probably do too. </p>
<p>So what sound does a deaf person make when sneezing? Nothing. They don't make a sound. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's certainly a combination of variables. </p>
<p>Social circumstances can affect how obnoxious we are willing to be with our sneezing, or coughing. Either trying to be obnoxious or trying to be stealthier and more controlled.</p>
<p>Then there's the threshold or subjective sensations your body feels when it wants to sneeze. We all feel subjective amounts of tickling on our bodies, the same is true of what our nose can take before it has to release itself. Stuffy nose, runny nose, foreign particles caught in nose hairs, etc. All affect what has to be discharged and how aggressively. </p>
<p>I have read that muting sneezes is bad for you because it's very easy to rupture blood vessels, especially in your eyes. Definitely not a good idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll take a stab at it. It's partly due to biology, like the volume in one's lungs, one's nasal cavity, how strongly one experiences the itchy feeling of a sneeze, etc... but more than any other thing, how you sneeze is due to social conditioning.</p>
<p>If you were conditioned to minimize your sneezes into the most timid, silent things as a kid, then that's probably how you are as an adult. If you thought it was cute to do a little hiccup giggle thing as you cover your face and flutter your eyes, or manly to roar and blink furiously, or <whatever> to sneeze a certain way as a kid, then you probably sneeze that way as an adult. And that makes up the biggest difference for why some people sneeze violently and others seem hardly effected by a sneeze.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I don't understand is why some people have to yell/scream when sneezing.   I get the large volume of air movement, but what does that have to do with your vocal cords??</p>
<p>Can't we just inhale deeply and sneeze? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's learned behaviour. Listen to deaf people sneeze sometime, they're quiet as fuck.</p>
<p>People who sneeze obnoxiously loudly do it because they've learned to sneeze obnoxiously loudly, just like people who fart really loudly on purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
