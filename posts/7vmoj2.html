		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very careful simulation based on testing data. Engineers have experimentally gathered data about all the different materials used to make the telescope. This data includes failure points given applied loads, vibrational frequencies, etc. They can use this along with a computational model of the sattelite to predict how it responds to the forces of launch. They design can use the results of these models to improve/change the sattelite design so that it can withstand the forces of launch.</p>
<p>That said, It probably takes some clever engineering on the part of the mirror to make sure that forces are applied evenly to it during launch. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also the mirrors are over-designed to be much more clear than they need to be so that it can survive its mission even if it gets hit and damaged by space dust.</p>

So one of the simulations they run will be from Maryland sound internaitonal, dont work there anymore. They will build a giant circle 20 or so feet in the air of speakers and subs. and then blast the shit out of the object with 1 million watts of sound. They literally recreates the vibrations and sound of a rocket taking off. After the test is done the object will be completely looked over for any damage. Then the object goes back into the center and gets tested again. This is call DFAT, Direct field acoustical testing. They will also change up the random noise generator to make it lower or higher frequency to pin point a range of what is causing issues on the object. These test can be days long to months depending on what they are testing and time to repair. Here are some pictures to see what the rig looks like: <a href="http://msi-dfat.com/" target="_blank">http://msi-dfat.com/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked at NASA Goddard for a few years where they were actually doing exactly the kind of testing you're asking about, and I was involved in similar testing while I was there (for a different instrument, but same procedure). </p>
<p>Essentially what we do is strap the instrument to a massive vibrating table, and expose it to the same vibrational frequencies that it would experience while actually being in the rocket. We have to do this three times in a row, but for three different directions (x, y, and z axis of the instrument). Of course there are tons of g-force monitors all over the instrument, recording how the instrument responds to the different vibrational frequencies. In between each axis change, and after the instrument has finished vibe testing, the engineers perform tests and checks to make sure everything still operates correctly and that nothing broke. This is the kind of thing that <em>every</em> spacecraft has to go through. </p>
<p>I posted elsewhere a video I took of the JWST team doing a round of vibe testing on the telescope, here's what the instrument goes through on a regular basis:
