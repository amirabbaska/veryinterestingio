		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While they do control big airliners like you're familiar with, that's the easy part of their job. They also have to control hundreds regional jets, private jets, military aircraft and training exercises, helicopter tours, traffic choppers, banner towers, sky diving planes, pipe line patrol, police choppers and more. And that's not even mentioning all of the hundreds of pilot's in training flying around in Cessna Skyhawks doing random steep turns, practice instrument approaches and simulated emergency descents. </p>
<p>The big airliners will follow a strict schedule and flight paths, making those decisions easy, but no software can account for the random paths and speeds of all those other flights, all of which the air traffic control is responsible for communicating with and keeping safe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why people are coming up with such extravagant answers. The reason is that pilots are human. A computer can compensate with a lot but expects outputs to be acknowledged and followed. If the planes were automated we could automate the the rest of the system but since human pilots are harder for a computer to predict due to our inconsistencies we have to put a backup human in the middle as a translator. It's not the best system but in order to change to a better one every single aircraft has to be safely fully automated first. After that you can start to change air traffic control. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>Stressful</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, working a scope full of traffic was fun. Stressful was maintaining focus on a mid shift (overnight) when you have two aircraft on the scope and you must remain vigilant.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you guys actually do? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We keep 'em separated. Usually by altitude -- broadly speaking, aircraft travelling north or east get odd flight levels, while southern- and western-tending traffic go with even altitude assignments.  Aircraft at the same altitude will be separated by 3-5 miles depending on aircraft types.</p>
<p>We try to move them quickly toward their destination, by abbreviating their filed flight route through our airspace.  </p>
<p>We montior traffic, and let pilots know when they can expect to see another plane in their sky.  This canbe especially important below 18,000 feet, where there are lots of pilots flying on &quot;visual flight rules&quot; -- going wherever they like (within the FAA's established rules).</p>
<p>The magic word is &quot;co-ordinate&quot;.  You talk to your neighboring airspace controllers, whether they're sitting next to you or three states over.  Radar and tower talk to one another constantly. Everyone works as a team to do the job together, safely and expeditiously <em>in that order</em>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of decisions are you making that can't be made by software? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Software just doesn't do flexibilty as well as humans, and in ATC the variables are <em>constantly</em> changing.  Weather, time of day, and human whim impact takeoffs and arrivals directly, and it's much easier to have a human with judgement making calls versus trying to write a program that would cover all the possible eventualities.</p>
<p>edit to answer &quot;we can totally replace you with AI /  DeepMind / Wilson&quot;:</p>
<p>yeah, eventually.  </p>
<p>I think mainly it's a matter of a developer wanting to spend the resources necessary to create something that could replace controllers, or using those resources to automate something simpler.</p>
<p>It is worth pointing out that automation software (like <a href="http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/stars_dod/" target="_blank">STARS</a>) is already a thing. Software reduces the cognitive load on controllers and allows them to handle more traffic, but i think it will be at least 25 years before we need to worry about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3PfKf0ndik" target="_blank">TARS</a> calling traffic by himself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can speak to the &quot;why not computers&quot; part of the question, having done some work in the area of using AI for ATC operations. There's a few big issues right now that hold back use of AI for core ATC tasks like conflict resolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Poor data quality. Civilian aviation radar systems actually give a surprisingly crappy idea of where planes are and what they are doing. There's this big international effort to upgrade the entire ATC system with stuff that lets planes self-report their positions to ATC (and to each other) via standard protocols, based on high-precision data from the plane's own instruments and satnav. These transponders (called ADS-B) are now really common on planes but aren't going to be universal until after 2021 probably (keeps getting bumped back). Interestingly, these transponders are civilian-readable and are the reason why there's sites like Flightaware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No idea how to train AI to be good at some tasks. For example, conflict resolution, the classic problem of determining when two planes might be in a position to hit each other soon and deciding what to do about it, and then issuing relevant orders to the planes. This is something that humans can do well but that AI does poorly. This obstacle might be removed in the future because deep learning is magical and makes absolutely anything possible. (I sound sarcastic here but there is a real potential for a big leap; ATC conflict resolution feels like one of those tasks that deep learning is born to solve.) No clear path exists for doing it anytime soon, though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No infrastructure for communicating orders from machines to planes. This is actually getting fixed alongside the ADS-B thing discussed above. Planes are getting text message systems that let them get ATC messages and send/receive messages to each other (important for future plans to let pilots negotiate transocean/transpolar routes dynamically with each other based on conditions, and other cool ideas). But the implementation so far has been rudimentary and crappy. That could change soon, however.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Job protections. The EU is very friendly to its ATC people, and they are one of the biggest civilian skies around in terms of traffic. US, less friendly these days but still friendly. Puts pressure on everything and everyone to keep humans in the loop.</p>
</li>
<li>Feels better. People don't trust AI more than they trust humans—yet. This is likely to change as driverless cars come into common use and people learn that AI is vastly better than humans at certain things, like, say, driving. Perceptions will change, and then policy may follow.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that said, there's been a ton of AI use in lots of different aspects of Air Traffic Management (ATM), a broader thingy that includes ATC as a subset. Basically all decisions about how and where to route aircraft as a result of weather-related disruptions in the US for example are being made by AI systems. All sorts of other stuff is now AI-based or is trending that way. So it may become the case rather quickly that only certain core ATC tasks are done by humans, while others take a lot longer to automate.</p>
<p>Whereupon there will no longer be any need for ATC, because nobody will have jobs that let them buy plane tickets. The 0.01% can then just use their ADS-B systems and aviation-grade text messaging systems and AI-based route negotiation systems to manage the tiny amounts of traffic of their private jets as they float safely above the tumultuous robot-vs-human wars raging below.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
