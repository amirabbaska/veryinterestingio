		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From Wikipedia: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Mikhail Lermontov's &quot;The Fatalist&quot; (1840), one of five novellas comprising his A Hero of Our Time, a minor character places a gun with an unknown number of bullets to his head, pulls the trigger and survives. However, the term &quot;Russian roulette&quot; does not appear in the story.</p>
<p>The term &quot;Russian roulette&quot; was possibly first used in an eponymous 1937 short story by Georges Surdez. However, the story describes using a gun with one empty chamber out of six, instead of five empty chambers out of six:</p>
<p>'Did you ever hear of Russian Roulette?' ... with the Russian army in Romania, around 1917... some officer would suddenly pull out his revolver, anywhere, at the table, remove a cartridge from the cylinder, spin the cylinder, snap it back in place, put it to his head and pull the trigger. There were five chances to one that the hammer would set off a live cartridge and blow his brains all over the place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with all things it started in a book long ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is the most commonly given explanation in Russia (by Russians):</p>
<p>During the bolshevik revolution a lot of the soldiers and officers in what was at the time known as the white army (which was opposed to what would become known as the red army) were depressed at the bleak prospects and the general state of the post-tsar Russia, and they were, eventually destroyed. But this fatalistic/suicidal attitude toward the end was prevalent and gave rise to the game of playing with one's life in a social setting as it made no difference in the end, the end was already evident and inevitable. Around the same time a lot of the white army officers managed to flee Russia to the west, hence bringing with them some of these tales. </p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>To answer some of the questions asked in the comments below - my grandfather was an officer in the Russian army, he spent his life time in the Russian military and was also an avid student of history. This was one of many stories I've heard from him and his side of the family, but I should point out, I've heard the same story from other unrelated sources in Russia, so I've kind of always taken it for granted that this was the established origin of the term Russian roulette. A cursory search of google can show more in-depths discussions of this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a specific Russian made revolver, forgot the actual name of it. But when one cartridge is left in the cylinder it would always land on the bottom when spun. The owner of said gun would then put it to their own head and pull the trigger, knowing that the third person to participate would die. </p>
<p>Edit: Nagant M1895 revolver used</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I've heard from a friend in the military is that it was a test used to see if soldiers had cleaned and oiled their pistols. A clean pistol would always mean that the chamber with the bullet in it would end at the bottom since it was heaviest, so if the gun was cleaned they could safely pull the trigger knowing it would not be lined up with a loaded chamber </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Russian's were known for doing reckless things, so whether they invented the term or not it seemed like something Russians would do.</p>
<p>There was a game called &quot;Cuckoo&quot; where an officer would stand on a table in the middle of a room with a pistol. They'd turn off the lights and other officers would hide behind furniture and yell &quot;Cuckoo&quot; and the officer on the table would fire at the sound. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
