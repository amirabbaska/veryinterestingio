		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>GPS is actually a remarkably simple piece of technology, at least in its concept. You have a series of satellites in known places in orbit equipped with atomic clocks that send out a constant radio signal that simplified is essentially &quot;Hello I'm satellite 3, the current time is XX:XX:XX&quot;</p>
<p>By knowing the current time when the satellite message was sent, and it's position, and the speed at which the message traveled (the speed of light) you can triangulate your position on the earth. The more satellites you get a fix on, the more accurate your position.</p>
<p>But Einstein did contribute one mind blowing thing to the GPS network.</p>
<p>He theorized that time was not a constant, and that the speed of time varies depending on your relativistic speed. The faster you move, the slower time flows for you. And at the speed of light time essentially freezes. To prove this they put two atomic clocks in perfect sync and placed them in a tower. One at ground level, and one up high. Since the second clock is higher off earths surface it's rotating around the earth at a higher speed than the one on the ground.</p>
<p>After a couple of months they checked the clocks and sure enough the clock up in the towers clock had slowed down, not by a lot mind you, but just enough to prove Einstein's theory.</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with GPS?</p>
<p>Since the GPS satellites are in <del>Geo-synchronus</del> medium orbit they are very high off the Earth's surface and therefore moving very fast. Since time is critical to the GPS system they have to constantly update the clocks on the satellites to be in sync with themselves and on the ground because for them time moves at a slightly slower rate than those on the ground!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Time dilation. Essentially both you and the satellite cannot agree on how time passes without applying Einstein's formulas stipulated in both the Special and General Theories of relativity. Yes there are two effects. Time agreement on when signals leave and arrive is critical to triangulate your position since you are far away from the satellites and they/you are moving all the time. One nanosecond error equals 1ft distance error.</p>
<p>Special Relativity: Because you and any GPS satellite in orbit have a relative velocity (one of you is moving, from the other's perspective), both will observe the other's clock to tick slower. </p>
<p>General Relativity: Because both you and the GPS satellite experience different gravitational accelerations (gravity is higher for you as it is for the satellites), clocks close to you tick slower than clocks close to the satellite.</p>
<p>Both effects counter each other where GPS tech is concerned but not exactly. But accounting for only one of the two is not sufficient. The combined effects add up to clocks drifting apart by 38000 nanoseconds a day if unaccounted for by both theories, making GPS tech impossible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
