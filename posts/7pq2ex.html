		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The signals don't interfere because they use different bands of wavelengths.  They just pass right by each other.</p>
<p>Wireless signals are sent out in all directions, or in a broad range of directions.  It doesn't need to &quot;find&quot; the receiving device: rather, the receiving device just needs to hear the transmitter.  Think of it like this: when I am shouting at you in a room, my voice doesn't need to &quot;find&quot; you.  I make noise that travels in pretty much every direction... you just need to hear it.</p>
<p>When you're driving, you're moving at best maybe 80-100 mph.  That's NOTHING compared to the speed that radio/cell/wifi signals travel.  As far as the signal is concerned, you might as well be staying still.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What everyone has said thus far is true, the different frequencies are used to cut down on inteference, but that doesn't mean interference doesn't exist between close frequencies. A lot of design work is set in place to keep signals from having too much &quot;phase noise&quot;, or too high &quot;harmonic interference&quot; which will affect nearby frequencies.</p>
<p>Things like WiFi use different channels to control interference, 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi only uses 14 channels but the standard is set up for only 3 channels to be used at a time so they don't overlap. (If you were to look up a Wi-Fi channels image you would see that some of the channels overlap in frequency)</p>
<p>The other thing I see mentioned is the coding that's used. What most new transmitters use is a digital code of random bits to modulate the data that wants to be sent in a specific way only known by the transmitter and by whoever wants to receive it. In the cell phone bands these signals are set up to be orthogonal to all other cell phone signals so only you and the person on the other line hear your call. (Orthogonal also means perpendicular, this whole thing is a way more complicated concept than what I can do in an ELI5) </p>
<p>This coding is very useful though and is actually a great way to keep signals from interfering with each other. The US uses CDMA for coding but another similar coding concept to this is DSSS (direct sequence spread spectrum) </p>
<p>I can definitely talk more but typing this on my phone on the train, </p>

<p>Edit: 14 Wi-Fi channels, realized I typed the wrong number</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like the alphabet.
you have several devices all broadcasting a separate letter.
so you have device a)sending AAAAAAAAA
and device b)sending BBBBBBBB
and device c)sending CCCCCCCCC an so on..
now if you could see the radio spectrum it would look kind of like
ABCCBBAAACCDGGGSSSJJJJLLLLLLLLBBBASSBBKKK
an alphabet soup if you would of all the different signals. Now the receiving devices are only set to receive their one particular letter, like your cellphone only looks for C's.. so in the above alphabet soup it would only pick up
CCCC
your wireless router is set to only pick up B so it just receives
the BBBBBB's and so on..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So far a lot of the answers are glossing around the interference issue, or giving incorrect information.</p>
<p>If you open your Wi-fi settings and see a dozen or more Wi-fi networks, those are all sharing the <em>same</em> frequencies. Even though there are multiple Wi-fi channels, there aren't enough to completely separate all of the different Wi-fi hot spots you often find in a typical neighborhood or building these days.</p>
<p>Plus, consider the fact that all of the devices in your room are all communicating with the same router at the same time. They definitely all interfere with each other.</p>
<p>The correct answer is that a lot of interference happens, and a huge part of making mobile data and Wi-fi all work is dealing with that interference.</p>
<p>There are lots of techniques to try to minimize interference, even when multiple devices are all communicating using the same frequency. Using multiple antennas to pinpoint the direction of each device can help separate their signals, for example.</p>
<p>However, a huge piece of it is that all forms of network communication involve a lot of re-trying and re-sending of data.</p>
<p>Internet data packets are about 1500 bytes each. Voice data packets are typically only about 5 ms worth of audio data.</p>
<p>Your device tries to send the packets to the router as fast as it can. Each packet has a lot of information about where it came from and its sequence number, and information about how to verify that it wasn't corrupted. The router acknowledges each packet. If a packet got dropped or the interference was too high, it asks for it to be transmitted again.</p>
<p>This retransmission normally happens so fast that the overall data stream is barely affected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
