		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is in part structure- and code-based. In addition, it is also signal-based. Below is a rather simplistic description of what goes on without discussing how it happens. May be able to provide one later if you are interested. Unfortunately my lunch break today was rather short.</p>
<p>I'll try to illustrate this by a rather simplified system of three nervecells, where the first one reaches from skin-surface to the spinal-cord. There are different types of these &quot;first-order&quot;-neurons: some are only responsible for  &quot;reporting&quot; on pain, some do vibrations, pressure or stretch. Temperature and pressure can, if stimulated very strongly or over pro-long time also signal pain (code-based). </p>
<p>What a specific neuron detects will depend on its set of membrane-proteins, which can be activated by for instance mechanic stimulation or by presence of a molecule. When the receptor is activated, this will lead to a generation of a signal, that will move from the &quot;skin-end&quot; of the cell to the &quot;spinal-cord-end&quot; of the same cell. Also the structure of this end of the neuron affects which type of signals it will respond to. If you want to look them up, you can search for Ruffini-and Pacinian endings, Meissner- and Merckels corpuscules and nociceptors.</p>
<p>Here, it will release neurotransmitters in order to activate the second cell in the series. This 2nd order neuron stretches from the spinal cord all the way up to the brain. On its way, it can give off collaterals to other spinal cord regions, which can be involved in processes such as pain modulation. A 2nd order neuron will usually terminate somewhere between Medulla oblonggata and Thalamus. Here, it can It will, just like the 1st neuron, signal to a 3:rd one to carry the signal further. The 3:rd order neuron will be mainly responsible for your to be aware of where the sensation occurs, by projecting to the somatosensory cortex and to more associative areas, which will make it possible to analyse what you think of said sensation and what you think you should do about it. (Some part of your experience will also depend on activation of amygdala, but I am not sure if this can occur directly via 2nd order neuron or via 3:rd order).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So as others have pointed out there are specific pathways that signals from nerves take to get to your brain. While this does play a part in the overall sense perceived there are a myriad of other factors at play here. Things like receptive fields, top-down control, hi-pass filtering, and receptive maps all play a part in the generation of a specific stimulus.
First off the area of your brain that encodes for sensations from your skin and inside your body is the somatosensory cortex. This area is where all the information regarding your sense of touch ends up, it also contains topographical maps of your body which aids in the localization of particular stimuli. By this I mean that the neuronal pathways and axonal projections from particular parts of your body all cluster together, so the neurons associated with your fingers are separated from the neurons associated with your face. This helps with localization of sensations as the area that's activated when you get punched in the face is different than the area that gets activated when you stub your toe or prick your finger.
Besides the localization of senses, These neurons also all encode for different types of stimuli through the usage of Receptive Fields (RFs). RFs are essentially the preferred stimulus that a neuron encodes for. So in your skin in particular you have different cell types that are all adapted to respond to different signals. there are a few primary receptive neurons in your skin, These are called pacinian corpuscles, ruffini corpuscles, Merkel's disks, free nerve endings, and Meissner corpuscles. These cells all respond to touch based sensations but are adapted to respond best to different specific stimuli. For example, Merkel's disks respond best to touch and pressure whereas free nerve endings respond best to pain, temperature, and crude touch. These specific stimuli are their RFs and when they are activated by these stimuli they send a strong signal  on to the brain. Because of this strong signal that is sent to the brain from a specific receptive cell, the brain is able to encode for a particular sense based on these factors and the location in the brain the stimulus ends up.
This brings us into the concept of sensory maps (SMs). SMs are ordered arrangements of RFs in a particular region of the brain. These respond to stimulus quality and spatial maps (the area the sense was generated). For touch based sensations these are located in the somatosensory cortex. Through the activation of these SMs your brain is able to designate what a specific sense is. So a hot feeling is sent to a SM that is specific to RFs for hot feelings. Same thing with pain and touch.
It should also be noted that the receptive fields in your primary receptive cells are small and simple. They activate optimally to basic concepts like hot, cold, stretch, pain, and touch and start on single pathways. Once these signals reach your brain however, emergent RFs come about (these are RFs that your primary receptive cell may not be encoding for) and the signal grows as it synapses onto other neuronal pathways. This is why you feel as many different senses as you do, and are able to describe each sensation greater than just saying something hurts or is cold.
While the location in the brain a signal ends up is the way your brain is able to encode for different stimuli, there are other factors that can affect your sensory perception. High-pass filtering is huge in helping determine what signals are actually encoded for and what signals aren't. High-pass filtering occurs in your thalamus and it acts as a buffer to all incoming stimuli. It does this by only allowing stimuli that have a great enough action potential to pass through to a SM in your somatosensory cortex. This eliminates all of the noisy signals that you body picks up on, but aren't important enough to actually perceive. Things like pain have large action potentials so it will almost always be able to get to its designated SM whereas something like pressure from sitting might eventually be cut off, causing you to not really perceive sensorily.
There is also the concept of Top-down control of your nervous system. This is basically saying that your brain is what determines everything and the rest of your nervous system is just there to send signals to it so that it can decide what to do with them. This concept gets especially interesting when thinking about phantom limb syndrome (PLS). This occurs in people who have suffered an amputation but still feel stimuli from the affected limb despite the fact that it isn't there anymore. This relates to top-down control because it means that your peripheral nerve cells aren't actually responsible for encoding for a sense, as if that was the case sufferers of Phantom limb would not still feel pain/sensation in the lost limb.
There is a ton of other things that affect how your brain encodes for particular stimuli from your skin such as the protein receptors that get activated under the effect of certain stimuli as well as the proximity of neurons to other neurons causing signals to jump around and cause stimuli to be felt in areas besides the affected area. But the big thing that decides how you feel is the area of the brain that a signal eventually ends up in, and how this particular area encodes for a particular stimuli.
Hope this answers your question and then some. Also sorry for any grammatical mistakes and please do correct me if you see something I said that was wrong</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have just a minor addition.  In your title, you mentioned heat and cold signals, but we don't actually feel either.  What we feel is the rate of heat leaving or entering our body, not the temperature of the object.  This is why the metal part of your seatbelt might be painful in summer while the nylon part is not even though both are the same temperature -- the metal has much higher thermal conductivity and thus transfers heat to your skin much more swiftly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The very simple answer to your question is different receptors. Receptors are specific to a stimuli, connected neurons are specific to a location, and this combination of specific sensation with specific location is what the brain uses to interpret most sensations.  Hence why phantom limb can exist (in the brain the neurons are still associated to a location even if it no longer exists).</p>
<p>Understanding taste neurologically gives a great model of how the body and brain communicate differences in signals.</p>
<p>For example, you can very easily distinguish between  the tastes &quot;bitter&quot; and &quot;spicy&quot;, but you cannot easily distinguish between the sensations on your tongue of &quot;spicy&quot; and &quot;physically hot&quot;. This is because the receptor for capsaicin is the same receptor for heat in taste buds. The brain often interprets these signals as pain and gives a varied response based on intensity.  Alternatively, the taste receptors for bitter foods function (exclusively?) as chemoreceptors which take in specific, potentially toxic or unpleasant chemicals and transmit that signal to the brain down its own path. The neurons just fire, they don't scream &quot;ahh it's bitter&quot; to your entire  brain. The brain receives a signal from the neurons that it knows are attached to bitter receptors and it uses that information to cause a reaction to the bitter food. If you got something extremely poisonous on your tongue, the neurons associated with bitter receptors would fire very rapidly and your brain would know something is horribly wrong down by the bitter receptors.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, individual neurons are not too complicated and focus on receiving, modulating/amplifying, and then outputting no signal or a signal of varied intensity. This is the limitation of communication that most neurons have, so they must work together to create systems which help them to break down and properly communicate specific things downstream. Oftentimes the brain will rely on its own complex system of layered neurons to properly interpret a complex series of signals from around the body. This is distinctly the case for olfaction (smell), but also is the case way downstream at areas of the brain where specific details about stimuli are interpreted (such as object orientation in the visual field).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
