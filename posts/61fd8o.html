		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Personally I think that the creator probably chose the 10m block time so Bitcoin can run on more computers and use less bandwidth. This bandwidth is incredibly important as the currency grows, more bandwidth is needed for each update. </p>
<p>It would also be a lot easier to mine the Bitcoin, lowering the value as more is available to the market. </p>
<p>The amount of energy used per Bitcoin would also decrease drastically, meaning less security because there would be less risk to scammers that try to cheat the system and have to invest less money(electricity) </p>
<p>Here are is a more indepth look at the pro and cons:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a side note, Bitcoin will <em>not</em> replace our current system. It wasn't intended to get so popular when it launched. There are many people working on newer blockchain currencies taht have many improvements, one of them is faster block minutes. The reason why these aren't released yet is that they don't want to split up the community. It will be released when it's done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, this is something Bitcoin Unlimited  (a proposed fork of the chain) is supposed to do. Exchanges won't support it, though. There was some kind of letter signed by the major exchanges such as Bitfinex and BTCchina that said that even if more miners mine BTC unlimited that they will not consider it the &quot;real&quot; bitcoin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
