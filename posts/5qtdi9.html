		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In some ways, this is a meaningless question.</p>
<p>The term &quot;noble gas&quot; refers to chemical properties, and element 118 doesn't exist long enough to really do chemistry (in a real, macroscopic sense). Secondly, as you go down the periodic table to heavier atoms, all of the &quot;rules&quot; that terms like &quot;noble gas&quot; and &quot;halogen&quot; are based off of become a lot less fixed. For example, the noble gasses go from &quot;doesn't react&quot; to &quot;yeah, you can make stable compounds of this and put it in a bottle&quot;. By that point, the term itself doesn't mean a heck of a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other commenters have said, it is too unstable to really have chemical properties. Another issue is that with these very large electron clouds, the highest energy electrons begin to behave differently due to relativistic effects and instability. If you have a rock on a hill, it is in a high energy state and &quot;wants&quot; to go to a low energy state, and will do this by rolling down the hill of possible. A small force on the rock causes its position to become unstable and the rock falls down the hill. The taller and steeper the hill, the smaller the force required to destabilize the rock. </p>
<p>The same thing happens (kind of. Quantum effects make it a bit harder to explain) with electron clouds. High energy electrons want to go to a low energy state. However, the lower energy states are already filled in a big atom, so the electrons tend to transfer to other atoms instead. Because of this, it is very possible that oganesson would actually be reactive if it were not so radioactive. </p>
<p>Also keep in mind that even with more familiar so-called noble gasses, the distinction is more of a suggestion than a rule. Xenon can be made to react with fluorine, for example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you mean by noble gas. If you mean that it's p-orbital is completely filled with electrons, then yes, it would be. The reason most noble gases are not as reactive as the elements near to them is because they are electronically &quot;comfortable&quot; because their p-orbital orbital is completely filled. Conversely, that is why halogens are so reactive. They only need to take one electron away from some other element to become &quot;comfortable&quot; and they really really really wanna become comfortable.</p>
<p>Despite this, as you move down the periodic table, the characteristics that define groups of elements become less concrete. This is because electronic orbitals form father and father away from atomic nuclei as the elements get heavier and heavier. Because of this, the electrons are more able to interact with, and be taken away by, other reactive elements. This is why noble gases like xenon can form compounds with some very reactive elements like flouride.</p>
<p>Due to the reasons stated above, whole element 118 will technically be a noble gas because it's p-orbital orbital will probably be filled, it will be most likely be pretty highly reactive, giving it's classification as a noble gas very little meaning. </p>
<p>Also as some others have pointed out, there's some speculation that it might not even be a gas at STP, so I guess you could call it a noble metal at that point?</p>
<p>P.S. I typed this on mobile, so excuse typos.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: heavy element chemistry is weird and doesn't follow periodic trends. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Curious why my answer rec'd 3 negative votes given that it is correct. Note that I do not  assume that the &quot;last&quot; p orbital is filled, or even, crucially, that it makes any sense to put them in order; and am saying that the system that we've arranged the periodic table makes assumptions based on observations that we've made of existing elements of low atomic number. There could be an extension to atomic numbers of any integer, including atoms that have not been observed,  it wouldl be interesting to do this, but it is not likely that the 'aufbau' extends in the combinatorial way it is now sometimes understood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, if we compare  the artifically excited states 5g186f147d108p59s versus 5g186f147d108p6  of of Cadmium (or more correctly actual excited states of Cadmium 71) we see that the one with the filled p orbital has higher energy, not lower, than if a 9s  electron is allowed <a href="http://spectrograph.uk/index.html?domults.checked=true&dofine.checked=true&autocorrect.checked=false&finecorrect.checked=false&doConfig("5g186f147d108p59s;5g186f147d108p6",1,0" target="_blank">http://spectrograph.uk/index.html?domults.checked=true&dofine.checked=true&autocorrect.checked=false&finecorrect.checked=false&doConfig("5g186f147d108p59s;5g186f147d108p6",1,0</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Unbilinium has atomic number 120= 8 choose 3 so would be an alkaline earth metal, and atomic number 118 being two less would be a noble gas if the periodic table continued its system...
It also is true, however, that this structure in the periodic table depends on not only Schroedinger's equation (which implies the Hund rule), but also the Aufbau including some aspects of it which are unproven/unexplained. That is, the order in which orbitals tend to be filled as far as we can observe follows a pattern consistent with Schroedinger's equation, but not logically deducible from it, nor are the precise solutions of the equation known.  One can also try Hartree-Fock, but the ground state configuration of atomic number 118 is likely unknown still.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
