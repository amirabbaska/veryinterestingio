<p>When the reactor eventually corrodes and leaks fuel, it will add to the ocean's dilute supply of uranium. You wouldn't want to be right next to it, of course, where the leak is undiluted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You kind of have two possibilities here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The radioactive material dissolves and travels far from its source</p>
</li>
<li>The radioactive material doesn't dissolve and stays near the source</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first scenario, the dissolving also means dilution, and the further you get the radiation, the less radiation you get. So that sort of solves its own problem for the most part (you could imagine it not distributing evenly and thus having &quot;hot spots&quot; but that's about the worst of it).</p>
<p>In the second scenario, the radiation is only a problem directly near the reactor vessel, which is a small thing in a big ocean. (This is the most likely scenario in this case for a number of reasons.) Keep in mind that a submarine reactor uses highly-enriched uranium as its fuel, so the total volume and mass of fuel is a lot smaller than a reactor used for civilian power generation. </p>
<p>So either way, the problem is fairly reasonably contained. This argument also works, as an aside, with deep-sea dumping of nuclear waste — it sounds terrible but as far as means of keeping it away from human beings go, it's not the worst. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that it sank in 1963 as well — its radioactivity today is only a small fraction of what it would have been at the time of its sinking. And it is pretty far down there — the equivalent of being 775 building stories or so underwater. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 explanation: Seawater acts like a blanket and keeps the reactor from hurting anything, and also keeps it cool so it doesn't melt.</p>
<p>ELI15 explanation: Water is an incredible insulator against radiation, absorbing the neutrons released in fission (as in a uranium reactor).  It's usually the method used for shielding spent fuel rods with a deep pool of water.  In fact, it's much better at shielding against radiation than the air around you is.  So, if you were to imagine losing a submarine.  No, not losing, it disappeared, and left only it's radioactive core behind - the danger from direct radioactive waves is almost non-existent.  You'd have to swim really close to it, but since we are talking about the ocean instead of a swimming pool we'll call it moot.  Now, we do hear from time to time about radioactive waste poisoning streams and bodies of water, so if radioactive waves don't spread so well in water - then what's the problem?  The danger comes from particles that are radioactive freely floating in the water, being ingested or otherwise into very close contact with living tissue and causing damage that way.  So, we come back to the radioactive core on a submarine.  I have to admit I have no idea how large one is, but if it's the size of a golf ball it's nothing to worry about.  Furthermore, uranium is a metal solid at whatever temperature it operates at.  If uncooled, it could melt, but in the ocean cooled by seawater it won't. Okay, but let's assume that both the submarine disappears and the uranium suddenly disintegrates into powder that floats through the water - and has buoyancy for some reason despite the fact that it's more dense than lead.  Okay, so if our magic, floating uranium dust were only the size of a golf ball, in the ocean.  Still no problem.  If it we're the size of a small horse it would still likely be insignificant in damage - although at that point it may be inadvertently swallowed by fish.  Even then it's an extremely isolated threat and unlikely to harm any humans unless it were to occur just offshore.  The other potential danger is if it's recovered and used as fuel for a nuclear weapons.  However, reactor fuel is less rich in Uranium-238 which is used for bombs, and much more of Uranium-235 (it has 3 less neutrons).  Please someone correct me if I got the numbers wrong, I don't have them here with me.  Uranium-235 is <em>much</em> more prevalent than 238 and produces plenty of heat for nuclear reactions.  However, if you don't have enough 238, you can't reach critical mass where the nuclear reaction sustains itself and explodes.  In other words, no bomb.  Now you need a LOT of reactor material to refine enough of this &quot;weapons-grade&quot; uranium.  For that, you'll need a lot of submarines.  </p>
<p>Now, maybe the sub was a missile boat and had nuclear missiles on board.  That could actually be worrisome.  I bet they'd be worried then.</p>
<p>tl;dr - if you're planning on losing a nuclear reactor, there's not much better places to do it than at sea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
