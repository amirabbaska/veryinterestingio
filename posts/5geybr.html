<p>If you want to be sure your browsing habits are secure I would strongly recommend using a VPN as your data will then be encrypted and tunnelled to your VPN server making it look like you are browsing from somewhere else. What a better way to stop snoopers than making the data unreadable?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The feature is creepy as fuck, I leave it off because I have respect for the users, but it is there should I have the need.</p>
<p>I use incognito mode because I share my PC with an 8 year old and I don't want Chrome making certain website 'suggestions' to my 8 year old.</p>
<p>For the record, running through an encrypted VPN would make it look to my router that you had only visited one web page - the VPN.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can use Tor, but that will slow you down some, it's probably overkill unless you're being properly naughty. Really, everyone needs proxy servers now. You just have some https connection to some server somewhere and then every request flows through that.</p>
<p>Amusingly, the proxy servers do not even <em>have</em> to be located outside the UK, because if lots of people are using the same server, there is no way to track who particular requests are coming from, but if one is remotely serious about privacy then of course it's better to use proxies located outside the UK.</p>
<p>I can't think of any legislation so clearly targeted at normal people for purposes of control rather than the official reasons. This legislation is nothing to do with terrorists, paedophiles or other criminals as it won't affect them - they will take the necessary rudimentary steps to keep themselves safe.</p>
<p>In fact, this legislation is so bad, I'm actually quite pleased with it. The security services were already tracking us (and forwarding everything to the US and other 'friendlies'). This legislation should spur enough people into protecting their privacy that it could even have a beneficial result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
