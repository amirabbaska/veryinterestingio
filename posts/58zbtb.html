Their stomachs are all lined with a thick muscle that squeezes and constricts their prey. The lining is as thick as steer hide or thicker and the sharks they tested had between 2000 and 4000 pounds of crushing force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Birds aren't reptiles or sharks, so this information you're getting is misleading. Some birds eat whole prey live if it's small enough. Small fish or mice, for example. Anything bigger usually gets torn apart pretty good before being eaten. The talons and sharp beak on raptors are there for exactly that purpose. Most birds (not owls though) have a crop, which is a sack in the throat for predigestion, or storage if they are bringing food back to a nest to regurgitate for young. I'd reckon any critter swallowed live would get smothered out pretty quick in the crop.</p>
<p>Birds do typically have a special tough lining that protect the muscles of their gizzard (bird stomach). I'd reckon this is less because animals flop around in their gizzards, but rather that they often ingest sharp pieces of bone and such.</p>
<p>Raptors cast (regurgitate) bone and bits of feather and other indigestible stuff.</p>
<p>Vultures have super strong stomach acid, afaik, but that's obviously not for killing macroorganisms.</p>
<p>Edit: TIL that birds are now technically reptiles. Point still stands that they are physiologically different enough to consider their eating habits separately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, birds have a fairly different digestive system than us mammals. So food is going to go to a sort of holding chamber called a crop (for most birds at least) before it goes down to the gizzard (stomach). Most birds I've seen tend to thrash their food a bit before horking it down, but in the case of live critters, they would just suffocate and die pretty quick. Gizzards are gnarly and super muscular, and they help basically grind up a bird's food. As far as I know, anything swallowed live would just die pretty quick and not really affect the bird's ability to digest it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
