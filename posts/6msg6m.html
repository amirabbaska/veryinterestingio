		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a tad off topic but the markup on Soda is tremendous. When I was a manager at Wendy's by very far the highest profit item was Soda. You're basically only paying for the cup and labor when you are the fast food restaurant. The soda itself is made from syrup and costs a fraction of a penny to produce. </p>
<p>The reason the prices are what they are is because people are willing to pay for it. McDonalds could make all soda 50 cents and still make a profit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>McDonalds does not always sell drinks for $1, that's a promotion that comes and goes and also varies by location.  Remember the &quot;2 for $5&quot; thing they had a while back?  The sign at the McD near my house said &quot;2 for <strong>$6</strong>&quot;, and they almost never lower their drink prices.</p>
<p>Also, people who want to go to a nice restaurant are not going to go to McD instead for a cheap soda.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Restaurant competition is a very class based thing. Restaurants that arent in the same class don't feel the need to compete because their customers arent there for the same reasons. Their advertisments are different, as is their food quality.</p>
<p>Mcdonalds direct competitors (varies regionally) are things like burger king, wendy's, etc. and they have kept drink prices down, but non direct competitors haven't felt that pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
