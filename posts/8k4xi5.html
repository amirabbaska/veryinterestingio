		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tear ducts are always producing tears to keep your eyes lubricated. The excess drains into the nasal passage. </p>
<p>When you are choking the first thing your body does is increase all the various secretions in that area in an attempt to help get it out. It's like a fire in a building. All the sprinklers in the area come on even if it's overkill. Better safe than sorry.  </p>
<p>All that gunk increases the pressure in your nasal cavities and prevents the tears from draining properly. So they back up and your eyes get watery. </p>
<p>Same thing happens in reverse when you cry. The excess tears in your nose can cause it to run. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really an ELI5 answer, but pretty straightforward:</p>
<p>An object in the larynx stimulates a nerve (internal laryngeal nerve), found in the piriform recess of the side of the larynx, that branches off of the vagus nerve. Stimulating the vagus nerve causes a parasympathetic response, which includes saliva and tear production.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea behind it is that your body triggers a reaction to lubricate the airways and tears are just a side effect of that. If you want to add some speculation to that it could also be an evolutionary reaction to non-verbally signal that you need help to other people. That's pure speculation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thereâ€™s two things happening here, first you secrete more fluid and second you are blowing air up into where the water in your eyes would usually drain. Your eyes need water constantly to stop them drying out and becoming damaged. When choking, your air way is blocked so you start blowing air up through the holes where water would usually drain trough your eyes.
The extra secretions are to help lubricate your mouth and help remove any blockage. Combined together, the effect is that your eyes water!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Couple of things here really. Choking is an airway emergency and causes a sympathetic response: airways get bigger, heart beats faster, muscles prime for acceleration. We're geared for fight or flight when we are choking. However, that dries out your airway and that is bad for when something is stuck in it. You have little hairs that propel things upwards via secretions in the airway. Stimulating the laryngeal nerve pathways causes a cough reflex. That drives up pressure in the airway to try and forcefully expel whatever is stuck, but it needs secretions to help move it upwards. That laryngeal stimulation causes the parasympathetic activity to increase and produce tears and secretions. Very interesting from the standpoint of biology really. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
