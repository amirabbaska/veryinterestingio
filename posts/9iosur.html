		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason why it’s difficult for multiple kids (heads) to be in a play pen (body attached to heads), is because they don’t like to share their toys (organs, attention, motor control). If one kid is in charge of all the toys, the other kid only gets to play with what the boss kid allows them to. If they control the toys separately, they have to compromise and work together to make sure the toys all get equal play time. It’s just easier for one kid to have all the toys, and not have other kids around to distract them from their playtime</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not a biologist, but I do not think having two heads provides a significant advantage to survivability. The only case where having a &quot;backup&quot; head would save your life is if your other head was irreparably damaged (cut off, impaled, etc.) and in such cases you are likely to die of blood-loss or infection regardless.</p>
<p>In all other circumstances, a second head is more of a liability. It requires you to consume more calories than normal to support a second brain. A body with two heads may require a stronger heart or lungs to ensure that both brains are adequately supplied with blood and oxygen. And <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/9iosur/-/e6lbomk" target="_blank">as /u/MrPrevenge points out</a> having a second head significantly increases your biological complexity. Simply having two heads isn't enough; you also need a system to control how they work together.</p>
<p>If having your head cut off is a threat to your survivability it is far simpler to evolve defenses against that danger (e.g. strong legs to run away from whatever is trying to decapitate you) than to evolve a redundant head.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
