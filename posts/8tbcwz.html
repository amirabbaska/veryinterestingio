		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a good question, not because they're actually going to blow away in a light wind but there's many approaches.... birds can collect several twigs at once (not always one at a time) and they also wedge them against anything that's sturdy, life a fork in the branch or a twig from the rest of the nest..... it's a remarkable system when you think about it, building a platform out of reach of many predators.....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the species, as different birds build their nests in different places which could be easier or harder.</p>
<p>Some birds nest inside things, like an old tree, that hole in your siding, ect. These are called cavity nesters! They just have to find a cavity, did it out a bit, and start stuffing it with whatever nesting materials they want, typically small sticks or grasses, fur, other soft materials.</p>
<p>Some birds build what is called a cup nest, this is probably what you think of when you think of a bird nest in a tree or bush, and is often primarily made of grass. Birds will often gather spiderwebs to help stick the grasses together, helping prevent things from just blowing away.</p>
<p>Still other birds use mud to make nests along cliffs, or the side of buildings. I don't know a lot about this kind of nest building, but they often are built with a combination of mud and sticks or grass. </p>
<p>Other birds nest right on the ground! Some take the time to build a nest of grasses or sticks, while others literally just scratch out a small depression and lay their eggs in that!</p>
<p>TLDR: birds are crazy talented and build all kinds of different nests. Spiderwebs are like the duct tape of the forest for building nests.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
