		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not &quot;glorifying&quot; mental illness. Psychopathic characters are very often the villains. Even when they're not, they still end up getting screwed one way or another. </p>
<p>Stories need some kind of conflict to be interesting. That means a protagonist and an antagonist. In the case where the antagonist is a person, if that person is just a normal human with normal motivations, the conflict is uninteresting - no one wants to watch a Batman movie that features the dark knight tracking down and collaring petty criminals for two hours. </p>
<p>Characters like the Joker are both unpredictable and a genuine threat to the protagonist. Psychopathy is one way to make characters unpredictable - their motivations cannot necessarily be ascertained by the audience at the start of the presentation. </p>
<p>I don't subscribe to the theory that it's some kind of vicarious exploration of our &quot;dark side&quot;. Instead, I believe it's just classic themes reorganizing themselves for more sophisticated audiences. Audiences want the hero to win, but they don't want it to be easy (which would lead to a lack of drama) or predictable (which would make it boring). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People tend to be fascinated by what they don't know and people they don't understand that have wild characteristics. Also creating a far-fetched villain is safer and more cathartic than creating a character just like your average human because you can't easily hate those like you but if a character may be far removed from traits you and loved ones may have, it's easier to root for the &quot;good&quot; guy since you don't have to understand the complexities and nuances of the character. </p>
<p>Sometimes we also like to explore those nuances of the &quot;bad&quot; guy, how they tick, how they wound up that way and create a bit of sympathy because it's more drama that sells. But I'd go so far as to say that this drive to understand how humanity can drive itself and others to commit horrible acts even manifests in war history lovers as myself. We see this all throughout history, people who may exhibit some mental illness or another drive themselves and others to awful acts or heroic ones. To prevent or understand this, being fascinated is a prerequisite. We're fascinated by people who have some sort of power to sway others. And this fascination drives understanding, understanding gives us comfort in knowing how to quell or make use of these powers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty simple. What scares us IRL fascinates us in fiction, because we can examine our fears without physical consequence, and that's always been a thing that helps us grow as a species. </p>
<p>For example, many of us like horror movies, in which brutal acts of violence are carried out by predators, monsters, etc; things that scare us deeply. but we like it, because we get to go deep into our fears and still come out safe on the other side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because humans are fundamentally fascinated by power. Power is the underlying variable in almost all relationships, superordinate and subordinate characteristics are the core of most on screen dynamics. The way we establish heroism is by having an opposite foil. The hero becomes more. 'heroic' in relation to the extent of capability for villainy of the villain. The main constraining factor that limits one's capacity for evil is conscience. Most humans have built in limits based on characteristics like empathy. Sociopaths are defined by the inability to experience empathy. This means they lack conscience and therefore are incapable of feeling remorse. So in other words, the characteristic of 'sociopathy' gives a villain with exceptional capacity. A hero who can beat such an 'extreme' foe is leveraged into the position of being more exceptional than  one dealing with an enemy who has moral constraints. This is inherently a more powerful, and therefore more dramatic dynamic than  a normal, 'human' foe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because we get to live out our dark selves in a safe environment. These psychopathic tendencies, we can be curious about what it'd be like to actually be like that, but without the real world consequences.</p>
<p>As an example, take Dr. House. I wouldn't call him a psychopath in the traditional sense, but he's &quot;admired&quot; because he speaks his mind and doesn't put up with bullshit. He's also brilliant, which is why he can get away with being a total dickwad towards others.</p>
<p>We like characters like Dr. House because we get to live vicariously through them and satisfy that part of ourselves that would <em>love</em> to tell off our coworker and tell them what we really think of them. But societal etiquette and our superegos say we can't do that, so we settle for fictional characters who can.</p>
<p>And because they're on TV and in movies, it's a safe way to explore these emotions and possibilities without having to wake up the next day and get fired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
