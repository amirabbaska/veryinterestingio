		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>clear goo is going to be mostly blood plasma, and white goo is pus or mostly white blood cells (they're dead after killing off the bacteria that got into your skin)</p>
<p>&quot;safe&quot; is a relative word when you talk about squeezing them.  the big problem with doing it is the pimple is there because that site was teeming with bacteria that got into your system and your immune system is fighting it off.  If you pop it, there's still probably a lot of bacteria around there, so you risk infection (or prolonging the existing problem).  </p>
<p>If you don't mind using a pin or needle (that you've sterilized) and you've washed the area, you can pop them that way with less chances of scarring and greater infection.  Putting something like neosporin on it will help too.</p>
<p>If the choice is between just popping it with your fingers (and no other prep) and letting it go away on its own, you're probably better off letting it go away on its own.  Most of the time, you'll not get an infection or scarring if you pop it, but this is the choice you have to make.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once they get to the &quot;solid goo&quot; phase I've never had any issues with popping them. I've been doing it for over a decade with no infections or scarring. That's not to say it won't happen to you, but there are safer ways of doing it.</p>
<p>Start with a clean, washed face and a clean, washed needle. Gently puncture the pimple. Take two fresh Q-tips and gently squeeze on both sides until the plug pops out. Wipe away the pus/blood with paper towel, swipe with alcohol or wash again with soap, dry again with paper towel then immediately place a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002DMANU/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_9ta6zb78C5FM" target="_blank">hydrocolloid bandage</a> over the dry pimple. Leave it overnight, remove in morning. </p>
<p>This results in no scabbing, no scarring, no infections - for me, personally. It heals amazingly fast after the plug is removed and the hydrocolloid is left to do its magic.</p>
<p>If the pimple is sore, swollen, warm or obviously filled with liquid, do not pop it. Wait until it has aged into a hard plug that isn't too tender.         </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The piece of goo is the soft stuff as it dries out. If you resist the urge of popping the liquid one the will mostly turn to the harder stuff that tends to come out while washing.</p>
<p>Safety of popping, it depends on how. You risk causing a break in the skin that may not coincide with the pore, bleeding, infection, etc.</p>
<p>The solid goo ones tend to pop out without causing as much injury, some even come out during a rub or scrubbing while washing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I perused the thread and while the answers are correct there are a couple of other kinds of pimples that have a hard little bean thing in them that aren't related to bacteria.</p>
<p>Black dot pimples are the oxidised oils that your skin naturally produces. It flows like it should until it gets too much air then turnes into hard black or dark colored spot. The other common kind is only for people that have ketosis pillaris, a pretty common thing where tje effected person's skin produces too much keratin. Those are just little balls or lumps of keritan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also pimples are caused by different things. Some “pimples” are caused by hormones. Some are caused by ingrown hairs. Some are caused by mild allergic reactions to food or topical ointments. Some are caused by dirt and bacteria. The type of pimple contents will vary depending on what the pimple is because sometimes the pimple is just your body trying to expel something from you and sometimes it’s inflammation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
