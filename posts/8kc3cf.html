<p>Dopamine makes us feel good, but Endorphins regulate our well being (isnt that the same?). Also every chemical is being described as &quot;responsible for happiness&quot;. And not only that, I have read that since we have thousands of different circuits comprising of millions of synapses, the same chemical may have totally different effects in each circuit, which just adds more confusion.</p>
<p>Do I need a degree in neuroscience to understand this stuff?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, you do not need a degree to understand this in a general sense!</p>
<p>Referring to them as &quot;happiness chemicals&quot; is a vast oversimplifcation.  For these molecules, they're simply <em>neutral signaling mechanisms</em>.  They play particular roles, in certain species, in certain tissues/systems, simply because of the way those species/systems have adapted to make use of them.  In humans/mammals, many of those systems are related to what we call &quot;happiness.&quot;</p>
<p>You're absolutely right that the same chemical may have totally different effects in each circuit.  Here's the short of it:</p>
<p><strong>Dopamine</strong> is a neurotransmitter.  When a neuron is &quot;active,&quot; neurotransmitters get released, typically at the synapse (the place where that neuron &quot;connects&quot; to another).  In doing so, it communicates information from one neuron to another.  I wouldn't think of dopamine as &quot;making us feel good.&quot;  This idea, however, comes from its involvement in circuits important for reward-motivated behavior.  Essentially, it's one of many signalling mechanisms that make a <em>circuit</em> that facilitates <em>learning</em> work.  It's used in <em>a lot</em> of different circuits, though, including but not limited to those important for other aspects of cognition, and for motor function.</p>
<p>While dopamine is a single neurotransmitter, <strong>endorphins</strong> (from <em>endo</em>genous mor<em>phin</em>e, meaning morphine-like things that occur normally in us) are an entire class of things which can be described as neuropeptides and peptide hormones.</p>
<p>Neuropeptides are themselves a type of neurotransmitter, but we generally don't refer to them as such.  They're generally packaged separately from neurotransmitters like dopamine, although they often coexist in neurons with classical neurotransmitters.  </p>
<p>Hormones are also signaling molecules -- they're just transported in body fluids, like blood.  They can act on a wide variety of tissues, not just other neurons in close proximity.</p>
<p><strong>Serotonin</strong>, like dopamine, is a neurotransmitter.  In addition to what it does in the nervous system, it actually plays a major role in the mammalian intestine, where it's part of the signaling mechanisms that keep stuff flowing (literally).</p>
<p><strong>Oxytocin</strong>, like the endorphins, is a neuropeptide and peptide hormone.  It can serve many different functions, but <em>in mammals</em>, it's been shown to play a role in the molecular/cellular/tissue-level mechanisms underlying childbirth, reproduction, and social bonding.</p>
<p>I want to reiterate that these are largely just molecules used to signal between cells and tissues.  In different species they can do very, very, different things.  For example, serotonin is thought to play roles in the circuits controlling aggression and hiding behavior in crayfish!  These molecules can play all these different roles <em>because</em> they don't have any inherent bias toward certain emotions, behaviors, or what have you.</p>
<p>There is an important difference between them that's worth pointing out!  <strong>Serotonin and Dopamine</strong> are organic molecules which are assembled in the body -- they're biosynthesized from other material, and are identical between species.  They're relatively simple in structure, and we can represent them like <a href="https://www.leafscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/marijuana-serotonin-what-is.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="https://www.leafscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/marijuana-and-dopamine-2.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>The neuropeptides -- like <strong>endorphins and Oxytocin</strong> -- are proteins.  Each organism has genes which code for them, and they're different between species.  Proteins are made up of chains of amino acids, which <em>themselves</em> can be represented rather simply, like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Amino_Acids.svg" target="_blank">this</a>.  Even though mammalian Oxytocin is very small for a protein (being made up of 9 amino acids), <a href="http://static.newworldencyclopedia.org/thumb/0/0f/Oxytocin.jpg/250px-Oxytocin.jpg" target="_blank">it's still much larger than a single serotonin molecule!</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you have a misunderstanding of how neurotransmitters work. A neurotransmitter is a molecule released by one neuron and received by another. That's it. Nowhere in the definition of a neurotransmitter does function come into account.</p>
<p>Lets talk dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter heavily implicated in reward pathways, specifically, in stimulus-response pathways. If you do something and you get positive feedback for it, you see an increase in dopamine release. However, dopamine also inhibits the release of prolactin, which stimulates lactation in females. This doesn't have anything to do with happiness-- it's just another thing that dopamine does.</p>
<p>Serotonin plays in a role in depression, but it doesn't make you happy. For example, giving SSRIs to non-depressed people won't make them happier at all. Depression is thought to be caused by an inability of the body to successfully deal with higher-than-normal cortisol levels, and serotonin helps with that. Many mechanisms that regulate sleep and awareness also rely on serotonin. Destroying these pathways, or destroying the sertonin producing neurons in them causes cats to fall into permanent comas.</p>
<p>Oxytocin is a neurohormone that's released that likely facilitates social bonding. It is released after sex, when two strangers meet for the first time, when an infant suckles a mother. However, it is also released when an in-utero infant pressures the uterus, triggering uterine contractions.</p>
<p>So the difference between dopamine and serotonin and oxytocin is not like the difference between a pencil and a pen and a marker. While all three play a <strong>role</strong> in happiness and mood, that is not their only, or even primary, function.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Dopamine.svg" target="_blank">dopamine</a>, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Serotonin-2D-skeletal.svg" target="_blank">serotonin</a>, and <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Oxytocin_with_labels.png" target="_blank">oxytocin</a>. They're completely different molecules with completely different functions, all of which just happen to play some role in regulating mood. So because of that, I think it is unfair to label them as &quot;happiness chemicals&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer...yes, if you really want to understand neurobiology you do need a degree, or more accurately, the training, access to materials (journal articles/experts), and immersion in the research environment, that typically goes with pursuing a degree. </p>
<p>That being said, one of the important things to keep in mind especially with systems as complex and the brain, is that in order to be able to have descriptive terms for everything, scientist need to be extremely careful with what specific terms mean, and this is often lost in translation when material is made more publicly available. </p>
<p>Here's a review on the subject: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/neurotransmitters" target="_blank">Endogenous Neurotransmitters</a></p>
<p>In general terms, </p>
<p>Dopamine is often described as the feel good molecule, but its a reaction to something like tasting something sweet that triggers dopamine release and the spike in feeling good. Its like a pet owner saying &quot;good boy&quot; to their dog. It reinforces the behavior by producing a positive response/sensation.</p>
<p>Endorphins produce a sense of well being which is more like increasing our ability to ignore every other signal that says &quot;hey stupid, this isn't fun, stop it&quot; </p>
<p>Still, what these chemical (neurotransmitters) do, depends a lot on which specific type of neuron is secreting it, and on to which other type of neuron or cell. It depends on how much is being released, how often, and in combination with what other neurotransmitters. It depends on what other transmitters were released previously.</p>
