<p>Obviously I am not talking about cosmetic work, although it's my understanding you can get a lot of cosmetic surgery done for free in the UK too.</p>
<p>I suffered through some pretty awful tooth pain for months due to the $1-2k it eventually cost me to be treated, yet I can walk out into traffic, get my leg broken and be patched up for free.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Presumably because it's not life threatening. Here in the UK like you said all healthcare is free (apart from a nominal prescription charge for some) but that doesn't include dentistry, which you have to pay for, but is subsidised. Having said that children, pregnant women and unemployed people do get it for free. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm in the UK. The NHS does help out some with dental charges but it's not free, unless you get various means-tested benefits. Although it's undoubtedly still a good deal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are three NHS charge bands:</p>
<p>Band 1: £20.60 covers an examination, diagnosis and advice. If necessary, it also includes X-rays, a scale and polish and planning for further treatment. </p>
<p>Band 2: £56.30 covers all treatment covered by Band 1, plus additional treatment, such as fillings, root canal treatment and removing teeth (extractions).</p>
<p>Band 3: £244.30 covers all treatment covered by Bands 1 and 2, plus more complex procedures, such as crowns, dentures and bridges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any further treatment in the same band or below is then free for the next two months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day, dentistry wasn't a medical profession. Dentists weren't doctors with degrees who went to school for 6 years and then apprenticed for another 6. Dentists were your local barber or blacksmith. Basically anyone who had the tools to pull a tooth from your head.</p>
<p>Because of that 'tradition', dentistry is a completely separate medical profession from everything else. A dentist is a D.D.S -- a medical doctor (cardiologist, dermatologist, endocrinologist, GP) is an M.D.</p>
<p>All of that carries over to insurance.</p>
<p>On a side note there are free health care system that include dentistry, like for example the health care system of Poland, where a visit to the dentist is covered under the free national health care.</p>
<p>In simplest terms it's insurance companies, capitalising on the traditional split of medicine and dentistry to find an excuse not to cover dental needs under a general health care plan so they can bill you for it separately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dentistry is its own profession, distinct from medicine, mainly for historical reasons. A Frenchman, Pierre Fauchard, is thought to have really got modern dentistry started back in 1728. That's over a century before doctors generally accepted that germs cause disease, for example.</p>
<p>As for why it's not funded, it's down to what the government decided. In the UK specifically, changes made in 2006 led to the government not adequately paying dentists for NHS work. In particular those changes mean that a dentist would receive no more money for a 'course of treatment' involving several fillings than they would for a single filling. This has resulted in many former NHS dentists switching to only treat patients on a private basis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
