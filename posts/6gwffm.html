		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electricity has been known for a long time. Egyptians noted the similarity between electric eel shocks and lightning.</p>
<p>Pliny the elder (and many others) noted that these shocks could be transferred, that objects when rubbed often attracted things, that so did magnets, and that the three phenomena were connected. Thales of Miletus came up with the theory that when Amber underwent friction, it became a lodestone, and if rubbed further produced lightning proving it was a magnetic force behind lightnng. Both though in terms of &quot;Gods&quot; or &quot;Souls&quot;, which in terms of philosophy might be better thought of as a &quot;motive force without a clear origin&quot;.</p>
<p>Which is a pretty solid conclusion if you discount Thales mixed up electric fields and magnetic ones. And, you know, thought everything was water (not as stupid as it sounds.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
