		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The taste can be influenced well before aging by the shape and height of the destillery and the destillation temperature. Different alcohols have sometimes very slightly different evaporation points and they carry different aromas. With a high destillery you can more easily adjust for a favorable mix since some non-favorable alcohols and aromas fall down again before reaching the cooling spiral.</p>
<p>Since English isn't my first language you might want to look at the explanation in r/scotch:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to /u/Janus96Approx's very good answer <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/457125" target="_blank">you might find this interesting</a></p>
<p>Essentially different people find different things harsh and that different things counter harsh. You may be someone, like me, who finds the smokeyness of the phenols that come from peatier whiskies counters harshness, or you may be someone that prefers the caremelier flavours that come from the lignates you get from using newer wood/wood for longer/smaller barrels.</p>
<p>You also might like your whisky sweater and so you might prefer whiskies with a different &quot;mash tun&quot; - ie ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corn whiskeys ie borbon will be sweeter</li>
<li>Rye whiskies will be spicier and to me can be quite harsh if they are &quot;high rye&quot; - ie more than 70% odd rye</li>
<li>Malted barley whiskies (scotch) tend to be the smoothest</li>
<li>Wheat whiskies tend to have  a kind of thickness to them</li>
</ul>
<p>For most people harshness, and certainly hangovers, is closely linked to the amount of higher alcohols in the drink: so ethanol is good, methanol, butanol, propanol etc... is bad. Various things control how many higher alcohols you get in your whisky:</p>
<ul>
<li>the higher the sill, the purer the ethanol,</li>
<li>the more times distilled, the purer the ethanol</li>
<li>the longer the &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot; the purer the ethanol. So basically the way a sill works is you boil the mash and then the first, say, 15% you junk as being stuff that came off too early to be the good stuff, and the bottom, say, 30% you junk as well for coming off too late. But everything that came out between those points you trust. But if you set tighter limits then you get less whisky but smoother.</li>
<li>higher alcohols break down into lower alcohols in time, so older whiskies will tend to be smoother (Edit: see discussion in comments).</li>
</ul>
<p>Because each of these steps costs money, in general more expensive whiskies will be smoother, but it's not a 1-1 mapping. And often an element of harshness is deliberately added because some people like it. Also more complicated whiskies with more going on taste wise will tend to have more higher alcohols and so take longer to have its edges smoothed off. So take something like Lagavulin 8 - it's basically the same thing as Lagavulin 16 so it's quite expensive, but while 16 is smooth, 8 will punch you in the nose.</p>
<p>Let me know which whiskies you like/don't like and I can try and pinpoint exactly what you enjoy in whisky and make some recommendations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The aging process is what smooths out the whisky.  As it sits in the wood barrels the whisky temperature fluctuations (driven by the changing of the seasons) cause the whisky to seep in and out of the wood.  While this is happening, some of the ethanol evaporates off (called the angel's cut) through the wood.  This drops the proof of the whisky, making it less harsh.  At the same time, some of the natural compounds from the wood get pulled into whisky, giving it color.  The longer a whisky is aged, the smoother it gets.  As a barrel ages, more and more volume evaporates out.  A 30 year old barrel of whisky might loose 3/4 of its original volume, which explains why it is so expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to a friend of mine who is getting his masters in food science, the harshness comes from an excess of carbonyl groups in the drink.  These break down during the aging process which is why aged whiskey is smoother than unaged.</p>
<p>Apparently you can smooth out cheap booze with sodium carbonate and the right process, but it's not cost-effective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, the smoother whiskeys and other distilled beverages have impurities which help soften the impact of the alcohol, while the harsher ones have impurities which may even make it taste or burn more than pure alcohol mixed with distilled water for the same percentage of alcohol.</p>
<p>Ingredients which help smoothen the taste would be (fruit) sugar (or caramelised sugar) left over from incomplete fermentation, some oils, and many more.</p>
<p>Different ingredients also produces different sensations of harshness, probably because they have differing amounts of calcium and many other chemicals/molecules with that effect.</p>
