		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine taking a chunk of aluminium: it's grey because it reflects all wavelengths equally, but it's not very shiny if it hasn't been polished, because it reflects light in almost random directions. </p>
<p>If you polish it up a bit, it's still grey, but now it's shinier, because it reflects light mostly at the same angle that it came in.</p>
<p>Keep polishing, and it eventually becomes a mirror.</p>
<p>So there's a continuum between a flat grey object and a mirror.</p>
<p>I guess when your mind is contemplating the mirror as an object, and not what's reflected in it, it's forced to assign an appearance to it, and that appearance is &quot;shiny and without a noticeable colour of its own&quot;, and that's basically a description of what we call &quot;silver coloured&quot;.</p>
<p>A side comment on &quot;silver&quot;: even pure silver is slightly yellow, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Image-Metal-reflectance.png" target="_blank">as you can see from its spectrum.</a> - see for example <a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fMtD30kx1vg/S_yPePP1GbI/AAAAAAAABPU/aPV6LrnEQmU/s1600/Stainless+vs+sterling.jpg" target="_blank">this comparison</a> of stainless steel next to sterling silver (<a href="https://bridgecitytatting.blogspot.de/2010/05/jons-foldover-bookmark-and-more-maille.html" target="_blank">source</a>).</p>
<p>Edit - More detail from a reply I gave below:</p>
<p>A piece of white paper reflects most of the light that falls on it in pretty much random directions. That means that it does actually take on the colours of things around it. <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/nWYC8" target="_blank">I just took a picture to demonstrate that.</a></p>
<p>If you have an incandescent lightbulb, so one with a hot filament, the light that it gives off is very yellow, and this is obvious if you take a picture with your camera set to &quot;sunlight&quot; white balance. <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/wLEpS" target="_blank">A piece of white paper will look yellow in that photograph</a>, but when you look at it in real life your brain still sees it as white, because it corrects for the ambient light.</p>
<p>A chunk of unpolished aluminium also reflects all wavelengths pretty much equally, and in all directions. However, it only reflects a certain fraction of the incoming light. Same if you print &quot;grey&quot; on a laser printer. It's like white, only darker.</p>
<p>I took another picture to show <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/mSRbi" target="_blank">what metal looks like compared to paper.</a> You'll see that this metal, which isn't very highly polished, is pretty much grey unless there's something really close to it. But the shades of grey are interesting. Where it's facing incoming light, it reflects it better than the paper, so it's actually a brighter white, and where it's facing off towards the darker areas of the room, it's a darker grey. For this reason, compared to white paper, it appears overall a bit more grey than white. Interestingly, the paper is a bit bluer than the metal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A mirror emits mostly <a href="http://idol.union.edu/malekis/CVision2003/MainPage/Course%20Content/Geometrical%20Optics/reflection2.gif" target="_blank"><em>specular reflection</em> with a small amount of <em>diffuse reflection</em></a>.</p>
<p>In most cases, there are so many light sources and objects to reflect light that the <em>specular reflection</em> dominates most of the light reflected towards our eyes.  In this case, the mirror has no color and simply looks like the color of whatever light is being reflected at our eyes.</p>
<p>The only time we notice the color of a mirror as silver is when a portion of the mirror doesn't really have an opposing light source or object to reflect light towards our eyes (i.e. that portion of the mirror has very low specular reflection). In those cases, <em>diffuse reflection</em> will dominate, and diffuse, uniform reflection looks like a dim or imperfect white, which is silver.</p>
<p>The more imperfect a mirror, the more <em>diffuse reflection</em> you will get, and the more silver it will look.  That's why <em>shiny</em> things that aren't necessarily mirrors -- knives, ball bearings, polished aluminum or stainless steel -- are easily recognized as appearing more silver.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Something like gold will absorb <del>red</del> blue light more than other wavelengths and that gives it its yellowish colour. Silver or aluminum reflect visible wavelengths almost equally so they appear grey.

<p>On a side note, mosts mirrors are actually green, you can tell they are green because when you put two mirrors facing each other and get that the tunnel effect if fades to green. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
