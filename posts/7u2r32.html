If it's not perfectly straight, it will travel in an arc and can still be at lethal speeds when it comes down. A couple years ago a 12 year old died on the Fourth of July because a neighbor fired a gun in the air and it came down into the boy's head.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Straight up means the bullet tumbles down and it reaches a fairly slow terminal velocity, no different than if you'd dropped a penny from the same height.</p>
<p>But anything besides straight up (just at an upward angle) and it will still have a ballistic trajectory, will probably not tumble, and it will be moving at a velocity that will kill people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Coming straight down, it will be tumbling and slow quite a lot.  It would hurt if it hit you on the head, but no worse then banging your head on a low doorway.</p>
<p>Angle the gun 15 degrees and it will be plenty lethal coming down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably not. Terminal velocity is way too slow, and a bullet far too light, to cause significant injury. </p>
<p>When you fire a gun, the bullet accelerates until it leaves the barrel, and then it starts slowing down immediately due to wind resistance. When you fire straight up, or nearly so, the bullet will travel up until it slows and briefly stops at the apex of is arc. Once it hits that apex, it's falling, relying solely on gravity to accelerate. In a vacuum, it would accelerate as long as it was being acted on by gravity. But you still have to worry about wind resistance: at a certain point, it will no longer be able to accelerate because the force of the air will be equal to the force of gravity. (I'm simplifying this, because physics isn't my strongest suite.) This is your terminal velocity. Terminal velocity is more challenging to figure than i can readily do, but let's say that you manage to get a slug falling at the rate of 200mph. (For comparison, the Challenger command capsule hit about 220mph, and a person in freefall will hit about 120mph.) That works out to be 293fps or so. A .22 short will have a muzzle velocity of about 1000fps, and most BB guns will be in the 400+fps range. If you are assuming something like a 7.62x39mm slug, the slug weight is about 10g/.3oz. At 293fps, that's...  A whopping 29 foot pounds of energy. A .22 short, one of the smallest, lightest ammunitions around, will have <em>at least</em> 44 foot pounds of energy at the muzzle. (Heavier bullets will definitely produce more energy.)</p>
<p>It would probably break skin, but likely not penetrate deeply. (Lawn darts, given how much they weigh, are more likely to cause significant injury, even with a relatively slower velocity.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong>. That's <em>only</em> if you shoot straight up, or nearly so. If you are shooting at an angle, then gravity will have altered the trajectory of the bullet, but the bullet will still have forward movement from being shot in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
