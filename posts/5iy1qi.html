		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Acupuncture in it's &quot;pure&quot; form is complete bunk.  Studies have been done and found that poking needles into &quot;chi points&quot; vs. random points gives the same effect.  If the human body has &quot;chi points&quot;, they aren't particularly responsive to being poked. </p>
<p>Interestingly, however, the effect in both cases is not zero.  The process does have a positive effect in some people.  </p>
<p>I haven't seen any studies which show whether this is pure placebo effect or if there is some other mechanism of action going on (or both).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dude with degree in neuroscience here. Read some, but not all of the studies. I cannot add anything but an anecdote that was a powerful enough experience to convince me that more than the placebo effect is at work with acupuncture in some cases. My first girlfriend many years ago had an older greyhound rescued from the track. One day it was on its last legs with arthritis getting bad in her neck and legs. She got to the point one morning where she could not get up and was just whimpering in pain. I told my girlfriend we couldn't let her remain in pain; we needed to put the pup down. My girlfriend had heard about a guy that did acupuncture on animals and wanted to try it, but agreed to take her dig to the vet to euthanize her if acupuncture didn't work. I carried the pupper in to the place and laid her on the mat he had on the floor;  the dog was in so much pain she couldn't even pick up her head. The guy did his thing and poked her here and there. I had to step out to take a call but about 20 min later the pup came sprinting out of the room and centrifuged around the waiting room like a 9 month old border collie.  She lived another 3 years and when she started to get bad again, which usually was around  3-4 months, my girlfriend would take her back to see the guy. The pup died comfortably in her sleep something around 3 years from that day. I find it hard to believe the dog was convinced of anything in such a way that could cause the placebo effect. I have tried acupuncture myself a few times and got no recognizable benefits. I am not convinced there is nothing to acupuncture. Perhaps we have not done enough rigorous science to find it. Perhaps there are many crappy acupuncturists like the are many crappy Western doctors. Perhaps we should give it a few more looks before writing it completely off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;So far, evidence supports its efficacy for some medical problems â€” especially certain kinds of pain. Research into how acupuncture relieves pain is still in its early stages and has not yet definitely answered the question. The study of pain is complex, in part, because it must rely on people's reports of their subjective experience. Studies of acupuncture are further complicated by the difficulty of finding an appropriate placebo. Despite these challenges, ongoing scientific research is likely to shed further light on acupuncture therapy.&quot;</p>
<p>TLDR: We don't know. The above excerpt is from <a href="http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/acupuncture" target="_blank">this article</a>. </p>
<p>Anecdote: I have Parkinson's Disease, and at least one scientific study (and my own personal experience) has shown that acupuncture is extremely effective at managing pain. I have no idea how it works, and it might be placebo, but I no longer rely on $800 in medications per month, and to be fair, we scientifically have no idea how those meds work, either. I'll take the qi voodoo bullshit if it helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dr Helene Langevin has done extensive research on the mechanism and effects of acupuncture since 2000. In one of her early studies, she found that traditional acupuncture points are often located at the intersection of muscles, where there are &quot;wells&quot; of connective tissue. Furthermore, inserting and manipulating an acupuncture needle into connective tissue results in the microscopic roughness of the needle to grab onto and pull the connective tissue (kind of like twirling a fork in spaghetti). When acupuncture is practiced, needles are generally placed, and then left in place for about 1/2 hour. Helene Langevin found some evidence that this long, slow stretch of the connective tissue had a significant effect on the structure of since of the connective tissue cells. When I studied this, she had yet to determine what, if any healing effect the change in connective tissue cells had on healing. If nothing else, acupuncture is able to produce a very specific connective tissue stretch.</p>
<p>(Source: I read a bunch of her papers while a was a biomechanical engineering student at UVM, where she was conducting her research).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There doesn't seem to be much &quot;proper&quot; science behind acupuncture. According to <a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/an-industry-of-worthless-acupuncture-studies/" target="_blank">this article</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>carefully controlled scientific studies consistently show that it does not matter where you stick the needles or even if you insert needles (as opposed to just poking the skin with dull needles, or retracting needles, or even tooth picks). To further support this conclusion, the perceived effectiveness of acupuncture does not depend on the degree of training or experience of the acupuncturist (so whatever they are learning has no effect), but only upon how warm and nice they are to the patient. In short, acupuncture is an elaborate placebo.</p>
