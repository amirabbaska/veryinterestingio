		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the beginning of the 20th century, it was usual to work 60 hours a week. Then, unions, labour strikes and movements changed that (thankfully) and went down to a 40 hour week. That's what we've been working for 100 years already. Now, with the automation it would be fair to think we're up for a new reduction of the week work.</p>
<p>Some countries such as France have gone down to 35 hours, without seeing much of a change (neither an improvement not a worsening of the work). In some countries they are trying the 6 hour day such as <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-34677949" target="_blank">Sweden</a>, it's going well for many of them, but nobody does these experiments long enough to actually see results.</p>
<p>3 days a week, 8 hours = 24 hours a week. That's almost the 30 hours a week that the Swedes are trying.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Economics_Foundation" target="_blank">new economics foundation</a> actually suggests a 21 hour week.</p>
<p>In general, arguments in favour of reducing the time we work per week is more time for our families, more time for other activities, more time for consuming goods, better work life balance, happy employees, less unemployment. Not everything is producing things (aka working long hours), people need to have the money, the need, the willingness to buy them and the time to use them. That all makes economy boost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just did a bit of googling.  Several industrial companies in Germany (the Ziess optical factory in Jena and a couple of others) did experiments at the start of the 20th century.  The Ziess plant switched from a nine-hour work day to an eight hour workday, and found that the workers actually got more work done.  At the same, the workers were paying premiums to an insurance fund.  When Ziess had a twelve hour day, the company would have to pay money into the fund each year because medical costs for the workers were higher than their premiums.  After the switch to eight hour days, the fund started making money, because there were less worker injuries and thus less money had to be paid to doctors.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a long history of moving towards the 40 hour work week through the 1800s and 1900s.  In the US, it finally became federal law that any work over 40 hours was &quot;overtime&quot; in 1938 for all industries.  It's something that unions &amp; the labor movement fought long &amp; hard for - prior to that 10+ hour days were common.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's another reason the days/hours worked over time has declined that other commenters have not mentioned: technological progress. </p>
<p>Even in the most egalitarian, low inequality society imaginable, it takes a certain quantity of food, water, and shelter to keep one person alive each day. If the efficiency at which those things are produced is low, everyone has to work many hours every day. If efficiency improves greatly, say, by agriculture or mechanization, then the minimum required hours of work per day to keep each person alive decreases. </p>
<p>Now, it should be noted that what we consider &quot;basic requirements&quot; does increase over time. Today, we consider running water, sewage systems, electricity, TV,  radios, refrigerators etc.., as basic equipment everyone needs to have. </p>
<p>However, that said, production efficiency has eclipsed basic needs so massively that the hours an average person works per year has been slashed dramatically. How dramatically? In the 1830 US, the average worker worked over 70 hours a week and over 6 days a week. They generally had no paid vacation, few paid federal holidays, no personal days, no sick days, no paid family leave of any kind. Today, the average is ~34 hours a week and while those benefits aren't ubiquitous (except federal holidays), they're common. </p>
<p>In all, Americans work about 40% of the hours they did in 1830's.. while at the same time have vastly better lives (in general). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
