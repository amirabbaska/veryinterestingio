		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, I'm currently taking quetiapine (an anti-psychotic also known as Seroquel) at a dose of half the smallest pill a night, 12.5mg, to help me with sleep (I have some serious insomnia and sleep issues). This makes me feel calmer, I sleep pretty well and wake up feeling pretty dozy, but I sort of struggle through it for the first half hour of the day and then I'm fine.</p>
<p>The recommended dose when actually using quetiapine as an anti-psychotic instead of a sleep aid is 400mg - 800mg. This drug already makes me totally dozy at, what, 1/32 of the lowest dose? I feel like if I took 100mg I'd basically be catatonic, maybe moving a limb occasionally just to check it was still there. </p>
<p>So my question is, what is the quetiapine doing to me, what does it do to a psychotic, and is there something different about how our brains work that they need that much of the stuff? </p>
<p>Thanks! </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you had a bowl of skittles, these represent all the different receptors in your brain. And imagine each piece of seroquel attached to one of those skittles. </p>
<p>All the red skittles are receptors associated with sleep. With a dose between 12.5 and 100mg, you would have enough seroquel to attach itself to all your red skittles. And the seroquel will always attach to the red skittles first. But what happens if you take more? Can you get more sleepy? No, because you have no more red skittles available for seroquel to attach to. Your green skittles and yellow ones and green ones do different things, so introducing a larger dose of seroquel will start to have different affects. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many anti-psychotic drugs are dopamine antagonists, so they basically block the flow of dopamine, resulting in a sedating effect. Now, in people with schizophrenia the flow of dopamine is higher than a person without schizophrenia, resulting in paranoia, rage, psychosis, etc. So, naturally a dopamine antagonist would balance out the dopamine levels in people with schizophrenia. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quetiapine is a dopamine antagonist, but it also have potent antihistaminic and anticholinergic actions, which is why this medicine have sedative properties. Histamine and acetylcholine are involved in arousal pathways on the brain, so the antagonism of the muscarinic (M1) and histamine (H1) receptors on the brain are associated with the sedating effects.</p>

<p>(sorry I don't speak english very well)</p>
<p>Edit: I just read something interesting on that book!</p>
<p>&quot;Quetiapine is a very interesting agent, since it acts like several different drugs, depending upon the dose and the formulation. It comes in a immediate-release (IR) formulation and in an extended-release (XR) formulation. The IR has rapid onset and short duration of actions, usually taken at night because quetiapine is most sedating at its peak delivery shortly after taking it, due in large part to its antihistamine properties. The XR formulation is ideal for an antipsychotic, with less peak-dose sedation but duration of action lasting all day, however is not ideal for a hypnotic**, because the peak is much delayed from the time when the patient takes the pill, delaying sleep onset.&quot;</p>
<p>**NOTE: &quot;hypnotic&quot; are drugs used to make you sleep </p>
<p>About the dosage, the lowest doses act at the receptors that have the highest affinity for quetiapine, which is the histamine H1 receptor. So at a lower dose quetiapine will have a pronounced antihistaminic effect, which leads to a sedative hypnotic effects. At higher doses, quetiapine will also act on other receptors like the dopamine D2 receptores, causing a antipsychotic effect!</p>
<p>I hope this helps! That book is awesome</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(Adding this because I have to 'explain' it.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quetiapine is a dopamine, serotonin, and adrenergic antagonist, and a potent antihistamine with clinically negligible anticholinergic properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically this means it helps block dopamine and serotonin from being released into the synapse. Your body will then find a new balance.</p>
<p>But, holy crap you're on quetiapine for sleep??</p>
<p>You know you can end up with gynecomastia (man boobs), involuntary muscle contractions (catatonia) and a host of permanent problems from taking that? If you're not clinically psychotic/bipolar you should NOT be taking that. There's a million other things for sleep, why take one of the harshest drugs out there?</p>
<p>Try working out 5 days a week, changing your diet, get your blood checked, etc. If that doesn't work try Ambien, but damn....get off that shit. This is coming from someone who used to be on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Antipsychotic medicine alter the levels of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters.  They are the chemicals that carry messages around your brain. The neurotransmitter that is most targeted by antipsychotic medicines is dopamine.  Changing the levels of these chemicals reduces, in almost all cases, the hallucinations and delusions of psychosis. In many instances, they also improve the mood and reduce anxiety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
