		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you have a bad idea of what an eclipse looks like. The shadow of the moon only covers a small portion of the earth. That's why you can't see an eclipse from everywhere on Earth. <a href="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03239/eclipse99_mir_3239050b.jpg" target="_blank">Here is a representation of what it would look like from the international space station.</a></p>
<p>However there is in fact a local temperature drop during an eclipse.</p>
<p>Edit: trying to find hard data on the temperature drop it seems that the drop is only about half the difference between day and night temperature. It feel a lot bigger because you lose the direct radiant heating from the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=87675" target="_blank">video</a> from NASA shows an actual 2016 solar eclipse moving over the Indian and Pacific oceans as viewed by the DSCOVR satellite stationed between the Earth and Sun.</p>
<p>(The video is actually a series of still photos, as it would take hours for the shadow to cross the whole Earth)</p>
<p>As /u/electric_ionland pointed out, the Moon's shadow only blocks the Sun on a very small portion of the Earth at a time.  The duration of a total eclipse at any given spot can never exceed about 7.5 minutes, and is usually much shorter than that.  So the cooling potential is like slow sunset, followed by 3-4 minutes of night, followed by a gradual sunrise.  It's noticable, but not much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason (the small area of an eclipse) has been mentioned, but there is another important reason. The earth contains a lot of heat and is fairly well insulated. Even if the sun were to suddenly disappear it would take a while (unsure how long) for the earth to cool appreciably. It wouldn't be instant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dedicated solar eclipse chaser here (booked my hotels for August's eclipse a year ago). I've been to total solar eclipses in Mexico, Romania, and Africa.</p>
<p>It does. As more of the Sun gets covered, the temperature drops noticeably, and animals, fish, and insects start behaving like it's sunset. But the Earth has a lot of thermal inertia, and just like when the Sun sets, the temperature doesn't immediately drop to freezing.</p>
<p>And bear in mind that the path of totality in a solar eclipse is not <a href="http://www.eclipse2017.org/2017/maps.htm" target="_blank">THAT wide,</a> so it's not like the entire hemisphere is being plunged into darkness.</p>
<p>While the partial phases may last a couple of hours, full totality is never longer than around 6-7 minutes, and the time when a significant amount of the Sun is covered is not that long either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) The area that gets dark from the eclipse is relatively small (less than 1% of the Earth).</p>
<p>2) The time any given area stays dark is relatively short (less than 10 minutes).</p>
<p>3) The Earth holds in a LOT of heat that takes a long time to cool down (think how long it takes to cool down after sunset).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
