		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of memory, volatile and non-volatile. Volatile memory requires a constant voltage to keep the memory from erasing, whereas non-volatile does not.</p>
<p>Examples of non-volatile memory include flash drives and hard drives in computers.</p>
<p>The only volatile example I can think of is RAM (Random Access Memory).</p>
<p>As for Pokémon Crystal, this is a trick Nintendo had been doing from 1986 to around 2000ish. I'm not sure when the last instance of this was, but I know that the first was The Legend of Zelda. </p>
<p>RAM memory was cheaper than flash memory (which is what they switched to with Ruby and Sapphire, although, they have a battery for the clock, which is a different thing altogether), so Nintendo would use RAM in their cartridges to store save data, with a battery to keep the volatile (RAM) memory from erasing. </p>
<p>However, these batteries don't last forever, and as other people have said, these batteries run out faster in Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal because they also run a clock. </p>
<p>The batteries are CR2025 and there are videos on Youtube telling you how to replace them. Pokemon Crystal is the hardest Pokemon game to do though, because the battery is soldered in twice as much as Red/Blue/Yellow/Gold/Silver.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Game boy cartridges are mostly read-only memory of some kind, either 'mask roms' (chips that are created in the foundry with data) PROMS (write-once memory that is set by blowing diodes you don't want leaving the data you do), EPROMS (which are PROMS that can be healed and reset, usually by UV light) or EEPROMS (which are proms that can be reset with an electric charge). This doesn't need a battery to keep the data.</p>
<p>But they also contain a small amount of efficient normal RAM, and the battery is used to keep the memory in that RAM live. This is used to store save games and high scores.</p>
<p>These days, this data storage is generally done with 'flash memory', which is the stuff they use in memory cards, usb sticks, and SSD hard drives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>How Is Digital Information Stored Without Electricity?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are literally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage_device" target="_blank">dozens of different methods and media via which digital information can be stored</a>. Some require electricity, and some do not. The main media in current use which do not require electricity are: flash memory used in USB sticks and solid state drives, which uses static electricity; magnetic material used in hard disks and still today tape drives; and optical media such as CDs, DVDs and BluRay disks.</p>
<p>The answer to your question is different for each type of media.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The second generation Pokémon games use an in game clock that always runs in the cartridge. That's because the Gameboy itself doesn't have an integrated clock. The 2nd gen uses a Day/Night cycle that effects what Pokémon you can get and also effects some moves (for example Umbreon has a move that heals him and is more effective during night). This is also true for later games but on DS it uses console's clock.</p>
<p>As far as I know these cartridges are 3 of the few Gameboy game cartridges that can actually run out of power. The first gen cartridges will easily last longer than gen 2, as they don't have a clock to run.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
