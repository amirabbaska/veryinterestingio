The bigger you are the more blood it takes to keep you going. It also means the harder your heart has to work to move the extra blood to all the extra places.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ahh! Finally one relevant to my expertise!!</p>
<p>The respondents so far are essentially saying “yes”. They’re not wrong, since each body cell requires a blood supply- so the BIGGER you are, the more blood you have.  But let me tackle another angle: No.</p>
<p>Take two people who are both 90kg. Same weight. One of these two runs 4 times a week and body builds at the gym. He is filled with lean muscle mass, which requires a vast network of vasculature to deliver oxygen and nutrients. His 90kg counterpart is made up of adipose tissue (fat storage cells) which just deposits energy for future usage and does not require extensive vasculature. A kg of lean muscle mass has a ton more vascular volume than a kg of adipose tissue. Sure, while your weight goes up due to obesity, you have more vascular volume than before, but the rise of blood volume per kilogram is lower than previous. It makes (accurate) drug dosing of narrow therapeutic range drugs that are dosed per kilogram much more difficult.</p>
<p>Therefore, obesity actually = LESS blood volume than comparators of the same weight. </p>

<p>This is why BP goes up with increased weight; longer blood vessel length= increased BP.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember in an AP class awhile ago read that you develop an extra few thousand feet of capillaries per pound of adipose tissue. I’ve looked but never been able to re-find that statistic.   I remember being astonished and calculating out how many ‘miles’ of extra distance a heart of a morbidly obese person would have to pump its blood!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
