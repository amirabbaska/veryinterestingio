<p>Bringing reality back, in the process of getting those two nuclei to touch has more than likely <del>annihilated</del> obliterated you, the table, and anything nearby, because fusion takes an insane amount of energy.</p>
<p>Edit: Since people keep mentioning it I don't mean literal annihilation in the term of a particle and antiparticle colliding, just on a macroscopic scale. Let's just go with obliterated.</p>
<p>So many questions. I'm sorry everyone, I'm just too tired to answer them all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, <em>touch</em> is a bit of a problematic term due to some quantum mechanical stuff that maybe someone smarter than me will get into.</p>
<p>So instead, let's just talk about what happens when the nuclei get REALLY REALLY REALLY close to each other.  Like, 10^-15 meters, or a millionth of a millionth of a millimeter.  Atoms are really tiny, but the electrons are more on the order of 10^-11 meters from the nucleus.  That's <em>ten thousand</em> times larger than the distance we're talking about.</p>
<p>So <em>if</em> a nucleus were to overcome the insanely powerful repulsion of another nucleus, something called the <em>strong nuclear force</em> would kick in.  This is an attractive force between nucleons like protons and neutrons, and it is about a hundred times stronger than electromagnetic forces, but tapers off to nothing if you get more than 10^-15 meters away from it.  The result is that the two would fuse into a new nucleus and, depending on the makeup of the new nucleus, would either be a different stable element, or would quickly decay into something else.</p>
<p>So for instance, if a carbon-12 nucleus in your hand <em>somehow</em> fused with a carbon-12 nucleus in your table, you'd have a Mg-24 atom in their place.  24 is its standard weight, so likely that would be the end of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>so it's actually a misconception that electrostatic repulsion is what keeps our hands from touching a surface. The repulsion actually comes from something called Electron degeneracy pressure which is a result of Pauli's exclusion principal. for instance the force that keeps two electrons from preoccupying the same quantum state is the electron degeneracy pressure. Check out the wikipedia article for a much more in depth understanding</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pauli exclusion prevents that from happening under everyday conditions.  </p>
<p>Pauli exclusion is part of why we don't &quot;melt&quot; through chairs.  For instance, Rutherford scattering describes how two nuclei pass by one another, so if it was just electrostatic repulsion we could kinda pass through like liquid through a sieve.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may be a bit of a buzzkill, what with people talking about stuff like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When two nuclei touch, nuclear fusion occurs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in truth, what you're talking about wouldn't cause fusion, it would cause repulsion from between the two nucleii from the exactly same electromagnetic forces that cause the electrons to repel each other.</p>
<p>Consider:  If, by some miracle, you've pushed a single atom of your hand through to a single atom in the table.  At that point you've broken past the coulomb repulsion between the two electron shells and now the nucleus of your hand-atom is inside the electron shell of the table-atom, and (probably) vice-versa.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a little aside at this point, the force required to do this exceeds the intermolecular forces holding the molecules of your body together, so you'd rip your hand and the table apart before this happens, but no matter: It's a thought experiment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the nucleii are past the electron shells - and they really never get <strong>completely</strong> past the electron shells because they're not true, spherical shells; they're <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Electron_orbitals.svg/2000px-Electron_orbitals.svg.png" target="_blank">more complicated than that</a> - the electron shells are no longer shielding the two positively charged nucleii from each other.</p>
<p>So the two nucleii would repel each other from coulomb forces once you got them to within 0.25 Angstroms, at which point you've pushed past the Bohr radius.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Before anyone takes it into their head to quibble about exactly how far you need to go to get past the electrons shielding the nucleii, remember this is a back-of-the-envelope conversation involving multiple nonsensical postulates:  The 0.25 Angstrom number is a brown number.)</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, the strong force really doesn't begin to kick in until about 1-3 femtometers.  0.25 Angstroms = 25,000 femtometers.</p>
<p>So yeah, if you got the nucleii to <strong>touch each other</strong> (the diameter of a nucleus is 1.75-15 femtometers), you might see fusion, but long before that you'd have to overcome a second round of coulomb repulsion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
