		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the old days, you could stop foreign propaganda by blocking (or seriously limiting) its distribution.  You could refuse to broadcast it on TV or print it in the newspapers.  Access to mass media was limited.</p>
<p>These days, the Internet lets everyone put everything up where people can find it.  Anyone with a few bucks can host a website.  A few thousand dollars on a botnet can ensure that it trends on social media.  There's no way to tell what's legitimate reporting &amp; what's propaganda.</p>
<p>To make things worse, when the whole &quot;fake news&quot; thing got out, it quickly transitioned from a criticism of this blatantly false reporting to an insult lobbed at any news source that disagrees with your preconceptions.  We've become so polarized &amp; compartmentalized in our own little filter bubbles that people start <em>choosing</em> their own &quot;reality&quot; that doesn't challenge them.</p>
<p>The end result is that people have no faith in <em>any</em> media nor do they have any faith in <em>any</em> politicians.  When they think that everyone is equally corrupt &amp; there's no hope to change things, they disengage from politics.  When they don't vote, the more motivated party with more solidarity wins.  People with hardcore party allegiances take control.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To think rationally you always should assume that you can be wrong, your previous knowledge can be wrong, people giving you information can be mislead themselves or actively trying to mislead you. That's pretty damn hard.</p>
<p>Moreover, all too often there aren't enough facts available to prove any side of the story. Rational thing to do here would be to accept that <em>you just don't know</em> (yet) who's really right, to take note of both opposing views and stay alert for new evidence. But <strong>people are afraid of not knowing things</strong> and therefore often choose the side that looks <em>more probable</em>. Now if there isn't enough evidence then you can't really assign any percentage to probabilities of different scenarios, so instead of being critical people just choose the side they have more interaction with.</p>
<p>Once you have (subconsciously) chosen the side, you don't really examine it critically any more. When some new information comes in you just examine whether it undermines integrity of your previous beliefs. If it does - the rational thing to do would be to <em>rethink your position</em>, but much easier (and much more common) thing to do is to look for ways to dismiss/undermine the new evidence.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> it is hard and time-consuming to evaluate everything critically, often you'll have to admit you just don't know stuff (whether because there are not enough facts available or because you didn't spend enough time researching the problem) and sometimes you'll need to reevaluate everything you know and to change your position.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>have you ever had an argument with a child where they just kept going, &quot;nuh uh! nuh uh! nuh uh! nuh uh!&quot; they know they're wrong, they just want to win the argument by making you give up.</p>
<p>or with someone who just straight up would not admit that they were wrong about a fact, even when you pull up the wikipedia page on your phone and show them? the most they'll admit is &quot;that's your opinion&quot; or &quot;well, that's not what i read&quot; or &quot;let's agree to disagree&quot;? refusing to acknowledge that they've lost the argument means they don't have to admit that they did. they might know they're wrong and just not want to admit it, or they might cling to their genuine ignorance because they don't want to be challenged and being corrected in an argument is uncomfortable emotionally.</p>
<p>frustrating and exhausting, right? now imagine you're at a party where this guy has already told everybody else this wrong fact, and they all like him personally and think he sounds like he knows what he's talking about. you tell a couple people the real truth but they seem disinterested because they think you're just stirring the pot. you maybe convince one or two. the rest go out and repeat the wrong fact ad nauseum until it's time to vote for the president and everyone thinks hilary clinton runs a child sex ring out of a pizza parlour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How do you propose stopping it?</p>
<p>Take, for example, the situation Germany is in at the moment. It's election year in Germany, and the authorities have observed with growing concern the way the Brexit referundum and the US presidential election have unfolded, and have identified as a major problem &quot;fake news&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Fake news&quot; is fictitious news stories, or at least wildly distorted and exaggerated news stories, which circulates primarily via social media and has a political objective. Some of that comes from obvious sources of propaganda, like the blatantly white supremecist Breitbart News; some of it comes from sources like Russia Today, a TV network that is funded by the Russian government itself.</p>
<p>Their stories, along with stories from more obscure sources, are spread partly by ordinary people on social media reading them, believing them to be true, and sharing or liking them, and partly by bots. In an era when more than half the people in the western world say they get their news from Facebook, this is very troubling.</p>
<p>In view of this, the German authorities are looking into ways of preventing the spread of &quot;fake news&quot; on social media, and have got agreements from the likes of Facebook and Twitter to help them. But how are they supposed to do that?</p>
<p>Do you fine people for failing to fact-check stories they &quot;like&quot; on Facebook? Do you outlaw memes? Do you write algorithms to detect the Russia Today logo in videos so they can be blocked?</p>
<p>In some cases the truth can be hard to ascertain: who is the final authority on what is true and what isn't? In many cases, the truth is misrepresented: it's still true, but taken out of context it's misleading. For example, it is entirely true that birth rates among certain immigrant populations are higher than the average German birth rate, and if you do the calculations on that basis you conclude that within a decade ethnic Germans will be outnumbered by other ethnicities. But that omits a lot of important information (the average age of immigrants, the lack of birth control in their home countries, that kind of thing), and in reality immigrant birth rates drop to the same level as native birth rates within one generation. So, should it be made law that you're not allowed to mention immigrant birth rates unless you cite <em>all</em> of the information? Does this mean that you shouldn't be allowed to make any kind of assertion unless you also present all of the counter-arguments? If you want to say, &quot;Angela Merkel's policies will lead to economic ruin within ten years&quot; you must, by law, add, &quot;according to some leading experts, while other experts say that her policies can only make Germany's economy stronger&quot;?</p>
<p>The more you delve into the complexities of this issue, the worse it gets -- and I haven't even started to mention the obvious pitfalls of government censorship.</p>
<p>At a basic level, you have millions of well-meaning people who don't all have a college education, who aren't experts in economics, politics, statistical analysis, science or journalism, and who therefore just share stuff they feel is important and which seems credible to them because they have no way of judging its authenticity. If you know of a way of putting a stop to that before the German elections this autumn without violating anyone's human rights, the German government would love to hear from you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is...in some small way to become evil oneself. One's standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control. I think if you examine political correctness, it has the same effect and is intended to.</strong></p>
