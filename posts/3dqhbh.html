		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those fidgets are called roll over signals. Your body sends these signals to check if you have fallen asleep. However, it does not necessarily have to be an urge to roll over. It could be just the urge to move your arm around (like you already mentioned), or having some random itches around your body, or anything really that will make you want to move your body.  </p>
<p>If you do respond to those signals by moving, or scratching or whatever the urge may be, your body will know that your mind is still awake, and your body will stay unparalyzed. During sleep your body will be paralyzed so you don't act out your dreams. However, if you don't respond to any of the roll over signals for long enough, your body will initiate sleep paralysis, that is also the same time when you will begin to dream. </p>
<p>Bonus fact:
People who lucid dream, will try to initiate sleep paralysis without letting their consciousness go by lying still and ignoring the roll over signals. The method is called &quot;WILD&quot;, short for &quot;Wake Initiated Lucid Dream&quot; which is one of many methods to initiate a lucid dream.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Many of you guys have asked me a lot about how to initiate WILD and all. I highly recommend you to read about how the paralysis works and feels before you attempt do it. There are also many more &quot;beginner friendly&quot; ways to initiate lucid dreams like; <a href="http://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/mnemonic-induction-of-lucid-dreams.html" target="_blank">MILD</a>, <a href="http://www.dreamviews.com/induction-techniques/4779-finger-induced-lucid-dream-fild.html" target="_blank">FILD</a> and <a href="http://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/wake-back-to-bed.html" target="_blank">WBTB</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes this is a form of <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/healthcare/care-centers/parkinsons/conditions/myoclonus" target="_blank">myoclonus</a>. The exact cause is not well known but an over simplification is that it is a reflex from the spinal cord in response to loss of input from the brain. When you go to sleep, the brain shuts off control to the body to keep you from acting out dreams. When the motor neurons in the spinal cord don't have input from the brain they will sometimes do their own thing. Source: I'm a neurologist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you start to fall asleep a few things happen. Your body releases chemicals that make you all sleepy and it also produces chemicals that paralyze you. </p>
<p>This is so that you don't move while sleeping. Remember the last time you had a dream and you tried to act it out? That's the paralyzingly chemical for you. Your fidget is you trying to move, but being unable. </p>
<p>Now go the fuck to sleep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I often have dreams that wake me up and I continue them in real life. If I'm sleeping alone it usually takes me a minute or two to realize that I'm awake and that I'm acting out a dream. If my boyfriend is there, he'll snap me out of it sooner.
For example, I have a recurring dream that my ring falls off. For some reason, this causes me to wake up, get out of bed, grab my phone, and turn on the flashlight. I start looking all around the bed for my ring, regardless of the fact that it's still clearly on my finger. This usually wakes my boyfriend up and he asks me what I'm doing, to which I reply &quot;My ring fell off&quot;. Right after I say that, I realize that it was a dream and I go back to bed. This happens to me probably 3 nights a week. I have no idea what that is. Perhaps a form of sleepwalking? Although I'm entirely coherent while it's happening, I just fully believe whatever happened in my dream is happening in real life. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
