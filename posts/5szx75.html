		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have attempted to answer your question regarding the biological processes by which music is interpreted by the brain as <em>music</em> rather than just a collection of repetitive sounds.</p>
<p>But I don't see anyone taking a stab at explaining why certain sounds are &quot;pleasant&quot; or &quot;unpleasant.&quot; It turns out that there is a fairly wide range of diversity between cultures on that point. I'm not talking about the contrast between, say, hardcore punk and baroque fugues. Distinctions between harmony and counterpoint aside, both of those are firmly located in the Western musical tradition and are largely indistinguishable in terms of their musical theory. Their &quot;opinions&quot; as to what sounds &quot;happy&quot; and what sounds &quot;sad&quot;, for instance, are basically identical. Both of those genres have far more to do with each other than either has to do with, say, Eastern European polyphonic vocal traditions, which make significant use of intervals that Western music, for the most part, deliberately avoids. Or some Indonesian traditions which use instruments intentionally designed in such a way that when they are properly tuned, they produce the same kind of frequency beats that are the hallmarks of what defines an instrument as being <em>out</em> of tune in the Western tradition. </p>
<p>So yes, we have a pretty good idea as to what happens, biologically/neurologically, when we hear sounds/music that we consider to be pleasant. But exactly <em>what</em> sounds/music any particular individual or culture perceives to be pleasant appear to be almost entirely arbitrary functions of human culture. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>When we expect something and we get it, it feels good. Music is made primarily up of patters, and when the pattern yields a certain set of notes that you expected to hear, it feels good. Imagine striking the keys of a piano  descending order and making a full octave. It's not a stretch to say that the final note it what makes it. If the last note were to be something disharmonious however, that would pretty much ruin the progression.</li>
</ol>
<p>A single melody isn't the whole picture though, there are patterns of expectation and reward on smaller and larger scales. One might argue that the notes themselves yield a micro pattern of expectation and reward. An a note gives way to a c note, etc. the song as a whole also follows a pattern. If y hear a certain progression of notes, the listener expects to hear directly afterwards another certain progression of notes. this is most likely why listening to a song after the tenth time playing sometimes feels better than that first time. When we expect something and we get it it makes us happy.</p>
<p>Surprise also plays a role too. When we expect something and we get something different, we also like it. We don't want to get bored. This is why 99.99% of music is a carful mix of repetition, expectation/reward, and surprise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Music doesn't cause &quot;dopamine release&quot; in the brain.  It's a pop-culture myth that feelings of happiness / euphoria / reward / etc. are due to dopamine release.</p>
<p>The underlying truth is that <em>one</em> of the many dopaminergic circuits in the brain appears to be active when an unexpected good (OR BAD) event happens.</p>
<p>But the release of dopamine in that circuit doesn't directly affect the rest of the brain, just like release of the neurotransmitter glutamate (the most common excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain) in your visual cortex doesn't directly affect the rest of your brain...  Neurotransmitters have <em>local</em> effects, by definition.</p>
<p>Additionally, that circuit I mentioned <em>also</em> involves at least a half-dozen other neurotransmitters besides dopamine. including acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, glycine, phenethylamine, tyramine, and serotonin.  We call it a &quot;dopaminergic&quot; circuit, but in truth it's no more dopaminergic than it is glutamatergic, or GABAergic, or glycinergic, or serotonergic...  Et cetera.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong>  There is a brain circuit that is <em>very tangentially</em> related to reward, but it does NOT simply fire whenever something feels good.  That brain circuit contains dopamine releasing neurons, but so do a lot of other brain circuits.  This circuit also contains neurons that release at least a half dozen other neurotransmitters.  We can stop saying &quot;pleasure = dopamine release&quot; now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's one theory...</p>
<p>Music is communication, just like a conversation.  The frequencies used in music to convey emotion are <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0031942" target="_blank">similar in pattern</a> to the frequencies used in speech to convey the same emotions.<br />
So for example when we hear a sad song, the notes and their corresponding frequencies are mimicking the patterns we'd hear in the phrases used by a person who was talking about something sad.  And differences in Eastern and Western musical scales is indicating the difference in frequency and cadence of the common languages of those regions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><pre><code> The sense of musical beauty and emotion is created by the presence of tension and release.  I'll explain how this plays out in the domains of harmony, rhythm, and melody.  
 When we talk about harmony we are are talking abut how different pitches (musical notes) sound when combined.  If we play two pitches at the same time and look at the ratios of their frequencies, the ones with simpler ratios such as 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4 sound pure and restful.  Those with more complex ratios sound less so, and in some contexts may even sound ugly.  We call this restfulness consonance and the opposite dissonance.  It varies from culture to culture and over style periods exactly where to draw the line between consonant and dissonant, but in general movement from complexity to simplicity results in a feeling of tension and release. 
 In rhythm, we are dealing with placing musical notes in time, so imagine this as being the horizontal axis of music.  Most music has the concept of the pulse or beat.  Patterns of beats create a feeling of strong and weak beats which when manipulated give a sense of motion and direction.  Think of walking; before you can take a step you must first lift your foot.  At the moment your foot is in the air, it is like a weak beat in music, and when it comes down this is the string beat. Just like when your foot is suspended in air, there is a natural urge for it to come back down, so is the urge for the weak beat to progress to the strong beat.
 Melody, or the tunefulness of a musical passage, is created by the interaction of dissonance and consonance and the weak-strong beat structure.  We also take into consideration the melodic contour. Generally speaking, a rising line builds tension and a descending one releases it.  Wide leaps create more tension than stepwise motion.  For example take the tune "Somewhere Over the Rainbow."  It begins with the leap of an octave, which is a wide interval so we start the tune of with a dramatic expression that builds tension, followed by progressively smaller leaps in the 3rd and 5th measures.  The phrase resolves with stepwise motion leading back to the same note it begins on.
 With a bit of quick explaining of the mechanisms behind what makes music work, I hoped to share what is actually going on from a musical perspective.  I cannot really speak to the biological response because I am not a doctor or scientist, but it is my belief as a musician and music teacher that these processes can be understood intuitively, and the pleasure we feel when playing and hearing music is from the mind being subtly engaged in tracking all of this beautiful order.  </code></pre></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
