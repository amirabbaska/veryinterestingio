		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Because we figured out how. </p>
<p>Cooking meat allows us to extract about 15% more calories from it because of the denatured proteins. Similar for being able to mechanically digest it. </p>
<p>So ground beef that's been cooked to medium has about 25% more effective calories than the same weight of uncooked roast. </p>
<p>That lets humans be the efficient ape. Compared to Chimps (our closest relatives), we've got about the same amount of gut and about half as much jaw for twice the ape. </p>
<p>Cooking food kicks ass. </p>
<p>And this is even skipping over the huge gains that we get from our ability to take &quot;questionable&quot; (read, not really questionable, but almost certainly full of Trichinosis) meat and make it fully safe by sitting it over a smoky fire for a few hours. </p>
<p>Really, it may not be necessary to cook your meat, but it's so much better that it's no wonder the thermivore ape kicked the ever loving shit out of the omnivore apes when it came to competition for environment suitable for living/fucking/fighting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't need to cook meat.  You can eat it raw if you want so long as it's fresh. </p>
<p>Humans were just the only ones to discover cooking meat prolongs its life and makes it easier to digest,  which in turn allows us to absorb nutrients better.  </p>
<p>You can survive just fine on raw meat. You can't do it on week old raw meat though and our food system is designed so that the majority of meat people have access to or will use is old enough for it to be unsafe or at the very least risky to eat raw (because it's assumed you'll cook it). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans don't need to cook meat.  Freshly butchered meat is reasonably safe raw, unless it has parasites.  And that is the same risk other animals take when they eat raw meat.</p>
<p>Humans cook meat because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it kills parasites</li>
<li>it preserves the meat</li>
<li>it makes more calories available from it</li>
<li>because we can</li>
</ul></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can perfectly fine eat raw beef. You could also eat raw pork or chicken but this meat can easily be infected by salmonella or in case of pork could contain trichinosis. </p>
<p>So why don't animals get sick from raw meat? Because their immune system is confronted daily by salmonella and stuff. The same reasons why some people from the third world stay &quot;healthy&quot; when drinking water from some rivers when people from industry nations would get very ill drinking the same water. Our immune system is partly a trained one. If you don't work it out, it gets weaker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't need to cook meat to eat it. This should be obvious what with all the sushi restaurants.</p>
<p>Cocking food makes the nutrients more available for our digestion and clears out many parasites so it became the norm. It is not required though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
