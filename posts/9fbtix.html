		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a little difficult to describe in words (without visuals), but I'll give it a go.</p>
<p>When you aim at a target with a bow, you align the center of your weapon with the target and you aim up or down depending on distance. In this case, the &quot;weapon&quot; is the bow itself, not the arrow. </p>
<p>When the arrow is released, it begins to travel forward. Almost immediately, the presence of the bow itself starts to push that arrow to the left. This is because bows are solid matter, and arrows are solid matter, and two solid objects can't occupy the same space at the same time. The arrow rubs alongside the bow and out to the left (in the standard firing position).</p>
<p>It's a paradoxical idea because we know that arrows can be fired precisely, and the deflection caused by the &quot;Archer's Paradox&quot; should cause it to fire left. Do archers actually account for this, and constantly aim slightly to the right? </p>
<p>Well, no. The thing is, arrows aren't rigid. They're really flexible. So, the middle of our arrow hits that bow shaft, which causes the tip and tail to flex right while the middle flexes left. Then the tail hits the shaft, and it all shifts again, sort of like how a snake weaves back and forth. Snakes sidle left and right, but end up travelling in a straight line anyway, just like arrows do. </p>
<p>Czech out this video here if you need visuals, or a different way of explaining it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7zewtuUM_0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7zewtuUM_0</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The paradox is that you would expect that since the bow is in the way of the arrow, your intuition tells you that the bow should deflect the arrow as it tries to get around it. The paradox is that it doesn't and the reason why your intuition fails is because you implicitly assume that the arrow is rigid. In reality, the arrow is flexible and so the bow bends the arrow instead of deflecting it. As a result, the arrow isn't deflected but instead wobbles while in flight due to  the bending caused by the bow.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Modern compound bows don't have this effect because the arrow flies through a hole in the center of the bow, rather than to the side of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
