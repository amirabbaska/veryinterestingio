		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Orcas are fairly intelligent.</p>
<p>The various communities all have different hunting techniques.</p>
<p>Anyway, there was a case about an orca pod attacking a boy in Alaska, the boy was swimming and felt something touch him, he looked and saw an Orca.</p>
<p>Experts think the orca aborted the attack, thinking the boy was a seal as it was close to a harbour where seals are common.</p>
<p>My guess is the orca could have taken that boy without question.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are horror stories of orcas eating humans a few hundred years ago, before the rise of whaling. So I suspect orcas perhaps fear humans, if a human is killed by them then there would be retribution.</p>
<p>So yeah, whales are rarely ever aggressive to humans. Probably because they do not understand us, they are curious and do not see us as a prey item. </p>
<p>They are intelligent enough to know we would be an easy meal though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what i understand about killer whales is that individual pods tend to have specific diets and hunting tactics passed down through the generations. Since humans are not consistently in killer whales hunting areas they wouldnt have developed a &quot;taste&quot; for humans or the tactics to hunt them. Thats obviously not to say they couldnt, they just have no reason to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>not worth the effort. Seals and whales are covered in blubber...its all about the gainz. While we are much easier to catch, humans are mostly meat. While good blubber/fat is more energy per mouthful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Killer whales use echolocation to find their food. This tells them where the food is, how big the food is, and what it is made of. They can tell the difference between copper and lead balls - this sense is really sophisticated.</p>
<p>There are different groups of Killer whales, called 'ecotypes', which vary in size, colour and location. They also eat different things -some eat fish, some go for mammals. Whatever they usually eat, they can tell the difference between their normal food and a person with their echolocation. We don't look the same to them as a seal, or whatever else they might be eating. We are also not a very nutritious food, nor do we usually hang out where Killer whales do, so there hasn't been a need to adapt to make us part of their diet.</p>
<p>They have bigger brains than humans, so they're a lot more intelligent than most people think!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
