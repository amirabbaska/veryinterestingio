		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you get way more bandwidth on a TV cable. The reason for this is because they only have to send out each channel once. So if there are 400 channels, the cable TV provider just sends out 400 channels of content which people who are subscribed can request. This means even if there are 2000 people connected to that provider, it still only sends out 400 channels.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the internet is designed to be <em>dynamic</em>. Each person who wants a file - such as a bit of a video stream - requests it specifically and gets a specific response back. So if there are 2000 people asking for various parts of various videos, it uses bandwidth for all of them.</p>
<p>This is why you are getting much higher bandwidth via your cable tv line than your internet line. Coax cable I think with all channels combined can transfer about 4200 mbps? Though I might be misremembering. Still, the limit on your internet speed isn't in the cabling, usually, but instead on the fact that <em>somewhere</em> down the line there's just too many different things going on to get it all through at once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, the streams that you record are streamed out to everyone as part of the cable package you get. It has dedicated bandwidth. The cable box has 5 tuners in it. </p>
<p>Second, when you stream an on-demand program it has to go to you and only you. If too many people want to stream on-demand at once you could get a slowdown, because you share a &quot;last mile&quot; segment with neighbors.  </p>
<p>You may have another problem though. What is your advertised internet speed and are you getting it? Try using wired internet if possible. Many times people's slow speeds are due to wi-fi problems. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked tech support for a big IPTV company.  The pipe going into your house is big enough to support 5 HD channels and whatever tier of internet you have but always has the bandwidth required for the TV reserved for TV. So if you are watching one TV show and not recording anything the bandwidth that can carry 4 HD streams just sits idle it doesn't get allocated to the internet.  This is done for two reasons.  People complain way more about bad TV service then they do about slower internet.  And this big IPTV company wants you watching their TV content which is way more profitable for them then Netflix which they don't make money from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you're recording TV shows your cable company is in control of both ends, there is no middle man therefore you always get maximum speed or bandwidth.</p>
<p>Streaming an HD show or movie relies not just on your connection to your cable company, but the connection of at least 10 other servers between you and who is streaming you the show. Bandwidth in these scenarios is limited. </p>
<p>It's like driving a car down a road from point A to point B.</p>
<p>With your cable co, there is no traffic no nothing.</p>
<p>Streaming is like 10 intersections with other traffic and stop signs and red lights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good answers so far. Networking requirements and optimization are the root reasons for higher video data rates for Cable TV. Cable TV can be optimised for video broadcast from a central provider on a relatively fixed system, including the data format and compression.</p>
<p>Networks supporting IP (internet protocol) need more general-purpose data transmission, including variable addresses. Data is split into packets that are buffered, inspected for a destination, and forwarded at every router. This significantly increases the cost of Mbps, but also gives the internet the flexibility to get data from YouTube, Hulu, Steam, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
