Carnitine is used to shuttle fatty acids into mitochondria where they are used as an energy source. Why would inhibiting this process be in any way performance <em>enhancing</em>? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), meldonium acts as a &quot;metabolic modulator.&quot;  It improves sports performance by stopping the carnitine activities and stops the mitochondria from being overloaded by fatty acid breakdown during exercise and instead shifts the focus towards breaking down carbohydrates, which requires less oxygen to be taken away from muscles.  By reducing the pressure on the mitochondria, meldonium reduces the amount of urea and lactate in the blood and allows for improved oxygen transport to the muscles to aid not only in performance but in recovery.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because meldonium medically has been shown to improve the exercise capacity of injured tissues (for example, injured tissues in the heart in heart attacks), it has been used without any approval for increasing exercise capacity of noninjured tissues (like muscles and a healthy heart). One of the major issues with meldonium is that it's quite unknown. Many of the claims of its performance enhancement are largely untested, but rather used anecdotally and to &quot;keep up&quot;  with other athletics trends trends and dopers. </p>
<p>The mechanism of action would be likely of one of modifying a number of metabolic pathways, some understood (like the one you suggested), and others not well understood.   Our metabolisms are very complex, and many effects have multiple inputs and modifiers. </p>
<p>The simplistic answer is that it seems to reduce oxidative stress on tissues. </p>
<p>Edit: digging a little deeper into the original research on this compound is kinda weird because it is mostly eastern block stuff.  But I did find this:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>• Meldonium is used to treat ischaemia: a lack of blood flow to parts of the body, particularly in cases of angina or heart failure.</p>
<p>• It is manufactured in Latvia and only distributed in Baltic countries and Russia. It is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States and is not authorised in the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>• It increases blood flow, which improves exercise capacity in athletes.</p>
<p>• Wada found “evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance” by virtue of carrying more oxygen to muscle tissue.</p>
<p>• The decision to add meldonium to the banned list was approved on 16 September 2015, and it came into effect on 1 January 2016. Wada had spent the previous year monitoring the drug before adding it to the banned list.</p>
<p>• The drug was name-checked in the latest investigative documentary on Russian doping reforms by the German Hajo Seppelt on Sunday. The documentary referred to a 2015 study in which 17% of Russian athletes (724 of 4,316) tested were found to have meldonium in their system. A global study found 2.2% of athletes had it in their system.</p>
<p>• L’Equipe reported that the scientific advisor to the French Agency Against Doping (AFLD), Professor Xavier Bigard, said in interviews with athletes at last year’s European Games in Baku that a wide proportion of athletes admitted taking meldonium.</p>
<p>• It is classed as an S4 substance under the Wada code, which addresses hormone and metabolic modulators.</p>
<p>• The standard ban under the World Anti-Doping Code is four years.</p>
<p>• A memo was sent out to athletes by Russia’s anti-doping agency last September informing them of the decision to ban its use.</p>
<p>• Sharapova says she has been taking the drug for 10 years after she was regularly falling ill. She had a magnesium deficiency and family history of diabetes.</p>
<p>• Several athletes have been suspended since the turn of 2016 after testing positive for the dug. Abebe Aregawi, the 2013 women’s 1,500m world champion, has been provisionally suspended after meldonium was found in an A sample she provided. Endeshaw Negesse, the 2015 Tokyo marathon champion, was also banned after reportedly testing positive for the same substance. Others include Olga Abramova and Artem Tyschcenko, two Ukrainian biathletes, Eduard Vorganov, a Russian cyclist and Ekaterina Bobrova, a Russian ice dancer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meldonium" target="_blank">Meldonium</a> is an anti-ischemic drug, which means it increases blood flow to tissues. It has been shown to increase endurance performance in patients with angina, which is a condition brought on by poor blood flow. Increasing blood flow can have a performance enhancing effect for a healthy athlete, which is why meldonium ended up banned starting January 1st 2016 after being on the monitored list, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25847280" target="_blank">source</a>. It is classified as a metabolic modulator on the WADA <a href="http://list.wada-ama.org/prohibited-all-times/prohibited-substances/" target="_blank">Prohibited List</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Possibly a naïve question, but could it be the case that she was taking meldonium prior to the January 1 ban and it would still appear positive in testing now?</p>
<p>I only ask because I know some banned/monitored substances can show up months after stopping use.  For example, I'll stopped taking creatine several months before my recent blood test, but my liver results still showed elevated creatinine levels.</p>
