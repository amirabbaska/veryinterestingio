		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple and concise explanation </p>
<p><strong>Professional Boxing</strong></p>
<p>The scoring system used in professional boxing is called the 10-Point Must System. These are the basics for scoring a round:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Judges score on a 10-point scale. Most rounds will end 10-9, with the more dominant boxer receiving 10 points, the other receiving 9.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a boxer is knocked down, he loses a point. If a boxer is knocked down twice, he loses two points. If both fighters are knocked down, the knockdowns cancel each other out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While uncommon, if a fighter completely dominates a round but doesn’t score a knockdown, a judge can still score that round 10-8.
If a judge deems the round completely even, both fighters receive 10 points.</p>
</li>
<li>When the referee sees fit, he can take away a point or two for an intentional foul; he can do the same for unintentional ones, but that usually occurs after at least a warning.</li>
</ul>
<p>While you’d probably do well relying on the eyeball test to determine the winner of each round, it helps to know what a judge is looking for. These are the things that help determine which fighter won a round:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Effective Aggression – Being aggressive gives the impression of dominance, but unless the boxer is landing shots and not constantly getting countered, it’s not exactly “effective.” Judges look for effective aggression, where the aggressor consistently lands his punches and avoids those from his opponent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ring Generalship – The fighter who controls the action and enforces his will and style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defense – How well is a boxer slipping, parrying, and blocking punches? Good defense is important.</p>
</li>
<li>Hard and Clean Punches – To the untrained eye, it can appear as if a boxer is landing a lot of shots, when, in fact, most are being blocked or aren’t landing flush. A judge needs to look for hard shots that land clean.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a fight goes this distance, the result is determined by the scorecards. Here are the possible outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unanimous Decision – All three judges had the same fighter scoring more points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Split Decision – Two of the three judges had the same fighter scoring more points (the winner), while the other judge had the other boxer scoring more points (the loser).
Majority Decision – Two of the three judges had the same fighter scoring more points (the winner), while the other judge ruled the contest a draw.</p>
</li>
<li>Draw – A draw can occur when either two of the judges rule the contest a draw, or it can happen when one judge scores the bout for one fighter, another judge scores it for the other fighter, and the third rules it a draw.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amature Boxing</strong></p>
<p>Method of Scoring</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A judge is advised to fixate in between the two boxers; do not develop a tendency to study or follow just one of the boxers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amateur boxing is scored on a point system, not on a round basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The winner is decided on the majority of judges, i.e., 5-0, 4-1 or 3-2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a boxer, in the opinion of the referee, is being outclassed or is receiving unnecessary and excessive blows, the bout shall be stopped and the opponent declared the winner.</p>
</li>
<li>If one boxer has a 20-point advantage (for Open and Under 19/Junior men), or a 15-point advantage (for Women and Junior Olympics/Cadets) over their opponent, the bout must be stopped except in the last round, and the boxer with the advantage is declared the winner.</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The scoring system works like this: every round, the judges will score both fighters. Usually, they award 10 points to one fighter and 9 to the other. If a fighter gets knocked down, they lose one point. The judges can score a 10-10 or a 10-8 when no knockdown has occurred, but it's less common to see that, and judges usually see something that will give the edge to one fighter over another in a potential 10-10 case.</p>
<p>As for what they're looking for, they're looking for the dominant fighter. The fighter who is controlling the pace of the fight, who's attacking effectively, who's getting clean shots in, who's defending against his opponent very well. A fighter may throw lots of punches, but if they're not connecting, or if the opposing fighter's defense is really good, then it doesn't matter. </p>
<p>Since the scoring is done per round, score winners tend to be the fighters that were consistently dominant throughout the fight. If a fighter was on the losing end for most of a fight, came back very strong at the end, but didn't get a knockout, then that fighter will still likely lose by score. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I suspect many answers have been deleted by the mods because they don't deal with the technical aspects of how scoring should be performed.</p>
<p>However, the question posed here was &quot;How <strong>do</strong> judges determine who wins.&quot;</p>
<p>The word &quot;do&quot; is an important one, and makes the answer slightly different than if the question was phrased, &quot;How <strong>should</strong> judges determine who wins?&quot;</p>
<p>The top answer has done an effective job of answering how judges &quot;should&quot; score.</p>
<p>But boxing does have an extensive and well documented history of controversy, where how the judges &quot;should&quot; score does not always equal how they &quot;do&quot; score. There are many factors that contribute to the discrepancy between the &quot;ideal&quot; and &quot;real&quot; results. There factors can include limited viewing angles for judges, corruption (bribery), national favoritism (especially in the case of Olympic matches), etc. </p>
<p>These controversies are not at all rare in boxing. In fact, they are so common that the answer to this question would not be complete without acknowledging their existence.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s worth bearing in mind that judges literally see a different fight to what we do, they don’t get to see every angle of action, they don’t get to see slow motion replays, they don’t get commentary that can subliminally influence who we think is dominant, they often get blindsided during fights, they can’t always be 100% sure if every punch lands or not and they certainly can get influenced by home town support for a fighter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
