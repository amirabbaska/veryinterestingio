		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep stages. There are 5 different sleep stages; </p>
<ul>
<li>the 'on-ramp', you know when you're at the back of a boring class / lecture and your head starts nodding, literally 'falling asleep' as it feels like you've fallen if you catch yourself.</li>
<li>stage 2, your brain waves start to slow down (iirc waking, your brain has a 'frequency' of ~20 cycles per second, as this slows you become more relaxed and eventually fall asleep)</li>
<li>stage 3, this is 'deep sleep', usually the period where people experience erratic sleep behaviour such as sleepwalking, wetting the bed etc</li>
<li>stage 4, now your brain is pretty much only producing delta waves, frequency of around 1-4 cycles per second... so slooooow! If you are woken from this stage, you will feel VERY groggy and disoriented</li>
<li>and stage 5, the stage we all know so well... REM sleep! AFAIK, it's the 15 mins of REM sleep per hour which 'refresh' you. If you don't get REM time, you will not feel like you've slept properly. This is why we feel so ughhhhhh after drinking, because alcohol interrupts this important stage. Hangover = dehydration multiplied by being horribly sleep deprived.</li>
</ul>
<p>On that note, my hangover cure? Get up, drink a pint of water, have something nourishing, then go back to sleep for a couple of hours. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your sleep cycles are roughly 90 minutes in length.  If you set your clock for a time that will be at one of the 90 minute increments from when you actually go t sleep, it will be much easier to get started on your day.  </p>
<p>For example, if you need to get up at 7:00 am, and can get to sleep by 12:30 am, you are better off setting your alarm for 6:30 because the alarm will go off as you are emerging out of your fourth 90 minutes sleep cycle of the night.  By 7:00, you would be fairly deep into your fifth sleep cycle and woule feel tired and groggy.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Look into getting a sleep sensing alarm- I use one on my iPhone called Sleep Cycle that purports to be able to detect where you are in your sleep cycles and wake you up closest to your natural waking point, within half an hour of your alarm (set alarm for 6am, it will wake you up between 5:30-6 depending on where it thinks you are closest to already waking). Has two sensing modes, movement based (need to have it on the bed with you) and a newer audio based one (need to have it pointed at you on a nightstand next to the bed). Both modes defiantly seem to work much more pleasantly than a traditional alarm clock- it also has some &quot;gentle&quot; wake up noises (I do birdsong. Not startling, but loud enough and unusual enough that for me, it wakes me up, especially when I'm close to being awake)</p>
<p>The only trick is that our typical REM sleep cycles are about 3 hours from almost awake to deep sleep, so depending on when you go to sleep, that half hour waking window may still have you in pretty deep sleep, so it's best to try and get yourself to sleep in a time frame that syncs up with when you need to wake up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With an alarm you are interrupting a sleep cycle. Waking up naturally will be more refreshing because you come out of the end of a cycle. If you wake up at 8 hours naturally without an alarm and you'll be just as refreshed as your 1am wake up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the other posts said, it is about when you wake up during your cycle of sleep. If you want to time when you wake up or when to go to sleep based on the sleep cycle you can use www.sleepyti.me to calculate it. It helps you wake up feeling more awake and refreshed instead of tired and groggy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
