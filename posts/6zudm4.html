<p>While a free proton can't decay into a neutron, beta particle, and neutrino due to energy conservation, an entire nucleus can decay to a species of lower mass by converting one of its protons into a neutron.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An isolated proton is less massive than an isolated neutron yes,  but a bound state of a neutron and proton is less massive than two isolated protons.  </p>
<p>This is due to the binding energy of the proton and neutron.  Remember E = mc^2,  so as the two isolated protons had more mass,  they had more potential energy that the deuterium nucleus,  this energy is released in a positron and neutrino that are emitted after fusion. Edit: Typo</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Classical physics gives us conservation of mass and energy, but these are approximations. Einstein proposed a system in which mass and energy are interchangeable, and mass-energy is conserved. You'll notice that every element is slightly lighter than the sum of its neutrons and protons. That &quot;mass defect&quot;is related to the forces and energy that holds the nucleus together. To enable positron decay, the decay must release enough energy to make up for the mass that is &quot;spontaneously&quot; created.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The whole system must have more energy than the state it wants to decay to.  In the case of a free neutron you only have the neutron's mass to work with.  Once you are in a nucleus, then you are considering the mass of all of the protons and neutrons as well as the binding energy.  A proton can sort of &quot;borrow&quot; energy to allow a decay to happen, as long as the mass of the resulting nucleus will be lower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Correct, but you have not considered the whole reaction: energy from nucleus + p -&gt; n + positron + neutrino. The energy from the nucleus will always lead to a conservation of mass-energy. This decay can not happen in isolation, so that energy source will always be available.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
