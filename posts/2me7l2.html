		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>as much as i appreciate it, I've been given gold 5 times in this thread, I dont need it more, if you appreciated it that much, I would much rather you make a donation to your local food bank or toys for tots drive and let me know about it in the comments, there are a lot of people going hungry and giftless and your money is better spent on them than me</strong></p>
<p>As this has gotten so popular I want to emphasize from the start, there are many acceptable definitions for these, this is just one set, it is highly likely you have seen something different. Different places will have different rules on whats what or no rules at all. There are literally dozens of right answers to this. Almost all of these should really be affixed with &quot;is usually&quot; but because of how long this has gotten, I cant include every exception and variation.</p>
<p><strong>this post has become more effort than its worth and I am no longer maintaining it or replying to it, thanks for understanding</strong></p>
<p><strong>everything I found here is either rephrased from an urban planning textbook, wikipedia, or googles define function, I never claimed to be an expert on anything, what I gave here is essentially the most common occuring definition I could find, but many are used interchangeably, how a word is used in vernacular does not change an accepted definition.</strong> </p>

<li><strong>grove</strong> thickly sheltered by trees</li>
<li><strong>copse</strong> a small grove</li>
<li><strong>driveway</strong> almost always private, short, leading to a single residence or a few related ones</li>
<li><strong>laneway</strong> uncommon, usually down a country road, itself a public road leading to multiple private driveways.</li>
<li><strong>trace</strong> beaten path</li>
<li><strong>circle</strong> usually  circles around an area, but sometimes is like a &quot;square&quot;, an open place intersected by multiple roads.</li>
<li><strong>channel</strong> usually near a water channel, the water itself connecting two larger bodies of water,</li>
<li><strong>grange</strong> historically would have been a farmhouse or collection of houses on a farm, the road probably runs through what used to be a farm</li>
<li><strong>park</strong> originally meaning an enclosed space, came to refer to an enclosed area of nature in a city, usually a well decorated road.</li>
<li><strong>mill</strong> probably near an old flour mill or other mill.</li>
<li><strong>spur</strong> similar to a byway, a smaller road branching off from a major road.</li>
<li><strong>bypass</strong>  passes around a populated area to divert traffic</li>
<li><strong>roundabout or traffic circle</strong> circle around a traffic island with multiple connecting routes, a roundabout is usually smaller, with less room for crossing and passing, and safer  </li>
<li><strong>wynd</strong> a narrow lane between houses, similar to an alley, more common in UK</li>

<li><strong>parade</strong> wider than average road historically used as a parade ground.</li>
<li><strong>terrace</strong> more common in uk, a row of houses.</li>
<li><strong>chase</strong> on land historically used as private hunting grounds.</li>
<li><strong>branch</strong> divides a road or area into multiple subdivisions. </li>
</ul>
<p>These arent hard and fast rules. Most cities and such redefine them their own way about what road can be called what.</p>
<p><strong>why you drive on a parkway and park on a driveway</strong>  parkway originally referred to the decorations along that particular road, not the state of the cars on it, its similarities to a park being obvious. driveways were orignally much longer than they are now, so you actually would drive on them.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Largely missing so far is the historical background that gave these terms their resonance in English. </p>
<p>Road is Germanic and comes from a meaning of &quot;journey on horseback.&quot;</p>
<p>Street comes from Latin for paved road. The Romans were famous urban planners.</p>
<p>As with many words, French origins connote sophistication and class, like Avenue and Boulevard, while Anglo Saxon implies something simple or rustic, like Lane or Way.</p>
<p>For example, Avenue is originally a landscaping term for a straight path with plants alongside. The word is from the French venir and implies arriving at a destination. It's one of the oldest landscaping features and so implies importance. (Source: <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_(landscape" target="_blank">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_(landscape</a>))</p>
<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulevard#France" target="_blank">Boulevard</a> on the other hand was made famous by Baron Haussmann's modernization of Paris and led to an <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flâneur" target="_blank">entire culture</a>. The word origin itself is less relevant here and many Parisian boulevards have Avenue in the name but the concept is grand, wide, and straight.</p>
<p>Bucolic terms in modern English probably relate to the Garden City movement either directly or indirectly. <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_city_movement" target="_blank">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_city_movement</a></p>
<p>So a complete answer would have to get into a bit of history and urban studies and not just (highly variable) conventions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Vancouver:</p>
<p>Streets run North South. </p>
<p>Avenues run East West. </p>
<p>Lanes bisect standard city blocks to give rear access to buildings. </p>
<p>Boulevards are streets and Avenues with a grass median. </p>
<p>Roads are winding and do not follow the standard grid pattern. </p>
<p>Place is a road the doesn't extend 4 blocks and usually ends abruptly, or is a dead end. Cul-de-sac for example. </p>
<p>Way is a place that doesn't end abruptly. Like a winding lane. </p>
<p>Drives always have a dead end, like the path to a golf resort. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Totally depends on where you are. Everywhere in MN that I lived, avenues ran north/south, streets ran east/west. The others I have no idea.
Now I live in Phoenix, streets are east of Central, Avenues are west of central, with numbered going n/s and named going e/w. Drives, roads, etc are also split based on which side of town, but I don't know which is where. </p>
<p>Those are only 2 example but give a good illustration that it's completely depending on location. It's ultimately up to the city. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my province (Alberta, Canada), there is <em>some</em> kind of a standard, but you'd be hard-pressed to know it.</p>
<p>Streets and avenues are at right angles to one another. Most places have avenues going east-west, but at least one town near me turns it sideways, so avenues are north-south.</p>
<p>A county south of me uses streets and avenues for its main roads (more on county roads in a minute), and if a road angles off a street, you add 1000 to a number and call it a drive; if it angles off an avenue, you add 2000 and call it a drive. So 192 Street can have 1192 Drive going off it, and 434 Avenue can have 2434 Drive. Lunacy!</p>
<p>A road called a &quot;trail&quot; is going to be a highway or expressway here. Examples are Deerfoot Trail, Stoney Trail, Blackfoot Trail, Glenmore Trail. We don't have roads with the type &quot;Expressway&quot; or similar.</p>
<p>Highways, from local roads going between towns to the Trans-Canada Highway, are all numbered highways. Highway 1 is reserved for the Trans-Canada; Highway 2 is the main corridor going north-to-south through the province.</p>
<p>Most counties use what are called range roads or township roads to divide up the area in grids. This works off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta_Township_System" target="_blank">Alberta Township System</a>, which actually also is used in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba and some locations in the northwest central US states. The roads are numbered, in my area, based on the ATS - I'm in roughly the middle of Township 23, Range 5, so the nearest township road is <strong>23</strong>2, and range road <strong>5</strong>2.</p>
<p>In the nearest city to me, the suburban side-streets are just named for the community with all sorts of type suffixes appended. For example, the community of Falconridge in Calgary has Falconridge Drive, Falconridge Road, Falconridge Terrace, Falconridge Boulevard, and once they run out of ideas, they'll modify the main name, and give you Falmead Road, Falmead Rise, Falmead Terrace, Falchurch Way, Falmere Place, Falton Mews Falton Gate, and so on. There are tons of suffixes like 'Mews' and such that I'd never heard of until I moved here. I found one today, coincidentally, called Fireside <em>Burrow</em>.</p>
<p>So here, all the suffixes when you get down to suburban level have seemingly no rhyme nor reason to when they can be used, but there is some structure for larger roads.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
