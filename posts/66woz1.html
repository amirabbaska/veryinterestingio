		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question, I started noticing this in my early 30's.  But I only occasionally have nasal connection or a runny nose, but I ALWAYS have a cough. </p>
<p>It's gotten worse over the years, as have hangovers...But as we get older our production of alcohol dehydrogenase decreases... I never had a hangover until 32, it's been all downhill from there. </p>
<p>I think the histamines in alcohol coupled with an increase in other inflammatory chemicals that result from the consumption of alcohol all add up. </p>
<p>I found this article which covers several possible relationships between alcohol and inflammation:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2842521/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2842521/</a></p>
<p>From the abstract:</p>
<p>&quot;Chronic inflammation is often associated with alcohol-related medical conditions. The key inducer of such inflammation, and also the best understood, is gut microflora-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Alcohol can significantly increase the translocation of LPS from the gut. In healthy individuals, the adverse effects of LPS are kept in check by the actions and interactions of multiple organs. The liver plays a central role in detoxifying LPS and producing a balanced cytokine milieu. The central nervous system contributes to anti-inflammatory regulation through neuroimmunoendocrine actions. Chronic alcohol use impairs not only gut and liver functions, but also multi-organ interactions, leading to persistent systemic inflammation and ultimately, to organ damage. The study of these interactions may provide potential new targets for therapeutic intervention.&quot;</p>
<p>The bottom line is alcohol needs to be imbibed in moderation and everyone reacts a little differently, so just monitor what works for you and what doesn't. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sinus congestion from alcohol is caused by an alcohol intolerance and high levels of histamine in alcoholic beverages, according to CNN Health. One of the first signs of alcohol intolerance and sensitivity to histamine is sinus congestion and flushing of the skin. The condition is commonly referred to as an alcohol allergy, but is accurately diagnosed as an intolerance. The intolerance is a genetic condition where the person's body is unable to break down the alcohol, leading to complications. MayoClinic.com states that beer and wine specifically are high in histamine, leading to nasal congestion.</p>
<p>I have a friend that suffers from this. There is a couple of breweries that he found that is better on his allergies. Stone Delicious is the one I remember. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is news to me as it isn't &quot;humans&quot; that tend to get congested after a night of drinking. Rather it is a subset of humans who have a genetic trait of alcohol intolerance. Their bodies are not able to properly break down and digest the alcohol and the congestion is a symptom of the body fighting the poison.</p>
<p>I myself do not have this genetic defect and therefore have not experienced this before and I only learned of its existence just now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I personally have a severe mold allergy. I might wind up sneezing and congested all day, or fine. I all depends on what im drinking, how it is filtered, or if the taps are clean at the bar...</p>
