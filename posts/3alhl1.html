<p>Two ways to understand this:</p>
<p>Light has energy, and gravity acts on energy.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Gravity is the curvature of spacetime, and so the paths that light can travel are determined by gravitational effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>to understand the answer to this question you need to properly understand how gravity works. any object with mass actually bends spacetime itself, so, from the perspective of light, it would always be traveling in a straight line, however it's the space itself that it's travelling through that is bent is causing it to go towards a blackhole. in fact time actually bends on itself as well and once the event horizon is crossed all paths to the &quot;future&quot; also go closer to the centre of the singularity. this is why no matter what speed an object is travelling at through space (even a hypothetical &quot;faster than light&quot; object) can never escape a black hole once it has crossed the event horizon. it's because time itself is also bent so much the only escape would be to travel backwards in time.</p>
<p>i recommend watching this video on youtube to better understand the warping effect of spacetime and its effects on all objects traveling through warped space, not just the ones with mass.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As near as we can measure, the photon is truly massless.</p>
<p>What mass does is it distorts space-time so that light will follow a curved path.</p>
<p>One of the most fundamental principles in optics, fermat's principle, (which arises from one of the most fundamental principles in physics) is that light will travel a path between points A and B such that the time of flight between them is a minimum. Normally, the shortest rout between two points is a straight line. However, we've all seen light get bent as it goes into a glass of water - this is because the shortest time of flight when going between two materials means the light gets bent at the interface (more about this in the edit below).</p>
<p>Since mass distorts space, it also distorts the path of least time for a photon to travel. What was a straight line in un-deformed space becomes a curved line in the presence of a massive object. This leads to things like gravitational lensing and the like.</p>
<p>This type of path is called a geodesic and massive objects tend to warp geodesics in their local vicinity.  Some massive objects, like black holes, warp space so much that all paths light can take are so curved that they lead back into the black hole.</p>
<p>Fermat's principle indicates that light will travel the path that minimizes the time of flight between two points. Lets consider light bending as it moves from one material to another by way of analogy.</p>
<p>Imagine a lifeguard on a beach that needs to save a drowning victim in the water. The lifeguard needs to travel the fastest path to the victim, which you my think is a straight line. However, the lifeguard can run faster on land than he can swim in the water, so the fastest path to the victim is the one in which he runs further on land, and then turns sharply and starts swimming.</p>
<p>(As it turns out, dogs playing fetch on a beach will do the same thing. They want to get to the ball as fast as they can so they'll run on the beach further than swimming.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of different answers here which can be difficult to sort through, and I think that comes down to the fact that there are a lot of different ways of understanding the nature of a black hole. They very relativistic places, and relativity is all about different possible frames of looking at a situation.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p>In one sense, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_in_special_relativity" target="_blank">light is not in fact massless.</a> While the rest mass of a photon (the mass apparent from its own reference frame) is always zero, photons are only ever observed from much slower reference frames. That is to say, from our perspective, light is always moving. If any object is moving, even particles, it must have energy; the faster it's moving, the more energy it has. (Relatively also says that the faster it's moving, the more energy it takes to make it faster. Going from 0% to 50% the speed of light takes less energy than going from 50% to 90%. This is why objects with rest mass cannot go faster than the speed of light; it would take infinite energy to accelerate to that speed.)</p>
<p>Because a photon has energy, it has relativistic mass, and thus possesses momentum (allowing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure" target="_blank">solar sails</a> to work) and is affected by gravitational fields, including those present in a black hole.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p>From another perspective, black holes are not merely strong sources of gravitational attraction. Their gravity is so strong it literally bends and twists space and time around it. Space becomes curved in such a way that traveling in a straight line will take you in a path around the black hole.</p>
<p>By this same principle, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Black_hole#Event_horizon" target="_blank">direction of time itself becomes bent inward</a>, further and further the closer you get to the black hole. The event horizon is the distance from a black hole where all paths through time only travel further inward. That is to say, once you're past the event horizon, all paths that lead out of the black hole also lead backwards in time. Unfortunately to travel along such a path, you need to go faster than the speed of light, so you're pretty much boned.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p>The strange thing about all these understandings is they are all just different ways of looking at the exact same physical laws. No one understanding is &quot;better&quot; than any other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
