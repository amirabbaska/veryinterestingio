		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s generally bacteria that’s causing the smell, </p>
<p>If you add deodorant or sprays that aren’t antibacterial then they feed from it and reproduce more, increasing the smell</p>
<p>To kill the smell dead you can always freeze socks and shoes which won’t kill them all, but it will significantly reduce the amount of bacteria left and really does kill the smell</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because deodorant only masks smells with a stronger smell.  It does nothing to what is causing the smell.  Eventually, that stronger smell breaks down and goes away.  But the source of the stink, still exists and keep producing stink.</p>
<p>What you need to do is break the source of the smell.  Typically, that is bacteria.  </p>
<p>My go to method has always been to put my stinky shoes in a large zip-lock back, squeeze as much air out as possible, and then put them in the deep freeze for a couple days.  That usually kills all the bacteria that causes the stink.</p>
<p>Or you can get some spray disinfectant and keep spraying your shoes.  Take out the insole when you spray.  However, this is not always successful as the disinfectant doesn't always get deep into the material like sweat does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. Spraying deodorant in your shoes doesn't eliminate the bacteria that feed on the salty goodness and cause the smell when they &quot;poop.&quot; </p>
<p>Your feet are the sweatiest parts of your body and can produce up to a pint of sweat a day. You sweat even more if you wear polyurethane shoes or polyurethane-coated leather shoes. Stick with leather (smooth, suede, nubuck) or textile (canvas, mesh.) </p>
<p>They will also sweat more if you have memory foam sock liners. They don't breathe (just aerated plastic.) Bacteria will gather in the air pockets of the foam. If you like foam foot beds in your shoe, make sure you get shoes with removable sock liners. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once a shoe gets funk it doesn't go away. Moist damp shoes harbor bacteria and the smell is awful. </p>
<p>Put shoes in freezer for two days. Take them out and allow them to COMPLETELY dry. That should handle the funk. Works for my shoe stench. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fill a sprayer with 2 parts 'pure' (\~99.9%) isopropyl/rubbing alcohol and 1 part water. Spritz the offending footwear until damp and leave them to air dry. No more smell (until you've worn them a while).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
