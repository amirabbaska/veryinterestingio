<p>For general heat conservation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Huddling in groups with a constant rotation from outer towards inner and back <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL7O5O7U4Gs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=159" target="_blank">Youtube Link</a></li>
<li>Thick, tightly overlapping down feathers</li>
<li>Good general body design to minimize surface area exposed</li>
<li>Thick blubber</li>
</ul>
<p>For feet specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ability to dilate vessels and control flow</li>
<li>
<p>very little, if any, muscle in the feet. Movement is controlled by tendons which attach to muscles located deeper in the warm areas of the body <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5tflsl/eli5what_keeps_antarctic_penguins_from_having/ddmcvqf/" target="_blank">Penguin skeleton</a> - from u/Wolfy21_</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keeping them tucked under their warmer skin</p>
</li>
<li>counter-current heat exchange: veins and arteries are organized closely together in a way that allows the blood leaving the warm heart to run near the colder blood from the feet before it actually reaches the feet. Benefit is that it warms the colder blood before it reaches the main body and the warm blood loses its initial heat to other blood instead of ice/air. <a href="https://teamatlantic.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/ducks-heat-exchange.jpg" target="_blank">image</a>, credit to u/wildflower8872 from a similar thread years ago</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me tell you a little story that I learned in nursing school.</p>
<p>I actually asked one of my nursing professors this question too, in a joking fashion because I told him I've always wondered about it since I was a kid, and why penguins didn't melt through the ice.</p>
<p>He went on to tell me an amazing explanation as to why a penguin's foot is like a human testicle. In human biology the testicles sit outside of the body so that sperm can be produced because at a internal temperature of 98.6 degrees they cannot produce sperm. However sitting outside the body exposure to colder air can also decrease the Bloods temperature enough that when entering back into the body it could cause a person to go into shock. So in the human testicle there exists a cross current system where the artery coming out of the body into the testicles passes by the vein that returns back in thus cooling the internal hot arterial blood when it comes out, and warming back up the cold venous blood when it goes back into the body.</p>
<p>The same exact cross-current system exists in a penguin's foot so that the arterial blpod can be cooled down to a temperature that the feet can not melt through the ice and then warmed back up on its way in so it doesn't cause Penguins to go into shock.</p>
<p>And that my friends is why a penguin's foot is like a testicle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Essentially, it allows them to retain their core body temperatures by &quot;allowing&quot; their extremities to be more cold than the rest of their body.     </p>
<p>Frostbite in general happens as a result of the body restricting vessels in very cold extremities to maintain its core temperature, instead of allowing the cold blood to recirculate. Penguins, arctic foxes, and others don't have this issue, because they have counter current exchange systems in place, in which the returning blood is re-warmed by the oxygenated blood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might enjoy the book &quot;Why Don't Penguins Feet Freeze?&quot; I bought it and thought it'd never come in handy, so here's my chance to shine!</p>
<p>Part of the answer has a biochemical explantation.
A binding of oxygen to haemoglobin is normally a strongly exothermic reaction: an amount of heat (DH) is released as the molecules attach. The same amount of heat is usually absorbed in the reverse reaction. However, as oxygenation and deoxygenation occur in different parts of the organism, changes in molecular environment (e.g.: acidity) can result in heat loss or heat gain in the process.
With regards to cold peripheral tissues like the feet, DH is much smaller than humans.  This has 2 benefits. Heat is absorbed by the birds' haemoglobin when it's deoxygenated. The second is a consequence of the laws of thermodynamics. In any reversible reaction (e.g.: absorb/release of oxygen by haemoglobin) a low temperature encourages the reaction in the exothermic direction. So at low temps, oxygen is absorbed more strongly by most species' haemoglobin, and released less easily. A modest DH means that in cold tissue the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin doesn't become so high that the oxygen cannot disassociate.</p>
<p>2 mechanisms are at work; penguins can control the rate of blood flow to the feet by varying the diameter of arterial vessels supplying the blood. They also have 'counter-current exchangers' at the top of the legs. Heat flows from warm to cold blood, so little of it is carried down to the feet.
In winter, their feet are held a degree or two above freezing - to minimise heat loss, whilst avoiding frostbite. (Ducks &amp; geese are similar, but if held indoors for weeks in warm conditions and then released, their feet may freeze, because their physiology has adapted to warmth which causes blood flow to be virtually cut off and their foot temp falls below freezing)</p>
<p>Tldr; they've adapted to the cold and can lessen blood supply to the feet. They also  hold their feet at a steady temp, a degree or two above freezing.
Less heat is absorbed by the birds haemoglobin when it's deoxygenated. The low temperatures encourage an even more exothermic reaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surprised this hasn't been mentioned. In the cells of their feet, the phospholipid bilayer has a higher concentration of unsaturated fats than saturated. This causes the cells to have a lower freezing temperature. There are of course other factors, but they have already been mentioned so far in this thread</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
