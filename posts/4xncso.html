		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just called spacetime volume, or just volume when it's clear from context. In an n-dimensional manifold, the n-dimensional volume is generally just called &quot;volume&quot;.</p>
<p>It's a very important object to consider in physics. In special relativity, spacetime volume is preserved by transformations between inertial reference frames. In SR or GR in general it's relevant for example for the definition of a few essential quantities which are defined &quot;per unit of spacetime volume&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In SR, the focus is on the separation in space and time between two points in space and time. A point in space and time is uniquely described by its spatial and temporal coordinates – this is commonly called an event. </p>
<p>The spatiotemporal separation between two events is called the spacetime interval. In the everyday, we might say that we'll meet in 3 hours, four blocks away: we separate out the space and the time aspects. In SR, these two different but interrelated quantities are combined in the spacetime interval. If the spatial separation is denoted r, and the temporal separation is denoted t, then the spacetime interval is defined via s^2 = r^2 - c^2 t^2. </p>
<p>In SR, different observers may measure different values for r or for t – time dilation and length contraction mean that not all observers will agree on the time or distance that separate two events. But the way that these quantities co-vary means that all observers will agree on the value of the spacetime interval. This is why the spacetime interval as defined above is interesting. </p>
<p>Notice that if r &gt; ct, then s &gt; 0, and vice versa. This gives a way to distinguish between events that are 'space-like' separated, and those that are 'time-like' separated. This is something cool to read into further if you want. I'd intended to try explaining this point, but I'm on my phone and typing sucks, so... sorry. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We call it a 4-volume, more precisely a R⁴-volume. Generally, we refer to &quot;extent of space&quot; as an n-volume. The SI-unit of R⁴-volume of Minkowski space would be m³ s. 1 m³ s equals to one cubic meter over a time interval of one second. If you measure time intervals in units of length, as often done in physics, the unit would instead be m⁴. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
