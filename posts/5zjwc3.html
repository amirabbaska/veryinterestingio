		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quick story.  I was working as an undergrad at a Cyclotron facility working on a targeting device.  It had clear panels so that the cameras could see it.  We accidently left power on when we were bringing the beamline up to atmosphere.  At some point the conditions were perfect and the air flouresced and looked exactly what I imagined a beam would look like.  My prof laughed at my panic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In vacuum, no. But beam physicists have special devices which allow them to look at beams while tuning accelerators. You can carefully guide the beam onto a piece of material called a &quot;viewer&quot; and watch it through a camera. The viewer lights up when there is a beam hitting it.</p>
<p>I don't know the specifics of if or how they do this at the LHC, but it's common with any kind of accelerator.</p>
<p>As for what it physically looks like, just a bright spot on some grainy CRT screen hooked up to a cheap camera, in my experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It definitely depends on what direction you're looking at it from. If you're looking at it on the rotation plane of the beam (I. E., the plane of the accelerating ring itself) then you would definitely see <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron_radiation" target="_blank">Synchrotron radiation</a>.
This has important applications both as a source of EM radiation with special properties ad as a tool to measure the beam properties. Other than that, as long as the beam is propagating through vacuum, you wouldn't see much. </p>
<p>Edit: you can see an example of LHCs Synchrotron radiation collected with a mirror and a camera [here] (<a href="https://run2-13tev.web.cern.ch/sites/run2-13tev.web.cern.ch/files/image/inline-images/MAX5082.jpg" target="_blank">https://run2-13tev.web.cern.ch/sites/run2-13tev.web.cern.ch/files/image/inline-images/MAX5082.jpg</a>) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The LHC uses a lead electrode infrared arc laser, which is not visible. When accelerated it pushes the frequency well above the visible spectrum. That being said, to see &quot;light&quot; it has to hit something to reflect or excite electrons of a molecule that will in turn emit photons. Since there isn't anything in a vacuum for the beam to hit, it isn'tâ€‹ visible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EM fields would be much more difficult to deal with than plastics and degraders. There are efforts to make different types of accelerators which can have variable energies but once protons are out of a cyclotron, it's much easier to slow them down with degraders which can be characterised and well understood, and be quickly added or taken away.</p>
<p>If your beam has a range of 240mm in water/tissue and you want it to have a range of 150 mm then simply place material in the way with water equivalent thickness of 90 mm. The centre I've worked at at use lead wedges that move in and out of the beam and are calibrated to deliver precise range in water. This is checked regularly during quality assurance, and there is much less that can go wrong!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
