		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In most any legal proceeding, there are questions of <strong>fact</strong> and questions of <strong>law</strong>. My answer will focus primarily on criminal law. Let's look at an example of a man who was arrested for selling what he thought was cocaine, but lab tests later revealed that the substance was only baking powder. </p>
<p>Here we have a question of law. Does somebody commit the crime of intent to distribute cocaine if the substance they were selling wasn't cocaine, but they thought it was? Or must the charges be dismissed? The judge is the <strong>finder of law</strong>. His or her job is to answer the legal questions posed by the situation. </p>
<p>Let's say that the judge determined that thinking that what you have is cocaine is enough for the charge to stand. The case proceeds to trial, and a jury is selected. The jury is the <strong>finder of fact</strong>. Their job is to listen to the evidence, and decide if the government has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant did intend to distribute cocaine. They don't deal with the legal issues. Their only job is to consider what actually <em>happened</em>.</p>
<p>Judges also maintain other roles. They maintain order in the courtroom, rule on the admissibility of evidence, and deal with everything that happens before and after the trial (taking guilty pleas, setting dates, hearing motions, considering sentencing). In some situations, the defendant will ask for the judge to decide the entire case, without a jury. In other situations, the defendant is not even entitled to a jury, and the judge is automatically the finder of both law and fact. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was a public defender (trial attorney) for 5 years, here's a short (I'll do my best but attorneys tend to talk a lot) version of what judges do.</p>
<p>First thing's first. There's A LOT that happens that aren't trials. Depending on where you live in the states 95-99% of criminal cases are resolved with plea deals and never have a trial, and therefore no jury is ever assigned. Judges in these situations typically just keep things moving (make sure the police files are getting sent over in time and that lawyers are doing what they need to do in a timely manner), make sure that the accused understands their rights and the plea they are taking or rejecting, and then sentencing. </p>
<p>Sentencing is a big part of the judge's job. Unlike television most states don't let people agree to a specific sentence in a plea, you have to have a range of sentencing (i.e. you don't sign a pea to four years in prison, you sign a plea to 3-5). Judges decide the sentence within that range and are required to give sentences &quot;specific&quot; to the circumstances. This typically means they read briefs from both attorneys on the facts and additionally have the accused submit to an interview regarding their life circumstances, which can be quite time consuming given that a judge is probably giving 5-20 sentences a day. </p>
<p>Trial actually doesn't have a ton of work for judges (I've had judges fall asleep in trial), their main responsibility there is to rule on objections. 90% of these are very straight forward and literally take seconds to resolve. The other 10% are supposed to be handled before trial (called motions in limine) and take maybe an hour, though I have seen the occasional one take an entire day. Other than that they don't do much in trial, it's pretty much the attorney's show (A lot of judges don't really like trials, they have a lot of work to do and don't really like just sitting around watching the trial).</p>
<p>Another redditor mentioned &quot;questions of law,&quot; and while they are technically correct it's worth pointing out that questions of law are generally handled by appellate judges not trial level judges. Trial level judges don't really have the authority to decide questions of law, instead attorney's brief them on the state of law and then the judge applies what appears to be the most relevant and recent law to the current situation. For example if you go to a judge and say 'the police searched me illegally' the judge doesn't say the police should or shouldn't have done what they did, they just find the most similar existing case-law and follow that decision. </p>
<p>Appellate courts at the highest level (Supreme Court of the U.S. and various states) will decide true questions of law. They are the only ones with the authority to change existing legal rulings and decide what the rule is in new unheard-of situations. This is all pretty simplified though.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Am lawyer, would guess 90% of what a judge does is sentencing and making sure cases move through the system quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Judges still make many decisions. They rule on motions, they can dismiss jurors, decide what juries can see or hear. Judges have to make sure that all of the procedures and rules are followed so that a guilty verdict will not be reversed on appeal.</p>
<p>And a judge has the power to throw out a jury verdict if he thinks they got it wrong.</p>
<p>We need judges since there are bench trials, no jury, the judge decides the verdict. </p>
<p>Although due to mandatory minimums and sentencing laws limit judges power, they still have some power in sentencing.</p>
<p>In the US, over 90% of cases don't go to trial, they are settled by a plea agreement between the prosecutor and the defense. The judge must approve any deal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Judges make rulings of law.</p>
<p>Juries make findings of fact.</p>
<p>A judge will say &quot;if your actions were intentional, your crime is first degree murder, with special circumstances that make you eligible for the death penalty&quot;.</p>
<p>A jury will say &quot;we don't believe the your foot slipped, we think you ran over those preschoolers on purpose&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
