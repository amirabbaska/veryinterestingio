		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern metals would make better and stronger swords than they had in medieval times, but it would make little difference in a fight. The sword would last longer before losing its edge, but it wouldn't be some kind of super weapon that could slice through plate armour or cut through blades. </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/NF9ylTFbzYc?t=4m26s" target="_blank">This video shows what I mean</a>. He uses a modern high quality steel sword and tries to cut through a cheap knock-off knife. It is incredibly ideal circumstances with the knife braced against a hard surface and a clean 90 degree cut, something that would never happen in real life, yet it still takes a huge amount of force and multiple attempts to cut through. In combat you would likely never have a situation like that, and the force would never be completely transferred into the blade. </p>
<p>This is especially true when talking about combat in plate armour, because they would very rarely strike with edge of the blade, if at all. It was all about thrusts and grappling with the opponent and they would hold the sword half way down the blade to use as a fast and accurate stabbing weapon to reach between the joints in the armour. You could hit plate armour all day long with a sword and make little more than a dent and some scratches.</p>
<p>While medieval metallurgy wasn't as advanced as modern metallurgy, by the end of the medieval period they had finely tuned the designs of swords to be very practical and good at their job. I doubt modern craftsmen could make anything better since a lot of the skills they had would have been lost so it would mostly come down to guessing and copying old designs. So the only advantage a modern sword would have would be the higher quality steel.</p>
<p>As for many of the advanced materials that are used in cutting tools nowadays, most of them are far too brittle to use as a sword and would shatter or break very quickly, and the ones that wouldn't would have be little improvement over steel. </p>
<p>TLDR; Modern swords would be more resilient and hold an edge longer, but would make little to no difference in combat. You wouldn't be able to slice through blades and cut through plate armour, and the designs of medieval swords were already very well designed for their purpose and not much could be changed to make them noticeably better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest benefits of modern technology would probably only be available after you move away from a medieval design such as a solid metal blade.  A composite blade might well prove lighter and more flexible than a metal blade.  Most swords weren't all that heavy to begin with though.  Also, even with a lighter, more flexible, sharper blade, skill is going to be pretty important.  Such a sword would give it's wielder an edge, but probably not one sufficient to overcome a lifetime of training, as many medieval combatants would have had.  </p>
<p>One thing you're overlooking though is shields.  RPG's may portray them as defensive items, but shields were historically wielded in a variety of highly offensive ways. They really are weapons in the truest sense of the word.  Modern materials could likely do far more for shields than they could for swords.  A shield built with modern materials could be substantially lighter and tuned to be rigid when striking yet cushioning when struck, making them better at both giving blows and blocking them.  You could make them transparent, which would give the wielder better awareness of his opponent.  You might also make them permeable to air to reduce wind resistance to make them faster to move.  A modern shield might offer a much bigger edge than a modern sword.  </p>
<p>All that being said, it would take less expertise, effort, and work to produce a crude gun from scratch, which would actually <em>be</em> the superweapon you're after.  There's a reason why guns took over!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends what you mean.</p>
<p>My understanding is that in real battles, swords were never able to actually cut through plate armor of the late medieval era. In battle against an armored opponent, you would try to use a more concussive weapon such as a mace, axe or war hammer, that would be capable of delivering substantial force even through plate armor and possibly deforming the armor under the point of impact. If a sword was all you had available, you'd try to poke it between the armor plates where hopefully there's a lot less metal between the sword point and your opponent's skin.</p>
<p>Modern metallurgy is unlikely to change this. The main advantage of a sword made with modern alloys over an equivalent medieval sword is that, in a sword-on-sword fight where the swords are being used to block each other, the medieval one is much more likely to break sooner (assuming they're wielded with equal skill). However, as far as actually slicing through plate armor is concerned, the modern sword still won't be effective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very little.  Sword tech was excellent at its peak, and saw plenty of production.  However, there were still plenty of armies which lost in part due to problems arming themselves with effective equipment.</p>
<p>There's not much better you could do.  A sword could already cut an arm badly on light hit.  Ceramic or whatever is no more likely to get through steel plate or chainmail.</p>
<p>In fact, swords were NOT the primary weapon in most of history.  Polearms were, and bows.  Polearms could pack together and make a deep barrier you just couldn't get through.  Swords need space to swing.</p>
<p>Swords were generally ineffective against plate or chain.  In fact, most armor was padded cloth/canvas that did a lot to stop a sword.  Swords with a sharp edge would more likely have the edge damaged on a plate impact rather than penetrating the plate. </p>
<p>A polearm, with shaft, was relatively massive.  It could separate chainmail links or break your bones through unbroken chainmail.  On a thrust, it could travel up one steel plate until it got to a joint and pushed under the next overlapping plate.  What's underneath could be a padded gambeson or a gambeson over chainmail, which it could injure through.</p>
<p>One thing that WOULD be improved would be arrowheads.  Most weren't hardened steel and probably not effective at penetrating plate.  Also most weren't broadheads, broadheads cost too much to mass-mfg and were ineffective on chainmail, probably heavy cloth/canvas too.  And it was hard to carry a LOT of the shafts due to head width.    Instead they were narrow steel &quot;bodkin points&quot; which handily penetrated chain and cloth but, like I say, not super-effective on plate and also didn't cause really serious injury for immediate stopping power.  About like getting stabbed with a pencil.   Hardened steel points could penetrate plate better, and might be made wider to cause more dire injury.</p>
<p>The more interesting question- could modern materials and engineering make SUPERARMOR??</p>
<p>Yes, actually.  I think so.  Many plastics are more effective than steel at stopping these impacts.  Ballistic nylon is radically better at stopping blades from cutting, as would stainless mesh chainmail.</p>
<p>One primary limitation was what would be practical to both make and wear and still fight.  Modern 3D CAD design would go a long way to making effective, form-fitting, practical designs- especially covering the joints.  Making the armor bulky enough to absorb huge impacts without having the impact carry far enough to break bones.</p>
<p>Helmets... that was sort of a limiting factor.  Wearing steel plates all over was NOT as heavy as you probably think.  But an effective steel helm was hot, bulky, very restrictive for vision/breathing, and slowed you down overall.  Also a concussion through those things would take you down easier than trying to strike through plate or chain.</p>
<p>If you don't have an effective helm, going with super-effective plate over, say, chainmail isn't all that beneficial.  In the thick of things they'll just strike for your head regardless of how much armor you have elsewhere.</p>
<p>Modern football helmet would probably be super-effective in medieval combat.  Generally speaking you can't knife through the plastic shell, a sword won't do much better.  An axe would smash through it, but those are relatively slow weapons and due to the shape, most impacts would glance off.  The grille protects the lower face ok without impairing breathing or vision much.  You'd probably add a solid nosebridge to the design, but it's mostly &quot;there&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
