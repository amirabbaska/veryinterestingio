		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that hasn't been mentioned here yet is that, while it works out because it was deliberately designed that way, the system is actually being redesigned so to speak. The changes won't alter anything in our day to day lives since we don't deal with anything on this level of precision, but there is a push for the base SI system to be based on physically derivable (and constant) values. It essentially takes the convenience of the SI system we have established and then backtracks to assign a physical and non-arbitrary way to measure each unit. Take this excerpt from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_redefinition_of_SI_base_units?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">relevant Wikipedia article</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A committee of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) has proposed revised formal definitions of the SI base units, which are being examined by the CIPM and which will likely be adopted at the 26th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in the fall of 2018. The metric system was originally conceived as a system of measurement that was derivable from nature. When the metric system was first introduced in France in 1799 technical problems necessitated the use of artifacts such as the prototype metre and kilogram. In 1960 the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of light from a specified source, making it derivable from nature, leaving the kilogram as the only unit still defined by an artifact. If the proposed redefinition is accepted, the metric system (SI) will, for the first time, be wholly derivable from nature.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, it &quot;works out&quot; this way, because the values of the litre, kilogram and metre were deliberately <em>picked</em> to align in such a way. Water, being a very common substance, was a good reference point to base the values on.</p>
<p>This is basically the same reason the Celcius scale is conveniently at 0 at the point where water freezes, <del>or why the day is conveniently divided into 24 hours of 60 minutes each</del>. There is no objective reality to the litre, kilogram, degree of temperature or any such measurement. They are simply numbers that have been picked because they were convenient and worked together - as opposed to measurements like foot or yard, which originally reflected common measuring methods (like using one's own body to measure stuff), and thus didn't line up too well.</p>
<p>In fact, this convenience is one of the major reasons (if not <em>the</em> major reason) the metric system was adopted in the first place.</p>
<p>EDIT: deleted the &quot;time&quot; example, because it makes no sense within the context and I'm stupid ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because everything is defined to be simple and orderly. 10 milli units in a centi unit, 10 centi in a deci, etc. Everything is just nice round ones and zeroes. Easy to remember, easy to use. Similarly, 1 ml is defined as 1 cm³. This is literally THE definition of those units. If you fill that amount of space up with water, you get 1 gram. Again, it was designed like that. They basically filled up the 1 ml of water first, and then decided &quot;this will from now on be called a gram&quot;. People sat down and froze and then boiled some water, and then decided &quot;this boiling point will be 0 degrees, and this freezing point 100&quot;, although this was reversed soon after. Yes, 0 degrees used to be the boiling point. It was actually reversed for a short while. Nowadays, 0 is the freezing point of water, and 100 the boiling point. <a href="https://youtu.be/rjht4oAByCI" target="_blank">Here's a video on that</a>. It should also be noted that nowadays, the definitions of these units are actually considered too unreliable, and various other more reliable (but more difficult to explain) definitions are used instead. </p>
<p>Compare that to imperial, where there's 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, and then the chain (22 yards) and furlong (10 chains), which are never used. And a mile is 8 furlongs or 5280 feet. That isn't a system. There is no order, no sense. It's pure randomness. I don't understand how you can remember all of that, or why you'd even want to. The definitions of metric units are just things that people came up with, but at least they're consistent by design. They have a structure that imperial completely lacks. That imperial was never designed to have. </p>
<p>ELI5 part of my comment stops here:</p>
<p>Personally, I believe that the objectively best measuring system would be purely based on physical constants. For example, the speed of light in a vacuum, or c, should be equal to 1. Every other speed would be a fraction of c. 50 km/h would be about 4.6*10^(-8) c. That may not seem like an improvement until you, until you start looking at various formulas. E²=(pc)². For daily usage, you could just decide that 10^(-9) c is called a nano-c. The 50 km/h I mentioned earlier would then become 46 nano-c. That seems practical enough to me. And it should be possible to to do the same for other physical quantities. It would make the life of a scientist a whole lot easier. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because that's how it was designed. It began with a metre, which was defined (originally) as 1/10,000,000th of the length of a line from the North Pole to the equator through Paris. Then one litre was defined as one cubic decimetre -- that is, the volume of a cube with sides 1/10th metre in length. And then one kilogramme (originally called a &quot;grave&quot;) was defined as the weight of one litre of pure water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This quote from a book is always relevant:</p>
<p>In metric, one millimeter of water occupies one cubic centimeter, weighs one gram, and requires one calorie of energy to heat up by one degree Centigrade - which is one percent of the difference between its freezing and boiling point. An amount of hydrogen weighing the same amount has exactly one mole of atoms in it. Whereas in the American system, the answer to &quot;How much energy does it take to boil a room-temperature gallon of water?&quot; is &quot;Go fuck yourself&quot; because you can't directly relate any of those quantities. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
