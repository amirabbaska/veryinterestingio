One remains competent while the other can barely stand. Is the first person producing something in their body which allows them to take in more alcohol before acting drunk, or is their mind somehow trained to deal with it? Same thing with pain.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a physical thing.</p>
<p>There's this idea in biology called &quot;homeostasis&quot;. Basically, your body has an idea of chemical balance, and it adjusts to stay balanced. Like: it's hot out, so you sweat, so you cool down, then you stop sweating. Or you eat candy, which raises your blood sugar. Your body will release insulin, which will lower your blood sugar. As it gets back to normal, insulin release tapers off.</p>
<p>This applies to everything. If you drink alcohol once, it'll make you drunk. If you drink it every day, your body will start adjusting to compensate for it, and you'll have a harder and harder time getting drunk. Soon alcohol just brings you up to normal. If you then stop drinking, your body will now be off-balance in the other direction, and you'll go into withdrawal until homeostasis can be restored.</p>
<p>Pain? Similar deal. Your brain tries to maintain homeostasis. Acute, agonized misery is only sustainable for so long. If the pain itself can't be dulled down, your emotional reaction to it can be. The emergency shutoff switch is when this doesn't work, and <em>all</em> your emotions are cranked down as far as they can go. That includes distress, pleasure, and fear: basically, it causes apathetic depression.  This is why you can't just expect people to &quot;get used&quot; to severe pain. </p>
<p>When I say this applies to everything, I mean it. Sex, gambling, sugar, background noise, <em>everything</em> is filtered through your perceptions in this way. Why aren't rich people all happy? Because that level of prosperity is their new normal. What's up with Stockholm syndrome? Victims become desensitized to abuse, and their expectations for &quot;kindness&quot; are steadily reduced. Why aren't teenagers overwhelmed by the pace of the internet? Because it's normal for them. Why don't better football helmets reduce the number of concussions? Because people just do dumber things in order to maintain the same sense of acceptable risk.</p>
<p>This one principle explains quite a bit about why people act the way they do.</p>
<p>Edit: Minor correction, plus some comma wrangling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;The liver does this by producing larger amounts of the enzymes which break down alcohol. Because the liver has become more efficient at breaking down alcohol, drinkers need to drink more alcohol in order to get the same effect. This is the role that the liver plays in the development of alcohol tolerance.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://hams.cc/tolerance/" target="_blank">http://hams.cc/tolerance/</a></p>
<p>What the liver does in more detail:</p>
<p>&quot;Alcohol is metabolized by several processes or pathways. The most common of these pathways involves two enzymesâ€”alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). These enzymes help break apart the alcohol molecule, making it possible to eliminate it from the body. First, ADH metabolizes alcohol to acetaldehyde. Then, in a second step, acetaldehyde is further metabolized down to another, less active byproduct called acetate, which then is broken down into water and carbon dioxide for easy elimination &quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa72/aa72.htm" target="_blank">https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa72/aa72.htm</a></p>
<p>&quot;The brain also has a role in the development of alcohol tolerance. When the neurotransmitter systems in the brain are regularly exposed to large amounts of alcohol they begin to adapt to the presence of alcohol. The alcohol works to suppress the functioning of the neurotransmitter systems. For example alcohol affects the GABA system causing sleepiness and a reduction in anxiety and alertness. With long term exposure to alcohol the GABA system adapts so that the alcohol causes less relaxation, sleepiness, and dulling of alertness. Because of this adaption to the presence of alcohol by the brain heavy drinkers begin to require more alcohol to get the same effect.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://hams.cc/tolerance/" target="_blank">http://hams.cc/tolerance/</a></p>
<p>TLdr: The liver eliminates alcohol more effeciently. The brain adjusts so that alcohol doesn't affect it as much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I got caught smoking pot in the dorms and had to attend a session led by a psychologist at my university, and he actually talked a little about this. Most people here are hitting the head on the physical aspect but one thing I didn't see is a certain, interesting (to me) psychological aspect. Let's say you drink if and only if you're in your room, and you need 12 beers to get drunk. Well, two things happen - when you enter your room your body primes you for alcohol consumption, since your brain is associating your room to drinking. Secondly, let's say one night you mix things things up and decide to drink at a friend's house. Well your brain doesn't associate your friend's house with drinking, so you don't have that priming, and those 12 beers will actually get you more drunk than if you were in your room. He also brought up the fact that most heroin overdoses occur in a new area from where the junkie usually shoots up. I don't have his sources for this stuff, I'm just writing what I remember from the lecture. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's both, I think there are enough answers here on the physical side. On the Psychological side, if you think you are getting drunk then you will display symptoms of becoming drunk. This can also mean that if you're drinking alcohol, you may feel the symptoms &quot;early&quot;, so to speak. You're mind expects the effect, so it produces the effect itself.   </p>
<p>Here's an <a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/media/releases/2002/pr021224.cfm" target="_blank">article</a> on how your mind can trick you into thinking you're becoming drunk (there's many more articles on this too). Essentially, it's just a placebo effect (if you're not using real alcohol). If you take this concept of psychological &quot;drunkenness&quot; and combine it with the physical component described in the other answers, you get the case of two people being the same body weight and same alcohol being on completely different levels of inebriation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a chronic pain disorder that most people get when they are older if they get it but I started having symptoms when I was 14 and it kicked in fully by 17-18. I'm able to handle the pain a lot better (as in not showing others that I'm in pain and not letting it run my life ) than most others with the same illness and that is probably because they spent a large portion of their life without pain where as I didn't have much of one before hand. Of course I went through depression periods and I still do but on the whole I basically had to except that life is painful but that doesn't mean I have to be sad too. The pain isn't getting better but I'm able to not let it affect my mood most of the time. I've found things that let me not think too much about the pain and that's the biggest thing that's helped. Its pretty cool that even if you're in a lot of pain if you find something that really interests you and makes you concentrate the pain doesn't seem like its there until I stop doing that thing. For me it was videogames, books, and art those are my best pain killers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
