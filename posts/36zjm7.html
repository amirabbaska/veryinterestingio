<p>I have been playing tennis for 4 or 5 years now and I always wonder: Why in hell do you count like this? Is there any reason for 15, 30, 40? The jumps are not even the same (+15,+10). What's the point in it?</p>
<p>Thanks :D</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically the French used to play a game called <em>jeu de paume</em>, which was like tennis but with the palms of their hands.</p>
<p>The courts were 90 feet long, so each player had 45 feet to play in.</p>
<p>When the player got a point they were allowed to move up the court - the first time 15 feet, the second another 15 (to 30 feet), and finally 10 feet (to 40 feet) so there was still a 5 foot gap from the player to the net.</p>
<p>The scores still follow this pattern.  They could have changed it I suppose, so it would go &quot;15, 30, 45&quot;, but 45 is harder to say than 40 <del>particularly in French</del></p>
<p>EDIT: Yes I mean feet, France only adopted the metric system towards the beginning of the 1800s, and Jeu de Paume predates that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being a scientist, I discovered the following on Wikipedia: History[edit]</p>
<p>The origins of the 15, 30, and 40 scores are believed to be medieval French. The earliest reference is in a ballad by Charles D'Orleans in 1435 which refers to quarante cinque (which gave rise to our 40) and in 1522 there is a sentence in Latin &quot;we are winning thirty, we are winning forty-five&quot;. The first recorded theories about the origin of fifteen were published in 1555 and 1579. However the origins of this convention remain obscure.[3]</p>
<p>It is possible that clock faces were used on court, with a quarter move of the hand to indicate a score of 15, 30, and 45. When the hand moved to 60, the game was over. However, in order to ensure that the game could not be won by a one-point difference in players' scores, the idea of &quot;deuce&quot; was introduced. To make the score stay within the &quot;60&quot; ticks on the clock face, the 45 was changed to 40. Therefore, if both players have 40, the first player to score receives ten and that moves the clock to 50. If the player scores a second time before the opponent is able to score, they are awarded another ten and the clock moves to 60. The 60 signifies the end of the game. However, if a player fails to score twice in a row, then the clock would move back to 40 to establish another &quot;deuce&quot;.[4][5][6]</p>
<p>Another theory is that the scoring nomenclature came from the French game jeu de paume (a precursor to tennis which initially used the hand instead of a racket). Jeu de paume was very popular before the French revolution, with more than 1,000 courts in Paris alone. The traditional court was 90 ft in total with 45 ft on each side. When the server scored, he moved forward 15 ft. If he scored again, he would move another 15 ft. If he scored a third time, he could only move 10 ft closer.[7]</p>
<p>The origin of the use of &quot;love&quot; for zero is also disputed. It is possible that it derives from the French expression for &quot;the egg&quot; (l'Å“uf) because an egg looks like the number zero.[8][9] This is similar to the origin of the term &quot;duck&quot; in cricket, supposedly from &quot;duck's egg&quot;, referring to a batsman who has been called out without completing a run. One possibility comes from the Dutch expression iets voor lof doen, which means to do something for praise, implying no monetary stakes.[10] Another theory on the origins of the use of &quot;love&quot; comes from the acceptance that, at the start of any match, when scores are at zero, players still have &quot;love for each other&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i was led to believe that they used clocks for the points....</p>
<p>1 point = 15 mins</p>
<p>2 point = 30 mins</p>
<p>3 points = 45 mins</p>
<p>however, since you have Advantage to worry about, instead of moving the clock to 45 mins, they would move it to 40, allowing the clock to be moved to 55 mins to show Advantage.</p>
<p>hope this clears it up!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
