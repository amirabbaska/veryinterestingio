		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have addressed your comment about the timeframe. </p>
<p>Here's why they are special:
Normal colors reflect the color you see and absorb anything else (a blue shirt absorbs red, yellow, green, etc. but reflects blue). This means that if there light hitting the shirt has 100 brightness units, the shirt can reflect up to 100 brightness units back.</p>
<p>Fluorescent colors are able to absorb energy from beyond the range we can see (UV) and then re-emit it in a color we can see. So a fluorescent blue shirt could reflect up to 100 brightness units back of blue, and absorb another 100 brightness units of UV and emit them back as blue light, giving off 200 brightness units of blue in a room where everything else is only giving off 100.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your premise is flawed. </p>
<p>Neon or fluorescent or day-glo colors (whatever you want to call them) were first used in the 1930s with the invention of phosphorescent dyes and neon light tubing. It's not that those colors didn't exist in the light spectrum, just that we didn't have a way to reproduce them until then. </p>
<p>The colors were very popular in the 30s, 40s, and even into the 50s when neon lights kind of hit their peak. </p>
<p>Like any trend, the popularity faded a little in the 60s and 70s when colors and styles were more &quot;neutral&quot; or &quot;nature inspired&quot; (remember brown everything, and harvest gold and avocado colored appliances) and movies and art were more gritty and dark. </p>
<p>And again, cycling like culture does, neon made a comeback in the 80s as part of the overall &quot;upbeat&quot; move away from the gritty darkness of the 70s. Teen movies especially featured characters wearing bright neon colors, as did a lot of the bright pop videos of the day, and MTV took the trend and ran with it in all of their programming as well. </p>
<p>I'm sure it'll cycle again and there will be a point sometime in the next 20 or so years that variations of neon and crazy patterns will once again be in fashion and someone will ask &quot;where did all this neon come from&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As for popular use, it's gotta be due to a combo of the ability to produce dyes, and to market them as a hip new thing in fashion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
