<p>These tubes are connected to an extracorporeal circulation machine that does many things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Circulate the blood as a mechanical pump would. It's &quot;smooth&quot; though, there is no pumping like a heart.</li>
<li>Oxygenate the blood via a membrane that allows gas to pass through. Recent technologies are pretty efficient.</li>
<li>Keep it at the required temperature</li>
</ul>
<p>The patient is also administered anticoagulant medication (usually heparin) to prevent any blood clot from forming in the machine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

First floor near the door of the Lillehei heart institute and cancer center there is a whole small room that has the first working prototype of the machine that does this on exhibit. The first heart bypass machine was tried in Minnesota by Dr. Lillehei. Now far smaller, but it really gives a great conceptual picture to see all the necessary pieces when they were huge and took up most of a small room.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The book “King of Hearts” by G. Wayne Miller is an awesome read about the pioneers of open heart surgery and the development of the heart lung bypass machine. Fun fact - did you know that they did an open-heart surgery using another person as the bypass machine?? </p>
<p>The guy who developed the bypass machine, Earl Bakken, is the founder of Medtronic, a major medical device company. It is such an amazing story, both his and the surgeon who pioneered the techniques. The Wild West of medicine!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Am a perfusionist:</p>
<p>Like plumbing. Blood flows in one direction. Where we divert it to.</p>
<p>Cannulae are inserted in the right side of the heart (venous system: blue blood). Which drains via gravity to a reservoir/holding tank. It will fill with the same amount of blood that normally is in heart/lungs. Little grandma- small volume. Big guy-lots of blood</p>
<p>We pump it via a cone that spins on a magnet. Faster spinning -&gt; more blood flow. It is constant (laminar) flow. Not pulsatile. Similar to garden hose. </p>
<p>Goes though a heat exchanger to cool blood. Cold blood -&gt; cold patient -&gt; less oxygen demand -&gt; safer for patient.</p>
<p>Goes through oxygenator. Which is full of tiny tiny tiny &quot;straws&quot; with micro-holes. Individual oxygen and CO2 molecules cross over into and out of the blood  (like breathing).</p>
<p>Now red/oxygenated blood.</p>
<p>Pump into a cannula that is sewn into the aorta (big artery coming out of heart).</p>
<p>Now can cut out heart and replace it. Or cut it open to repair it. Or add the VAD to keep people alive until heart transplant becomes available. </p>
<p>Lots of details to add. But essentiallly:</p>
<p>Blue blood drains out before heart. Gets pumped at a certain flow (individualized for each patient size).  Oxygen/CO2 exchanged. Red blood pumped in right after heart. </p>
<p>Continuously until surgery finished.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a cardiovascular perfusionist and this is literally my job. So as others have said before, the surgeon places cannulas in the IVC (inferior vena cava) and SVC (superior vena cava) which empties the blood going into the heart into a reservoir. The blood then gets pumped forward with either a centrifugal pump which creates a negative pressure in the inlet by spinning and drives it forward with a positive pressure or a roller pump that displaces the fluid (blood) forward. The blood then goes into an oxygenator, which you can think of as a synthetic lung. This device removes CO2 and oxygenates the blood. There is then a length of tubing that is connected to a cannula that is placed in the ascending aorta. The blood flows into the aorta and perfuses the body. This process is not called ECMO as I have seen someone say in the comments, but cardiopulmonary bypass. There is a difference.</p>
<p>After initiating cardiopulmonary bypass the surgeon will place a clamp on the aorta between the heart and the cannula in the ascending aorta. A needle is placed in the aorta between the heart and the clamp and connected to another pump that delivers a solution called cardioplegia that is typically mixed with arterialized blood from the oxygenator. This solution contains potassium, which arrests the heart (makes it stop beating) by increasing the action potential of the heart muscle. Immediately after the clamp is placed, the perfusionist delivers this solution at a pressure which forces the aortic valve closed and the solution has nowhere to go except into the coronary arteries that supply the heart with blood. </p>
<p>Once the heart is arrested, the surgeon with make incisions at the aorta, SVC and IVC,  and the pulmonary artery. At this point we usually have to wait until the donor heart arrives and the surgeon goes to the restroom or gets coffee or something. The heart gets there, the vessels are reattached, and the new heart is reperfused after the cross clamp is taken off. After a period of time we wean the patient from cardiopulmonary bypass, close the chest, and move to the ICU. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
