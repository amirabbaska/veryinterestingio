		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I've been reading some stuff out of idle curiosity but it appears that caloric restriction in mice decreases the rate of aging as well as apparently extending life span. One would imagine that fasting like that would be bad for you, and apparently in people, prolonged restriction in men and premenopausal women over 21 it causes loss of muscle mass, strength and reduced bone mineral density and even has a higher rate of mortality in older middle aged and the elderly, as one would expect; but can still make you live longer and look younger???</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think that you may need to relook at the science.  Prolong fasting does not cause appreciable loss of muscle mass, strength or bone density.  Check out <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413115002247" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413115002247</a> for scientific studies.  These studies conclude that fasting is associated with increased regenerative markets, along with a decrease in risk factors such as diabetes, CVD, cancer and aging.  The research above also highlights and increase in stemcell production and nero pathways.  In fact, the use of Intermittent Fasting has become all the rage among atheletes in order to cut wait but increase performance.  I can give you a ton of links but it would be better to just Google it.</p>
<p>The theory behind the benefits of fasting are that lack of food slows down cell division in parts of the body but stimulates the growth in others while preserving as much muscle mass as possible.  From an evolutionary perspective this makes sense.  For most of our existence we have been hunter-gathers and would eat when we had food.  We did not farm until relatively recently.  Thus, our bodies developed not knowing when it would have it’s next meal.  Had our bodies not been adapted to fasting for extended periods then we would have gone extinct long ago.  </p>
<p>When our ancestors fasted it was because they had no food to eat – it was not a choice.  No food put is in survival mode and the body responded.  In order to survive that body would conserve any energy it could (stop splitting cells where it could), preserve muscle mass so that we could chase prey, increase cognitive function so we could think clearer, and start utilizing stored fat for energy.  All of these things contribute to a longer life and decrease signs of aging.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am pretty sure you need to separate fasting from calorie restriction when looking at the science, they are slightly different.</p>
<p>The benefits of calorie restriction seem to play off of protein metabolism, growth factors, testosterone, and other hormone responses, but researchers haven't nailed anything down.  From what I have read you have to be EXTREME in calorie restriction, to the point that it is difficult for most humans to maintain voluntarily, for the numbers to come out in your favor.  Haven't read much about looking younger...although ageing and our biological processes are essentially oxidation, (?) so if you stop fueling the body the biological process slows and there is less cell death/turnover, but that is only a huge speculation on my part.</p>
<p>from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3569090/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3569090/</a>   (this study looks at humans)
&quot;The mechanisms by which CR slows aging and protects against age-associated diseases are not known yet. Many interrelated and overlapping metabolic factors have been proposed to play a role, including a reduction in growth factors (e.g. insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)), anabolic hormones (e.g. insulin and testosterone), and circulating inflammatory cytokines (Fontana &amp; Klein, 2007). Calorie restriction and reduced growth factor signalling both elevate resistance to oxidative stress, reduce cellular damage, and increase lifespan in experimental animals (Mair &amp; Dillin, 2008; Russell &amp; Kahn, 2007).&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure its an evolutionary development.  Like those flies that come out of hiding in January.  Where did they come from when the life of a house fly is 28 days and they are so huge they can hardly fly.  Caloric restriction indicates drought or some type of scarcity of resource which would prevent reproduction, so they live longer.  When otherwise dieing would be more practical, to make room for the next generation, one step ahead in evolutionary development.  Also, living without big macs isn't really living, so reaper stops his tally. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most credible theory I've read has to do with inflammation. Basically, if you eat extra food, you're making extra work for your body. You bring in outside chemicals and pathogens on that food that your body has to process, when you don't even need the energy, so it's a net negative for your body. Inflammation taxes your body, causing aging.</p>
<p>You can be unhealthy and live a while, just as an obese man can starve to death. Health and age aren't necessarily linked 1:1. Constant lack of food isn't good for you, but it also means there's not a lot of cellular division going on which means you age less, to oversimplify extremely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One is that all food causes oxidative stress which ages you. Basically the process of the food being broken down into energy releases free radicals which cause damage. So basically every meal you eat is aging you a tiny bit. Less food means less aging. The other is cellular autophagy. When your body is short on food, it begins eating itself. It starts by breaking down damaged and malfunctioning cells and recycling them. This leads to having more of the healthy, younger cells running the show.</p>
<p>Tangentially some foods are less oxidative then others and you can trigger autophagy through fasting. So it may be possible to mimic some of the caloric restriction benefits, by eating properly and fasting from time to time while still eating enough calories overall to generally maintain muscle tone and energy levels. So you get to keep a decent quality of life and still maybe add a bit on the back end.</p>
<p>Edit: Just wanted to add, that though you seemed to use caloric restriction and fasting interchangeably, they are not the same. Generally speaking consistent caloric restriction will cause the body to lower your  lean body mass in order to adapt to having fewer available calories. Fasting by contrast seems to preserve muscle at first. A fast of even a few days does not cause a noticeable decrease in lean body mass, most the energy will come from stored fat. It's as though evolutionarily, your body thinks it needs that muscle in order to get more food or else it will starve. Whereas the guy who is getting just slightly fewer calories everyday for months on ends up adapting to the new normal by loosing muscle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
