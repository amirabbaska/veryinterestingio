		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When in your pocket the headphones are jumbled into a variety of states. If the current state does not result in a knot, then it is untangled next jumble. If it <em>does</em> however form a knot, it will not untangle next jumble. So over time you end up 'breeding' a completely knotted headphone cable. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They would still tangle. If both you and the cord were <em>perfectly</em> still, no knot would form as there is no motion. However, once moved, the cords  will continue spinning around themselves for however long they have energy.</p>
<p>In fact, I'd imagine they may knot <em>worse</em> in space, as they'll never really come to rest on the ground or in a pocket.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Way less so, but for entirely different reasons.</p>
<p>Movements of your body - shaking, walking, other things moving around, your body rubbing against the pocket - that's what bunches up your headphone cables. Not gravity.</p>
<p>In space, you need very little force to move around. A light gesture sends you &quot;flying&quot; in desired direction. If you move too hard, you'll keep crashing, spinning, hurting yourself.</p>
<p>As result, you stress the headphones much less - less movement means less tangling.</p>
<p>Of course that is not the case during the obligatory exercises in the special &quot;gym equipment&quot;. In that case, better put the music on, because your headphones would tangle just about as badly - or just &quot;crawl&quot; out of your pocket and fly away...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think people are over complicating this. I think we could expect little to no knots, as least under the model I'm picturing:
You place headphones, untangled, into a small box. You, sitting in your shuttle, push the box forward. </p>
<p>So, in a shuttle we lack any gravity constant that's more than negligible,  so the headphones are essentially weightless. Neglecting air resistance (as it is only acting on the box, not the inside) we essentially have headphones moving at a constant velocity in a direction with no forces acting on them. Every part of the headphone is moving forward at the same speed, so there's nothing to cause the friction of the headphones to act on itself to cause any folding. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
