		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, capillary action! Just as trees &quot;pull&quot; water from the ground (assisted by the evaporation at the leaves) and paper towels absorb spills. Water and other liquids like to stick together and &quot;climb&quot; narrow gaps, like those between paper towel fibers and hairs. In a slightly related vein, you can increase the liquid carrying capacity of a paper towel by tightly folding it over on itself, allowing more liquid to be trapped between the folded portions of the sheet as well as between fibers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Cosmetologist who just finished studying this for over a year. </p>
<p>You have an outlayer on the hair called the Cuticle that protects the cortex. The cuticle can swell and close with water, heat, and other chemicals. Cuticle swelling is actually what allows hair to lose Eumelanin (color) and a similar process allows for hair to also have hair color deposited in it as the cuticle swells open and the color deposits. It closes and retains that pigment, but much like a pine cone this is not &quot;air tight&quot; and pigment will fall out of the cuticle over time. That's why hair color dulls and fades, even permanent color. </p>
<p>Water can be retained in the cuticle, but there are a lot of things at play here. Coarser hair has a larger cortex which is much like a sponge that can absorb water. Also, the cuticles are larger and hold more water. Think of these like flower petals...some small, but on course hair very large.  Other factors come into play like the current PH of the hair, weather it's condition is dry or not, this is exacerbated by previous lightening and coloring services. </p>
<p>Long story short, there are a lot of reasons hair will or will not hold water well, but the number one is course hair (Hair thickness) and hair density (Measured by how many hairs are found in a square inch).Denser heads see less light and air so they take the longest to dry. </p>
<p>There are tests we do in salon involving porosity prior to chemical services that can give some insights into what you are up against, but at the end of the day it is genetics, hair health, and previous exposure to heat, coloring, and the elements. </p>
<p>I have some clients I can dry in 6 minutes and others that will take 20. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all hair does this! Some people have porous hair, and others have non-porous. To all those out there curious about which kind you have, fill a glass with water and put a couple strands of your hair in there. If it's floating after about 10 minutes, it's non-porous. If it's sunk, it's porous!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plus when youâ€™re sleeping your hair is not being subjected to as much passing air to evaporate the water. If you shower in the morning, just walking around as you go about your business puts a pretty steady air current (albeit a slow one) through your hair. You may notice the front pieces around your face dry faster than the back during the day for this reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
