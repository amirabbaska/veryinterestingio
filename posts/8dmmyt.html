		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading somewhere that having the ability to tell where other humans were looking was a proposed reason as to why our sclera were white, while our iris and pupils were colored. It allowed us to follow the gaze of our companions and look in the same direction without speaking or moving to point. Comes in handy when you're hunting something and trying to be extra sneaky. Hard to do when your entire eye is the same color. I could be completely wrong, but it's a plausible theory I heard!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: We evolved the white in our eyes because of our early hunting partnership with wolves/dogs.</p>
<p>The &quot;sclera&quot; or white part of the eye is not normally white in other primates like chimpanzees.  However there is a rare mutation which causes the sclera to be white in primates.  And this rare mutation has evolved to become a dominant trait in humans but not in other primates.  And just as with other evolutionary traits, this means that having a white sclera conferred some sort of evolutionary benefit to our ancestors that was not seen in other primates.</p>
<p>It was recently discovered that humans domesticated wolves into dogs far earlier than previously thought.  Scientists used to believe that wolves became domesticated around the time that humans first began living in permanent settlements.  They believed that wolves came to scavenge our garbage and that we ended up turning them into pets.  However evidence of domesticated dogs was discovered which put the date of their partnership with us long before humans ever had permanent settlements way back to our hunter-gatherer days.</p>
<p>So scientists now theorize that the domestication of wolves into dogs came about through a hunting partnership.  Essentially humans and wolves hunting together was far more effective than either was at hunting alone.</p>
<p>And one important parts of the hunting partnership between humans and dogs is their ability to follow our &quot;direction of gaze&quot;.  This is an incredibly rare ability which allows dogs to be able to tell the actual direction you are looking, not just the direction that your head is turned.  But dogs are only able to follow the human direction of gaze because our scleras are white.  If they were black like other primates, dogs would only be able to tell the direction our head was pointing, not what we were actually looking at.</p>
<p>So it is theorized that at the same time we were domesticating wolves into dogs, guiding their evolution, that in a way they were doing the same thing to us.  Our human ancestors with the random mutation for a white sclera made the best hunting partners because they could more effectively communicate to the wolves during the hunt.  And that gave them an evolutionary edge which eventually turned this useful random mutation into a dominant trait for our species</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eyes are really cool and one of the best examples of convergent evolution out there. Beginning with photosensitive spots in only a few ancestors, the eye and all of its components (concavity, iris, pupil, lens, etc) have evolved independently dozens of times in the animal kingdom, with the most popular estimation being between 40 and 65 times</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
