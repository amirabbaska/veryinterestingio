		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we're only losing and regrowing the outermost layer of skin, and near UV radiation can penetrate to the innermost layer of skin where cells are alive and well and furiously producing more skin to keep up with the loss. </p>
<p>If a single UV photon hit one of these cells in the wrong spot as it's preparing to split (which is how more cells are produced), this can cause it to start misbehaving, and be the start of cancer. </p>
<p>If this cell is not a regular skin cell but a pigmentation cell, it's even worse since those are able to metastasize even without unintended mutation. Now you have cancer that can spread throughout your body. </p>
<p>Edit: just to clarify, the UV photon has to hit <em>exactly</em> the right spot at <em>exactly</em> the right time to cause cancer. The risk of any one photon doing so is extremely small, but the number of photons in sunlight is extremely large which is why it happens sometimes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a long way from being expert, but... As I understand it, rapidly reproducing cells are more likely to undergo genetic damage.  It's like using a copy machine to make a copy of a copy of a copy... rather than copies of the original page.  Each copy picks up some defects that add to the defects already made.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The new skin cells are made by the old skin cells. The instruction to make new skin cells is usually what gets damaged. These broken instructions leads to making damaged cells. Your body will usually try and kill cells with damaged instructions before they make other damaged cells but it doesnâ€™t always happen. If these damaged cells keep making other damaged cells with damaged instructions for making cells then you could get cancer depending on how damaged the instructions for making new cells are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't really &quot;re-grow&quot; skin cells; as with all human cell reproduction, the existing cells divide.
UV light (or UV radiation if you prefer) is able to penetrate the top layers of skin, and when it does, this can damage the DNA in those cells. When those cells divide, the damaged DNA is copied into the new cell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
