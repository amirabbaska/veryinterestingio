<p>First kind of things do Google, Facebook, Reddit track and collect?  Is it on a per IP address basis, name basis?</p>
<p>Next, what does the data that look like when Facebook for example sells it to a third party? What kind of information is is available through Google Analytics?  Google doesn't sell its own data right, it just uses it to place ads for others right?</p>
<p>And then third parties who do research and analysis of this data, where do they obtain this data from and how do they analyze it and what can this data look like when it gets sold to their clients?</p>
<p>And how does one obtain such data freely and/or from these third parties?</p></div></div>

Your data (cookie or otherwise) is stored and parsed into segments (male, twenties, white) which are used by ad campaign managers to appropriately target you based off of needs and wants for each ad campaign. Campaigns have a target sheet which tells each campaign manager (or computer, now) which segments to associate with that campaign. Your data is sold to numerous vendors, and in the case of ads, typically to an RTB backend who can do something with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

These are various IDs that identify you and the things you're interested in along with other information passed in on URL headers or by data collection code on the page.</p>
<p>For example, here's a really long string made to Adobe Analytics (yes, they do a lot more than Photoshop or Illustrator). You can see any of these calls with built in tools in your browser that track all the calls it makes as a page loads. This isn't secret sauce stuff.</p>
<p>This shows a call from Autotrader to Adobe Analytics. There's an ID in here that identifies the user, data in passed in as key-value pairs, other data associated with the page load and calls made from the page.</p>

<p>You can monitor these calls from the browser itself. For example, right click on a Chrome page and select Inspect. Reload the page and watch all the network calls. Or, click on Application to see all the cookies that a page loads. You'll see the data is mostly strings of numbers.</p>
<p>Google's Doubleclick code does this too. For example, here's an ID value captured from the doubleclick.net cookie: 22c3c72ab3250030</p>
<p>For most of us, this looks like gibberish. For advertisers, it's how they identify visitors and associate interests to that visitor.  There's nothing really that top secret about it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Working in AdTech for 4 years for various big Digital Marketing clients.</p>
<p>You can't buy most data from the bigger companies like Google and Facebook. You can use the tracking mechanisms (Google Analytics Tracking, Facebook Pixel, Conversion tracking etc) to track visitors based on Sessions mostly stored in Cookies.</p>
<p>It's stored in FB/Google's backends and if you don't have your own DMP (Data Management Platform) with your own 1st party data, then you can't buy/sell that much. You just use their FB/Google tools to build targeted audiences to better target the appropriate ads in their Ad Networks.</p>
<p>You can use their tools or their API to query your questions against the data you collected using their Analytics solutions and you could integrate some custom data sending into your own backend (CRM, shop system etc).</p>
<p>It's actually stored in their databases and they limit the granulairty of what you can get out of their APIs throuh quotas and limitations. What you get out mostly, are simple lists of &quot;show me the average shopping cart amount in USD per marketing channel&quot;, then you'll get a list that tells you:</p>
<ul>
<li>AdWords Campaign 1, 66$</li>
<li>AdWords Campaign 2, 74$</li>
<li>Facebook Campaign 1, 120$</li>
</ul>
<p>Marketers then make assumptions based on the data they get out of analytics tools. </p>
<p>For companies as big as LinkedIn, Google, Facebook you can basically be sure, that they're not selling any data. Their business model is to create the best possible tracking solution to get the most accurate data and then use that to sell you (the advertiser) the possibility to target your Ads as good as possible. So if the advertisers get better targeting, they can do better advertising, which leads to more revenue per invested advertising budget. This, in theory optimizes the budgets, and the advertisers will spend more. It's a win win: advertiser is happy to spend more, but also gets more revenue, the users get better ads that are in theory useful to their intend and the networks get more money.</p>
<p>Bigger clients (companies) usually use a marketing cloud like Adobe Marketing Cloud, Oracle Marketing Cloud, IBM Marketing Cloud or Google Analytics 360, which costs around 130+k $ per year. It allows you to actually own the data in your own DMP which is called 1st party data.</p>
<p>With a DMP you can do cool things, like sell your 1st party data (non-identifiable data, so it's not your name, it's just your cookie) in the marketplace to others. You can also buy other 1st party data from that marketplace. It's used to improve audience building and improve the targeting. Better targeting - better ads - more revenue.</p>
<p>Furthermore the analytics data is also used to optimize automated campaign optimization through automated bidding or machine learning supported bidding. Why bidding? Because in many networks you need to bid a price to show an ad to a user in real time, and the ad-network's algorithms will decide automatically which bid wins and finally which advertisers ad will be shown. The algorithms are mostly optimized to not show just the highest bid, but also the most fitting ad (best targeted ad). Those Real Time Bidding (RTB) platforms need data to show ads to their visitors as well.</p>
<p>Now there's a maret for less famous and less ethical networks. They're happy to sell anything they collect: email addresses with more dimensions like: for what site you used it to register, what interests therefore you might have, your age etc. Email marketing from those shady networks and vendors selling data is basically what then leads to spam.</p>
<p>Buying/selling names, physical addresses and other PII (personal identifiable information) is is shady business but still done on a large scale. But it's not the business model of the big networks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is an example from a database leak from GeekedIn in 2016, Troy Hunt has an <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/8-million-github-profiles-were-leaked-from-geekedins-mongodb-heres-how-to-see-yours/" target="_blank">example on his blog</a>. This specific data is not from Facebook, but you will get the idea.</p>
<p>You can see it is an aggregation of information from different sources. The more reliable sources such a record contains, the more valuable it is, because it allows for more precise marketing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
