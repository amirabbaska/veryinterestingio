		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, the body is a delicate and finely-tuned machine that has hundreds of complex things kept in balance. Through nerve signals to the brain and especially <strong>hormones</strong> - <em>a series of signalling molecules released into the bloodstream to tell a particular set of cells to do something specific</em>.</p>
<p>Pregnancy takes that complex system and dashes it against a wall. Then sets the pieces on fire whilst laughing at the mother's misfortune with that terrifying baby cackle for daring to put a bun in the oven.</p>
<p>For suddenly that organism has to deal with <em>another</em> one parasitically living inside it, draining its resources, developing its own set of systems and completely throwing everything off balance. Sleep will be sporadic. Moods will swing wildly between profound sadness and unbridled rage. Unexpected dietary weirdness will start appearing, such as pregnant women craving things with absolutely no nutritional value (such as chalk). </p>
<p>But there's no method to it. They're not <em>seeking</em> some nutrition their body desperately needs. The organism isn't suddenly being more careful to avoid things that could make them sick. After all, if that were the case why wouldn't our bodies do that all the time?</p>
<p>Plus we're very capable omnivores that can draw nutrients from a very wide range of sources, it's fine. It's one of the reasons for our success - we eat everything.</p>
<p>It is simply that a tiny person has reached up from the uterus and grabbed the hormonal steering wheel. This finely-tuned and delicate system is going through the most brutal transformation it has ever had to deal with, and is struggling to adapt.</p>
<p>As for the <em>why</em>. Well it makes no evolutionary difference to the pregnant mother. Overly weird pregnancy behavior didn't select those mothers out of the food-chain. Since we're social-animals that band together and protect said females from predators.</p>
<p>If two-hundred-thousand years ago Ung the pregnant cavewoman decides to start shoveling handfuls of clay into her mouth, then she'd get some weird looks from her tribemates. But it's certainly not going to kill her.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotal but I never craved anything out of the ordinary. I <em>did</em> tend to indulge my whims more while pregnant. Like I want a cinnamon raisin bagel with tons of cream cheese right now but I'm not going to get one, but when I was pregnant?? I definitely had a treat yoself mentality. I believe there's an element of that for a lot of women.  And honestly I think that makes sense too, as a subconscious need to take care of yourself during a physically sensitive time, as well as before a time that will require great selflessness. Most aversions outside of extreme cases seem to come from straight up nausea. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't quite work like that for everyone. I haven't had any weird cravings - fried junk food in the first trimester, and cake in the third. I think I just really wanted salt and fat and now I want sugar and fat. I can't eat spicy food anymore because of the acid-reflux. Other than that, no change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Some of it's chapters specfically deal with hormonal changes during pregnancies and how they influence taste (or more accurately how they mess with taste and disgust). I found it super interesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
