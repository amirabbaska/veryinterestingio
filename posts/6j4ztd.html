<p>1) Becoming a bank isn't easy.</p>
<p>2) Being a bank is very profitable.</p>
<p>3) Cheating and just assigning yourself a bunch of money isn't worth risking getting caught (from the bank's perspective).  An employee might want to, but they would have to get past the bank's security and audits to get away with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If by electronic money you mean cryptocurrencies I will try to answer. The Bitcoin paper solves an important problem in computer science called &quot;the Byzantine generals problem&quot;, which aims to achieve trust and consensus among two or more parties by using untrustworthy communication channels.</p>
<p>It does so by using cryptography and economic incentives.</p>
<p>In this matter a crypto currency wallet is nothing more than a private key. You can look at it as a password, a very long and complex password. The one who owns this password owns the funds.</p>
<p>Mathematically this key can't be faked. You either have it or not. Someone can steal it of course but not fake it.</p>
<p>However private keys are randomly generated and there is a very small chance that you could generate a key for an existing wallet. This is called a collision. This is the closest to faked.</p>
<p>For instance you could bump into a collision for Satoshi's wallet and become and instant billionaire. Or you could win the lottery 10 times in a row. I guess chances are the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They could, but it would be really hard and in some ways, easier to catch than counterfeiting physical money. </p>
<p>Electronic funds are exchanged by institutions acting as proxies for individuals. If I pay my friend with PayPal, neither he nor I deal with the strings of code that mean &quot;take $100 from this account and give it to this account&quot;. If I hand him a $100 bill, he accepts &amp; validates it himself. So if you're going to fake electronic funds, for practical purposes you have to do it inside of an institution. Aside from Bitcoin and similar, which have their own securities others discussed, we don't have a way to exchange electronic funds without proxies (institutions). </p>
<p>Institutions are in the business of keeping money secure, so they have security, audits, etc. to make sure money doesn't magically appear or disappear. So even if you could hack into your bank's software and add some zeros to your account, you couldn't create a legitimate origin that would pass an audit. If you say it's a cash deposit, where's the cash? Receipts from a business, where are the credit card records for those purchases?</p>
<p>It's probably easier to steal electronic funds than cash (at least big numbers) but it's probably easier to forge cash than electronic funds. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not money. It's a tradable financial instrument. </p>
<p>Money in this day and age is made in to money by legal Fiat. Basically we have a whole load of laws about which specific objects (notes and coins) and which values on bank ledgers count as money. A really important feature of money is that you are required to settle your taxes in whatever is the local,legally backed currency.  For as long as you can not pay your taxes in bitcoin then it simply isn't money.  you're always in the position of having to convert it in to some local currency to leverage its value. </p>
<p>Which brings us to what is money? Money fulfills 3 main roles in an economy. 1. It is the primary means of exchange, meaning you can use it universally to purchase things. This works because by and large businesses are legally required to accept the local currency as payment. And because businesses want money because they need it to settle their taxes (see above).  Electronic &quot;monies&quot; simply aren't fungible for all goods across the economy and neither do they have the legal backing that would make that possible. 2. Money is a means of storing value, meaning you can save some for later and make use of it at a later date. This is the one thing electronic monies share with real money.  Trading e-monies wouldn't make any sense if you couldn't access their value at some later date. 3. Money is typically the principle unit if account. That is, businesses and governments can and do use it as a universal unit of measurement (GDP expressed in $ or Â£, companies profits are measured in x many $). Last time I checked no one is doing their accounts in terms of bitcoin, in part because it is much too volatile but mainly because everyone else is using an agreed unit of account, and usually businesses are required to file their accounts in terms of the local unit of account, and that isn't bitcoin.</p>
<p>Which is not to say true electronic currencies aren't coming and I believe Singapore have been looking to back their currency with block chain technology  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others already answered most of this but I wanted to share how I have understood it (so kinda an answer and a question at the same time). Everyone feel free to correct me if I am wrong. </p>
<p>Digital money (as in normal bank account money, not cryptocurrencies) exists inside an institution such as a bank. A bank can and does &quot;forge&quot; new money all the time. They are limited by some laws but basically when you take a loan they just write a line on your account. And that money just appears out of nowhere. </p>
<p>The thing is as long as that &quot;money&quot; stays inside the bank it is only lines in their balance books. You taking a loan and paying it back is just them moving numbers around in those books. As long as it stays in those books. However if you want to take the money out of the bank you suddenly need actual money that is accepted by another bank. This is why banks fall in economic crisis situations. There is a lot of virtual money but not that much actual money and then people suddenly want to take a lot of actual money out of the bank and they cannot pay up. The system in general relies on the banks having access to enough of real money to always be able to pay. </p>
<p>It is not really just banks who can do this. You can easily create money yourself. Just write a line in the book that says you have money. Now as long as that money does not need to leave your imaginary wallet you can think you have it. If your friends agree to use the same book you can move the money from one to another there. It just does not do any good if you cannot also make the local grocery store accept it. The bank can because they promise in any moment pay it in real money. </p>
<p>Btw &quot;real money&quot; here does not only mean physical money but rather the digital money in the accounts the banks have in the central bank. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
