		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, the Rosetta Stone played a huge role in deciphering hieroglyphics since it included translations in languages we already knew. But how could it be deciphered if we didn't have that kind of cheat sheet? </p>
<p>A fascinating example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B" target="_blank">Linear B</a>, a pre-Ancient Greek language discovered on stone tablets on the island of Crete. It was long assumed that it would be completely indecipherable without some sort of &quot;Rosetta stone&quot;, but we cracked the code in 1952, thanks to decades of study by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22782620" target="_blank">Alice Kober and Michael Ventris</a>.</p>
<p>The first breakthrough came after Kober diligently recorded the frequency and position of each symbol on the tablets (While this type of analysis is not hard to do with computers today, this took <em>years</em> of work for Kober). In doing so, she discovered many instances of the same groups of symbols, but with consistently different endings. Through this, she realized that Linear B was an inflected language with different endings based on usage, like verb endings in Latin and Spanish. </p>
<p>She also noted that there were about 200 unique symbols in total. Being an expert of many languages, she knew that this was too many characters to be alphabetic (each symbol representing a letter - English, for example), and too few to be logographic (each symbol representing a word, like Chinese). She surmised that each symbol in Linear B likely represented a syllable. </p>
<p>Now we have a clear understanding of what <em>type</em> of language Linear B was, but how do we determine what any of it means? This is where Ventris stepped up. </p>
<p>He theorized that these tablets likely had location names, and knew that location names often stayed similar over long periods of time. So he basically did <del>brute force</del> trial-and-error using the ancient Greek names for towns in Crete: What if a particular group of symbols are syllables that mean something like, &quot;ko-no-so&quot;, meaning the Cretian city of Knossos? After exploring this idea in countless ways, he eventually discovered a pattern that confirmed this: When he interpreted one particular set of symbols as &quot;ko-no-so&quot;, other symbols began to make sense. Slowly but surely, that first bit of translation led to him fully deciphering the entire language. </p>
<p>EDIT: As /u/QuarkMawp pointed out, brute force was not the correct term.</p>
<p>And since this has gotten some traction, if anybody is more interested in this and other sorts of amazing cryptography achievements throughout history, I highly recommend <a href="https://simonsingh.net/books/the-code-book/" target="_blank">The Code Book</a> by Simon Singh. It covers a broad history of immense achievements in cryptography including Linear B, along with things like development of new codes in Renaissance Europe, cracking the Enigma Machine code in World War II, Navajo Wind Talkers and modern Public-Key Encryption. It's very informative and engaging, and also very accessible for the layperson. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said the Rosetta Stone was vital in beginning understanding. Beyond that we know because it keeps making sense. So as an example.</p>
<p>Why did the ¥ cross the road?</p>
<p>The ¥ we ate last night was good.</p>
<p>We had fried ¥.</p>
<p>The ¥s ran out of the coop.</p>
<p>The ¥ feathers were beige.</p>
<p>We can start narrowing in on what ¥ is because there are only certain things that can be filled in and make sense. In this case birds are really the only thing that work, in particular I started with chicken.</p>
<p>Sometimes we don't have an absolute answer but a close enough answer that can be used. As we see the symbols more we have more knowledge about what the symbol means.</p>
<p>It is actually the same way you learn new words, the context eventually reveals the information, and as you hear the word more often you can fix any mistakes you've made in the meaning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have talked about how we have decided what means what in hieroglyphs, but that doesn't actually mean we know for sure that our translations are correct.  </p>
<p>I'm going to give an example that I leaned about when I took a class on reading hieroglyphs in college; unfortunately, the details have faded a little.   </p>
<p>Back in the 50s or 60s, egyptologists thought they had the translations down. Then, one discovered a pattern in verbs that indicated a whole tense no one had noticed before. This tense looked very much like present tense, but was subtly different. They had to go back and re translate practically every thing. The fundamental meanings didn't change a whole lot, but the subtleties did. I think this new tense is called &quot;second tense&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides inferring from translations, there is also some help in errors that have been made by the people who wrote in hieroglyphs. Because when you make an error with language, it's not random but rather reflects the system of the language. So if you find a phrase that is repeated in many places, but in one place there's a mistake in it, you can look how it differs and thus get a better idea about the phrase. It's a bit hard to imagine, but one example is Latin pronunciation - a writer might confuse I with E because the sounds are pretty close, but he won't ever confuse I with X because they're very far apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

As the decree has only minor differences between the three versions, the Rosetta Stone proved to be the key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs.</p>
