		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order for venom to be dangerous, it must enter the bloodstream.  Many venomous toxins specifically target red blood cells themselves and break down those cells which results in organs being unable to receive oxygen.  This leads to inflammation and necrosis of the cell tissues.  Organ failure then leads to death.  (Not all venom works this way.  Sometimes venom attacks the nervous system instead.)</p>
<p>When consuming anything, animals have several defense mechanisms in the digestive system.  The first defense is the mouth itself.  If the lips start burning, the animal might not swallow.  Then, the taste buds help the predator know whether this should be swallowed if it tastes bad.  Next, the saliva in the mouth and chewing action helps break down molecules and foods into smaller pieces.  Saliva is also full of white blood cells (leukocytes) that attack harmful items (such as bacteria) that might enter your mouth.</p>
<p>After the mouth, the item enters the stomach.  The acids, heat, and enzymes in the stomach are capable of denaturing proteins.  For proper protein function, the proteins must consist of specific shapes.  By denaturing potentially harmful proteins, they are rendered harmless in many cases.  They are also broken apart.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_acid" target="_blank">Gastric acid</a> in the stomach is normally between 1.5 and 3.5 PH.  (Stomach acid can be incredibly acidic!)  So, if it reaches this point, the venom is most likely going to be broken down in the stomach.</p>
<p>However, if the venom happens to make it to the digestive tract intact, then it could potentially leech into your system.  But, if it is possible for such a substance to reach this point, it is not actually a venom.  It is a poison!</p>
<p>To explain further, for an animal to be venomous, it must inject its venom by way of a sting or bite.  For an animal to be poisonous, however, it does not inject the toxins in the same manner.  Instead, you are harmed by swallowing the poison.  So, if a snake was commonly eaten and it resulted in people dying, the snake would be considered poisonous not venomous for this reason.  If this same snake could also harm people by biting them and injecting venom, the snake would then be poisonous and venomous!  Most snakes are simply venomous.  That is, consuming their venom is usually harmless.  It is not recommended that you do so, though, since it could potentially be toxic if it passes all of the digestive defenses, and no matter what you consume, if you consume enough of it, it will kill you.  The dose makes the poison.</p>
<p>&quot;All things are poison, and nothing is without poison, the dosage alone makes it so a thing is not a poison.&quot; -- Paracelsus</p>
<p>Edit: Clarification that saliva itself does not break down the proteins.  That starts in the stomach.</p>
<p>Note: Bloodstream is a simplified term and circulatory system would probably be a better term to use.  Venom initially enters a different system designed to transport white blood cells and remove toxins from the body (lymphatic system).  For some venom, the molecules are too large to enter the bloodstream itself.  Comments from /u/KingKongBrandy and /u/Maj3sticCr0w led me to make this note.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the venom doesn't get stabbed into the bloodstream, then it will seem like nothing happened, and the predator will be OK.  But what really happens is pretty neat.</p>
<p>Putting something in your mouth and then swallowing it is ALWAYS safer than poking it into your bloodstream.  </p>
<p>Just like humans, many predators have a whole line of &quot;digesters&quot; that can make things safer to eat.  First, there is spit - chewing and mixing with spit is important for digestion because it helps make big chunks smaller, it helps smaller chunks slide down into the stomach, and the spit helps some things start to dissolve.  If you are chewing a venomous animal, there is a good chance that the chewing will burst the tissues where the venom is stored - that makes it less likely that the fangs or stingers can actually inject the venom.</p>
<p>Once the venomous parts get into the stomach, the acids within the stomach are often strong enough to &quot;de-nature&quot; many venom proteins.  &quot;De-nature&quot; basically means it changes shape to that it doesn't react the same way that it would have.  Then other enzymes begin to break everything down into even smaller chemical bits.  Those small chemical bits are mostly turned into new proteins that you need to rebuild your own cells, or energy that helps you move.</p>
<p>So eating venomous animals is not a super idea, because there are some risks of the venom getting through your skin (or digestive tract lining) but the venom itself is usually not dangerous to digest.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you inject beef stew into your bloodstream, you could get very sick.</p>
<p>EDIT:  I'm forced to amend my dangerous comments, as follows -
1) Putting something in your mouth and then swallowing it is  ALMOST ALWAYS safer than poking it into your bloodstream.  If a doctor tells you otherwise, listen to your doctor.
2) Don't eat sacks of venom and don't inject things into yourself.  EVER.  If a doctor tells you otherwise, listen to your doctor.
3) Putting things in your butt is not quite the same as eating.  But it is ALMOST ALWAYS safer to put something in your butt than it is to inject it.  If a doctor tells you otherwise, listen to your doctor.
4) If you aren't sure whether to eat something, put it in your butt, or inject it, move on to something you are more familiar with.
5) I'm really surprised there weren't many responses talking about scorpions.  They are good examples of animal magnetism in this crazy world.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There's a difference between venomous and poisonous.
A venom ingested doesn't have to be poisonous as it's often designed to interact with specific parts of a body. Usually the nervous system or blood.<br />
when the venom is ingested it most likely won't encounter those systems before it comes in contact with all the digestive enzymes that can break down the protein structure that makes up the venom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will add that many predators know to simply avoid the part of the body that delivers the venom. For example, meerkats adroitly nip the stingers off of scorpions and discard them before they eat their delicious land-lobster. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Venom is a small square box. </p>
<p>Your bloodstream is a small square hole and your stomach is a small round hole.</p>
<p>Venom is able to go through the square but not the circle because it's not designed to go through a circle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
