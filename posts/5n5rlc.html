		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sociopath and psychopath aren't official medical terms and so don't have a clear, explicit definition, or a direct mapping to a medical concept. The way they're used can vary depending on the person using them. </p>
<p>Usually they'll either be used interchangeably, or 'psychopath' will be used to mean an especially severe or violent sociopath. There are <em>some</em> professionals who use them to mean different things; Robert Hare, a criminal psychology expert, uses 'sociopath' to refer to a condition you develop as a result of abuse, neglect, growing up in an extremely harsh and uncaring environment (eg being a child soldier or slave), and 'psychopath' to refer to a condition with similar symptoms that is more concrete and innate. But even he admits this is just a convenient way to talk about things in his writing on criminal psychology (where he's an expert) and not necessarily a hard neurological truth.</p>
<p>The medical concept is called Antisocial Personality Disorder. Antisocial, note, does not mean introverted or shy or lonely, that's usually called being <em>a</em>social. Antisocial means more 'against society.' Antisocial Personality Disorder/'sociopathy' is defined by an inability to conceive of other people as actual people, extremely muted social emotion, exaggerated and uncontrolled nonsocial emotion (eg something that would make a normal person mildly irritated will make them seethe with rage), and usually attributes of narcissism (&quot;everything other people say and do is secretly about me, if anything bad happens to me it was other people being jealous and malicious because nothing is ever my fault&quot;).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These are all great answers, but I would like to underscore the first point in the top comment:</p>
<p>These are not official or clinical terms in the field of psychiatry. A person can't be &quot;diagnosed&quot; as a psychopath. Rather, these are social labels that people use to define abstract concepts of complex personalities. Naturally, that means that they overlap a lot. A lot of people have mentioned Antisocial Personality Disorder as mirroring cultural ideas of sociopathy, but I haven't seen anyone mention Conduct Disorder. CD is probably the closest clinical relative of psychopathy, like APD is to sociopathy. It's your basic toddlers-drowning-kittens type of thing, and only presents from a very young age. Like most personality disorders, this is also not something that can be easily handled by medication.</p>
<p>I would <em>heavily</em> hesitate (Edit: flat out refuse) to relate general psychosis (ie. schizophrenia) to psychopathy, since the two definitions just don't overlap enough. Doing so only increases stigma on an already vulnerable group, who are much more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. Just my input as someone who has worked with these populations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The distinctions between 'sociopathy' and 'psychopathy' has been widely debated in the field of Psychology due to the very issue surrounding whether 'sociopathy' is an officially diagnosable term. </p>
<p>Psychopathy is firstly recognized as the neurological imbalance and lesions within the amygdala, the part of the brain that controls fear and judgment. With that in mind, those diagnosed with psychopathy primarily lack general empathetic abilities; the ability to understand and comprehend hurt, grief, love, and affection, as well as the desire to experience thrill-seeking emotions, often to 'compensate' for the lack of other 'basic' emotions that they lack.</p>
<p>Psychopaths are often greatly misunderstood due to media accounts of serial killers, manipulators, liars. Whilst they most certainly have the ability to deceive and manipulate, only a very small fraction of diagnosed psychopaths are dangerous. Generally speaking, psychopaths may live their lives without causing pain or harm to others, although can be masters of manipulation due to their lack of empathy, guilt, or fear. </p>
<p>Bankers are currently statistically rated to have the most psychopaths in its profession; as well as thrill-seeking tendencies, money, achievements, status, ego, and power are often viewed as a desire for those with such traits. They are able to reach goals through the lack of hesitation and perceived fear.</p>
<p>Now, onto Sociopathy. Again, is it an officially diagnosed term? Or is it a pseudo-scientific, watered-down variation of the term, 'psychopathy'? The current DSM categorizes psychopathy as a variation of an antisocial personality disorder prevalent to biological factors.</p>
<p>'Sociopaths' are often vaguely described as similar in traits, although its root causes are based on environmental factors (such as levels of childhood trauma/abuse/grief, etc) in which cause, could also then be contributed to such disorders as 'post traumatic stress disorder', which also causes the same perceived traits as 'sociopaths'. In which case, psychopathy is more clearly definable in terms of the DSM, as a form of an antisocial personality disorder, whereas Sociopathy is often confused with a byproduct of past environmental trauma. </p>
<p>Whilst there is a rather clear difference between the both disorders, with a rather similar outcome, I believe there needs to be more extensive theorized studies in order to strengthen the legitimacy of the term, 'sociopath'. Hope this helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although Psychopathy and Sociopathy are often used interchangeably Psychopathy  is not regarded as the same as anti social personality disorder in psychpathological/forensic/psych literature. </p>
<p>ASPD shows a pretty common pathway from ADHD to Conduct Disorder to Substance Abuse to ASPD. It also seems to have a much bigger nurture  component  than Psychopathy. Take a super impulsive, poorly self regulating  kid put him in a terrible home life and your likely to get ASDP in the  adult.</p>
<p>Psychopathy  on the other hand seems less determind by nurture. Psychopath born in a bad environment = jail, Psychopath born in a nurturing environment =CEO. The main difference  between the two are what's known as low prosocial traits: callousness, lacking empathy (although not the theory of mind kind which can be impaired in autism), lacking remorse. ASPD folk can often report feelings  of  guilt or shame.</p>
<p>Interestingly  although  the DSM doesn't  recognise Psychopathy  in adults as seperate from ASPD the most recent edition DSMV does aknowledge a subtype of conduct  disorder in teens (the usual precursor  to an adult ASPD diagnosis) which is characterised  by  low prosocial traits. So they're  kind of aknowledging the difference. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While not medical terms, psychopath and sociopath are used differently:</p>
<p>Sociopath is generally someone who is particularly uncaring toward others.  Often a master manipulator who only views other people as tools to get what they want.  Experiences extreme feelings and emotions, but acts on them in antisocial ways, often violently.</p>
<p>Psychopaths are people who genuinely are incapable or have extreme difficulty feeling.  Like a sociopath, they have no problem using other people to get what they want, but unlike a sociopath, they have only a cerebral understanding of human emotions, and do not actually feel them.</p>
<p>A perfect example of the contrast is Tony Soprano (sociopath played by the late and great James Gandolfini) vs Valerie (psychopath played by Beau Garrett) from Season 6 Episode 12 of &quot;House&quot;.</p>
<p>Edit: more clarity on my examples.  Also, Dexter (psychopath played by Michael C Hall) would be another and slightly less obscure example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
