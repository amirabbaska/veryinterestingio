		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because the center of your eyes is full of cells that are sensitive to color, rather than cells sensitive to light.</p>
<p>To go along with this, from a young age my dad taught me the trick of &quot;averting your eyes&quot; for astronomical observation. You first look where you think it should be, then you look a little to the side to actually view the object. I've become quite good at it and now look at most stars indirectly.</p>
<p>Edit: Here's some additional info for people who want to know why this is. You have two types of cells in your eyes. Cones that are designed to detect color (three types) and rods that only detect brightness levels across a wide color range. Your brain mixes those two signals together to give you what you see. It's most important to see color in the center of your vision though so your eye has a concentration of those cones in the center of your vision and you detect color less well outside the center of your vision. This is also why when its dark everything seems to become black and white because the cones in the center of your vision can hardly see any light any more. (Think walking around with a dim night light, or when you wake up in the middle of the night without any lights on but can still see because of various dim sources of light.) The center of your eye has more cones than rods while the periphery of your eye has more rods than cones. Coincidentally, rods see best in the blue/green color range which is why you use red light to not destroy your dark vision as the rods don't see the red very well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wait. What? I have never ever noticed this. I am in a extremely dark area where you can see the milky way really clearly at the night. I spent a lot of time looking at stars and always felt like I see more if I look directly at the stars in question. </p>
<p>While the explanation makes sense in practice I haven't noticed this at all</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have two different cells in your retina of your eye that can sense light.
-cones, that can see color, but only when there is much light
-rods, that cannot see color, but can see better with little light</p>
<p>the cones, which works best during the day, are in the center of you vision.
the rods are everywhere else.</p>
<p>So when you see a star at your peripheral vision( very precise words by the way), you use your rods, which are better during the night.
When you you look directly at a star, the light falls on the cones, which are not very light sensitive, so the star seems to disappear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The distribution of light sensitive cells in your eyes changes from the center to the outside. In the center, it's mostly color sensitive cone cells while on the edges of your vision, it's almost entirely low light sensitive rods. Rods are better at picking up contrast and low amounts of light, so the center of your eye is less sensitive to dim things.</p>

If I saw something in the darkness, I was trained to not look directly at it, but to look about 30 degrees to either side, keeping eyes in motion as indeed, the corners of the eye are much more sensitive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
