		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My apartment has an ant colony somewhere in the building and occasionally ants make their way through one of my walls.</p>
<p>Last night I decided to leave a glass of soapy water near the wall where they were coming out of. I didn't hope for much ... but this morning it looks as if all the ants decided to voluntarily drown themselves for my convenience.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Dpx4sC7.png" target="_blank">Here's a pic</a>. I doubt that's all the ants in the colony, but that gap in the wall they were coming out of shows no trace of ants whatsoever now. So why did the ants do that?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ants would normally float on water due to surface tension. That is because the water molecules at the surface stick together, acting like a very weak, but seemingly solid surface. Strong enough to allow <a href="http://www.natur-server.de/Bilder/MZ/001/mz000671-wasserlaeufer.jpg" target="_blank">small insects to float on top</a>.</p>
<p>So normally, when an ant touches water to taste or drink it, it's able to rest some of its legs on the surface without sinking. But soap molecules prevent the water molecules from sticking together, breaking the surface tension. Insects can't deal with that, and are very likely to drown if they fall in. </p>
<p>I suspect that there was something in the soap that smelled like food to the ants, so they climbed into the glass to see if it's food - thinking that it's safe to get back out. Touching the water to taste it, they fell in and drowned. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are likely drawn to the moisture as all living creatures need water to survive. Since ants leave chemical scent trails for others to follow the others may begin check out this trail to see if it is promising. Once they reach the soapy water they can't get back out and they down. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ants need water to survive, just like anything else really. They will drink up water they find and bring back to the colony.</p>
<p>This is usually fine because of surface tension. The water makes a sort of &quot;wall&quot; that tries to keep the ant out. The water wants to stick to itself, not the ant.</p>
<p>When you have soapy water, the soap reduces the surface tension of water. So when the ant goes near it to drink, the water sticks to the ant and sucks it in. They get stuck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
