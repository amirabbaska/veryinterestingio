		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends whose population estimates you look at, as every organization will have its own methodology. Firstly, even national population numbers in developed countries will never be 100% accurate. You have a never-ending mortality and birth rate, and presumably a steady immigration and emigration rate. Once you understand and can calculate the growth or declining rates of the latter noted elements of population, you can better calculate the representation of the country. Developed countries might also have a government facilitated census, and this helps at tightening the numbers. But they will never be perfect, I would say that most developed countries have a +/- 2% discrepancy. When you look at population numbers from a developed country's government, you can assume that they're correct.</p>
<p>Lesser developed countries have more difficulties when it comes to calculating the above noted figures. As a result, you want to use a proxy, or best guestimate. There are multiple approaches that you can take and this goes back to what I said about it depending on the organization. Some will have an agreed upon formula that encapsulates many factors (e.g. employment, real GDP, GDP PPP, gross exports and imports, energy consumption, etc.), And ultimately spits out a number. Other organizations might take the posted numbers from a developing countries, if they even have them available, and apply a +/- rate to adjust the accuracy and discrepancy.</p>
<p>Note: I'm writing this from my phone and there are many more things that I want to add. I also haven't proofread much of what I wrote above. If this post sticks and you want further clarification I'll add what I can when I get home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>They rely on census and administrative data for each country, wherever possible.</p>
<p>Here is a lengthy paper on the subject.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/estandproj.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/estandproj.pdf</a></p>
<p>The paper goes into a lot more detail, but I am guessing that getting accurate numbers for North Korea or Syria would be problematic.  Presumably they can get data from intermediaries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
