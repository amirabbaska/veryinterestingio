		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The polymer that lines aluminium cans might absorb small amounts of soluble flavor from the soda. Conversely, acetaldehyde in plastic bottles might migrate into the soda. The FDA regulates this kind of potential chemical contact, but even minute, allowable amounts could alter flavor. Glass is apparently the best for keeping its true flavor.</p>

<p><strong>Best edit EVER:</strong> THANKS /u/fatcatfromspace. Sorry guys I massively messed up I forgot about the whole ELI5, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/XREDExl.jpg" target="_blank">so I made this to make it easier to learn and understand.</a></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://imgur.com/ks5j1Re" target="_blank">Here's my best attempt (its hard to colour between the line).</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit 2: Guys I spent a couple of minutes looking on google for an answer that I've always pondered about and when I found an answer I was happy with, I went with it! Mine probably isn't the right/final answer but I was sufficiently happy with it. Especially after I coloured it in, it really helped me get my head around it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glass is what is referred to as an &quot;absolute barrier&quot;.  Pretty much nothing comes and goes through it, except for energy.</p>
<p>Plastic is, relatively speaking, porous.  The same goes for aluminum.</p>
<p>On top of that, you can have plasticizers leaching into the beverage from the plastic bottle or the lining of the can.  In the case of the can, small amounts of metal ion, as well.</p>
<p>In the other direction, small amounts of gas can diffuse through/out and the smaller and/or more fat soluble molecules can migrate into/through the plastic.</p>
<p>Also, things like phosphoric acid can chemically work on the container.</p>
<p>There is sooooooooo much science going on in those little systems that it boggles the mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've worked for two different soda companies for a total of about 8 and 1/2 years. </p>
<p>The simple answer is this. The drinks lose carbonation the fastest in plastic bottles. There are microscopic holes in them which is why they go out of date more quickly than other products. </p>
<p>Aluminum packaging suffers from a similar problem but not as drastic. As such, it's shelf life is longer. </p>
<p>Glass bottling as far as I remember doesn't have this problem, or it's significantly less severe, and retains carbonation far longer than the other two. </p>
<p>We had to rotate product annually to guarantee consistency in taste. Look for the colors of the caps on 2 liters. When they change its a visual cue for rotation. </p>
<p>The dates aren't expiration dates but actually freshness dates. It's the date that the product has lost enough carbonation to taste flat. </p>
<p>Pro tip diets in plastic containers  have the shortest shelf life. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the soft drinks in the UK have this taste difference between types of packaging too. I was once told that this was because it was different factories producing the drink for different containers so plastic bottles were done in one place and cans in another. The base syrup was always the same but the main difference was the water that was added. The UK especially has varying regional water tastes due to different minerals contained in it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A family friend works in the Coca-Cola factory in Huddersfield (U.K). Just asked him and he said that simply it is because each of these different containers require that the coke is bottled at different temperatures, but that this altered the taste and fizz very slightly. (He didn't go into any more detail over a quick phonecall, sorry guys).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
