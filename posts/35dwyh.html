		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Driller here.</p>
<p>There are three main issues. One is heat, and the other is pressure, and the final one is hole stability.</p>
<p>Heat from geothermal sources, or just generated from the drill string, causes damage to the drill string components. Some companies have giant radiators that are installed on the surface to cool drilling fluid down before being pumped back down hole, but in the end the cumulative heat reduces the amount of time that is able to be spent downhole and drilling to less than 200 hours per trip.</p>
<p>Pressure is another problem. As you get deeper, the pressure exerted on the formation from drilling fluid gets higher and higher. At the same time, the horsepower required to pump the drilling fluid back up to the surface becomes much greater. You would need enormously powerful pumps capable of generating as much as 10,000 psi.</p>
<p>Finally you have hole stability. This is the ability of the hole to not collapse in on itself, potentially trapping the drill string and getting it stuck. To mitigate this problem casing is run through various sections of the hole. The problem is that every time you run casing, you have to then drill with a smaller drill bit and BHA/drill string. Eventually you can't run anything smaller and are at the limit of what can be reasonably drilled.</p>
<p>The potential to drill deeper than 40,000 feet is there, but absent funding for such a project I find it hard to believe that anyone would undertake such an endeavor. It can be done deeper than 40,000 ft, but not by much.</p>
<p>EDIT: RIP my inbox. Also, <a href="http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/bp-and-technology/more-recovery/deepwater-frontiers.html" target="_blank">apparently BP is developing very high pressure equipment (20k PSI) to enable very deep offshore wells</a> Thanks to /u/fanofdeja for that bit of info.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Gilded?! Thank you kind stranger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The deepest drill hole for those curious is in Russia called [The Kola Deep] (<a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole" target="_blank">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole</a>). 12,262 vertical metres.</p>
<p>Modern down hole drill technology has improved somewhat since then, so theoretically it might be able possible to go a further few 1-2,000m, but the cost would be horrendous and it is doubtful that any company would attempt it without a very good economic reason.</p>
<p>Pressure, temperatures, the weight of the drill string as others have mentioned all start having serious effects.</p>
<p>In terms of mining, most mineral (non oil and gas) drill holes don't go much deeper that 1,500m for the simple reason that it is cheaper to mine a decline, or put down a shaft and drill out the potential ore body of interest with a greater number of shallower holes.</p>
<p>For example, a 1,000m diamond hole might cost in the region of $250-300,000 and take 4-8 weeks to finish depending upon the Rock, drill rig and several other variables. A 300m deep hole might run $35-45k and have a greater chance of success and take a week to two weeks.</p>
<p>To drill out the potential ore body, you might need dozens to over a hundred holes depending upon the type of mineral and size of deposit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question was answered in a recent Discovery Magazine article found here: <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2014/julyaug/13-journeys-to-the-center-of-the-earth" target="_blank">http://discovermagazine.com/2014/julyaug/13-journeys-to-the-center-of-the-earth</a> </p>
<p>The relevant excerpt:</p>
<p>&quot;Everything we know about the mantle, which begins about 15 miles below the surface, and about Earth’s core, 1,800 miles beneath us, has been gleaned remotely.&quot;</p>
<p>Others have mentioned the Kola dig, which is also discussed in the article.</p>
<p>&quot;Temperatures at the bottom of the Kola hole exceeded 300 degrees Fahrenheit; the rocks were so plastic that the hole started to close whenever the drill was withdrawn . . . If Earth were the size of an apple, the Kola hole wouldn’t even break through the skin.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More than this depth and mines would collapse. The temperature would be hotter than the point where drill bits are useful. You could also drill from a deeper point. The Moho Borehole was a US project to drill into the mantle from a point on the seabed where the crust is thin.</p>
<p>But there are some alternatives. There have been proposals to create self-sinking probes containing radioactive isotopes. A few hundred pounds of radioactive cesium would melt its way through the crust and into the mantle hundreds of kilometers down. They could be used either for exploration or disposal of nuclear waste. The sound given off by the rocks as they cracked and melted could be used to figure out the location of the probe and the composition of the earth.</p>
<p>An even more outrageous plan was to crack the Earth's crust with a hydrogen bomb, then pour ten million tons of molten steel into it with an embedded high-temperature probe. The steel is denser than the mantle, so it will sink all the way to the core. The probe can communicate with the surface by vibrating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the heat, how deep do one have to drill to establish some kind of power plant - sending down water, to a depth where it boils - get steam back up, run it through a turbine to generate electricity just like any other nuclear / coal / general power plant.. Get clean &quot;limitless&quot; energy.. Would it be possible with the technology of today? If so, is the process of doing so too expensive for it to be worth it?
I'm guessing the answer depends on where on earth you are, Iceland have hot springs and already takes advantage of that energy wise.
But could the method provide clean energy in most other places in the world too with &quot;just a bit of drilling&quot;?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
