<p>In some languages or cultures the queen is still referred to something similar to the minister; vizier in east cultures, and Hetman in Poland. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't always called the queen, and it wasn't always the most powerful piece in the game. It is said that the origin of &quot;queen's chess&quot; (modern queen movement, and the piece actually being referred to as a queen) started in Spain during the reign of Isabella I. Whether that's related or not is hard to tell, but I'm sure not everyone at the time loved the idea of a queen being the best piece in one's stable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The piece went through a lot of variation over the years. In its original incarnations throughout Indian and Persian culture, all the pieces were considered male and the Queen was considered the equivalent to what we'd consider &quot;Minister&quot; or &quot;vizier&quot; or &quot;advisor&quot;. It could also only move in a single diagonal. </p>
<p>When it came to Europe, the continent had a long legacy of powerful queens: Eleanor of Aquitane (queen of France and England, Duchess of Aquitaine (a powerful region of Medieval France), and one of the richest women ever), Isabella of Castille (who unified Spain with her marriage and completed the Reconquista) are two that come to mind immediately. Together, the two shaped a lot of medieval European history. The later, particularly, may account for the piece's power as Isabella wielded a lot of political power and Jews may have brought the game with them as they were expelled from Spain in the 15th century. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
