		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Crabs&quot; is a huge category with many species.  Aquatic crabs live permanently in water and have gills like fish.  They can go out of water but only for short periods, but then again so can some fish.  There are also terrestrial crabs that have lungs and live on land.  These guys can swim around and actually hold a bubble of air in front of their face, but again they can only go under for a short time.  Intertidal crabs have gills, and then also have cuticles on their legs that help them breathe on land.  They have to stay moist though and can't live away from water, but they can breathe in air or water fairly well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Funny thing. Your own breathing is a &quot;water process&quot;. It works because the inside of your lungs are <em>wet</em>. The act of breathing is, in a very real sense, the act of plowing air across a wet sheet. That sheet is folded up and convoluted and we call that sheet &quot;a lung&quot;.</p>
<p>So you push air across the inside surface of your lung (metaphorically) and the water there absorbs oxygen and burps up carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Once the oxygen is in the water it can flow from the &quot;outside water&quot; in your lungs to the &quot;inside water&quot; which is your blood stream.</p>
<p>This whole process is why, when the air is too dry (often by being too hot or cold) or just plain too cold (cold enough to momentarily freeze or sublimate the water in the lungs) it hurts to breathe.</p>
<p>So the same thing is true of everything that breathes.</p>
<p>And for &quot;internally gilled&quot; things like crabs, as long as they can move air past their gills and keep their gills wet, everything will be fine.</p>
<p>Lungfish can do the same thing.</p>
<p>But most regular fish can not keep their gills wet and have no means to force the air to move through them. So they gulp air if you pull them out of the water. And they can live a surprisingly long time. But eventually they dry out because normal fish have no stock of water to keep their gills wet, and gulping air it exhausting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you get too much water in your lungs you don't have the ability to &quot;stir&quot; the water and the surface area of the sheet becomes trapped behind the tubes that are normally full of air, but are now full of water. So you exhaust the oxygen in the water in your lungs, replacing it with carbon dioxide. Unfortunately now, instead of the normal <em>fifty</em> to <em>seventy-five</em> square meters of lung (wet sheet) each breath exposes to air with each breath, the air can only get into the big tubes, which have a cross-section of just a few inches... and you drown.</p>
<p>So crabs et. al. can survive on land because they have evolved to be able to keep their gills wet, and they can move air across them by one means or another, and that same means can move water across them when they are submerged.</p>
<p>Humans cannot breathe under water because we have to push the air out the way it came in, and water just doesn't respond the same way to pressure.</p>
<p>Fish cannot breathe on land for long (in general) because they cannot keep their gills damp and they are good at moving water instead of air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I learned about how frogs breathe in both environments in uni, I know you asked for crabs, but you might find this interesting: </p>
<p>Humans heart have four chambers, 2 ventricles, 2 atria. Each side of the heart has one of each. The blood coming from the body enters through the right atrium, then is pumped to the lungs by the right ventricle. The blood coming from the lungs is received by the left atrium, and pushed to the body by the <del>right</del>* left ventricle. </p>
<p>Frogs basically have 2 separate circulatory systems, one for land, one for water.  They still have 2 atria, one on each side, but they only have one large ventricle at the bottom. </p>
<p>When they are on land: atrium 1 receives blood -&gt;ventricle pumps to the lugs-&gt;lungs pump to the body-&gt;atrium 1 receives blood. Atrium 2 is never used. </p>
<p>When they're underwater: atrium 2 receives blood-&gt;ventricle pumps to skin(how they breathe underwater)-&gt;skin pumps to body-&gt;atrium 2 receives blood. </p>
<p>To switch between the two, frogs have a valve in their heart that switches blood flow between the two systems. </p>

<p>&quot;. Crabs can be divided into three broad categories: aquatic (mostly marine), intertidal, and terrestrial. Each type is able to live only in its own environment. Aquatic crabs have gills and breathe underwater like fish. Take them out of the water for too long and they will suffocate because their gills collapse. Some intertidal crabs are able to breathe both in water (by means of gills) and out of water (using thin areas of cuticle on the leg bases) but they have to stay moist for the cuticle to function. Terrestrial crabs have stiff gills that function well out of water but not in it; if you put them into water with no way out, they'll drown eventually. Some terrestrial crabs, especially those that live in really dry habitats, also have lungs.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most fish would actually be able to breathe air if it weren't for the fact that their gills collapse when not supported by water. The gills of some crab species are much more stiff and thus can retain their surface area outside water, allowing them to breathe air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
