		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We sleep best and most deeply when we are in the place where we normally sleep.  That is partly because we have learned it is safe to sleep there, but also because we've gotten used to all the normal sounds.  After a while, our brains only tell us to wake up if we hear a sound that isn't normal.  Like, if your furnace makes a banging noise every hour, your brain will eventually realize that the sound doesn't mean anything bad is going to happen and will ignore it.  But if someone threw a rock through your window at night, your brain would say, &quot;wake up, it sounds like something weird is going on, it might mean we are in danger!&quot; </p>
<p>It's like my dog.  Sometimes we are in the city, and sometimes in the country and he is used to being at both places.  When we are sleeping in the city, all sorts of traffic and people can be heard all night but he ignores it, because he knows it is normal there.  In the country, if he heard a car door shut a mile away in the middle of the night, he would freak out.  That's because he is awoken by hearing something that is unusual for the place he is at.  </p>
<p>The same is true for us.  When we sleep in a new place for the first time, studies have shown that part of our brains aren't really sleeping, they react differently to noises around us.  Stay there a few nights though, and you will begin to have a more restful sleep, and only the noises that are out of the ordinary there will disturb you.</p>
<p>The reason our brains have this kind of nighttime security system is because we are most vulnerable when we are asleep. Those early humans whose brains developed in this way survived and had kids.  Those that didn't evolve this way likely died in their sleep, but not peacefully.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's another aspect of this besides subconscious training. Disclaimer: I'm not a sleep expert, but I've read a lot because of my own sleep disorders.</p>
<p>You know how your eyes close when you go to sleep? They close so what you see can't bug you and wake you up. But you don't have ear lids, so your brain does something cool: it mostly turns off your ears.</p>
<p>It's like your ears have little fingers way down on the inside that plug them. (They don't really, but it's like that.) You know how, when you plug your ears, you can still hear things that are loud, and you can even hear things that aren't loud if you listen hard? That happens when you sleep, too, when your ears are mostly turned off.</p>
<p>Your brain mostly turns off your other senses, too, like your smell, taste, touch, and body position. This is really helpful when you're hurt or sick, because it keeps pain from waking you up, so you can sleep and get better. Your body gets better a lot faster when you're sleeping.</p>
<p>You should know that if pain is bad enough to wake you up, you should go see a doctor.</p>
<p>Another cool thing your brain does when you sleep is mostly turn off your movement. It's kind of like your brain holds your arms and legs down a little. It's weird, but it's helpful, because if you have a dream where you're running, you won't start running in bed and fall out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reticular activation system. A network of neurons interconnecting all the major structures of your nervous system.
the reticular activation system mediates consciousness. A loud noise while you sleep? It will jolt you awake. If you're in pain for whatever reason it will be low key on continuously, which is why you can really sleep well if you're in pain. Depressed? Similar process, it's almost signalled like pain and again will be low key on chronically, and you get disordered sleep.</p>
<p>It's a pretty cool part of the brain</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you’re still conscious, to be more specific you’re not full unconscious or unresponsive. The parts of your brain that detect threat and keep your body at the right temperatures are still awake and if they feel like something is wrong they will wake you up.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
