		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: money.</p>
<p>It takes $10,000 to send 1lb of stuff to space. ISS weighs 925,000 lb and it only serves research purposes. If you would like to perform any kind of manufacturing or processing and house a reasonable amount of people (ISS currently houses 6) you can easily multiply that by 100x. And already we're getting close to trillion dollars. Add some money for food, water and other supplies and the cost is astronomical.</p>
<p>An undertaking like that would require multiple governments to combine their powers and throw trillions of dollars in an very uncertain investment. Which will probably not happen in the near future because humans just don't play along nicely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most answers center on money and politics and those are good answers, but there's another that gets ignored a lot: the moon is a seriously hostile environment for technology. Specifically, moon dust.</p>
<p>The closest thing to it from all I've read is talcum powder, baby powder. And, if you disturb it, it gets EVERYWHERE and really gums up the works. It would be a huge technical challenge to deal with it in a permanent base. It might be okay once it was built and up and running, but getting to that point would be tough. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure but unless they have a fully fledged stockpile of resources to build with on the moon you still have to launch all those materials up to the moon and then build the base and then launch the constructed rocket again from the moon to wherever. You also have to send a bunch of people up there and pay them mucho $$$ and train them and do all the research to see what the effects of long term low gravity moon life would do to the body and bring them back for vacation etc etc. So yeah. A few things to work through I guess. Maybe there's something to it though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>materials will still need to be brought up from Earth until mining and refining is researched and tested.</p>
<p>an asteroid mining station would be the best option </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
