		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of areas of programming that require only basic math. If you're doing development for a moderate-sized web site or app, it's quite possible you'll almost never use any math, and never anything beyond things taught in high-school algebra.</p>
<p>More generally, some programmers use a lot of math all the time, some hardly use math at all.</p>
<p>There are many more specialized areas of programming that require a lot of math. Computer graphics uses a lot of trigonometry and calculus, so pretty much any game that requires physics or 3-d rendering uses a lot of math. Video and audio compression uses Fourier analysis. Cryptography uses number theory. Those are just a few examples - there are lots of specialties. Good programmers often need to have at least some familiarity with those areas, even if that isn't their area of expertise.</p>
<p>Quite often large-scale software engineering requires more math - for example web sites that need to scale to millions of users. It's hard to properly optimize sites to handle a lot of traffic without a good foundation in probability and statistics.</p>
<p>A degree in Computer Science typically covers many of those things, which is why there's a math requirement. In addition, Computer Science involves a lot of mathematical analysis of programs, including determining what's possible to compute, determining asymptotic runtime and memory usage, and mathematical proofs of bounds and of correctness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both math and programming are strongly based in logic, so there is going to be a lot of skill overlap.  Writing a program is often very similar to constructing a mathematical proof.  You need to create steps that both logically flow together, and that are valid in the general case, not just in special cases.  The skills behind math often apply to programming in a sort of a vague way.  I might not ever need to find the integral for a hyperbolic trig function, but the mode of thinking that let me do that often also apply to math.</p>
<p>Computers are often doing tasks that require higher level math to fully understand.  If I am using a random number generator to perform a simulation, I had best understand probability and statistics to ensure the results are valid.  I had also best have a little number theory so I understand how the RNG works.  If I want to analyze how long that program will run for a given input and how much space it will require, that brings in abstract algebra, number theory, and calculus.</p>
<p>Also, computers are often used to directly solve math problems.  If I need to invert a matrix or find an approximate solution to a complex equation, I need enough math to understand exactly what those things mean.</p>
<p>Finally, you never know what math you are going to need, so it is good to have a big toolbox.  I learned what a Poisson distribution was in college, thinking I would never use it.  More than a decade later it was the key to diagnosing a serious network problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Programming is - in a sense - just applied math.</p>
<p>Math has a strong emphasis on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>logic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing/applying algorithms</p>
</li>
<li>defining stuff (classes, groups, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not saying you can't become a great programmer without studying maths, I'm just saying since they share so many similarities it usually helps to learn both or that it is easier for you to learn the other if you find you have a talent for one of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Programming is a form of applied mathematics. A better understanding of the underpinnings can aid in their application.</p>
<p>Set theory, group theory, and category theory are underpinnings of computer science, and many white papers on computation and computability are described in these terms. Mathematical analysis is used heavily to measure properties of programs, typically focusing around efficiency and complexity. Lambda calculus is a formal system that describes computation. There are many other branches and systems of math that can be used to describe different aspects of computation itself. It's not all just applied mathematics in terms of using X mathematics to solve a business problem. Knowing statistics, for example, would make a programmer very valuable at measuring performance, efficiency, and correctness of programs, and is typically an obtainable skillset to most developers.</p>
<p>You don't necessarily need explicit knowledge of maths to be a developer. Lord knows, I've worked with mouth breathers who managed to do enough to not get fired. Kudos to them. Also a consideration is there's plenty of software that can afford to be incredibly wasteful, which is actually most software.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
