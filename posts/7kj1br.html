		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can bend the 5 foot section of railroad rail, but it's such a small amount you don't really notice it. When you have 200 feet of railroad rail that small bend is amplified by a factor of 40, because every 5 foot section of the rail is bending just a little bit. They likely bend nearly the same amount (same radius of curvature), but it isn't very noticeable until you have a long enough piece of rail to see the arc. </p>
<p>EDIT: Yes, I understand that the weight of the rail itself also plays into this. I was assuming the rain was lying flat and you were just pushing on it while the other end was fixed, for simplicity. If it's hanging or in other scenarios you do still need to consider the additional weight and leverage of the rail causing additional bending. This simplification also assumed you could somehow apply the same force on each 5 foot section of rail, which is false as was pointed out by u/orangeman10987. The bend increases with the cube of the length in realistic scenarios.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First we must clear a misunderstanding up.  The railroad rail’s flexibility is an intrinsic property, meaning that the actual amount of the material in question doesn’t affect the flexibility at all.</p>
<p>In engineering applications, we calculate deflection of beams (we can consider the railroad rail as a beam for reference purposes) using pretty simple equations.  For simplicity’s sake, I’ll reference a situation where the rail is fixed at one end and extends into space until it reaches the end (no support below).  The maximum deflection, which as you noticed happens at the end of the beam, is equal to FL^4 /8EI.</p>
<p>In this equation, F is the force per unit length (Newton per meter, for example), L is the length of track, E is the modulus of elasticity (that intrinsic property I talked about earlier), and I is the planar moment of inertia (a property of the shape of the object).  </p>
<p>Notice that for any two lengths of the same material, the only variable that will change is that L as the rest are intrinsic properties.  On top of this, the L is to the fourth power and in the numerator, which causes it to really control the deflection in this equation.  </p>
<p>This equation does not hold true for a situation like a rail supported at only at both ends which sags in the middle, but I wanted to use it to mathematically show why length matters so greatly in deflection. </p>
<p>Source: currently a mechanical engineering student.  Anyone feel free to correct me if I’m wrong </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three different effects here which I will try to describe in a way that makes sense:</p>
<p>1) if you bend a 5 foot section of rail, the end will move by a tiny distance, but if you attached a laser pointer to the end pointing at a wall 200 feet away the spot would move much further: the same angle of bend results in a larger movement of the end point of a longer straight line</p>
<p>2) if you can bend a 5 foot section of rail by a certain angle, say 0.1°, then bending each 5 foot section of a 200 foot rail will result in a 4° total bend.</p>
<p>3) if you fix one end of a 200 foot section of rail and push on the other end, the part nearest the fixed end will experience a lot of force because the length acts as a long lever and gives a mechanical advantage.  If you clamp a piece of wire in some pliers and try to bend it, the further away from the pliers you push, the less force it will take to bend the part right next to the jaws.  </p>
<p>This is the same reason that it's easy to break a long stick in half but much harder to break a shorter section of stick of the same thickness.</p>
<p>These factors combine with each other to mean pushing on the end of a 10 foot rail will move it considerably more than twice as far as a 5 foot section would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To bend the end of a 5 foot section by 1/10 of a foot*, you need to bend it with a curvature radius of 125 feet. To bend the end of a 200 foot section by the same amount you only need a curvature radius of 5000 feet. In addition you have a much longer lever arm. The required force is much smaller.</p>
<p>*I'm not starting with weird unit conversions here. If you prefer inch do the math yourself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The material properties of the beam are the same for both lengths. However, the applied force causes a different bending moment/torque in each case. Say you apply a 100 lb load at the end. Since torque is force times distance, the shorter beam experiences 500 ft-lb of torque, while the longer beam experiences 20,000 ft-lb! The bending moment is what causes the beam to bend. </p>
<p>To get a bit more technical, the slope of the beam (change in deflection per unit length) is the integral of the bending moment/torque, and the deflection is the integral of the slope. With the short beam you are integrating over a small distance with a small maximum moment, while the long beam has both a large maximum moment and a large area over which to integrate.</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
