		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our individual cells aren’t really controlled that heavily by the brain. The brain may trigger things like puberty and conscious motion, but something like healing or digestion largely functions without the help of the brain. For instance, if you cut yourself and need to regenerate tissue to fill the gap, cells don’t receive a signal from the brain to stop growing, they just can sense that they have grown to the point that they are in contact with cells on all sides and stop reproducing.</p>
<p>So the answer is in the individual cells themselves. Our cells occasionally receive signals that come from the brain but most of their daily activity comes from stimulus from inside the cell or adjacent cells. Plants are the same way</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a fundamental misunderstanding in the question itself. So I'll address that.</p>
<p>Brains don't micromanage the organism at the cellular level. They control and provide a central processing location for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system" target="_blank">nervous system</a>.</p>
<p>So living creatures without nervous systems have no use for brains.</p>
<p>The brain doesn't tell each cell how to function. The function of the cell is built into each individual cell itself. Cells do their job autonomously.</p>
<p>Check out this image of the levels of organisation.</p>

<p>The brain is all upper level management of the organism as a whole. The lower systems have simpler programming and manage themselves without needing to be told what to do.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what the brain is responsible for.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the brain doesn't really control <em>everything</em> in an animal's body. The individual cells and tissues do a lot just on their own as long as they have the supplies to do so. For instance, if you chopped off a hand and gave it some other source of blood circulation, it would still be alive. It couldn't move, but all the interaction that needs to happen between the separate tissues would still be going on. Plants are like that, but they have it even easier since the only supplies they really need are things they can get passively, like water and sunlight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plant growth regulators, or plant hormones, control many of the basic processes that occur in plants at a cellular level.  Instead of one centralized organ or gland producing a hormone that is distributed through the body, like in animals, each cell is capable of producing these chemicals that can induce different processes.  There are five major groups of these hormones that control things like growth, abscission, cell differentiation, or cell death.  </p>
<p>Environmental stimuli will determine which parts of the plant will grow or change in certain ways.  If one part of the plant is receiving a substantial amount of light, it will trigger the production of more cells that are capable of using that light.  The same can be true for roots.  If there are nutrients or water in one area then the necessary cell types will be increased in response that environmental stimulus.  Some plants, like certain pine trees, will begin to kill off their lower branches when those branches are over shadowed by the taller portion of the plant. This prevents wasting energy on the less productive lower branches and does not need to be handled by a higher brain.  The branch is simply not receiving enough of the environmental stimulus, in this case light, and so the cells in that branch stop maintaining light capturing leaves and cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some posts have answered the question up to the point of &quot;cells are triggered to follow their programming&quot; which is correct but I'm going to try and go into some more detail. TLDR at the bottom.</p>
<p>A plant cell (just like any other cell) is a semi-enclosed space where all sorts functions occur simultaneously. This can mean digesting sugars, putting other sugars into fruit, converting sunlight into chemical energy etc. In this way we can say that a cell is a factory with many machines that do different tasks. Different machines can be made, destroyed, switched off or on depending on where the cell is in the plant. </p>
<p>How does the plant know which machines to use when? well, plant cells can detect signals in a variety of ways like sunlight, water and the molecules all around it, and then use those signals to switch machines on or off. For example, when sunlight hits a plant, a machine in the cell is &quot;turned on&quot; and starts making a molecule (or plant hormone) called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscisic_acid" target="_blank">ABA</a>. This molecule can do many things by affecting other machines, like closing the plants pores to stop evaporation when its too sunny. All this depends on the amount of molecule or hormone present, not to mention all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_hormone" target="_blank">other plant hormones</a> that can have effects on what machines are turned on or off. </p>
<p>This brings me to the buzz-phrase of all this: Chemical Gradients. These are the fined tuned signals that flip the switches of all the machines in a cell. If a hormone is made in one place in the plant (say the leaves) it can travel all the way to another place (the roots). Unlike us though, plants don't have a heart to pump their fluid around so they rely on these chemicals moving by osmosis (from a high amount to a low amount). In the same way a salt crystal will dissolve and spread in a glass of water (without  the need to stir it), the plant hormones and molecules will spread across the plants internal water, without the need to move the water. Since a machine is making this hormone, that's where most of it will be, as you get further away from the machine the less hormone you'll find. This is whats called a chemical gradient and it has very complex interactions will all the cells it encounters. ABA, for example, can tell seeds to go dormant, cause leaves to die and tell fruits to stop ripening. These effects are also altered by the presence and amount of other hormones inside the cell.</p>
<p>How do all the cells not just compete with each other? Well the cells do what they are programmed to do and the program (the DNA blueprints) are tightly controlled to allow all the cells in a plant (or any multi-celled organism) to function as a team. If you can make one set of cells really good at capturing water and nutrients, while another set converts sunlight into cell fuel, then that co-ordination is more beneficial than every-cell-for-themselves. This effect is compounded when you have lots of groups of cells competing against each other on who can be the best team of cells. And when I mean best, I actually mean best adapted to a specific place in the world. A fern and a tree both need sunlight and water but the fern can deal with low light and high humidity, while the tree grows enormously tall get at that sweet sunlight. </p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Now I've only mentioned plant hormones but this type of effect can happen with other molecules, like nutrients in the soil and molecules released by diseases when they infect the plants. I have also, purposefully, left out that many plant hormones can be transported along with, sugars, salts and other molecules. I did this because its waaay beyond the scope of this question and the osmotic effect is still driving the movement of the molecule from its origin to the transporter.  </p>
<p>TLDR:
The balance of all the molecules in a cell turn the machines within that cell on or off and this balance is effected by a chemical gradient. The sum of all those machines working together gives the function of a cell in the larger context of a plant. All of the cells working together can do things a single cell can't, like grow a tree. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
