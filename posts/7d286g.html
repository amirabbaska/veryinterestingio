		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people use the word &quot;stretch&quot;, they typically mean &quot;Static Stretching&quot;. Modern research shows static stretching before exercise is actually a bad idea. It has been shown to reduce muscle power performance, while providing limited (if any) injury reduction.</p>
<p>However, &quot;Dynamic Stretching&quot; is good. Dynamic stretching is basically what people call &quot;warming up&quot;. Things like: arm circles, leg swings, easy lunges, etc. </p>

<p><strong>Edit/Update</strong>: Oh god...this is by far my most upvotes. Now I feel obligated to give proper information.   </p>
<p>It turns out, modern-modern research suggests incorporating some static stretching into an overall warmup routine can be beneficial<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stretching is a controversial topic. It isn't clear that it does anything. There is research which shows it can be good. There is research which shows it can be bad. There is research which shows it does nothing. Really, more research needs to be done on it. But as for now, the scientific landscape is a little too rocky to have any firm footing, so I recommend waiting until there is some sort of expert consensus from the sports and performance experts.</p>
<p>Stretching does need to be differentiated from warming up. It is probably important that someone who benches 315lbs warm up prior to benching and not just go into benching 315lbs cold. One big reason is because the level of technique needed to bench 315 tends to be pretty high and the margin of error is low, so it is generally good to prepare for the lift by ramping up to it.</p>
<p>When it can get a little confusing is that many weight lifters will do a lot of stretches to improve their flexibility. For them, having increased flexibility is important because the positions that they need to get into in order to perform maximally require a great deal of flexibility.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have already said, there's a lot of debate but generally it's agreed that warming up your muscles is better than doing serious stretches first thing.</p>
<p>A point of interest- people who are hyperflexible/double-jointed should use extreme caution when stretching and should consider restraining themselves to only doing the dynamic warming up variety.  The last thing you want when your joints are loose is to loosen them further.  Voice of painful experience here, it can lead to regular and random dislocations and subluxations later in life. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that it is actually better to stretch days prior to heavy work outs.  When you stretch you make micro tears in your muscles and ligaments.  Giving your muscles the time to heal after stretching gives you the benefits of stretching without putting you at risk of injury.  It may be beneficial to have a stretch day in your work out regimen and then <strong>warm-up</strong> before each workout. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
