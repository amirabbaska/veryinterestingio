		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Far too thick and far too heavy. The best shielding is lots of hydrogen atoms, so they are mostly looking at various dense plastics, like polyethylene.</p>
<p>There is a good argument that we shouldn't shield spacecraft from cosmic radiation. Cosmic radiation is really high energy, and almost all of it will pass straight through you. It is just going too fast to react. But if you have a reasonable amount of shielding, the radiation has a greater chance of interacting with some of the atoms in the shield, producing lots of lower energy radiation that will affect you.</p>
<p>Solar radiation is a different matter. That is low enough energy to affect you, and also low enough in energy to be absorbed by shielding without producing scatter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It could, but would likely need a fairly thick lining.</p>
<p>I remember it being mentioned somewhere that water worked fairly well at reducing the effect of cosmic radiation. While probably not as effective as lead, it might still make more sense because you could use it both as a lining for habitation areas while also using the space occupied as water storage for hydroponics or waste processing. The other advantage is that water is more common in the form ice from comets so larger scale building would not be as dependent on locating sources of celestial lead. </p>
<p>Alternatively, a station could just generate its own bubble of magnetism to deflect cosmic radiation if it could generate enough power. Or could use a fairly small deflector placed between itself and the sun similar to what is being discussed for solving for Mars's lack of an ionosphere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A thin layer of shielding actually makes matters worse. If a single high energy particle hits a centimeter of lead, it can scatter into hundreds of lower energy particles that spray into the body of the person being shielded. If I recall correctly, you would need a meter or more solid rock to absorb such debris well enough to provide a solution that is literally better than nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it could, but it would be extremely impractical to do so. The first problem is that Lead is not actually that great for this application. When cosmic rays hit Lead they generate x-rays, and those are highly penetrating. Sure, you could block <em>those</em> with Lead too, but now you need a crap-ton of the stuff. In comparison, if you use materials with lighter elements (particularly Hydrogen) such as water or polyethylene then you can block a lot of the more dangerous high energy particles reasonably effectively with a much lower expenditure of mass.</p>
<p>Longer term you'd want basically a combination system that involved an active component based on creating an artificial magnetosphere (which is fairly power hungry but not impractically so) and then passive shielding that relied mostly on things like polyethylene, water, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
