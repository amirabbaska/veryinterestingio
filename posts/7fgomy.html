		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the vibrations caused by the water flowing through the valve. As you turn it to hot, the cold valve starts to close off more until it's barely passing water through and causes it to whistle, just like whistling with your lips. You have to restrict the airflow by closing off your lips to create the whistle sound and as you change the speed of the air and size of opening in your lips, the sound changes with it. This is what's happening with the water and the valves in your shower. The temperature doesn't matter to the sound, it's just that when you turn it up hotter you're closing off the cold valve more and more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it's a really loud noise it is likely caused by the valve you have, I saw this covered on an episode of this old house long ago. </p>
<p>Your sink or bathtub or toilet have shut off valves in the line before the water reaches the valve at the sink or bathtub, this is so you can replace the main valve without having to shut off the water main.</p>
<p>The older style valves have a rubber seat that is loose when it is in the open position, The rubber seat picks up a vibration as the water flows by. When it hits the right frequency it becomes extremely loud.</p>
<p>To fix this they replaced the old valve with a new ball valve, it doesn't have any loose components that can start to vibrate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This can be caused by a few things. By putting your ear to the various areas of the shower you can tell pretty easy which one it is. </p>
<p>1) if the noise is coming from the shower head area, simply buy some lime-a-way and put it in a sand which bag and dip the head in it or hold it over the head. </p>
<p>2) if the noise is coming from the area of the handle where you turn it from cold to hot, you will need to replace your shower cartridge. You tube it it pretty simple to do. </p>
<p>3) if it’s coming from the downspout area where you lift the little handle to send it to the shower head, I would just replace that. It’s about 15-$20 at Home Depot or Lowe’s. You can buy a universal one and it’s pretty easy to install as well. </p>
<p>I know this because I literally just fixed to showers in my sisters house. One was fixed by #2 and one was fixed don’t #3. Pretty straightforward and I hope this helps!!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
