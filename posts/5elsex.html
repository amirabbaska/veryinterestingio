		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, everyone has a different amount of wax production, so some have way more of a buildup than others. It can be a serious problem for some people. Secondly, it exists to protect your tympanic membrane  (ear drum) from foreign substances. It does this by being sticky and catching everything that goes in. If you stick a lot of things in your ear, spend time in the sand, in dusty areas or outdoors or with pets or anywhere where the environment can get inside your ear canal, more things are going to be sticking to your ear wax, thus causing a bigger build up! Shoving q tips will just shove the wax further and further back, making it more impacted and harder to fall out. Thirdly, Our ear wax is actually produced in a way where wax is continually being pushed out of the ear naturally so some people literally never need to clean out their ears! The ear is a strange thing. </p>
<p>Pro tip: if a bug crawls in your ear, your ear canal is so sensitive that you'll know it's there  (no need to worry about bugs crawling in without your knowledge) and they rarely get stuck in the wax, but all you do is turn off the lights and shine a flash light or bright light near your ear and it'll crawl out! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ears like vaginas are self cleaning. Earwax is a self-cleaning agent, with protective, lubricating and antibacterial properties. There are tiny glands in the outer ear canal constantly pump out a watery substance, which gets mixed with bits of dead hair and skin and together is called earwax! </p>
<p>There is also wet and dry earwax the wet earwax is the dominant gene and the dry earwax came about as a mutation in Northeast Asia</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why, but I can say, definitively and without hesitation, that the way to remove wax buildup or a clogged ear canal is with a water syringe. Get in the shower with a glass, fill it with warm water and maybe some peroxide. Fill the syringe with the warm water and shoot it into your ear repeatedly until the big disgusting wax ball comes out. There's no mistaking it. I've had nurses do the same thing for $100 and figured out how to do it myself.
*edit here's what I use for this:  <a href="http://imgur.com/a/bvz88" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/bvz88</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

So no q-tips, use a water syringe. You can get one specifically made for this from the pharmacy, they're fairly inexpensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>and /u/BUTT_PLUGS_FOR_PUGS gave a really good explanation on there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wax comes from the keratin cells that make up the outer 1/3rd of the cell sandwich that makes up the main part of your ear drum. These keratin cells migrate, like your nails or your hair keratin so that any holes can be healed by a new sheet of cells growing out to the edge and replacing them. Kinda like a little conveyor belt.</p>
<p>When the sheet of cells comes to the hairy outer section of the ear they peel off, mix with natural oils in the skin and become brown/orange waxy substance called cerumen (ear wax) </p>
