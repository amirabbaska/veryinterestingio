		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're generally warm and comfortable, and your brain is &quot;booting up&quot;, which mostly has to do with cranking up its metabolism and seeking glucose. In those 5-10 minutes you wake up a bit more, blood flow changes a bit, and you finish waking up completely (which is not as cut and dry a process as it may seem, ask anyone with sleep paralysis!). </p>
<p>There is also pleasure to be found in following a strong urge, which might involve the dopamine reward system, but I honestly don't know if this applies here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it also depends on where you wake up in your sleep cycle.  you go through periods of being in very deep sleep, and very shallow (almost awake) sleep.  if you wake up during the latter period, you feel better immediately.  The periods last about 1.5 hours.  So if you fall asleep, and wake up in intervals of 1.5 hours, it will be easier.  I usually target 6 hours or 7.5 hours of sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you have ever woken up a baby/young child from a full night's sleep, a kiddo who has no concept of &quot;being late&quot; the first thing mine always did was stretch.
With those few extra minutes to fully wake up they were always happy when I got them out of their cribs/beds.
With this in mind, I set two alarms for myself, one for the time I need to get up and one five minutes prior so I can stretch and slowly wake up. Sometimes, I just fall right back to sleep, but not back into a really deep sleep. Without those five minutes I am almost always cranky and horrible to be around while my body adjusts to being awake. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you enjoy waking up slowly, you should try a wake-up light. I got one a few years ago and it's the best thing ever.</p>
<p>It works like this: you set an alarm and 30 minutes before that it slowly turns on the light. You can program a longer or shorter period for that.</p>
<p>It really helps to wake up slowly. I Was very skeptical before I got it but it really does work. I'm always awake before the alarm sounds and it's very gradual.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
