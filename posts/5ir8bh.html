		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've worked with chimps who know sign language (including the one that was taught it by his mother) - it's pretty mind boggling to wrap one's mind around.  What you're talking about is can they pass on traditions/culture, and the answer is yes - this has been seen in a number of primate species.  People seem to feel better when we call it &quot;traditions&quot;, rather than &quot;culture&quot;, though.</p>
<p>It is definitely a cool field of research!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not apes, but monkeys, so still primates. The Japanese Macaque has been used by scientists as an example of how primates can have culture. Scientists were giving the macaques potatos and they saw one young female wash her potato in the river instead of just wiping it off with her hands, because there was sand on it. Eventually almost all of the monkeys began washing their potatos in the river, with the exception of a few older monkeys. Later, the monkeys began dipping them in the ocean almost exclusively instead of the river (because salt and potatos). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the references already provided by others, I've added one that provides evidence of social transmission of foraging skills in chimps, considered by many to be good experimental evidence of chimp 'culture' (the authors did a number of studies, I've just attached the main one). Basically captive populations of chimps were presented with a foraging task that could be completed in 2 manners. One population of chimps had an individual that had been taught 1 of the methods, whilst another population had an individual that had been taught the other (these are known as seeded diffusion experiments). Long story short, each population learnt how to complete the task via their seeded method, providing evidence for social learning and (some) evidence of culture.
<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7059/abs/nature04047.html" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7059/abs/nature04047.html</a></p>
<p>A study of wild chimps corroborated these results and found evidence for social transmission of a novel behaviour (reference below). The fact social learning has been proven both in captivity and in the wild means that we can be pretty certain that chimps (amongst many other animals) learn socially, the only reason we don't have more evidence of this (and for a greater number of species) is because teasing apart genetic, environmental and 'cultural' reasons for observed behaviours can be difficult, especially in wild populations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it's been done in a number of species to date (I can provide a variety of references if you're interested) and the study of animal social learning is a rapidly growing field. I'm currently doing my masters project on social learning in captive populations of Humboldt penguins and meerkats (seperately), trying to do my own seeded diffusions to teach entire populations new behaviours.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chimps learn through observation and mimicry. When you teach a chimp something, he does not understand that you are performing the deliberate act of teaching. He is just watching and copying what you do, and if he finds it useful he will remember it and use it again. But chimps seem to lack the theory of mind necessary to understand the act of teaching.</p>
<p>Chimps develop and pass down culture in the same way, by observation and copying. You could say the they can learn but they donâ€™t consciously teach. A chimp who passes sign language on to her offspring is simply trying to use something she found useful and the infant is watching and copying.</p>
<p>Studies have been done comparing the learning abilities of chimps vs human toddlers. In one, both were shown a gizmo that contained a treat. The researchers demonstrated how to open it by taking a stick, tapping on the top, then poking the stick into a hole and then another hole and finally opening the drawer and taking out the treat. The chimps did better than the toddlers. The toddlers tried to follow the complicated routine they had been shown while the chimps simply forced open the drawer and took the treat. In another, the researchers demonstrated how to get a treat out of a tube by unscrewing the lid. The toddlers had no problem with this, but the chimps tried to chew the lid off.</p>
<p>One of the biggest differences between humans and other primates seems to be in social cognition abilities. The chimps donâ€™t seem to have the concept that someone would teach them something or they could teach something to another chimp. When it happens, it happens more or less by chance, not as a conscious act.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a quick synopsis from Time Magazine of <a href="http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1659611,00.html" target="_blank">one study.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
