<p>the majority of insects have 4 wings: 2 fore wings and 2 hindwings. flies are the only insect order (group) that have modified hindwings called halteres (they look like little drumsticks). these halteres are what allow flies to have superior agility to other insects - they act as dynamic counter-balances in flight. perhaps this has something to do with their name...they're excellent fliers!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A little more anecdotal but it might be because pretty much all other flying insects have something else identifiable about them.
Bees are the buzzy, flowery ones, wasps are the angry, stingy ones, dragonflies are the long, elegant ones, ladybugs are the pretty, spotted ones.
But with flies they don't do anything else. They are teeny black specks that fly around for about a day then die. They're only &quot;flies&quot; because there's almost literally nothing else you could possibly name them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
