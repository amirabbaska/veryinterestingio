		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two main reasons. First, glasses are generally worse heat conductors than metals and second metals tend to be ductile while glasses are generally brittle.</p>
<p>So let's step back a second. The reason that glass shatters when rapidly cooled is usually because of heat gradients in the material. These variations in temperature create stresses at different points in the material. If the stress is large enough it can then lead the glass to shatter. So what's different in metals? To start off metals are much better conductors so that such heat gradients can more quickly dissipate.</p>
<p>But just as important is the fact that metals also tend to be much more ductile. The reason is twofold: 1) metals tend to be crystalline and 2) they are connected through metallic bonding. These properties allow metals to relieve stress through dislocations where planes of atoms slide past each other. As a result the material can easily deform in the presence of a stress without cracking, which is what makes crystalline metals rather soft.</p>
<p>If you move away from these conditions you tend to reduce the ductility of the material. So for example if you move away from metallic bonding to ionic or covalent bonding the materials tend to become quite a bit more brittle. The reason is that now the directional bonding makes it much harder to slide atoms around in order to relax. It's for this reason that quartz (the crystalline form of common glass) is pretty brittle. Likewise if you move away <a href="https://i.imgur.com/RqBqCYW.gif" target="_blank">from a crystalline structure to an amorphous structure</a> you again prevent atoms from being able to slide away from each other in an orderly way. As a result it's much likely for cracks to develop and propagate, which leads to materials shattering. For this reason, even metallic glasses can be quite brittle.  </p>
<p>As a final note, in some cases even crystalline metals can shatter. Certain metals exhibit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductility#Ductile%E2%80%93brittle_transition_temperature" target="_blank">a ductile-to-brittle transition</a> in a given temperature range. At those temperatures if you apply a strong enough stress the metal will also develop cracks like glass and shatter.</p>
<p>edit: I added a more thorough discussion on the effect of the type of bonding per the point raised by /u/Narwhal_Jesus </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It actually can shatter depending on the type of metal it is.  Regular high carbon steel (used for making knives) is really susceptible to cracking and breaking if you quench if in water.  It has to do with the metal crystals themselves during the quenching process.  When you quench steel slowly i.e. in oil the metal cools slowly (relatively) and the crystals are larger and adhere to each other better.  Fast quenching produces small, not very well bonded crystals that are brittle and susceptible to cracking and breaking.  Metals ability to expand and shrink keeps if from shattering like glass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just took materials science last semester, this was a pretty basic concept through the class. Quickly reducing temperature causes the total mass to change temperature at different rates, so while the outside is cooled, the inside is still very hot. Materials contract when they cool, so the outside squeezes the inside, and the inside pushes on the outside: the inside is under compression and the outside under tension. Metals can handle compressive and tensile stresses really well and we typically want those traits in metal: in ancient metallurgy blacksmiths have quenched tools in water and oil. (It’s more in depth but that’s the general idea for metals) Glass (or in general, ceramics) doesnt handle tension well at all, but it’s amazing at compression. The tension it makes on its own is enough to shatter itself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glass is an extremely good insulator as opposed to metal which is a good conductor so temperature flux can be distributed more easily throughout the entire piece of metal. This will more easily allow the coefficient of thermal expansion to occur more evenly whereas with glass a sudden change in heat will cause sudden changes in the size of various parts of the glass so it may expand or shrink without anywhere to go causing it to crack. This still CAN happen with metal but it’s ability to bend and compensate for temperature change makes it more difficult </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

The instant vaporization of the water can send the molten metal flying in the air.
