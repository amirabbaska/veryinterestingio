<p>Are there any other compounds that have similar properties?</p>
<p>How did they find this out?</p>
<p>What is the difference in synthesis? Wouldn't they take the same precursors?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is in the name.</p>
<p>Levo vs Dextro</p>
<p>One of the molecules is facing one way, the other is mirrored.</p>
<p>In simplest terms:</p>
<p>You might have two puzzle pieces that are a mirrored shape. One has the connector on the left side, one on the right side. Both pieces <em>could</em> be considered the same <strong>shape</strong> if you flipped one of them over cardboard-side up. But if you tried to fit this cardboard-sided piece into the wrong place, you would see that it actually doesn't fit at all (because the picture isn't showing).</p>
<p>In the body the orientation of a chemical changes its function dramatically.</p>
<p>edit: In some cases a certain part of the chemical will always fit into a certain &quot;slot&quot; in the body. But if you mirror the chemical, both the previous slot and a new slot are now accessible.</p>
<p>In one version the 'A' receptor is hit. This results in a decongestant effect. The 'B' receptor does not accept this shape of the molecule.</p>
<p>In the flipped version, the 'A' receptor is hit and so is the 'B' receptor. Now you've got a stimulant (with a decongestant effect too).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same way two different keys can be made from the same key blank, and can have the same shaped grooves cut, but in different places, and then one would fit one lock, and another would fit another lock.   The shape of the keys, and the molecules, matters, even if they are made up of the same materials.</p>
<p>Most cells have &quot;receptor sites&quot; that have a particular shape.  Different chemicals activate those receptor sites because they have the right shape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This happens for a lot of complex molecules, it's not the chemical formula that matter, it's the <em>shape</em> of the molecule. And when you're talking about proteins, the shape is often the only thing that matters.</p>
<p>Look up protein folding for example.</p>
<p>As an example, cells have receptors that match a specific shape (a &quot;lock&quot;) and if an incoming molecule has the right &quot;key&quot; then it can enter. Different shape, different effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted standard Vicks Vaporub isn't the same thing as this. Levoamph is a different form of decongestant that comes in a tube. As others have elaborated, it's like two keys with the exact same design, just on opposite sides. Just because they look very similar, does not mean they would function exactly the same. Neurotransmitters work much like keys, their shapes decide their functions. Mirrored molecules, called enantiomers, don't necessarily have <em>any</em> relation to one another. Sometimes they're have vastly different effects, such as with methamphetamine. Sometimes they are largely similar, such as with amphetamine where both forms are often included in ADD medication because they exert only a slightly different effect. And sometimes one is totally inactive, such as with adrenaline. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
