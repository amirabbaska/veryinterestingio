		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So! Your analogy of a ball isn't a bad one to start with. But instead of thinking about a ball being thrown up, and having its momentum acted on by gravity and reaching a moment of equilibrium, let's instead think about a ball being thrown <em>down</em>.</p>
<p>When you bounce a ball it hits the earth and comes back more or less instantly, due to the laws of motion.</p>
<p>(I realize I'm way beyond what a 5 year old would understand, stop me if I'm going too fast.)</p>
<p>When it comes back up, of course, it is slower and doesn't go so high. That's because of gravity and friction, and inertia. Inertia is the thing that really matters here.</p>
<p>A ball has mass and therefore has inertia that it has to overcome. Overcoming inertia slows things down, and inertia is relative to mass. </p>
<p>A photon has no mass. And therefore no inertia. When it changes direction, it does it <em>instantly</em>. It bounces without slowing down or losing speed. It's also too small to have friction and while it is affected by gravity, well... We don't really understand gravity so we can't really understand how light is affected by it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've partially answered your own question - photons move at c. </p>
<p>What you're missing is that they're not (necessarily) the same photon. When light hits the mirror, the photons are absorbed.  </p>
<p>The reflection is other photons being emitted, travelling at c. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really complicated question. If you have an hour and a half <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMSgE62S6oo" target="_blank">here's Richard Feynman answering it</a></p>
<p>Basically the photon is travelling at c until it hits the mirror where it is absorbed by an electron on the mirror's surface. Then various quantum phenomena occur within the atoms on the mirror's surface. However what makes a mirror a mirror is that the end result of these phenomena is that a second photon is spat out almost immediately and with the same wavelength and angular momentum as the first.</p>
<p>Yes photons are normally generated travelling in a random direction, why is it not random in this case? It's something to do with the quantum reactions between the atoms on the mirror's surface. I forget exactly what but if someone could watch the lecture and summarise it that would be great.</p>
<p>So at the moment of reflection there is no photon and so no speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't think of it as a simple photon when you're talking about reflection and refraction of light. You must think of it as a wave.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics tells us what's called Wave-Particle Duality, meaning that any particle (a photon, proton, neutron, electron, etc.) is both a wave and a particle at the same time. When I say wave, think of ripples on a pond of water. When I say particle, think of what you normally think of when you think of these things.</p>
<p>In some interactions, particle-based mathematics describes them perfectly. This can be something like the attraction/repulsion of a proton and an electron next to each other (they're like magnets, one is positive and one is negative). </p>
<p>However, some interactions make the particle seem more like a wave. This means that they can reflect off of surfaces and interfere with each other (when two waves meet, they will either strengthen each other or cancel each other out. Think trying to shake two ends of a jump rope... if you do it at the same time, then you get one big wave. If you shake both ends at different times, it is much weaker).</p>
<p>When it comes to light reflecting off of a surface, the wave model is used. Therefore, there isn't necessarily an object like a ball that's being slowed down.</p>
<p>That's the end of how light reflects, and I'd like to just add another thing about the speed of light. A photon can never move at any speed but c (the speed of light). If we were to look at the mostly inaccurate particle model here, that would mean that the photon instantly changes direction without changing its speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
