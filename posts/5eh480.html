		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Calculus is, in the way it was first used/discovered, just using infinitesimals as a method of solving problems. In that sense, I doubt mathematicians thought there was something missing, since they weren't working on problems that required calculus. This might not be the best analogy but imagine you were tasked with designing a rocket without knowing F=ma, there's no way to design the rocket without discovering it. I think Calculus is somewhat similar, Leibniz and Newton both were working on problems that weren't possible without calculus so they were forced to either discover it, or not solve their problems. The question is thus somewhat esoteric: Did the caveman think they were missing on knowing how a wheel works? Well somebody did and they therefore discovered it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before calculus was invented, there were a number of problems which we didn't know how to solve. It was in attempting to solve them that we assembled calculus.</p>
<p>Mathematicians might have suspected that there was an easier way to solve some of the problems, but probably didn't anticipate the magnitude of the discovery.</p>
<p>Today there are still unsolved problems, and there will likely always be unsolved problems - things sitting out at the limits of our mathematics. But just as then, we can't anticipate the magnitude of the discoveries which it might take to solve them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Calculus wasn't invented over night by Newton and Leibniz one day, it had been in development for hundreds, maybe even thousands, of years. For example, Issac Barrow, one of Newton's advisers, had the full power of Calculus and dealt with the concepts of infinitesimals explicitly. Newton and Leibniz just used all the ideas of Calculus that had already been developed in novel ways, with new perspective and formalized the ideas more coherently. Further, it isn't like Calculus was done after them. It was pretty messy and imprecise, Newton based his formalism in physics, Leibniz was a philosopher and mathematical formalism was still in its infancy. It wasn't until the 1800s when Calculus really got the formal backing that it has today, namely the ideas of limits were precisely defined and things like integrals and derivatives can follow from this. Finally, there is still a ton to be done in Calculus. But it's not about finding new ways to compute different integrals, it's more subtle than that. The ideas of the 1800s and 1900s have shifted our focus from trying to imagine what &quot;infinitesimal change&quot; means to trying to look at things from a bigger picture. One of the most important fields in more modern calculus is Functional Analysis where we don't care much about finding derivatives of single functions, but how large collections of functions that obey certain calculus-based properties behave. These are infinite dimensional geometric collections of functions, and trying to understand them is a big question in math today. It's also has some algebraic spice mixed in, in the form of what is known as &quot;Representation Theory&quot;, and how these two theories interact is very fascinating and more can always be known.</p>
<p>Aside from just Calculus, there is a shit-ton of unknown things in math. The more you learn about math the more you learn that it's full of holes and that we know basically nothing. Each question answered results in a billion unanswered ones. Math is very mysterious and unknown and under constant development. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer your first question. I don't have enough history.</p>
<p>As to your second, <a href="http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems" target="_blank">Millenium Problems</a> are a group of math problems that we don't know how to solve. If anyone figures out the solution and proof to these problems then it is likely we'll have some new math!</p>
<p>There are other puzzles like this. My experience is that they are a bit too esoteric for anyone but math related Ph.D.s to understand. Calculus (mathematics of flow and accumulation), on the other hand, is visible all around us!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It varies. There is some evidence (though the details are contested) that the Cult of Pythagoras were so obsessed with fractions (aka rational numbers) that they thought every number could be expressed as a fraction, and they did nasty things to Hippasus of Metapontum for proving that sqrt(2) is not a fraction. On the other hand, we've got long unproven things that are PROBABLY true but we just can't quite make it work, such as twin primes (although Zhang is close) or the Riemann hypothesis. Then of course, we've got Godel's Incompletness Theorem which shows that math will always &quot;missing&quot; some bits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
