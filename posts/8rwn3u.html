<p>So which is it, and if it's both, then how is this inconsistency settled?</p>
<p>Are people just throwing away Thorium because it has no use currently? I would still expect there to be SOMEONE selling nice thorium spheres or cubes for classrooms... </p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I'll clarify that I'm not asking about Thorium reactors or LFTRs or MSRs.... Just why is it so hard for a <em>chemist</em> to get a <em>sample</em>, and when he does why is that sample so tiny?</p>
<p>As far as I understand Thorium emits only alpha particles which are easily stopped by the lightest of shielding and might even be safe to handle with only gloves... I'd assume <em>someone</em> would be selling chunks of it! </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thorium is abundant and cheap to mine compared to other similar elements, but it is still extremely rare compared to common metals like iron and aluminum. The main problem is that if there's no industrial use, there's no proper market and no economy of scale. A mine isn't going to be profitable if the only demand for their product is from people who think it's neat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Monazite, the major ore, is traditionally minded as sand.  To buy a nice Monazite crystal (like, 1-3 cm) can be a bit pricey.  A thorianite crystal (1cm is big) can be REALLY PRICEY.  So, specifically, in terms of crystals, the rarity is the cause of the price.  As an ore, it is typically unremarkable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I suspect part of the reason is lack of demand. If there's no demand you have no retailers, no wholesalers, no producers, no refiners, no smelters. Nobody's going to trade in a radioactive substance almost nobody wants to buy. Nobody's going to build a smelting and refining plant for a substance they might sell a few kilos of per year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>We do however throw away tons of Thorium each year. This is without us even trying to mine thorium it is just the waste from mining rare earths like neodymium.</p>
<hr />
<p>So I have a friend who’s trying to start a rare earth mine in Missouri. “Jim, how much thorium do you think you’ll be pulling up a year?” And he goes, “I think about 5,000 tons.” 5,000 tons of thorium would supply the planet with all of its energy for a year. And he goes “And there’s like a zillion other places on earth that are just like my mine. It’s a nice mine, but it’s not unique, it’s not like this is the one place on earth where this is found.” -Kirk Sorensen (Flibe Energy)</p>
