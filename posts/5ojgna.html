		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The european central bank set the interest rate low to suit the largest economies which were Germany and France.</p>
<p>Germany had previously gone through a Bank collapse and had changed its laws to lower the probability of it happening again.</p>
<p>the Germans culturally are good savers (which is strange as by saving money they were effectively loosing value due to the low interest rate was less than the Rate of inflation)</p>
<p>Once the crash happened and the euro dropped in value all the high quality products that Germany sell became cheaper leading to a boom in the Germany complete with tax rebate.</p>
<p>Who do you think lent all the money to the other european countries? german dutch and nordic banks. once they saw that they were not getting paid the called the government and Sanctions were imposed. So the german banks got their money back by making the people in the countries where they had lent the money to those banks pay back all the money.</p>
<p>Yes I am still  a bit bitter about it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The crash came from an excess of bad debt.  Folks had been writing loans to people that can't pay, and eventually ran out of capital to keep writing loans when too many folks didn't make their payments.  </p>
<p>It was really a team effort.  Banks shouldn't have been writing multiple mortgages to folks that work part time at McDonalds, and folks that can't afford $1200/mo shouldn't be taking out loans with $1500/mo payments.  Easy lending makes economies do whatever they're going to do faster.  If times are good and everyone is making payments, the economy grows very quickly.  When times get tough, it crashes quickly.  </p>
<p>Germany's banking system kept restrictions on lending practices, and this was reinforced by their culture that didn't borrow what they can't pay back.  They never really had a crisis of capital where the banks were out of cash to lend due to lack of payment.  The downside here was that their economic growth was restricted during the boom times, but also restricted during a crash.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I figured I'd comment on the automotive industry for a moment since that was a big part of the economic crisis.  I'm not an expert so someone please correct me if I'm wrong.  I studied automotive engineering abroad in Germany in 2009, so I'm attempting to remember what I was told from 8 years ago.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A big part of the problem is that when the industry crashed, dealers were left with big lots of cars that they couldn't sell except for a loss.  In Germany, dealerships are almost non-existent.  People order their cars directly (and custom) from the factory, and then wait for it to work their way though the system and show up.  As such, there was no capital tied up in inventory that depreciated. </p>
</li>
<li>This is the part I'm more fuzzy on, but I believe I was told at the BMW plant we worked with is that <del>part of the taxes paid by the corporation was essentially a &quot;bailout tax&quot;</del> the government has a program (Kurzarbeit) and when the industry crashed, the government had money to put back into it, and essentially paid BMW to keep their workers employed for a while.  This helped keep the economy from bottoming out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, if I'm misremember this, please someone correct me.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Clarified kurzarbeit, see child comments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because German economy had enjoyed years of manufacturing growth based on exploiting credit growth in weak euro economies (See the PIIGS). This had a double positive for Germany. 1. These countries in Europe bought German goods with credit fueled purchases. 2. The low interest rates that caused the over heating of the PIIGS economies also meant a weaker euro compared to what the German economy should have had, thus increasing German exports outside the EU and making German goods more competitive in the Eurozone. </p>
<p>The EU interest rates should have been increased to prevent the over heating of the PIIGS economies but was not for one sole purpose. To continue the benefit gained my the German economy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
