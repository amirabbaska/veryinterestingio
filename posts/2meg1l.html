		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's nothing explicitly preventing that if the system is set up properly, but it would be very unlikely to form naturally. The first moon has to be far enough from the planet that the planet's gravity won't destabilize the second moon's orbit, but not so far that the planet no longer influences it substantially. Something that does occur is a Trojan moon, where one moon (Tethys) orbits a planet (Saturn), and smaller moons orbit in the co-orbital Lagrange points 60 degrees ahead and behind Tethys.</p>
<p>Edit: there was a now deleted followup question about binary planets and definitions, this is my response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't think there are any known binary exoplanets (hard to detect) although there are exoplanets with orbital resonance. In this solar system, Pluto and Charon could be considered a binary system because they orbit a common barycentre (and are tidally locked to each other). The main issue with these definitions is that if you accept anything with hydrostatic equilibrium as a planet, then number just keeps going up and up and up as we discover more, so the 2006 definition essentially capped it at 8 and made everything else dwarf planets.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it's unlikely to last because the gravity from the larger body would make the moonlet's orbit unstable. </p>
<p>It's possible there are moonlets in the solar system that we simply haven't confirmed yet. Io constantly ejects tonnes of volcanic debris into space, so some of that probably makes it into orbit. </p>
<p>Also, Iapetus has a <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/files/2014/05/iapetus_cassini_big-990x989.jpg" target="_blank">suspicious mountain range</a> that exists perfectly along the moon's equator. It's possible this mountain range came from a ring system falling down onto the planet, meaning Iapetus might have had thousands of moonlets in the past.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh well. There was an answer about how &quot;the Earth is a moon of the Sun, such that our Moon is a moon of a moon.&quot; So I thought it could be interesting to look at the definition of moons.</p>
<p>Moon typically only refers to a planet's natural satellite. Since the Earth itself is a natural satellite (of the sun), this distinction is introduced to avoid the confusion above. </p>
<p>Yet it's important to note that there's still some fuzziness in the definition of moons. For instance I don't think that moons have any minimal size per se. So OP's question is not as simple as it seems as moons can have dusts orbiting them and it's not clear at what point dusts or rocks should be considered moons. Otherwise, if we just use an intuitive definition for moons, /u/iorgfeflkd answer above is great.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
