		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An objective correlative (correlation, if you prefer) is a way of describing an abstract concept (emotions, colors, sensations, and the like) in a concrete manner, so that the reader/audience can experience those concepts at the same time. </p>
<p>For example, I could say &quot;I feel sad&quot;, but you wouldn't feel sad just by reading that (no objective correlative). If I say, instead, &quot;I feel like I just saw my childhood pet get run over by that truck all-over-again&quot;, you might feel a little bit of that sadness (some objective correlative). Or, I could say &quot;I've just left home for the last time, my family was waving me off in the rearview mirror, my wife next to me with a hand on her belly. I had a new family now.&quot; That might make you feel a little bit of that sadness or longing, but also hopeful (more objective correlative).</p>
<p>The big issue with the idea of objective correlatives is that it assumes there is some concrete way of describing abstract ideas so that no matter who the reader/audience is it will resonate with them, which is absolute nonsense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, there are a lot of half satisfying answers here. Let me take a crack at it. I’m not an Eliot scholar, but I have thought about this a lot. </p>
<p>It has been suggested that the objective correlative is a tool used by the author to describe emotion in concrete terms, in order that the audience can experience that emotion more fully. Like saying, &quot;Jim's heart raced and his stomach seemed to be turning little summersaults&quot; is more concrete than simply saying, &quot;Jim felt excited.&quot;  This is *sort of* the right idea, but it is likely that Eliot didn't just make up a new term to describe something as straight forward as &quot;concrete description&quot; or &quot;sensory detail.&quot;</p>
<p>Let's see what Eliot himself says: &quot;<em>The only way of expressing emotion in the form of art is by finding an 'objective correlative'; in other words, a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events which shall be the formula of that particular emotion; such that when the external facts, which must terminate in sensory experience, are given, the emotion is immediately evoked.&quot;</em></p>
<p>First, notice the way Eliot doesn't want to be pinned down into a firm definition of what &quot;stuff&quot; might qualify as an objective correlative. It might be &quot;a set of objects,&quot; or it might be &quot;a situation,&quot; or it might be &quot;a chain of events.&quot; Presumably it could be other things in a work of literature too. So it is not always a visual image. It is not always character action. It could be many things.</p>
<p>Secondly, pay attention to the this bit: &quot;<em>which shall be the</em> <strong><em>formula</em></strong> <em>of that particular emotion.&quot;</em> In other words, conveying emotions in literature is hard, because emotions are so complex and ineffable. Simply <em>describing</em> the emotion will never <em>evoke</em> the emotion in the reader. So the writer must find another way. Eliot is suggesting that the writer must construct a kind of symbolic network of associations that, when constellated, evoke the desired emotion. In theory this could operate as straight forwardly as: graveyard setting + black clothes + flowers + weeping grandmas = emotions of grief. But in practice objective correlatives usually operate more opaquely. (And might even be more successful if their operations are somewhat invisible to the reader.)</p>
<p>An example is in order: Think about the ending of the movie Titanic, when Rose, now an old lady, throws that huge diamond back into the sea. If things have worked the way the movie makers intended, the appearance of that diamond on screen should evoke in you, the viewer, a powerful set of emotions. But why? The literal act of tossing a diamond into the ocean is not overtly emotional. And the diamond on its own is absent of emotion. It is emotional because the diamond has, over the course of the film, taken on all kinds of symbolic associations. First it represented Rose’s entrapment with Cal (that guy she was gonna marry). He had given it to her as a gift. Then she posed nude for jack while wearing it (a kind of rebellion against her class/emancipation from Cal, and a symbol of her love for Jack). And more: the diamond is blue and is called “The Heart of the Sea”--the sea is, of course, the site of all this drama, and the final resting place of her true love Jack, etc. (There are many other associations, I'm sure.)</p>
<p>So over the course of the film the diamond has taken on all these symbolic associations. None of them is all that strong or important individually. But when the movie makers skillfully triangulate them--set them just so--they evoke a powerful emotion in the viewer. They are &quot;<em>the formula of that particular emotion.&quot;</em> <strong>The diamond is an objective correlative!</strong></p>
<p>If all of this this feels a little like a magic spell, wherein if a combination of words is whispered correctly, under just the right moonlight, on such and such a date, a certain magic is performed, it is because that is how it is meant to feel to the reader. The reader is not necessarily meant to understand the workings of the objective correlative, they are just meant to be affected by it. This is why I hitch a little at definitions of the objective correlative that seek to characterize it simply as a kind of &quot;concrete description.&quot; Eliot is trying to find a term that describes the complex networks (or &quot;formula&quot;) of associations that give rise to the emotions we feel when reading good literature. (And inversely, he is trying to find a language for why other works of literature [<em>Hamlet</em>, he insists] fail in this regard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding of the objective correlative, after reading &quot;Hamlet and His Problems&quot; many years ago, is that it is the narrative/concrete counterpart that grounds/justifies the abstract/emotional part of the story. If you have a story in which a man has everything he could possibly want and need but you end on a note of his major depression, then you've missed any sort of objective correlative to that man's depression. The depression is just kind of random then. Another way to think of this is that there must be a subjective correlative to the concrete narration of the story. If a man goes through every terrible trial in a single day but at the end of it all just wonders what to make for dinner, then there seems to be a missing g subjective correlative to the stresses and trials in that man's life. He should be asking Why and gnashi g teeth, not going on with his life as though nothing happened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, it’s a way to represent an abstract feeling or emotion through a concrete image. The best example that I can think of comes from Eliot’s <em>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</em>. It’s something to the effect of “I wish I were a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the ocean floor.” In context, it’s meant to show the narrator’s social anxiety. He wishes he could crawl away into some deep dark crevasse like a crab.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
