In three or more dimensions, a random walk is not guaranteed to return to its starting point.</p>
<p>Another example is the cross product, which is only defined in three and seven dimensions. There is no two-dimensional cross product.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How many ways are there &quot;to do calculus&quot; on Euclidean space? For dimensions 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,... there is only one way. For four dimensions, there are infinitely many ways to do so. These are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_R4" target="_blank">Exotic R^(4)</a> spaces.</p>
<p>Somewhat relatedly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture" target="_blank">Poincare Conjecture</a> (proved by Perelman) says that if a 4D object &quot;looks like&quot; a sphere, then it is a sphere. This was relatively easy to prove in every dimension, except 4D. Proving it in four dimensions was a longstanding open problem and was made one of the Millennium Prize Problems, worth $1million for a solution (which Perelman turned down). Perelman had to invent radical new math to solve this problem in four dimensions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In physics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand%27s_theorem" target="_blank">stable orbits</a> between two bodies can only exist in three dimensions (where the force of gravity is proportional to the inverse of the square of distance).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In graph theory, graphs embedded into the (Euclidean) plane can always be properly colored by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem" target="_blank">four colors</a>. Graphs embedded into a line are always 2-colorable, but graphs embedded into 3 or more dimensions can require an arbitrarily large number of colors.</p>
<p>Perhaps related, only some graphs can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graph" target="_blank">drawn in the plane</a> without any edges crossing. Meanwhile any graph can be embedded into 3D space without any crossings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In geometry, in the 2D plane, there are infinitely many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon" target="_blank">regular polygons</a>. In 3D space, there are five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid" target="_blank">platonic solids</a>. In 4D, there are six <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_4-polytope" target="_blank">regular 4-polytypes</a> (a 4D analog). In all higher dimensions, there are always exactly three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polytope#Higher-dimensional_polytopes" target="_blank">regular polytypes</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Edit] One more: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_packing#Hypersphere_packing" target="_blank">hypersphere packing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissing_number_problem" target="_blank">kissing number</a> problems have known solutions only for 1, 2, 3, 4 (kissing number only), 8, and 24 dimensions. (Of course a solution for any number of dimensions exists, but it is not known yet.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation#Scalar_wave_equation_in_general_dimension_and_Kirchhoff's_formulae" target="_blank">wave equation</a> which is used to model (among other things) the propagation of sound waves behaves differently in odd and even numbers of dimensions. </p>
<p>In odd numbered dimensions (except 1d) the wave propagates radially from a point source with a sharp wave front only supported at one point. If there were a loud bang then the sound would travel toward you, you would hear it and then it would pass you and you would not hear it anymore. </p>
<p>In even numbered dimensions the wave propagates radially from a point source and once the wave front has caught up to you would would hear the sound. However, as the wave front passed you you could still hear the sound as the solution to the wave is supported everywhere behind the wave front. It would be noisy to live in 4 dimensions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
