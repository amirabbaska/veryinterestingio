		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Moving air has a lower pressure. The faster it moves, the lower its pressure. When you breathe what you are really doing is opening your lungs and creating a low pressure area inside your body. This means in still air, air rushes into your lungs to fill the area of low pressure. When the air outside is lower pressure it doesnt rush in as much, so it feels like breathing is harder. You don't breathe from your mouth or nose, you breathe from your abdomen. In low enough pressure air you <del>can</del> can't force air into your lungs, one of the reasons you need a mask at high altitude </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I disagree with all posts on here so far. While there will be pressure differentiation, it wont be significant enough to affect anything at the speeds I am assuming OP is talking about. </p>
<p>The reason you find it hard to breathe when there is wind blowing at your face is because you are experiencing a sensation that you very rarely feel. Its not that it is necessarily harder, it just requires more thought. You have to regulate the amount of air that comes in, rather than just blindly breathing in and out as you normally do. The air blowing at your face is goes in a lot easier when you breathe in, so your breathing muscle have more control and behave in a way that they never really do. The feeling that you get when wind is blowing in your face and you start to breathe is very short lived and goes away once your body becomes accustom to it.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU4SDDNXuUA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU4SDDNXuUA</a>  This video shows that we have absolutely no problem breathing when high speed wind is blowing into our face, pressure differentiation do not have much affect at all. You would be ripped apart by the wind much sooner than you would not be able to breathe.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air pressure.</p>
<p>Our lungs inhale by creating a lower air pressure inside your lungs than the atmospheric pressure (15psi).   So when the wind blows, and hard enough, the pressure drops cause your breathing to be difficult.    Think like the movies where a hole in a space ship sucks everything out into space, same theory, space psi lower than psi in the ship, except, you wouldn't be sucked through a small crack, unless the difference in pressure is somthing like 100s to 1000s  psi, or lbs of pressure.</p>
<p>That's why low pressure storms tend to have high winds, air swirling from places of high pressure to low pressure.    There is a video of a crab walking on the ocean floor, super high pressure, along a pipe that has a crack in it, the pipe is pressurized to low pressure, the crab sucked through, because the ocean floor has massive pressure and the pipe was likely at atmospheric pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>If I understand correctly, this compensates for the wind/air pressure, so they can still breathe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I literally cannot breathe when there's strong wind. Like, my throat just closes up and I can't breathe in or out. It feels like I'm &quot;underwater&quot; in a way. Almost lost consciousness during a skydive and my instructor told me he had never experienced anything like that before. Really strange. Is that the same kind of thing you are experiencing? Or do the other answers fit your experience better? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
