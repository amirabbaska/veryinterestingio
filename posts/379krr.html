		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grad student in Forestry here. While the answer /u/murphyw_xyzzy has some truth to it, it isn't quite accurate.</p>
<p>First, to say that forests are generally about the same age due to fire or logging isn't completely correct. While stand replacing fire is a cause of even-aged stands like with lodgepole pine (<em>Pinus contorta</em>), many trees have built up resistance to these types of fires (like Douglas-fir, <em>Pseudotsuga menziesii</em>) which will only burn through the understory, leaving mature trees intact. These types of forest stands are typically found at lower elevations (which tend to be drier than mountain tops).</p>
<p>What actually happens in many of these forest stands is referred to as &quot;gap dynamics.&quot; This means that a tall, mature tree will die due to disease/rot, wind, or other cause, leaving an opening in the forest canopy allowing sunlight to reach the forest floor. Certain &quot;pioneer&quot; species take advantage of this and try to grow as tall as possible in the little time they have before the canopy closes again.</p>
<p>In forests of high elevation mountain ranges, it is typically too cold and moist for fires to take off, this is why it is not quite accurate to say it is because of fire (at least in general terms). As for logging, depending on the terrain, mountain tops (were talking more the Rocky Mountains as opposed to the &quot;mountains&quot; of the eastern US) are incredibly difficult (or costly) to log and so that wouldn't quite be accurate either. All that being said, the bigger idea of murphyw's answer is correct: trees in the same local area are likely to be close in age, no matter the cause.</p>
<p>Another part of the answer lies in the fact that it just appears that they are all the same height from a distance. It can be hard to see exactly where one individual tree's canopy starts and another ends. Even if there are differences of a few feet or more, unless you were flying (hovering, really) directly overhead, it would be difficult to make out the true differences in height.</p>
<p>Another part, alluded to above and by murphyw, lies in the fact that when there is an opening in the canopy, trees will indeed race to get as big as possible (usually upward instead of outward) and slow their growth once they have reached the point when they are sure to outcompete their neighbors for sunlight, nutrients, or water. Once a gap (from disease, wind, fire, logging, or any other effect) begins to fill and the canopy closes, trees at that height don't need to compete vertically anymore. At that point, they likely have enough coverage at the top (as well as the light that does filter through the canopy) to not need to grow any bigger. Maintaining their individual canopies will give them the sunlight they need to thrive.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR: Partially because of incorrect visual perception, partially because trees in the same area do tend to be of similar age, partially because at a certain height it isn't worth the energy to continue to grow taller, and partially because when the canopy closes, trees at that height don't need to grow taller, the race is over.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally forests are trees of about the same age. Fire or logging. </p>
<p>In old growth, where the trees are not generally all the same age or type, there's still strong pressure against being 'the tallest'. Lightening and wind. There is also pressure against being the shortest, no access to light. So they all end up generally about the same height. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought that your question was more about the tree line. Its an amazing thing to hike through - less than 50m you go from lush forest to open rocky alpine. Especially interesting when your path vias above and below it.  </p>
<p>Now that, is an interesting thing, due mainly I feel to temperature and icing conditions: the outermost trees must be strong to face it alone on one side. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the answer here is that trees regardless of type don't just grow however they like regardless of their environment.  Depending on the situation they will respond in different ways.  If they're getting very little sun they will respond by getting as tall as they can as quickly as they can.  If they are getting a lot of sun then they'll slow down their vertical growth and focus on spreading out to get as much of the sun they can and to reinforce the strength of their trunk.  For this reason alone most trees regardless of type will tend to cluster in size.  It's simply not that advantageous to be significantly taller than everyone else.</p>
<p>Secondly, getting taller is costly and it gets more costly the taller you get.  Here we're talking about hard physical limits that all species have to deal with.  There is the trouble of the strength of the trunk and it's ability to deal with storms.  The increase in thickness at the base required starts to accelerate the taller it gets.  Another maybe more significant problem is water.  Every cell in every leaf is connected through a single pipe to a cell in the roots.  Each cell must literally suck the water up from the roots.  This takes energy and is tough to do.  So every inch of height is harder to achieve and less efficient than the last.  </p>
<p>There is in fact a real hard limit to how tall a tree can get and it depends on the thickness of the capillary tubes connecting the leaf cells to the root cells.  The smaller the tube the taller the tree can get.  The problem is that at a certain point the weight of that column of water gets so great that a vacuum bubble called cavitation starts at which point the column collapses and the cell can no longer get any water and it dies.  The capillary effect which depends on the width of the capillary tube uses the surface tension of water to help extend the height to which this column of water can raise before it cavitates but it can't extend it indefinitely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After seeing most of the answers talking about age of the forest I can say that's only part of the story. The main reason is trees will only grow taller if there will be a net  energy gain for the future. If 1 tree grows taller it gets the advantage of being the tallest around but only before the others grow to catch up to it. The other tress will have to grow to &quot;even the playing field&quot;. There comes a point where the trees don't get enough of an advantage to make it worth growing. That point is nearly the same with all of the trees. Veratisim
Veratasium did a video on this at work and I'll try and find it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
