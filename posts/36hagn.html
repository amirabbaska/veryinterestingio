		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally my degree (Molecular Genetics) can be useful! </p>
<p>It's all about protein gradients. It's part of why life is mostly symmetrical or radial. You have a point of origin, let's say a shoulder area, producing a particular protein during development. As the cells near it replicate to form an arm, the protein made at the origin spreads into them. The further the cells are from the origin, the less protein they have. Eventually, the cells are far enough away that the lack of that protein signals that the new cells being formed should be hand cells. Those hand cells then function as a new point of origin for a different protein radiating outward, which when present on its own forms finger cells and when mixed with the original shoulder protein forms wrist cells. At about a 50/50 mix of hand/shoulder proteins, elbow cells form. </p>
<p>This is a very simplified explanation, as the truth involves the interaction of countless protein gradients and combinations from tons of origin points, but it's the general way that your body forms and differentiates. </p>
<p>So the cells on the tip of your nose are far enough from the point where your nose meets your face and have little enough of one or, more likely, five thousand nose proteins that they know they should be tip of nose cells as opposed to anything else. They're obviously not getting &quot;please become feet&quot; proteins because the origin cells for those are much too far away. </p>
<p>Hope that helps. </p>
<p>[Edit]: Thanks for the gold! And thank all of you for such a friendly response. I'm glad you guys found my explanation so interesting. </p>
<p>If you haven't looked yet, check out some of the wall-of-text comments below. Other users have added a ton of great information to this conversation. Specifically in regards to extracellular matrices, asymmetric cell division, and protein sinks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After development, which a lot of the really good answers are focused on, your cells know to <em>stay</em> the correct type of cell by modifying their genomes to only express the right subset of genes in the right dosage at the right time. This is possible because the genome is more than just its constituent DNA - it's wrapped up in proteins called histones, which can be chemically modified to control which DNA can be accessed and when. Your DNA itself can also be modified - methylation of certain sequences of DNA (CpG dinucleotides most prominently) is known to suppress gene expression.</p>
<p>So it turns out the way your chromatin (the DNA + histones) is wrapped up and 3-dimensionally organized dictates which genes are expressed when and in what cell types.</p>
<p>An important point to add is that epigenetics/epigenomics and chromatin biology are VERY active fields of study. Beyond what I've stated here, there's not a whole lot accepted as absolute fact; for example, how the histones are modified (by what proteins, under what conditions, etc) and why that serves to open up DNA is still under investigation. As is why certain cells are more or less amenable to being &quot;reprogrammed&quot; as different cell types, or how it even happens. Every answer in biology generates 3 more questions!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the responses here describe developmentally how a cell knows what kind of cell it should turn into, and they're excellent responses.  I will add one thing - all somatic cells in your body have the exact same genes, so cellular identity is determined epigenetically by chemical modifications to the chromatin that turn certain genes on and other genes off.  So extracellular signal gradients tell the cell what it should be, and it then establishes its identity via epigenetic mechanisms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another thought: stem cells undergo unique methylation patterns that 'code' them to be used in different areas throughout the body. This is one of the major problems with a pure DNA view. Methylation of DNA as well as methylation and acetylation of histones can affect gene expression. I know this is maybe a little off topic, but I hope it helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many correct ways to answer this question -<a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/seminars/2014/secret-life-rna/" target="_blank"> here's a lecture</a> I gave that explains it simply in terms of RNA (10:00 through 24:00). The lecture is for Harvard Science In The News, it is meant to be easily understandable by general audiences.</p>
<p>&quot;DNA contains the information your cells need to perform their functions but if every cell in your body contains identical DNA, how can one cell become a blood cell, another a muscle cell, and even another a brain cell?! The answer lies in RNA, the dynamic messenger of DNAâ€™s information.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
