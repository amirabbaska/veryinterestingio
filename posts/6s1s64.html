		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the tests aren't perfect, can't detect some drugs/treatments, and are sometimes pre-announced.</p>
<p>One of the 'drugs' Armstrong used was called 'blood doping' or erythrocyte supplementation. He took perfectly matched donor red blood cells and injected them until he had 2.2 times the normal human number of red blood cells. (which gave him massive endurance)</p>
<p>2.2X regular human RBCs is the limit imposed by the international doping agency and Olympics, because 2.2X is the maximum amount of red blood cells detected in an un-doped natural human. Which is to say that some people naturally have 2.2X RBCs and they are super-men for endurance sports....so it's common practice to bring your level up by doping so you can compete with these supermen. Otherwise you don't stand a chance.</p>
<p>Anyway, RBC supplementation is virtually impossible to detect as what you are injecting are perfectly natural normal red blood cells. You can't even use genetic testing - often they'll donate their own blood when they don't need it, collect the RBCs, then re-inject it when it's competition or training time.</p>
<p>Also there are rules as to how many times in a season you can be tested for drugs. Once you've hit that limit you can dope as much as you want until the end of the season and clean up in time for the next season.</p>
<p>And they are coming out with new drugs all the time that may not be detectable by existing tests.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
