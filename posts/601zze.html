		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not well-known because we as Western countries wrote a history that shoehorned the China-Japan-Pacific conflict into the European-centered war.  That's not necessarily wrong: the Japanese did attack European and American territories, and they did that (ultimately) because of their conflict in China.  These things are absolutely connected.  But the idea that China was a nation like Western nations, and that it had a &quot;role&quot; in the war like France or New Zealand is not quite accurate.  China was horribly complicated in the 1930s.</p>
<p>So in China the Second World War has to be discussed in the context of their history.  Most countries in the war operated together.  We call the winning side &quot;the Allies&quot; because- with a few serious exceptions- they collaborated closely.  China had the benefit of aid from the Soviets and Americans, but they did not have the ability to project power into other theaters or provide men or material in return.  They didn't cooperate internally, much less with other governments on other continents.</p>
<p>China didn't even have a single government: it was a quilt of warlord territories, most of which had been assembled together by Jiang Jieshi (Chang Kai-Shek) into Kuomintang (Nationalist) territory like a syndicate.  The Communists under Mao Zedong controlled roughly one province.  Other warlords and potentates controlled their own provinces and regions, including places that still give the Chinese government a headache, like Tibet and Xinjiang out west.  The efforts each government made differed too, with the Communists putting up remarkable resistance when they faced off against the Japanese, and the Nationalists losing ground continuously for eight years.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, it was not realistic to expect the Chinese to do much outside of China.  Their place in the history of the war is crucial, but the story that we tell- about industrial superpowers, an engineering arms race, intercontinental strategy, and the wills of mad men- doesn't really fit with the events in China.</p>
<p>Source: wrote thesis on China in the 1930s, lived in China for several years.</p>
<p>For my pet theory: the conflict with Japan should be put in the context of Chinese history broadly, under the idea that China has a cultural center (including places like Sichuan, Shanghai, and Bejiing) and a cultural border (including places like Japan, Manchuria, Vietnam, and Tibet).  Every few centuries one of the border countries rides in and tries to take over the center.  The Mongols and Manchus pulled it off.  The Japanese tried but failed.</p>
<p>That theory will probably not hold water, but I'd like to try it out on some Japanese people anyway.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p><strong>It’s a good reason to remember that on its own. I would say that one of the single facts, which is worth remembering if you want to annoy an official in the Chinese Communist Party, is to remind them that the reason, the primary reason, that China today has a seat in the permanent five on the United Nations Security Council, the top table of global diplomacy, is not because of anything that Chairman Mao did. It was because of the wartime efforts of Chiang Kai-shek, and essentially as a direct result of China’s involvement on the Allied side in World War II.</strong></p>
<p>China now finds itself — more than 65, 70 years nearly after the end of World War II — as the only non-European, non-white power to sit at that top table. So these things do have a great deal of significance today.</p>
<p><strong>When were they forgotten? Put very simply, China’s wartime experience, suffering, and contribution to the Allied cause fell into a hole created by the Cold War. Neither side had an interest in recalling what China did.</strong></p>
<p>On the Chinese side, after 1949 when the civil war was over, the Nationalists had been exiled to Taiwan, and Mao was victorious on the mainland, you had essentially a virgin history in the mainland of China — that the only people who had made a contribution to fighting and defeating the Japanese were the Chinese communists.
The contribution that had actually been made by the much larger Nationalist army was essentially either dismissed or wiped out of the official history that was taught in China itself. So there’s sort of an historical black hole there.</p>
<p>But we can’t put any of the responsibility by any means on the Chinese communists on the mainland. You have to remember that in the West, we very quickly forgot about that wartime contribution as well. The reason is that Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese wartime leader, was essentially seen as a sort of embarrassment — this Cold War relic remaining on Taiwan, looking more and more irrelevant year by year, associated with incompetence and corruption, with a whole variety of qualities that the West didn’t find very attractive.</p>
<p>But what was forgotten was the leader, through a whole swath of decisions, many of them very problematic and difficult, had nonetheless kept China in the war against Japan. First of all, on his own for about four and half years, and then of course as part of the very difficult alliance with the West for another four years after that.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the United States, it's because the war on Germany took precedence, so we learn more about the Western Front, briefly touch on the Soviet Union and the Eastern Front, and our experience with the other side of the world is mainly limited to the Pacific War with Japan.  China's not covered because, to be honest, the vast majority of our servicemen were deployed elsewhere.  All we ever hear about from the Chinese Theater of Operations is the Flying Tigers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After the war,  our government was worried that Japan would become communist like Russia and China.   A lot if the atrocities committed by Japan weren't made public since our politicians wanted to rebuild and make an ally of them.  They wanted a presence in the region.  There was really no way to talk about China without talking about what the Japanese did there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the simple reasons is because we call it the &quot;Pacific War&quot; on the eastern front. Where and when did it start? Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941. This entirely takes out the starting point in which Japan began hostilities against China, September 18, 1931 during the Mukden Incident. An entire decade had passed before the USA joined the eastern front, but we don't even bother to mention it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
