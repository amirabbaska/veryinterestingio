		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For starvation, you first run out of carbohydrates (sugars) as an energy source, then you run out of lipids (fat) as an energy source, and finally your body starts breaking down proteins for energy. Since proteins are essential to all your cellular function, this means that your body starts breaking down your organs, starting with muscles. As parts of your vital organs are broken down, you die, usually from heart failure.</p>
<p>For dehydration, you end up with an electrolyte imbalance in your blood, which leads to seizures and heart failure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In either case, the ultimate cause of death is an electrolyte imbalance. I'm on mobile so can't go in depth, but <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte#Physiological_importance" target="_blank">the wiki page</a> has a pretty good explanation. Basically many processes in our body depend on keeping an electron potential across cell membranes. This potential is maintained by the metabolic process. In the case of starvation, there is no longer sufficient energy in the form of glucose or ketones to maintain the electron potential. In the case of dehydration, the composition of the fluid outside the cell prevents the proper concentration of electrolytes for the electron potential to form. Usually what kills you is the heart muscle can't contact.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is how one of the drugs used in lethal injection works too. Injecting potassium chloride dumps so much potassium ions in the blood the heart can no longer function because the gradient of potassium between inside and outside the cell gets reversed.         </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As you starve your major organs begin pulling nutrients out of your body by breaking down fat tissue first, then muscle. Once your body reaches the point of nothing left to give, your organs begin shutting down and inevitably your heart will stop.</p>
<p>Although, dehydration can kill you faster than starvation. </p>
<p>If you're in a situation where you have plenty of food but no water, assuming it isn't soup. As your body becomes more dehydrated it will pull as much as it can from the rest of the body to keep the the vital organs functioning. This will cause you to become severely constipated.</p>
<p>Without being able to have a bowel movement, eventually your kidneys, liver and pancreas will shut down. At this point you'll be in tremendous discomfort and pain as it becomes more and more difficult to breathe. Or, your heart simply isn't strong enough to get this far and you've suffered a heart attack or heart failure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To summarize the very accurate, but somewhat wordy resposes: with hunger you die because your body metabolized its self, including organs, which in turn causes organ failure. With thirst, your brain and organs start to fail due to extreams in the blood system due to lack of water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
