		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello, immigrant here (well, American citizen now).</p>
<p>When we arrived to US, me, my sister, mother, father, 4 of us, right as we landed in DC in late 1990s, we were $2700 in debt to US government for our plane tickets.  Our whole wealth included roughly $40 in cash, and whatever cloth we were allowed to bring.</p>
<p>We were placed in an apartment building in NW DC, our rent was $650 and paid for for the first 2 months by whatever agency/organization oversaw our immigration.  We were enrolled in foodstamps program for 3 months, I don't recall how much, but I know we had to be careful and stretch it out (we ate a lot of hot dogs...fucking hot dogs, I hate hot dogs now).  We had to start paying back the airplane tickets within 6 months as well.</p>
<p>Me and my sister were both high-school aged, and you can't buy school supplies with food stamps, so that was kind of shitty, but we got some help from the school.  Dad got a job as a dishwasher at a hotel within a month, mom followed soon as a housekeeper at a different place.  Our plane tickets were paid off within a year, and the rest is history.</p>
<p>US government spent 3 months worth of food stamps on 4 of us, and that's all, not to mention the debt we had to pay to US government.  We pretty much paid $2700 to have a privilege of being homeless in this country, and we were/are grateful.  </p>
<p>This is why it's easier to take in 10K refugees than it is to house the homeless.  There seems to be an illusion that immigrants are given massive wealth and money and support to come to the US.  Sure the social services are available to us as well, as they are to anybody else, but that's just that, like anybody else, no special treatment, and that's wonderful in more ways than one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The state-funded resettlement agencies are going to assist them in finding housing and work for 90 days. If they have family, they'll be flown into the nearest resettlement center. After that, AFAIK, they receive no special treatment, but are free to get the same support from Health and Human Services that is already available to the homeless and others in need.</p>
<p>The fact that the US gov't gets to determine where they go might be a factor too. Homeless are not exactly proportionally spread out across the US, and cities/states can get a lot of flak for trying to move their homeless elsewhere, which wouldn't be an issue for the federal gov't. They can just drop refugees in smallish towns or less expensive cities that are prepared to take them.</p>
<p>Also a lot of long-term homeless, veterans or otherwise, are mentally ill. This may mean that they are unable/unwilling to ask for help, or that the shelters and such are unequipped to provide it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplistically, it's not easy, and it's not easier.  To the greater point, the current administration has made tremendous advances in housing homeless vets.  I live in Houston, and as part of the Obama administration initiative we have effectively ended veteran homelessness in our city.  We can't <em>force</em> anyone to come in off the streets, but any willing vet in Houston can be placed in housing virtually overnight.  </p>
<p>Entering the US as a refugee is the most difficult, most heavily screened/scrutinized method of entry.  On average it takes approximately 3 years to obtain this status legally.  Last year the US made it possible for refugee children at the US/Mexico border eligibile for refugee status, and a year later the number that we have fully processed is zero. </p>
<p>Regarding terrorism, it would be much more expedient for someone to enter the US posing as a student, tourist, or businessperson.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If homelessness could be solved by giving people homes we would have done it already.</p>
<p>The problem is that the homeless are homeless for a reason (and I am NOT saying they deserve it).  If I took you today, took away your home, your money, everything you own and dropped you naked on the streets of Orlando within a year you would have a place, a job, and food in the fridge.  The difference with the homeless is that there are generally significant addiction / mental health issues (or personality issues bordering on mental health) that prevent them from a) getting the help they need b) making good use of the help they get, and/or c) keeping/forming the kinds of relationships they need to maintain a job.</p>
<p>If we took all the homeless and put them in a house, and gave them an easy job, half of them would be back on the street within a few months.</p>
<p>What the homeless need is a home, a job, AND serious psycological assistance together with social workers and support people.  Even then it is going to be a craps shoot as to whether they can recover as our medical skill with mental health issues is very limited.  But that is really the difference.  It costs X to house, feed, and cloth someone, it costs 10 times X to also provide that person intense psycological, medical, and social intervention.</p>
<p>As one other side note...  After some really horrible treatment we stopped forcing people to receive psychological treatements.  That was a social policy decision that was 100% understandable and may or may not have been right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
