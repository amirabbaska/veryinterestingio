<p>Enceladus is much smaller than Earth and therefore has far weaker gravity, which would correlate with smaller pressure at a given altitude. However, its ocean seems to occupy a larger percentage of the planet's volume compared to Earth's, in addition to being buried under a thick sheet of ice.</p>
<p>Given Enceladus' size, gravity, and nature of it's sub-surface ocean, what would its water pressure ranges be? Could a human swim in it without a pressure suit? Could a submarine reach any depth?</p>
<p>Bonus question is to estimate the temperature range of the ocean. Since it's liquid, it'd have to be above zero celsius unless it's highly saline. Is there expected geothermal or tidal friction heating? How warm would it be purely from solar exposure, or radiation coming from Saturn?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can calculate this with the equation:</p>
<p>pressure=density <em> force of gravity </em> height. </p>
<p>This gives you the pressure of the fluid column above you, but this works pretty well for very large amounts of solids. We are assuming that gravity doesn't change much over that distance, I suspect it might since Enceladus is so small. Wikipedia says that Enceladus has 30-40 km of ice and has a surface gravity of . Pushing this all through <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=30+km+*1%25+earth+gravity*density+ice" target="_blank">Wolfram Alpha</a> gives a &quot;sea level&quot; pressure of 3.11-4.15 Megapascals. This is equivalent to being 320-420m(1000-1300 ft) underwater on Earth. That's about as far as any SCUBA diver has ever gone, but it has been done. The world record took 12 minutes to descend, but 14 hours decompressing on the way up. Deeper dives can be made, but you start needing a rigid pressure suit. It's also close to the pressure limit for military style submarines made of steel, but titanium submarines have gone to 10 MPa. Submersibles made for extreme deep sea diving definitely could. </p>
<p>The temperature is unknown but depending on how much ammonia is mixed in, it's anywhere from somewhere above a brisk -3 C that you could dip in for a minute or two without dying, or a -103 C ammonia water slurry. What we do know is that it is <em>deep</em>. 20-30 km(18 miles) deep. That's three and a half Marianas Trenches or Mount Everests. The water pressure down there (again, assuming the equation holds) is <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=40+km+*enceladus+gravity*density+ice%2B30+km+*enceladus+gravuty*density+water" target="_blank">about 7.5MPa</a>, within the limit of some submarines and diving hardsuits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few things about the Earth's oceans: its main sources of energy are wind, the sun, tides and fish (funny, right?). Enceladus' ocean, if completely covered by ice, gets no energy directly from the sun or any kind of light, but must get massive forcings from ice movements above (equivalent to wind forcings here on Earth) and tides from Saturn's gravitational pull. Geothermal could be a large source of energy too, although so far we have no way of knowing.</p>
<p>Now, we usually talk about sea pressure in pneumatic, or relative terms, meaning that we take pressure at the sea surface to be zero and then vertically integrate density times gravity to estimate pressure at any given depth. We do that because humans are &quot;tuned&quot; to live at sea level, or absolute pressure 1 atm = 1010 hPa, so we define that as zero to measure deviations from atmospheric pressure. However, estimating absolute pressure would require integrating the density of our entire atmosphere. </p>
<p>If you wanted to do the same for an ocean that's buried under miles of ice, then you would have to take into account the weight of all the ice above a given point. Glacial ice is about 0.92 times as dense as water, so being under 1 km of ice is equivalent to having 920 meters of water above you. We know very little about these oceans, and since gravity is not the same in Enceladus as it is on Earth, I can't say for sure, but I'm pretty confident that no human could swim there. Considering that ice sheets in Greenland are up to 4 km thick, glaciers in Enceladus must be huge everywhere, creating gargantuesque pressures.</p>
<p>Given the mass of Saturn, maybe it could create tides strong enough to drastically reduce bottom sea pressure, as it 'lifts' water and ice upwards. Also, vertical shear during these tides must be a really important source of turbulent kinetic energy and thus provide heat to these oceans. So that's the only way I think humans could, at least momentarily, exist in an ocean like that.</p>
<p>This is all a theoretical construction, and the reality might be different, but if we could make a cruise to explore these seas for the first time, that's what we would base our experiments on before knowing any better. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something I can weigh in on as I'm looking at Enceladus as part of my PhD. </p>
<p>Basically it depends on which model you use. Currently the thinking is that there is a localised subsurface ocean around the southern pole that probably forms a lens shape with the thick part of the lens  only 5-10km beneath the South Polar Terrain/Tiger Stripes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0063" target="_blank">1</a>. And the deepest part being 50-60km beneath the ice shell <a href="https://twitter.com/NatureAstronomy/status/849212317552259073/photo/1" target="_blank">So for visual purposes</a>.</p>
<p>Now depending on the densities and thicknesses you use for the ice and liquid and the rocky silicate core you will get various values.</p>
<p>With varying thicknesses the sea floor pressure will be anywhere between 28 and 45 bar or 2.8-4.5Mpa <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11084-015-9475-9" target="_blank">2</a>. . Which is equivalent to 250-450m below sea level on Earth. This pressure is entirely habitable by known barophiles (pressure loving organisms!) which have been known to survive up to 50Mpa and plenty of multicellular organisms live happily below that depth in our oceans (Hadal Snailfish have been found at 8145m!) </p>
<p>The Pressure within a porous silicate core is likely to only be around 30Mpa which seems pretty tame too<img src="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001910351500250X" alt="3" />. </p>
<p>What we can say is that pressure isn't going to be a problem for biology under Enceladus type conditions.</p>
<p>Now yes this new evidence suggests that there is hydrothermal activity and geochemical energy available but to form multicellular organisms you need a fair bit more energy - which may be available but at the moment this is only a theory.</p>
<p>So for temperature this gets fairly complicated. The temperature will depend on: the heat source - which may be down to tidal heating from Enceladus' resonance orbits, or from a possibly warm core thats lasted since formation; The chemistry and thickness of the ocean/shell - If its a relatively low salinity NaCl-H2O system or whether there is ammonia involved; And finally the amount of heat that is being stored/lost.</p>
<p>Geochemical evidence from the plume suggests the ocean is warm. Silica nanoparticles have been found in the E ring <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0703/ering_cassini_big.jpg" target="_blank">image</a> which is maintained by Enceladus' activity. These nanoparticles can only form in alkaline high temperature environments 323K-373K (50C-90C/122-194F)<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v519/n7542/full/nature14262.html" target="_blank">4</a>  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9604" target="_blank">5</a>. Other evidence such as radiation around the tiger stripes shows that the temperature of the vent systems are 30K warmer than the surroundings <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0063" target="_blank">1</a>.
Other simulations suggest the core could be anywhere from 20-150C <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103514006459" target="_blank">6</a>.
The chemistry of the ocean matters too, if there are significant concentration of ammonia salts, the melting point may be depressed up to 16K at 0.1%wt NH3 so there may be liquid but it may be below freezing temperature of pure water.</p>
<p>The combination of geochemical and geophysical data points to the ocean being warm i.e. above the freezing point of pure water, whether its been warm for its entire history or whether this activity is recent is another question.</p>
<p>In important distinction should be made between habitable and inhabited. Maybe this ocean is habitable but uninhabited and therefore a pristine niche that could be invaded by Earth species.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, this is cool and maybe the idea of a Biosphere doesn't stop at the stratosphere, but extends to the outer reaches of the solar system!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Anyway this is a fascinating question. I'd want to posit the same one for Europa of Jupiter. </p>
<p>A few unknowns would make these calculations difficult. The amount of geothermal activity at the ocean floor, and the thickness and uniform distribution of ice above. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
