		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A dozen people already responded to this but I'm gonna anyway because I'm a know-it-all and pretty bored at the moment (and the rest of reddit sucks today). I'm gonna actually try to explain this using references from The Office:</p>
<p><strong>Ponzi Scheme</strong>:  A Ponzi scheme is when you ask someone for an investment and promise a huge or quick return on investment, then deliver on it by promising someone <em>else</em> the same thing and paying off the first person with someone else's investment.</p>
<p>Example: At lunch time, Dwight says to Ryan &quot;If you give me your pudding, I'll give you two puddings tomorrow.&quot; Ryan agrees, and gives Dwight his pudding. Dwight then goes to Phyllis and Stanley and says the same thing. They both agree. Now Dwight has 3 pudding packs, eats one, then the next day gives the other two from Phyllis and Stanley to Ryan to follow through on his promise. Ecstatic about his return on investment, Ryan is more than happy to give Dwight even more pudding containers. He gives Dwight 5, Dwight eats one and gives the other four to Phyllis and Stanley as a return on his promises to <em>them.</em> They too are happy with the return on investment, and invest even more pudding packs in the hopes of doubling their investments. In order to sustain this, Dwight needs to continuously get more people to give him their pudding to pay off his debts to others while simultaneously taking a pack for himself each time. </p>
<p><strong>Pyramid Scheme</strong>: The classic red flag of a Pyramid scheme is when someone who is looking to &quot;hire you&quot; tells you you need to &quot;invest in your future&quot; or that you have to &quot;spend money to make money.&quot; The days of a recruitment pyramid scheme are falling to the past because people have caught on to the premise of basically investing in nothing. So nowadays to keep it legal, Pyramid schemes have to offer some kind of tangible thing which is usually something pretty petty or worthless / has marginal value. Basically what this is is a system where one person at the top recruits a bunch of people who invest in something and they only see a return by getting more people to invest in it through them. The closer to the top of a pyramid someone is /the more people you have beneath you, the more money you make.</p>
<p>Example: Phil drives a corvette, and Michael wants to know the secret to Phil's success. Phil tells Michael he's made a fortune selling calling cards, tells him they are the wave of the future and that they sell themselves. He tells Michael that the <em>real</em> secret, though, is to buy a bunch of calling cards and then sell them to other people who can then sell them for him. Makes complete business sense, right? After all, you're just being a middle man. That's how Michael justifies his investment in calling cards; the only catch is that Phil wants Michael to cover the full costs of the calling cards that Michael purchases from him, and then Phil gets a percentage of Michael's profits from what he sells. In order to make money back, the <em>quickest</em> way isn't to actually sell the calling cards but to recruit Ryan, Jim, Toby and Stanley to buy them in large quantities <em>from him</em> with the intention of making a fortune selling them themselves after making a large initial investment, with Michael also taking a percentage of their profits and as a result Phil making a percentage of their profits transitively. The higher up you are on this pyramid, the more you are making off of the people beneath you. Regardless of whether or not they actually sell any calling cards, the &quot;initial investment&quot; on the part of the recruit/salesman is where the people higher up in the pyramid really make money.</p>
<p><strong>Matrix Scheme</strong>: This is when you pay a small amount to be on a list of people who could win something significantly more valuable than your initial investment. The more contributions you make, the higher your odds become of being the person who wins the larger prize.</p>
<p>Example: Dwight, being the scheming assistant to the regional manager that he is, has some shady ways of being the best salesman at the office. His secret is the matrix scheme. He calls clients who are interested in getting a brand new Sabre printer. Unfortunately for clients, Dwight knows that he can make more money profiting off of hope than profiting off of printer sales. Dwight tells his client that if they pay twice as much for printer <em>paper</em>, they will be placed on an exclusive list of people who can receive a FREE Sabre printer. Can you hear him saying &quot;What if I told you you could receive a FREE Sabre printer just by buying more paper?&quot; But there's a catch: there are about 20 clients ahead of them on that list. The more orders of overpriced paper they place through Dwight, the closer to the top of the list they get. Eventually one of the clients receives a free printer, meanwhile Dwight has sold so much paper at such a high profit margin that the cost of that free printer is insignificant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Ponzi:</strong> This key idea is the company is lying to investors about the value of its assets and paying out new investors' principal while pretending it's the old investors' profits. </p>
<p>You raise $100 from 10 people and promise them 100% per year return. You start with $1000. After a year you tell people you have $2000 but you don't, you still only have $1000. </p>
<p>Two investors want out so you give them $200 each because if you refuse, you're busted. So you have 8 investors and $600, but you're telling them you have $1600. You have to keep recruiting new investors or you'll run out of money.</p>
<p>Sometimes investments start out with good intentions but turn into Ponzis when they try to cover up losses.</p>
<p><strong>Pyramid:</strong> You tell people up front that you're going to take their money, and they get paid by recruiting new people to join. These lower recruits pass money to the person who recruited them and to you, say up to 3 levels. Your sales pitch is that in return for one fee, the recruit gets a fee from the 10 people he recruits, the 10*10 people they recruit, and the 10*10*10 people <em>they</em> recruit.</p>
<p>These inevitably collapse because you can't keep finding exponentially more suckers. MLMs are basically a pyramid scheme with the addition of a real product being sold instead of just &quot;memberships&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Matrix:</strong> You buy some overpriced thing and get put on a list for a prize. For every 10 people who buy in, the person at the top of the list gets the prize end everyone else moves up one spot. So no matter how many people buy in, 90% don't get the prize.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ponzi schemes involve lying to investors. The other two are open about how they work but the vast majority of participants are guaranteed to lose money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h1>Ponzi Scheme</h1>
<p>You get asked to invest cash in an investment promising huge returns (and a fee paid to an advisor).  The investment never generates returns, you're paid from the money coming in from new people investing in the &quot;Scheme&quot;.  They work until it collapses on itself.  If I invest $10,000 with a promise of it returning $1,000 a month, that $1,000 comes from other people's $10,000 and so on until it collapses.  These are <strong>always illegal</strong></p>
<h1>Pyramid Scheme</h1>
<p>There is a product behind the scenes.  You can sell the product profiting pennies, or recruit new <em>salespeople</em> and get a huge cut. Take <em>It works.</em>  You buy a starter pack which includes a buy in fee, and that fee is given to who recruited you.  I could sell the dream of &quot;being your own boss&quot; to 10 people, and from each one I would get a cut of their buy in fee.</p>
<h1>Matrix Scheme</h1>
<p>Think bigger and better.  You buy a bunch of DVD's overpriced for $50.  Are told if you get 20 people to buy these DVD's, you'll be put on a list for a flat screen TV.  However math shows if the entire world were to join, 90% of the people would never get the better product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pyramid Schemes involve participants recruiting new participants for a fraction of the profit that &quot;flows upwards&quot;.  Take a hypothetical scheme called &quot;Aeroplane&quot;  where participants &quot;get on the aeroplane&quot; by paying $2000 upon joining.  Their $2000 is paid to the person who recruits them who then takes a cut (how much depends on their &quot;seat number&quot; on the &quot;Aeroplane&quot;) and passes what's left of the $2000 up to the person who recruited them.  &quot;Aeroplane&quot; is an n-ary tree that eventually exhausts the entire population of people who can be recruited, leaving a substantial proportion of the recruited population unable to recoup their $2000 &quot;investment&quot; while simultaneously sending the bulk of the money collected to the root of the tree. </p>
<p>Ponzi schemes use money collected from new &quot;investors&quot; to pay old &quot;investors&quot; who wish to cash out while lying to everyone about how much of a return &quot;investor&quot; money is generating (the idea that a high rate of return will prevent the majority of &quot;investors&quot; from cashing out).  Ponzi schemes collapse by a single mechanism:  more old &quot;investors&quot; cash out than can be supported by new &quot;investors&quot; contributing.  Ponzi schemes are characterized by a guaranteed rate of return higher than a central monetary system's prime borrowing rate.  It can sometimes take decades before &quot;investors&quot; become aware that they are participating in a Ponzi scheme; however, once this idea communicates through the population Ponzi schemes collapse just as rapidly as a Pyramid scheme exhausts its population.</p>
<p>Matrix schemes transfer the idea of population exhaustion or outgoing to incoming investor ratios to that of time.  Essentially, participants are promised access to (a) desired, high-dollar item(s) via a queue of an indeterminate and non-guaranteed waiting period that is typically based participant recruitment performance.  Matrix schemes fail by non-delivery of (the) promised high value item(s).  Participants may each have differing tolerances for queue wait times and social communication of non-delivery is easier to disrupt.   Just like Pyramid schemes (population exhaustion) and Ponzi schemes (zero cash-out tipping point), queue wait times eventually goes to infinity primarily due to population exhaustion.</p>
<p>As a side note, almost everyone in a modern economy participates in some sort of variant of  &quot;continuation non-viable&quot; financial schemes.  Social Security (in the USA) is often pointed out as a Ponzi scheme.  There are, however, significant differences between &quot;continuation non-viable&quot; schemes that collapse rapidly and the Social Security Fund that has a myriad of parameters that can be used to sustain it indefinitely.  The most important difference between the Social Security Fund and an run-of-the-mill Ponzi scheme is that Social Security promises nothing of substance to its participants while participation is mandatory.  Social Security also has a multitude of parameters that can be adjusted to prevent or delay collapse.</p>
<p>Stock markets are a multi-facilitated hybrid that is probably best described as a zero-sum debt issuance parimutuel betting system that periodically resets via large crashes that wipe out capital placed into the system in a &quot;legally credible manner&quot;.  Instead of exhausting a population or reaching a unsustainable tipping point or requiring that people live longer than their biology affords, stock markets destroy money itself (usually in the form of debt).</p>
<p>A bigger question posited by non-neoclassical economists is whether or not the very definition of money, in a fractional reserve debt issuance based context, falls into the category of &quot;continuation non-viable&quot; (and, in point of fact, most evidence points to the reality that all fractional reserved debt issuance &quot;money&quot; eventually fails, although the failure is usually attributed to political reasons rather than some fundamental flaw with the idea of money as defined in that context).</p>
<p>Curiously, about the only thing that is guaranteed in any sort of continual manner is the assembly of biologicals via DNA, sexual reproduction and a comfortable energy gradient.  Even if you look at this throughout time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event" target="_blank">you will see collapses caused by life itself</a>.  With respect to human life, <a href="https://assets-production-webvanta-com.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000000/44/16/original/files/images/figure12.JPG" target="_blank">a clear linear growth line existed in the per-industrial world and became exponential with the discovery and utilization of oil</a>.  In this regard and because energy is finite (to include human knowledge/creativity) , the current non-linear, above carrying capacity population of earth may be, in and of itself, a &quot;continuation non-viable&quot; situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
