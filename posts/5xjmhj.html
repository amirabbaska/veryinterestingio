		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What doping does in those systems is create conditions under which a junction between two semiconductors can be made to conduct electricity. In other words, it can be switched between a zero state, or a one state. But without the doping, the materials used, like silicon, are semiconductors on their own. Being a semiconductor means simply that the electrons living inside those materials can never have certain values of their energy. Imagine they can have any value between 0 and 1 (in some unit of energy), or any value between 2 and 3, but they can't have values between 1 and 2. That part of the energy spectrum is known as the energy gap. Basically, if you put electrons in all states from 0 to 1, you cannot put another one in a state of energy 1.0001, for example. The next available energy for that extra electron is 2, so you have to provide one entire unit of energy to bring that electron into your material.</p>
<p>That's precisely what happens when you transport electricity: you connect metallic cables to your sample, and you apply a voltage to bring electrons from your battery, through one cable, into the sample, then out through the other cable and back to the battery. But if you need to provide 1 unit of energy, and your battery can only provide, say, half a unit, then you cannot bring electrons into the sample (there are no states for those energies!), and current can't pass through it. That's what being a semiconductor is all about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't necessarily have to be doped. Doping allows the creation of diodes, certain types of transistors and devices. A semiconductor is defined by having a specific bandgap. Insulators are materials that have a large separation between the valence and conduction band so it would be difficult for electrons to get excited and move into the conduction band. Conductors usually have lots of electrons in the conduction band and the valence band can overlap the conduction band meaning it'll easily be conductive. For semiconductor it's somewhere in between and a few electrons can reach the conduction band.
The most basic is semiconductor is silicon based and you can manipulate its behavior by adding dopants such as in the diode or silicon mosfet.
One example is a transistor that doesn't have to use doped material is a Gallium Nitride High electron mobility transistor (HEMT). Essentially you have a small layer of AlGaN on top of GaN and due to the lattice mismatch it causes a stress on the interface which causes a piezoelectric polarization thereby creating a 2 dimensional electron gas channel like with regular silicon mosfets. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Semiconductors are simply materials which <em>can</em> be doped to make Electronic Devices based off of those materials. Usually doping(in Silicon based devices) involves using Silicon which has been laced with impurities to produce the pn junctions you speak of. Silicon by itself is an intrinsic semiconductor and it's not capable of being used as is in devices. </p>
<p>Nowadays, for MOSFETs(Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors), we use Compound Semiconductors which are made out of different materials altogether. For example Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) is used because it can give us better conduction characteristics and produce faster devices. Another one, as has been pointed out below is AlGaN(Aluminum Gallium Nitride) which is used in cases where we need extremely high mobility (speed of movement) of electrons.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that MOSFETs form the basis of Very Large Scale Integrated circuits which are the basis of chip fabrication technology today.</p>
<p>So what does it mean to be an intrinsic semiconductor?</p>
<p>You can take a pure silicon wafer and it's still considered a semiconductor. Mostly this regular silicon can't be used as it is because we need a charge imbalance to induce current flow. This is done by doping two pieces of silicon and joining them to form the pn junction you talked about. I hope the internal process of doping is something you've understood well already.</p>
<p>A device with only 1 pn junction is a diode. We can alter the doping concentrations of the p and n type substrates (surfaces) to produce different devices. For example Zener diodes use imbalances in doping concentrations to produce the reverse breakdown characteristics they use to control voltage.</p>
<p>We can keep adding these junctions and tweaking their doping to form more intricate and useful devices. A common purpose device with 2 pn junctions is a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT). An SCR(silicon controlled rectifier) is a device which has 3 pn junctions. These are old devices compared to the technology we have today. I'm currently doing my undergrad in Ee so these are the devices I'm mostly familiar with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
