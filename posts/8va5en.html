		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you stopped. The tired feeling is you sobering up/“coming down”. You’re gonna feel exhausted if you stop hours before you go to bed. Your body is in full filtration mode and working hard without the booze to stir things up. You’re also gonna be able to process just how exhausted you are as you sober up. I’ve been smashed several nights after a long day of work and had no problem staying up til 6am because I didn’t stop. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because alcohol is a depressant, if you drink and then stop you will feel tired and ready to sleep because thats what alcohol as a drug does to you. Generally if you drink in the night you will be going to sleep very soon after finishing drinking anyway which makes it kinda biased. However alcohol also converts to sugar basically which is energy so as long as you keep drinking you wont fall asleep as easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Agree with the responses that you become drowsy once you stop drinking, regardless of the hour. For me day drinking usually involves being outside in the sun, another contributing factor - makes you drowsy even without alcohol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also understand the way alcohol effects different people. Many alcoholics get a stimulant response from alcohol so your perception on how it effects them and how that plays into when you see these individuals drinking skews things a bit. That and state of mind of the individual drinking. When you day drink I assume its without intent to be productive vs someone going out and not giving into the depressant bc they are on a mission to have fun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
