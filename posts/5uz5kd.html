		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The major contributing factor is your circadian rhythm. This rhythm is basically your natural biological clock. However it does not run exactly on a 24 hr cycle, there are slight deviations naturally and other factors can contribute to altering your biological clock. </p>
<p>The next factor to take into account is which stage of the sleep cycle you are waking up from. There are typically 5 stages of sleep, stage 1/2 are &quot;active&quot; sleep cycles, your brain activity is still highly active and almost indistinguishable from a wake person. In stage 1/2, you are also more likely to respond to stimuli, such as someone calling your name. Stage 3 is regarded as &quot;inactive&quot; sleep cycle, this is the stage where your brain activity drastically drops, preparing your brain and body to enter stage 4. In stage 3, a person is much harder to wake up and waking from this stage leaves a person exhausted and generally disorientated. Stage 4 sleep is where actual rest and rejuvenation occurs. In this stage, your brain activity is picking up slightly but still in a mild manner, not too much to be called wakefullness, but enough to signal repairs in the body. Lastly is REM stage, this is where your brain is now increasing activity and causing dreams. After REM, the cycle repeats back from stage 1. </p>
<p>Basically as you sleep, you go through this 1-4+rem cycle over and over, with each cycle lasting about 90 mins. Depending on what your body needs, stage1/2 will shorten as you go through the sleep cycles and lengthen stage 4 for rest and recovery or REM sleep. If you wake from REM, you will feel refreshed and ready, that is why most people dont remember dreams or recall a dream suddenly disrupted by waking up. If you wake up during stage 3/4, you will feel tired and exhausted, your brain was trying to turn down the power after all, and signal the body to recover from things like exhaustion or injuries. </p>
<p>So thats it, a bit long for ELI5, but its a complicated question that takes many things into account, as is common when talking about neurological issues</p>
<p>Edit: forgot to talk about sleep deficit and how that also contributes alot, but im on mobile and cant continue forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit: it all make sense now, according to the top post, i have to wake up in the middle of my stage 3 sleep before the actual rest occur, also, a train could hit my house i woudnt wake up if its early morning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That may be specific to you, not a general phenomenon that applies to everyone, having to do with your circadian rhythms. If your body clock works well with a certain sleep time, and you shift that, you may get poorer quality sleep in the morning when you're used to being awake, or just generally have disturbed your body's rhythm. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason is because: about an hour before we wake up, our bodies prepare us for the day by releasing certain brain chemicals, namely cortisol. One reason why it is important to get up around the same time everyday is because of this chemical timing. Our bodies become habituated to this cycle, this circadian rhythm, and if we all of a sudden shift away from that, we feel off.
Kind of explains jetlag and the off week a lot of us have after changing our clocks for daylight savings. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
