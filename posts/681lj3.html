		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>It's a personal question that may make the person you're asking very uncomfortable, and there are sometimes business reasons to not answer it.</em> </p>
<p>First, the heart of the rudeness element is you're invading the person's privacy with what some people feel is a very nosy question. </p>
<p>Salary specifics are generally not publicly known and it can be embarrassing for some person to reveal how little they are actually making if they think they're not making very much, and uncomfortable to others who might be doing well. </p>
<p>Answering runs the risk of being judged. &quot;You only make THAT much? Gee, you're letting them take advantage of you&quot; or &quot;Wow, how do you even look after your family with so little income&quot; in the first case. &quot;Brag much? Who'd you blow to get that salary?&quot; or &quot;Well, la-de-daa lookit Mister One Percent over here!&quot; in the other.</p>
<p>And in some corporate cultures, it can be a bad thing if other people learn how much you make, particularly if what you make is more than your co-workers. A number of years ago, a financial-team coworker found an IT team's paystub and absolutely freaked out that the difference in salaries was so high, and it caused a real shit-storm. </p>
<p>So there's a bit of an unspoken rule that you don't talk about salaries, and people that negotiate or earn good salaries have no interest in sharing the fact that they get a bigger piece of the pie, and managers that know salaries don't share because they usually are not empowered to just give a good but underpaid worker a bump whenever they want.</p>
<p>Since it's uncomfortable or unwise to ANSWER the question, it's rude to ASK it, and generally people don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can think of money as representing power, so you are asking someone how powerful they are, you're asking them &quot;what is your status?&quot;</p>
<p>The answer is going to mean &quot;I am more/less powerful than you / I have higher/lower status than you. Either way it will be embarrassing for them to say this to someone else, so the question is rude because it places them in an embarrassing position. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Money and class are obviously very important in American culture. But, there is also an American belief that we should live in a classless society. When you ask someone how much they make you are basically asking them what social class they belong to. This upsets the notion that we are all the same. If we are truly living in a classless society then there is no need to ask how much someone makes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Co-workers are told not to disclose their salary to each other by their bosses because &quot;you don't want them to become jealous that you make more than them.&quot; or &quot;we gave you a pay wage higher than I'm allowed to and I need you to keep it secret!&quot;. The real reason is to keep employees in the dark about how much their job is actually worth and gain negotiating power.</p>
<p>If Suzy hears John is making 15/H and she makes 12/H she knows that she should be paid more. No business owner wants this obviously so it's been discouraged in almost any job since before your great grand-parents time and is now considered taboo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
