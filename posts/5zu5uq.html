<p>We can estimate that X dinosaur was more numerous than Y dinosaur for a given period, but anything more would be too poorly supported.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Best we can  do is to poorly estimate how much food and how large of an area, say a carnivore like t-Rex would require to survive. Based on that you can make a very rough assumption of number of Rex prey in a certain area. It is hard to calculate the exact number of each prey animal since we have so little info about Rex prey preferences. </p>
<p>Keep in mind, at best this will give you some very general picture. It is hard to make precise calculations using this because we have very little info about metabolic characteristics, social structure and general behavior of trex( I use Rex as an example, this is true for all dinos).  Were they metabolically more similar to birds or reptiles, were they solitary or lived as pairs or as small groups, were they active hunters or scavengers, if active hunters; did that ambushed prey or chased them, were they very territorial or territories overlapped, how was the inter-predator interactions, how fast babies grew , how much parental investment were there,  were juveniles allowed to share the territory with their parents until maturing. All these questions and many more needs to be answered for a precise calculation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To even attempt to estimate the population size of an extinct species based on the fossil record, scientists must understand the exact relationship between the historical presence of organisms and the fossils that the organism leave behind for humans to find. Obviously, only very few organisms will ever become fossilized and found  of which only the hard parts will usually be preserved. Additionally, natural processes may encourage or prevent fossilization, distorting the picture of what was actually happening at a particular stage in time. This inherent distortion in the &quot;signal&quot; is called the taphonomic bias, and the study of the way that dead organisms become fossilized is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taphonomy#Taphonomic_biases_in_the_fossil_record" target="_blank">taphonomy</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best scientists can do is guess based on fossil numbers.</p>
<p>For example, in the Karoo Basin in South Africa, a site from the late Permian, is full of Lystrosaurus parts.  It's now believed that they dominated the early Triassic because there are so many of them at fossil sites.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
