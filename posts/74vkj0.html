		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The researchers speculate that the human ability to discern age through scent might be an evolutionary skill related to the way other animals are able to sniff out young, virile mates and avoid those that are older or sick.</p>
<p>Both human and non-human animal body odors are rich with chemical components that can transmit useful social information, the scientists say. And many animals, including mice, rabbits, owls and monkeys, are known to undergo changes to the chemical composition of their body odor as they age.</p>
<p>“Similar to other animals, humans can extract signals from body odors that allow us to identify biological age, avoid sick individuals, pick a suitable partner and distinguish kin from non-kin,” said senior author Johan Lundström, a sensory neuroscientist at Monell</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it's a natural aging process when the skins antioxidant defenses begins to decline. As they decline, the natural oils become oxidized. Fatty acids from the body's glands then react to the oxygen to form a unsaturated aldehyde (organic compound) called nonenal, which is responsible for that funky smell.
It isn't water soluble, so it remains on the skin even after washing and the smell can be quite prominent. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many comments suggesting that old people smell that way due to bad hygeine and all but obviously, every old guy you ever met isn't an unhygienic person! The characteristic smell on old people is due to certain chemicals released on there skins. These chemicals release significantly in the skin of old people. One theory suggests that the chemical 2-Nonanal is responsible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
