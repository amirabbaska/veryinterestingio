		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Iraq invaded Kuwait for financial reasons mostly. Kuwait supported Iraq during the war with Iran. After the war Iraq was in debt to Kuwait for something like $15 billion. Kuwait refused to debt relief. Kuwait was over prducing oil when there was already a glut. This drives the price of oil down which is bad for Iraq because they are really far in debt not just to Kuwait but to many countries around the world to the tune of $60 billion. Also Iraq accused kuwait of slant drill across the border into Iraq and pumping oil from Iraqi oil fields.</p>
<p>Now, how does Iraq invade Kuwait and not expect retaliation from the U.S. and other? Iraq at the time was the most powerful military in the region and the U.S. and Russian had just wound down the cold war. Iraq calculated we wouldn't be able to stomach another conflict with Vietnam and Afghanistan in our rearview mirror. </p>
<p>Another reason they thought the U.S. wouldn't get involved was a matter of mixed signals from the U.S. ambassador. Statements such as &quot; we have no opinion on Arab-Arab conflicts&quot; and that the U.S. did not intend to &quot;start an economic war against Iraq&quot;. This was said while Iraqi forces were forming on the border with Kuwait. These statements and others, said and not said, was seen as a go ahead  for invasion.</p>
<p>The U.S. didn't think Iraq was really going to annex Kuwait. The U.S. believed it was just posturing by the Iraqis to put pressure on Kuwait for debt relief and lower oil prduction. I've heard that Saddam was surprised by the response from the U.S.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Saddamn thought they were Russia invading Crimea.  Or Germany annexing Austria.  They thought their power and distance from from the United States and other major players would keep international players from interfering.</p>
<p>Saddam, as he would many times in his life, miscalculated.  All regional powers are given a certain amount of leeway in controlling their backyard, but Saddam overestimated Iraqi power and underestimated the economic importance of Kuwait as well as a recent strengthening of US-Kuwait relations.  </p>
<p>Especially, Saddam overestimated the leverage he had over the United States in a post-Cold War environment, when he was used to having the US relatively eager to keep a major regional power happy.</p>
<p>Of course, the people who miscalculated the worst were the Kuwaitis, who thought their increased drilling from the field shared between Iraq and Kuwait would force Iraq to the negotiating table, but instead led to tanks rolling over the borders.</p>
<p>Honestly, the US probably would have been okay with Iraq strongarming Kuwait, maybe shooting up some oil wells and some salvos of artillery while promising more to come if Kuwait didn't settle down.   But a full-fledged invasion and occupation was too far over the line given the strengthening ties between the US and Kuwait - the same way Russia would be playing a very dangerous game if it tried to annex all of Ukraine instead of just Crimea.  Consider how even in their blatant annexation of Crimea, Russia plays politics by insisting it's local sentiment and Ukrainian secessionists and no Russia has no idea where those tanks came from.  We let Germany have Austria because we could imagine a sufficient excuse, and we let Germany have Czechoslovakia because Hitler asked nicely and the German war machine was pretty terrifying.  And of course, many of the relevant politicians could remember WW2 and so could their political bases, so any appeasement would have made them look weaker than they would have in the absence of Hitler.</p>
<p>Saddam forgot to even ask - in the modern world, you have to give the world powers a chance to save face if you're going to exert military force.</p>
<p>TL;DR Saddam thought Iraq had a hard sphere of influence that would let him apply an Iraqi version of the Monroe Doctrine/Iron Curtain, but it didn't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/gulf-war-documents-meeting-between-saddam-hussein-and-ambassador-to-iraq-april-glaspie/31145" target="_blank">Here</a> is a transcript of a conversation between April Gillespie, who was the US Ambassador to Iraq at the time of the invasion, and Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>In it, Saddam makes it clear that he considers Kuwait to be part of Iraq, but states that he will drop his aggression towards Kuwait in return for being allowed to keep a part of Iran.</p>
<p>In response, after having said that her only mission is to maintain good relations with Iraq, tells Saddam that Iraq's stance on Kuwait is not really US business and implies a &quot;You do whatever you do.&quot; attitude.</p>
<p>In effect... Saddam was told that the US wouldn't interfere. That's not to say the US supported the invasion, but did not feel it was prudent to <em>oppose</em>.</p>
<p>TL:DR - Saddam had obtained tacit permission <em>by</em> the more powerful countries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because, well, history wasn't on the side of that. Iraq was the strongest military power in the region. While the Cold War was winding down, the US and USSR still didn't see eye to eye, and both had, within the past generation, had foreign military adventures (Vietnam and Afghanistan) that were PR disasters at home.</p>
<p>Saddam figured that as long as the oil kept flowing, the west wouldn't give a shit who was selling it, or about the politics of the region.</p>
<p>That math might have been true a decade earlier, but clearly not in 1990.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Iraq and Iran has just finished an eight year war.  During that war, there was a subset of conflict called the 'Tanker War' in which a lot of Oil Transports transferred their flag to American subsidiaries. </p>
<p>Iran was a dangerous entity in the '80's.  A very new government, espousing a form of Islam that the rest of the Gulf (Saudi, Kuwait, U.A.E etc) were afraid of.  Iraq 'stepped up to the plate' and went to war against Iran, a move that the other Gulf states felt great relief over, because the war curbed Iran's Islamic expansion.</p>
<p>Nominally, every country in the Gulf supported Iraq during this war. 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend.'  Iraq had the equipment (Tanks, Planes, Artillery) and Iran had the bodies (Human Wave attacks).  After eight years, Iraq was financially wasted and Iran had a very bloody nose.</p>
<p>Iraq needed money and that money came in the form of Oil Revenue.  Kuwait, who 'had Iraq's back' during the war, owned large oil producing fields.  When Iraq went to Kuwait saying 'Look, we fought the Iranians and stopped them from invading the other gulf states now we need money', Kuwait apparently no longer had their back.  </p>
<p>Iraq needed the oil but Kuwait had it.</p>
<p>There were claims to diagonal drilling and '19th Provence'. </p>
<p>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright tried to diffuse the situation but failed miserably, giving Saddam Hussain the impression that he had a green light from the United States to Invade.</p>
<p>Saddam had a delusion that he was a major player in the world.  He felt his military was strong enough to deter any intervention.  He miscalculated.</p>
<p>This has a lot to do with the command structure of the government and the military in Iraq.  Saddam felt he couldn't lose because he had led such a magical life and there was no one in his circle of advisers that would contradict him.  To do so meant death or ostracizing.  He was surrounded by 'yes men'.</p>
<p>Saddam had built up a cult of personality.  The first Gulf war cracked that wall. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
