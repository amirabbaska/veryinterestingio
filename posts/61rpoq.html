		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://500womenscientists.org/" target="_blank">500 Women Scientists</a> is a grassroots organization started by four women who met in graduate school at CU Boulder and who maintained friendships and collaborations after jobs and life took them away from Boulder. Immediately following the November 2016 election, we published an open letter re-affirming our commitment to speak up for science and for women, minorities, immigrants, people with disabilities, and LGBTQIA. Over 17,000 women from more than 100 countries have signed in support of 500 Women Scientists, pledging to build an inclusive scientific community dedicated to training a more diverse group of future leaders in science and to use the language of science to bridge divides and enhance global diplomacy.</p>
<p>500 Women Scientists works to build communities and foster real change that comes from <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-successful-movements-have-in-common" target="_blank">small groups, not large crowds</a>. Our <a href="https://500womenscientists.org/take-action/#pods" target="_blank">Local Pods</a> help create those deep roots through strong, personal relationships. Local Pods are where women scientists meet regularly, develop a support network, make strategic plans, and take action. Pods focus on issues that resonate in their communities, rooted in our mission and values.</p>
<p>With us today are six members of the group. They will be answering questions at different points throughout the day so please be patient with receiving answers.</p>

<p>Wendy Bohon (Dr_Wendy) - Hi, I'm Dr. Wendy Bohon! My research focuses on examining how the surface and near surface of the earth changes as the result of earthquakes. I also work on improving public education and perception of science, particularly seismology and earthquake hazards. I'm a woman, a scientist, a mother and a proud member of 500 Women Scientists!</p>

<p>Hi, I'm <a href="https://kellylfleming.com/" target="_blank">Kelly Fleming</a>, AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow and co-leader of 500 Women Scientists. I firmly believe that for science to serve all of society, it must be accessible to diverse people - including underrepresented minorities, immigrants, women, and LGBTQIA people. Although I don't do research anymore, my Ph.D. is in chemical engineering from the University of Washington, where I studied reactions that help turn plant material into fuels. </p>

<p>Tessa Hill - I am <a href="http://hillbiogeochemistry.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Tessa Hill</a>, an oceanographer at UC Davis, based at <a href="http://bml.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">Bodega Marine Laboratory</a>.  I study impacts of climate change on the ocean, including ocean acidification, which is a chemical change occurring in the ocean due to our carbon dioxide emissions. I am excited to be working with 500 Women Scientists to encourage a diverse, inclusive and thriving scientific community.  You can find me on Twitter (@Tessa_M_Hill) and our lab Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oceanbiogeochemistry" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/oceanbiogeochemistry</a></p>

<p>Monica Mugnier (MonicaMugnier) - Hi, I'm Dr. Monica Mugnier. I'm an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. My lab studies how African trypanosomes, the parasites that cause African sleeping sickness, hide from our immune systems. You can read about our work in more detail at <a href="http://www.mugnierlab.org/" target="_blank">www.mugnierlab.org</a>. When I am not pondering parasites, I spend a lot of time thinking about how we can make the scientific community a more welcoming place for everyone. </p>

<p>Kathleen Ritterbush - Hi, I'm Dr. Kathleen Ritterbush, Assistant Professor of paleontology at the University of Utah. My students and I study mass extinctions and ecosystem changes of sea animals from the time of the dinosaurs and earlier. I believe science careers should include all kinds of people, engage our communities, and support work-life balance.</p>
</li>
<li>Hi there, I'm a planetary volcanologist. I study the physics of volcanic processes on the Earth, the Moon, Venus, and Mars using combinations of satellite data, field work, and laboratory experiments. I'm currently transitioning from a position as a postdoctoral fellow at a public university to one at a federal agency. Because I'm a federal employee, I think it is prudent to remain anonymous but I am happy to answer as many of your questions as I can!</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I've got a question for Dr. Ritterbush. I've always wondered, since humans haven't explored more than 5% of the ocean (That's what most reports say so I have assumed this to be accurate), the Marine creatures we've assumed to be extinct might have adapted to live in the unexplored regions, and there might be some which the world has never seen. What are the chances of creatures we presume to be extinct to have adapted and survived in different conditions which we haven't explored yet? Is it not possible for Marine creatures to be trapped under polar ice blankets, still have a chance at survival?(My knowledge of this comes off an article I read about Japanese researchers who managed to revive microscopic creatures after having frozen them for 30 years). Have you personallyâ€‹ encountered any such species which was deemed extinct but was rediscovered whilst exploring new regions (or species which have been frozen for millenia) in your years of research? If so, what species were they?</p>
<p>P.S.- I haven't studied biology much(I will be taking up physics) so please forgive me if any of the my questions seem obnoxious to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any hypothesis as to why Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, and a few other countries where women are generally treated with less equality have a higher percentage of women entering STEM fields than the U.S.? (Saudi Arabia, 50% of STEM graduates are women, compared to 20-25% in the U.S.).</p>
<p>Also, I am a white male high school science teacher. What can I do to encourage minority and female students to continue in STEM fields, without being condescending or overbearing? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every time that I stumble upon a panel on a symposium or see a note about &quot;The role of women in science&quot; I think to myself &quot;Well... Their role is to make new science isn't it&quot;. What am I missing? </p>
<p>I may not be aware of the gender problems in science because I've worked with female researchers since my time as an undergraduate and continue to do so now. As any scientist, these women are obsessed with their work and when I asked, they didn't care much about this &quot;women on stem&quot; movement. Do you think female scientists have a responsibility to support these movements actively? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
