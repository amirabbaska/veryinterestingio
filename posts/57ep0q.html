The issue is everyone is BUYING IT. Its fucked. </p>
<p>I looked into it for 5 minutes and found out the &quot;scientists&quot; who declared its death is a reporter named Rowan Jacobsen, who writes culinary articles and sometimes environmental articles. He is not a scientist and in no way has the authority to declare something dead.</p>
<p>Edit: Sorry for being dumb, shouldn't have posted the clickbait </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With unusually warm water, corals expel their zooxanthellae, the symbiotic algae that provide the plant with food. If the water stays too hot for too long, the algae die, and the coral will starve. When this happens, you're just left with the dead coral which is mostly built from calcium and looks bone white. Essentially this is why it's called coral bleaching, the vibrant colourful coral is gone and all that's left is the skeleton so to speak. </p>
<p>Because of the sensitivity of coral to changes in climate, it's usually seen as a precursor to the effects of climate change. El Nino events are usually the cause of mass coral bleaching but these weather events occur infrequently and the coral often recovers. This time, with climate change, the changes we are seeing will be permanent and as such, the Great Barrier Reef as we know it will possibly never be the same.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ocean acidification is a huge problem. Corals (and other marine life) are very sensitive to change, especially to heat and pH level change. Basically there was a huge increase in carbon dioxide usage causing the ocean to absorb more carbon than it can handle (22million tons a day). When carbon mixes with water it creates carbonic acid which is not so acidic compared to your stomach acid (hydrochloric acid) or car battery acid (sulfuric acid) but is still damaging. When carbonic acid forms, it releases a hydrogen atom which gets combined with carbonate that is naturally found in the ocean. Carbonate is extremely useful because it can also bind with calcium and forms calcium carbonate which is a building block for shells in shellfish and corals However, carbonate has a more natural attraction to the hydrogen released by carbonic acid than calcium causing less calcium carbonate to form and less shells and corals to form. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just saw this <a href="http://youtu.be/19T8SNZH1lc" target="_blank">YouTube clip of coral &quot;belching&quot;</a> and it explains it very simply.
This <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-11/coral-belches-algae-as-water-temperature-rises-bleaching/7917754?pfmredir=sm" target="_blank">article which also has another video of the event</a> will help too, but to spit out some of the key points:
Coral relies on a type of algae to convert sunlight into a sugar that is the energy (photosynthesis) for the coral and this also gives it the vibrant colour.
When the water temperature rises above 30 degrees Celsius the algae cannot convert the energy and instead the energy becomes a reactive form of oxygen, the article describes it as like peroxide in bleach.
The coral then rejects the algae as the friend it depended on for food is now poisoning it. No longer receiving this sugar the coral bleaches, weakens and is now open to be infected by external bacteria and microbes that can cause infections. </p>
<p>Coral can recover but it is not an easy task for it, particularly if the temperature of the surrounding waters stays that high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
