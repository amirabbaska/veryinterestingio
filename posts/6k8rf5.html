		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can be caused by various reasons. Here are some simple explanations.</p>
<p>It can because your blood sugar drops and you get hypoglycemic which causes the nausea or the puky feeling. When have been hungry for a while our bodies start slowing down to preserve nutrition. This affects blood circulation to put it simply which is why some of us feel light headed, dizzy,etc.</p>
<p>Or </p>
<p>It's can be caused by the acid in your empty stomach. The longer it's been since you ate the worse it can be. By the acid not having anything to digest it causes irritation to the stomach lining and lower esophagus which you feel as a sensation of nausea. This sensation tends to be worse in people with a predisposition to having acid reflux.</p>
<p>An actual medical cause can be gastroparesis where the stomach does not empty correctly and can leave food in your stomach from meals digested during your prior meal that adds to irritation.</p>
<p>In addition if the nausea is extremely transient, such as a sensation going back and forth between extremely hungry and nauseous quickly, it's likely a caused by a strong signal in the gastric nerves and the limited ability of our brains too correctly interpret this signal. So it is likely trying to interpret the extreme range of human gastric sensation and gets the two confused, i.e. hunger or nausea.</p>
<p>Or </p>
<p>When your body expects food your stomach releases ghrelin, a hormone that makes you feel so hungry that you get nauseous and feel like you're starving. This reaction is only related to your feeding schedule though, so it'll happen when you might not even necessarily need food. After a while your stomach will stop releasing Ghrelin and the feeling will go away. That could take between 30 minutes to an hour.</p>
<p>For instance if you normally ate food every hour, if you missed a meal you'd feel nauseous and super hungry, even though you didn't really need food. Ghrelin encourages you to seek food, but your body stops releasing it after a short while so as not to inhibit food procurement activities. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have had emergency services come out to me and explain this when I had an episode once.</p>
<p>It had to do with low blood sugar. I hadn't eaten anything all day, was running around playing paintball and at the end of the day when walking home I kept vomiting and passing out.</p>
<p>Someone noticed me passed out on the sidewalk and called an ambulance. When the EMTs showed up and took my vitals, the first thing they asked was what I had eaten that day. I said nothing. They told me to go home and eat, because I was having a hypoglycemic episode. I told them I didn't feel hungry at all and they said that was normal and was why I was so tired and throwing up (all that was coming up was a watery, yellow liquid that smelled really bad) but I can't remember exactly everything they told me about it. I was kinda fucked up and felt drunk. </p>
<p>If I haven't eaten for a while and start feeling queasy now, I find something to eat immediately. </p>
<p>Edit: correction of a word. Thanks /u/saikado.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: It was a little more complicated than I put it, but I can only relay what I remember and, as I mentioned, I was out of it; passing out, throwing up, I felt drunk and dizzy. So I don't remember a lot of the details I didn't even understand. They administered some tests, talked to me a bit, my friend showed up and told them what we were doing earlier in the day, and then someone called my mom to pick me up. I was 15 or 16 when this happened. </p>
<p>EDIT 3: I forgot to add in the previous edit that the EMS did not administer anything to me, at least not that I recall. No injections, pills, not even a bite to eat. If they were supposed to have done something like that, then they either fucked up, or did give me something while I was still unconscious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To staple onto this question, in case anyone has any insight... I have been suffering from depression (Probably) as of late, and one of the major effects is the near disappearance of my appetite. Simply put, I never actually feel hungry. However, if I don't eat at all, often my body will start to feel nauseated. Is this the same thing? Is my body not telling me I'm hungry until its far past the time I should have ate?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What about the weird &quot;static&quot; sensation I get in the back of my throat when I'm really hungry. I can feel it in my throats and hear it as well. </p>
<p>Edit: I'm super happy other people experience this. Also I have many many throats. </p>
