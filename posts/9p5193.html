		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one really knows!  We can see how neurons convey sensory information, how converging and diverging signals can organize, process, store, and retrieve this information.  We can model complex behavior of vast assemblies of these neurons organized into functional areas, but that <em>still</em> does not answer your question about how this translates into the qualitative experience of having a thought.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do understand very precisely how neurons work; how they communicate with each other, what they are communicating, and how fast. When we look at larger and larger groups, however, the precision starts to get smaller. It's too hard to keep track of all these neurons at the same time.</p>
<p>Early humans probably couldn't think in coherent thoughts, and still relied on pure instinct. Some were randomly born with the ability to primitively organize thoughts, create sequences of thoughts, and plan ahead. This increased their chance of survival, which in turn passed those traits to future generations. Run this evolutionary cycle a few hundred thousand times, and sure enough you will have people who think in words, can consciously think about multiple things at once, plan ahead, and remember all of that information for long periods of time. We don't know how it works, and to be honest, it's unlikely we will for a long long while.</p>
<p>This is how YouTuber CGP Grey puts it, and I love it:</p>
<p>&quot;While an individual neuron may be understood, and clusters of neurons' general purpose vaguely grasped, the whole is beyond. Nonetheless, it works.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's something here that's known in philosophy as a category mistake. That is, you're assuming that the low voltage electrical impulses and thoughts are separate categories when they are the same, at least according to one of the more modern theories of consciousness eliminative materialism. That is, there is no &quot;conversion&quot; between the two - that's just what thoughts /are/</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
