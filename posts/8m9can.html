		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about tuna specifically, but canned food in general lasts a long time because the canning process kills all the microorganisms that were in it. Usually you put the food in the can and seal it, then heat it up, cooking the food inside and sterilizing it at the same time. Without the bacteria and fungi breaking things down, the food takes a lot longer to decay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light tuna is typically made from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skipjack_tuna" target="_blank">skipjack </a>tuna that are usually about 10lb or so and only a couple years old.  White tuna is only from Albacore, which grow to almost 3-4 times that size, and have a much higher mercury content because of their size and life span.</p>
<p>For how long and why it lasts, I'll cite an old reddit post from /u/ethornber.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ltrch/how_does_canned_tuna_have_such_a_long_shelf_life/c2vjokn" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ltrch/how\_does\_canned\_tuna\_have\_such\_a\_long\_shelf\_life/c2vjokn" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ltrch/how\_does\_canned\_tuna\_have\_such\_a\_long\_shelf\_life/c2vjokn</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light tuna is usually made from skipjack tuna, a different species than albacore. Skipjacks are smaller, and less susceptible to the process known as &quot;bioaccumulation&quot; which is responsible for mercury getting into tuna. Skipjack eat smaller prey than albacore, and those smaller fish are lower down on the food chain than the larger fish that albacore eat. Bioaccumulation amplifies at each level of the food chain, so this means that skipjack consume food with lower mercury content, making them themselves have less of it. This is also why canned sardines and other small fish have very little mercury at all compared with larger predatory fish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

If you are worried about mercury from fish, studies have shown that the benefits of eating fish far outweigh any potential negative impacts: <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/203693" target="_blank">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/203693</a>
There are a couple species to consume in moderation though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light tuna is usually skip jack instead of albacore or yellow or blue fin. Part of the reason why skip jack is lower in mercury is smaller fish, eats fish further down in the food chain than larger tuna. And reaches market size sooner than the larger tuna, so it doesn't live long enough to accumulate as much mercury.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
