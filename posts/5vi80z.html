		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's many reasons for this.</p>
<p>First and foremost is the fact that the fall of the western roman empire is a long and drawn out process during which time the economy needed for statue making was dwindling. If there's no one rich enough to buy a statue no one makes it. If no one makes it, no one learns how. And so the craft is forgotten in a generation or two.</p>
<p>But The roman empire didn't fall in 476, just the western part. in the east we can see similar styles up until the iconoclasm which is it's own mess. Unfortunately due to wars, ottoman dislike for statues and the iconoclasm, not many statues from them remain. So in the west people stopped making these natural lifelike arts because there wasn't enough money in it. Because everyone was poor. Because they were living in an &quot;almost post apocalyptic&quot; world of a fallen empire.</p>
<p>But to answer the important part of your question. Beauty is subjective to the society in which it is made. I.E, these paintings you see and feel are bad were not bad in the eyes of those that made it. </p>
<p>U/pinesap explains it very well here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1l1vp2/why_is_ancientmiddle_ages_art_is_technically_much/cbv3et1/?st=izh3hm9h&amp;sh=dae468f9" target="_blank">&quot;During the Middle Ages, the ideas that artists sought to depict were allegorical - the allegory a central form of medieval art and culture. The images created at that time were realistic as far as the ideas and cultural values they represented - they were not &quot;lacking&quot; in any skill. They served exactly the purpose they meant to fill, narrative, symbolic. The idea was not to represent reality, it was to transcend reality - and the point was that this was ideally to occur on the viewer's spiritual mind.&quot;</a></p>
<p>In other, simpler words: the people who made medieval art did not intend to do the same job as the roman and greek artists.  The People around them did not want grandiose, realistic, natural art. It didn't fit their view of the world.</p>
<p>It may seem strange to us now, but the fact is art usually reflects the values of them time. And at the time, storytelling was more important than realism. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sculptures from each period served different purposes, and were made by people with different styles. Other people have already covered the shift towards allegory/symbolism/transcendence in Medieval art. </p>
<p>But I just wanted to point out that Roman sculpture wasn't reliably &quot;realistic&quot; either. Do you really think so many emperors and consuls were as buff/handsome/well-proportioned as their portraits suggest? Heck no. At least one of them had to have been a cross-eyed pudgy bald dude or something. Roman art was stylized, just in the opposite direction from Medieval art. They used realistic proportions for things like how long a person's arm should be in relation to their fingers, but they gave their subjects a heavily idealized musculature, weight, and facial structure that were unlikely to have been a reflection of anyone's actual body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe that good &quot;life-like&quot; quality in sculpture arose much earlier than in paining because when you are sculpting you are representing 3 dimensional objects in another 3 dimensional object. With painting however, you are trying to trick the observer into seeing 3 dimensional objects on a 2 dimensional surface. </p>
<p>If you look at Roman and Greek paintings (on pottery and such) it is also quite primitive from a modern perspective, just like early medieval paintings. Likewise, medieval sculptures were also not fundamentally different in complexity compared to Roman sculptures.</p>
<p>The big shift in European paintings from the silly-looking early stuff to proper three-dimensional representation using depth and such was a really big step!</p>
<p>Source: Was also curious about this question and asked a friend who is quite knowledgeable about this stuff. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the Roman Empire fell, it wasn't to another great civilization.  There are volumes of books written why Rome fell, but in the wake of its fall there was a total breakdown in the unity of Western Europe.  The Catholic Church was the only real remnant left of the Roman Empire (which had adopted Christianity before Rome fell.)  The artistic advancements that did not directly serve the Church were abandoned and largely forgotten.  It wasn't until the Renaissance (15th century) that Western Europe began to display a greater secularism as well as greater respect and interest in the arts.  Renaissance means &quot;rebirth&quot;, and the people of the Renaissance saw their time as a rebirth of the ancient glory of Rome/Greece.  They labeled the 1,000 years between their time and the fall of Rome as the &quot;middle&quot; ages (Medieval is Latin for middle ages.)  Some of the rediscovery of ancient artistic techniques was due to archaeological discoveries, and some of it was experimentation.  Opera came about because Italians thought that Ancient Greek theatre was entirely sung.  Michaelangelo and other great Renaissance artists were among the first to create on the dame level as the ancient Romans/Greeks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Roman art was inspired by Greek sculpture, painting, etc. which emphasized proportions, depth, and perspective. You have to remember that this was a period of high praise for mathematics and art itself and because the Greeks (and subsequently the Romans) were studying Euclidean geometry, their art thrived in terms of realism. As some others said, when the Roman Empire fell, Europe was thrown into the dark ages and all of this was lost until the Renaissance and specifically in painting, Giotto came onto the scene to revive perspective.</p>
<p>To add to that, the medieval style did not require realism. Much of it was mosaics for religious purposes and since its subjects were always religious figures it was ok for them to essentially break the laws of physics (e.g. Subjects appearing in more than one place in a medieval piece).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
