		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, just wanted to clarify some things. Severe malnourishment has several sequelae (outcomes) depending on what exactly is lacking in the person's diet. The two that most people are familiar with are (1) Kwashiorkor - the kind with the really big belly and (2) Marasmus - The kind where the people look like walking skeletons.</p>
<p>In marasmus, there is generalized severe malnourishment. These people are sick because they are lacking sufficient calories, thus they become incredibly skinny - they are literally wasting (actual medical term) away.</p>
<p>In Kwasiorkor, there is sufficient/close to sufficient caloric intake, BUT there is INsufficient PROTEIN intake. This means that the diet is mostly rice, corn, etc. Your body needs proteins for countless things such as building muscle etc. It also needs proteins to transport fats (not soluble in blood/water) throughout your blood stream. These 'transport' protein are called lipoproteins and are made in the liver. Without these proteins, the fats consumed by the body get trapped in the liver, leading to fatty livers (contributing to the big bellies). Also, proteins are needed to maintain the proper fluid volumes in your body (I won't get into this now) and without it, you retain water, contributing to fluid retention (medically called edema), and thus also making the bellies bigger. </p>
<p>I hope this helped :) </p>

<p>EDIT: XD This is the first time i get gold! Thank you guys!!! (I guess med school paid off after all haha)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called kwashiorkor, and it's a sign of serious protein deficiency.  The stomach gets bloated because of fluid retention and because the liver expands with fat deposits.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, kwashiorkor gets its name from what an African tribe called it.  Translated, it means &quot;disease of the deposed child&quot;.  What would happen is that when a 2nd child was born, the first child would be abruptly cut off breast milk and put onto a more adult diet high in carbs and low in protein.  This resulted in protein deficiency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Protein deficiency. Protein in the blood, primarily albumin, is largely responsible for the osmotic force that keeps water in the pressurized vasculature from leaking out.</p>
<p>ELI5 version: if you don't eat enough protein, your body can't put the proteins into the blood that keep water in there. The water leaks out into the abdominal cavity, among other places.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's called <em>kwashiorkor</em>, and it happens when there's not enough protein in a person's diet. Protein in the blood keeps water bound in blood, and if there's not enough protein then the water leaks out into the tissues, mostly in the stomach and abdominal area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
