		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two main reasons:</p>
<p>If it’s something disgusting, our body perceives the image or sound as real and suppresses our hunger. Historically this protected us from eating rotten food which could make us sick.</p>
<p>If it’s something emotionally distressing or shocking, that’s our fight or flight response kicking in. Our body senses that distress and shuts down things like hunger and digestion to prioritize our immediate needs (ex: getting away or fighting off danger)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has a set of nerves that control the functions of your body that you have no conscious control of, such as the movement of the muscles in your gut, how hard and fast your heart beats, etc (called the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems).</p>
<p>One set (the sympathetic) triggers the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response; it raises your heart rate, redirects blood from your gut to your muscles and brain, dilates your eyes to let more light in to allow you to take in more information etc. The other (the parasympathetic) does the opposite and prepares you to &quot;rest and digest&quot;. These two nervous system work in opposition to each other.</p>
<p>When you hear or see something your brain determines may be a threat, the &quot;fight or flight&quot; mode (the sympathetic nervous system) gets fired up and the &quot;rest and digest&quot; (the parasympathetic) side is turned down. This abolishes your sense of hunger as your body is preparing for physical exertion and does not have the energy to devote to digestion and absorption of food.</p>
<p>It's considerably more detailed than that, but I'm trying my best to ELI5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you talking from personal experience? And if not, are sure that actually happens? </p>
<p>Because this &quot;loss of appetite&quot; phenomenon has always sounded like a myth to me. Characters in TV, books and movies are always losing their appetite when something disgusting happens, but I've never experienced that in my life. It's obviously unpleasant when something disgusting happens while you're eating, like having someone puke close to you or seeing a swarm of cockroaches pass you by, but unless any of that gets on the food, there's no way I'm going to stop eating. At best, I might get far enough where I can eat my food in peace, but I'll definitely remain hungry the entire time. If I'm hungry, the only thing that will change that is eating, and there's no way I'd ever &quot;lose my appetite.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
