		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like some others said, size has a lot to do with it. Also, so does your enzyme balance. Alcohol gets broken down in your body by enzymes and eventually is used to make or store energy (as fat cells or for production of ATP). Someone who's body regularly deals with larger quantities of alcohol has their cells making more of those enzymes so that they can break the alcohol down faster. That doesn't mean it's healthier for them though, because all that effort is a huge strain on the liver, which not only filters impurities but also plays an important role in metabolism regulation.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tolerance.</p>
<p>Size in both height and weight do factor into it, but in most cases it's all just a matter of tolerance.</p>
<p>Normal people don't need to hit around the 8-10 standard drinks mark just to feel an effect.  If a normal person that hasn't got a daily or even weekly drinking habit tried to skull a bottle of spirits(hard liquor) it will very likely kill them, because it's just too much too fast. </p>
<p>Think of it like running a marathon.  If you practice everyday your tolerance for pain increases. Meaning you can push yourself further before you feel like you are on the edge of dying.  If you have ever tried running long distances without that training you would know very well that simply a few hundred meters can be enough for your body to give out. </p>
<p>Tolerance in this sense is a form of conditioning. In a way alcoholics condition themselves to ingest larger quantities of alcohol. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people you see doing that end up in bad shape. They likely start vomiting and pass out. The ones who dont get alcohol poisoning have made it to that level of &quot;ability&quot; have done so through practice. A person develops a tolerance to alcohol just like anything else. </p>
<p>Edit: body mass and fat do have a lot to do with it but mostly only as a beginner. Ive seen thin/low body fat people drink like a pro and larger people get stupid with a couple drinks. I was a &quot;power drinker&quot; at 6'1 165 lbs. I quit drinking many years ago and now at 225 lbs, i would bet 2 beers would severely impair my motor skills. Practice and tolerance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely hate having to argue with the people who say this amount will make you vomit etc... I hate it because to my alcoholic husband this is just the opener for his day. He will tell me he's going to be sober, go out to &quot;smoke&quot; and another 750ml of vodka is gone. Yes he will pass out eventually but the only time he gets sick is if he is detoxing (which never lasts more than a day or so, why put your body through that?) if you have the tolerance, and a serious problem, you can easily consume this much alcohol and go back for more. It breaks my heart...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, I've only seen this happen two times. once was at a drinking party  where a friend of mine was trying to prove she was a better drinker than a guy from Saskatchewan, she won but we immediately took her to the bathroom to make her throw up so that we wouldn't have to take her to the hospital an hour later.</p>
<p>the second time was while watching Archer. The various individuals seemed to managed to keep the alcohol down seemingly due to high tolerance to alcohol and by being cartoons</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
