		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was on an Ohio class sub ssbn from 2007 to 2011. The sub rarely rocked, even in crazy bad storms, below 400 ft. We steamed under a typhoon in the Pacific with no ill effects. Being on a sub underwater feels a lot like a big jetliner.</p>
<p>However, very near or on the surface the boat rocks like a damned pendulum. Imagine a steel pipe with some weight on the bottom. Thats a submarine on the surface. It starts to roll like a round pipe and the only thing that keeps it up right is additional ballast near the bottom. But that also creates a weight that acts like a pendulum swinging the boat back and forth. Many sailors got sick a few times coming up to periscope depth. </p>
<p>As for other stuff causing the boat to move, I could feel when the speed was changed by more than a bell turn (I.e. going from 1/3 go 2/3 ahead or more). I could also feel large rudder changes because they'd make the boat roll a little. The officer of the deck might sometimes order light angles on the boat, like a few degrees up or down, for various training purposes or to be a dick. I did it once to my captain. He told me he was going to go use the treadmill for an hour, I ordered a 3 degree up angle to make him work harder because I was passive aggressive. After 45 minutes he walked into Control and asked why there had been an up angle for 45 minutes. He didn't need to look, he could tell it by how much harder to run it was. I had to explain it was for &quot;training purposes&quot; so the helm, lee helm, and diving officer of the watch could learn as a team (it takes some coordination between those three to effectively keep the boat at an angle without changing depth). Anyway, we all laughed after the captain walked out. I'm sure the captain did the same thing when he was a junior officer. </p>
<p>Edit: I got the idea from a more senior officer on the boat. We were not undermining the CO as someone said below. Submarines are different in that my CO was more like an older brother to me than a boss. I'm sure the CO laughed a little and months later after it happened with a different officer on watch he announced he'd no longer be telling us when he was running on the treadmill because, &quot;Sometimes I like to feel good about myself after a run.&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former Trident sailor here. I'd guess that 25% of the crew puked at some point, every patrol. It's noticeable. Sea sickness pills were common issue. The worst I ever saw was 35 degree rolls to <em>each side</em> (port and starboard) at 350ft (106.7m) deep, under a tropical storm in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>So, yes-- on an Ohio class (&quot;Trident&quot;) you can definitely feel the sea state, depending on the ocean conditions and the course of the submarine.</p>
<p>I served aboard USS Kentucky (SSBN 737)(GOLD) and USS Alaska (SSBN 732)(BLUE).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In stormy enough seas, you absolutely feel it. I was under a hurricane and even at 500 feet a lot of people got sea sick.  I've never notice changes due to thermal layers or currents though.  </p>
<p>Sometimes the boat does 'Angles and Dangles', where the ship will perform maneuvers creating sustained positions that are fun (or frustrating if you are trying to sleep, cook, or do work).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. During a storm last year we felt rolls of up to 5 degrees to port/starboard and we were around 200m deep at the time. On the surface however you'd be getting thrown about as without a keel the submarine ends up corkscrewing it's way through the water, causes horrible sea sickness as there is no escape from it.
