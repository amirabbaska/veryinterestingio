I am aware that some transitions are affected by loss of degeneracy, like in complexes that are affected by Jahn-Teller distortion. But every absorption I see consist of bands of finite width. Why is that? The same question extends to infrared spectroscopy, with the transmittance bands.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energies of the states <em>aren't</em> exactly discrete. The lineshape of the state is not quite a Dirac delta function, but rather a <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5f7dd3713f975faa67bd3fc7b5155482" target="_blank">Breit-Wigner function</a> with some nonzero width. The width is inversely related to the lifetime of the state, so only states which live forever truly have definite energies.</p>
<p>You can have additional sources of broadening of your spectral lines, like Doppler broadening due to finite temperature, etc.</p>
<p>But what I've discussed above is a fundamental broadening the the energy of the state which you can never get rid of.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You get Doppler broadening of absorption lines due to the random motion of atoms. The absorption line is only well defined in the reference frame of the atom, but the motion of the atom shifts this absorption line slightly. Due to the fact that the motion of the atoms is random and approximately Gaussian, you end up with an absorption band that is also Gaussian around the transition energy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Uv-vis spectroscopy is considered electronic detection/absorption. Electrons being excited from one energy level to another. Let's say from HOMO to LUMO or something similar like a band gap. Having broad peaks suggests to us that there are many energy levels that electrons can exist in. The wavelength max, the peak in the broad absorption spectrum suggests that at that energy level the probability of an electron to be excited is the greatest. We can infer all this data from the uv-vis and probably need other tools to suggest more than this. </p>
<p>Other spectroscopy detects rotational and vibration energy levels within a molecule. It just so happens that electronic excitations also incorporstate these energy levels too. Once an electron is excited it means that it gained energy, potential and kinetic. It can transfer that energy in a number of ways and has to conserve energy which is one of the laws of thermodynamics. It does this by emmiting pure energy as light or causing the molecule to vibrate or rotate. Rotation and vibration (rot and vib) would be considered heat. Since rotational and vibration energy levels are not quite as discrete as an electron existing in specific orbitals there ends up being essentially infinite rot and vib energy levels, meaning the excited electron can give a little, a lot, or any amount of energy to these heat modes. Ok, this suggests that electrons can relax or donate energy to other modes but doesn't explain broad peaks.</p>
<p>Ground state electronic levels. These electrons excited by UV-vis are not all at the same starting energy level. Since absorption is pure light energy being incorporated into the molecules where electrons start and stop excitation will determine the light/energy that can be absorbed. If a molecule is already in a slightly excited state by being a little warm then it has a higher starting place energeticly and will absorb a longer, less energetic photon and appear to absorp above its wavelength max. Shorter/higher energy photons can be absorbed if an electron can incorporate that light energy to its excited electronic state plus a heat energy level (rot and vib).
We should be able to backup this idea by taking uv-vis at different temperatures of a known substance. </p>
<p>TLDR:
UV-vis excites electrons at discrete energy levels which would be suggested by peak max. Vibrational and rotational (heat) energy levels allow for wiggle room and allow molecules to absorbed photons of higher and lower energy. This combination of electronic, vibrational, and rotational energy levels gives a broad spectrum. We are looking at energy being absorbed into a molecule and thus must extrapolate what a change in energy means.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have two types of broadening : homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening.</p>
<p>The easier to conceptualize is inhomogeneous broadening : this can be caused by a multitude of factors, that make each molecule/emitter be in a slightly different energy state. This can be caused by Doppler effect (molecules moving at different speeds), uneven distribution of impurities in a material that locally affect the material properties around them, etc.</p>
<p>In the case of a pure, defect-free sample, where there is no inhomogeneous broadening, you will still observe homogeneous broadening of any optical transition. This is caused by the uncertainty principle, and the product Delta_E <em> Delta_t has a minimum value of hbar/2, and any optical transition takes a finite time Delta_t to happen, thus the transition linewidth will always be at least hbar/(2</em>Delta_t).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
