		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Simple Answer:</strong></p>
<p>For the same reason that a fired bullet can pass through your body while a rock cannot.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Goldilocks and the Three Bears example of this radiation is too big and slow and this radiation is too small and fast. </p>
<p>Gamma rays, visible light, and radio waves are all examples of electromagnetic radiation, and radio waves are on one end of the spectrum (with a wavelength of meters), gamma rays are on the other end (with a wavelength of about 10-12 meters) and visible light is somewhere in between (with a wavelength of around 5 x 10-7 meters). </p>
<p>Three things happen to EM radiation when it encounters a barrier. It can bounce (reflectance or scattering), pass through (transmittance), or just plain stop (absorbance). </p>
<ul>
<li>The intensity of radiation transmitted depends on several things:</li>
<li>The wavelength of the radiation</li>
<li>The intensity of the radiation hitting the barrier</li>
<li>The chemical composition of the barrier</li>
<li>The physical microstructure of the barrier</li>
<li>The thickness of the barrier</li>
</ul>
<p>Your question has to do with the first point, but keep in mind that powerful enough visible light (many times brighter than sunlight) would be able to pass through the walls of your home so you could see it, and even a weak light can shine through a paper-thin wall or a wall made of glass. </p>
<p>EM waves interact with matter on their own scale of size and time. </p>
<p>The reason why visible light can't travel through walls as easily as gamma rays or radio waves is because, to the visible light, there's something 'there' on a similar scale of length (wavelength) and time (frequency) that the gamma rays are too small and fast to interact with and the radio waves are too large and slow to interact with. </p>
<p>The gamma rays just pass through the spaces between and within atoms and molecules. They're small enough to do that. If your walls were made of pure lead, they'd have a little more trouble. </p>
<p>The radio waves on the other hand are large enough to ignore the walls because they're too thin. But if you've ever tried to listen to a radio in a tunnel or a cave, you know that radio waves have trouble penetrating through meters of earth. </p>
<p>Visible light interacts with many solid materials because the wavelengths are the right size to be scattered by structural elements within those materials like microfibers and cracks and porous spaces. Well-cut glass or diamond don't have these structural elements at this length scale so they look clear unless they're shattered or rough. </p>
<p>So scattering due to physical elements of the right size is a major reason, but another factor contributes too. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its not true. Many materials allow visible light to pass trough (glass, some plastics, air.. ) and many materials dont allow wifi or radio waves to pass trough (metals, basically).</p>
<p>X-rays have very small cross section and thus they are less likely to actually hit an atom, so they kinda slip trough. But eventually they hit something and that hit is pretty hard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The radiation interacts electromagnetically.</p>
<p>The more energy the radiation has, the more readily it can electromagnetically interact with materials.</p>
<p>Consider these materials:</p>
<p>Glass &gt; woods &gt; metal</p>
<p>Metal is an electromagnetic conductor, and interacts easily with electromagnetic waves, blocking them. It blocks visible light and radio waves easily.</p>
<p>Glass is a dielectric &quot;insulator&quot;. It doesn't interact and won't block visible light or radio waves.</p>
<p>Wood is mostly a insulator but not entirely. It won't interact with low energy radio waves, but higher energy visible light is enough to enable interaction. So wood can pass radio waves but not visible light.</p>
<p>So the ability to conduct determines the level of energy needed for interaction with the light.</p>
<p>However, once you reach very high energy levels, the wave is so small that it much smaller than an atom (atoms are mostly free space). It cannot interact unless the light particle directly hits a sub atomic component. Hence your can only stop very high energy by a very thick dense material to increase the chance of interaction. This is why x rays can pass through very conductive material including metal. And the only way to stop them is very thick dense matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a chemical point of view:</p>
<p>Although now people tend to use &quot;quantum&quot; to refer to futuristic things such as information teleporting and the next generation of computing, at its most basic level it was used to describe the phenomena of quantization of energy. As I'm sure you're aware, matter is made of molecules, which are stable arrangements of atoms. It turns out that atoms, molecules, and collections of molecules only interact with certain energies; though the energies can sometimes be so close to each other in level that things may seem continuous to our human observations. </p>
<p>Energy includes light, and light of different frequency contains different energy. Energy might go into the translation, rotation, bond vibration, or electronic excitation of a molecule. However, the energies that can go into any of these will always be well defined. Energies that don't fit can't interact and so pass through.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add with a nice visualization.</p>
<p>It's also not just medium frequency. It has to do with the specific wavelength light and of light and the properties of the material it's passing through. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpx7hsoYEt4" target="_blank">Here</a> is a video  where you can see infrared light going straight through a black trashbag but being stopped by...a simple pane of glass!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
