		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been 4th amendment issues raised with various spying programs, but several times various federal courts have declined to rule, citing a lack of evidence the plaintiffs were damaged by the programs in question.</p>
<p>The following cases are examples, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union_v._National_Security_Agency" target="_blank">ACLU v. NSA</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACLU_v._Clapper" target="_blank">ACLU v. Clapper</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_v._NSA" target="_blank">Wikimedia Fdn v. NSA</a></p>
<p>This question of standing is fundamental. Because the programs are secret, it is impossible to know what information of yours may have been intercepted. </p>
<p>By the way, it is case law that someone has no expectation of privacy over information that was shared with a third party. e.g. when you dial your phone to reach your aunt, you shared the fact that you dialed that number with the phone company, therefore it cannot be information exclusive to you and your aunt, and therefore no private information is taken when the government read your call records. </p>
<p><strong><em>TL;DR</em></strong>: Simply saying &quot;three-letter-agency probably knows what web sites I've visited&quot; isn't a lawsuit you can file, because (a) you don't know whether they know, and (b) even if they did know, you had to ask a third party (your ISP) for the websites, so that wasn't harm anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>GW had an attorney write the legal justification for the NSA spying that Snowden revealed.</p>
<p>As far as I know that legal document was (and still is) classified.</p>
<p>A few people have seen it. Attorney General Ashcroft would not accept it and several of his staff resigned in protest over it.</p>
<p>To get the issue heard in court there will have to be a specific victim who is damaged directly by the spying done by that specific program. You can't argue principles in court without tangible victims.</p>
<p>This is why you want to trust the people who are in office. Psychopaths can manipulate anything and make it look appropriate (i.e. Richard Nixon.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not easily done like you're five, but I'll give it a shot....</p>
<p>Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Patriot Act, and other statutes and amendments, Congress has created a special court, known as the FISA court, to review the sufficiency and constitutionality of highly sensitive requests by the federal government agencies and agency components involved in gathering intelligence information on individuals within the US involving the national security of the US. The FISA court is staffed by certain constitutionally appointed federal judges (see Article III of the Constitution) who serve for set terms in that capacity.  The Article III federal judicial branch long has been understood to exercise final interpretive authority over what is permissible government action under the Constitution (see Marbury v. Madison).  The executive branch of the federal government cannot act through its intelligence gathering and law enforcement capacity to obtain information in certain ways, including the real-time surveillance of electronic transmissions (i.e. &quot;wiretaps&quot;) and similar invasive techniques, unless the request or program is first submitted with adequate evidence for its necessity through the FISA court process for review.  This usually includes periodic returns to the court for it to monitor both the progress and the continued need for this exceptional kind of surveillance.  To submit a FISA warrant or request, the Department of Justice imposes serious internal review requirements, including approval by the AG or, sometimes, her delegate.  For these reasons, the obligation that the executive branch obtain Art III judicial review under a process authorized by congressional statutory action, coupled with the necessity of proving a national security justification and submitting the activity to continued judicial monitoring, have so far been determined adequate to satisfy the constitutional concerns they raise.  And if there is a program involving electronic surveillance by federal law enforcement based on national security concerns (that is, not justified under ordinary criminal warrant requirements) that involves US citizens on US soil which hasn't been approved in secret by the FISA court according to the requirements of that system, then the action is illegal and unconstitutional. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order to sue in a court of law, especially against a government, you need what is called &quot;standing&quot; </p>
<p>That's provided either specifically by a law giving you access to the courts (so the statute itself says &quot;people like X, Y or Z can sue to enforce this statute&quot;) or by the concept of &quot;injury-in-fact&quot; in that you were actually and specifically harmed by the unlawful act. </p>
<p>there's a derivative of that &quot;injury-in-fact&quot; standing which is essentially allowing non-injured parties to step in for the injured parties and exert their rights on their behalf.</p>
<p>to make the technical discussion very brief, groups like the ACLU haven't had too much success (so far, BIG point) in asserting standing on behalf of a generalized class of harmed individuals, so they literally need to find a straight-up victim of the unlawful act. </p>
<p>unfortunately, what typically happens is that that specific harm winds up disappearing well before the merits of the lawsuit get fully litigated through the entire appeals chain, or the parties settle and it doesn't actually work to provide broadly-applicable judicial precedent about the law.</p>
<p>you need to understand that NSA spying is relatively recent when you're looking at things on legal timelines - courts take a LONG time to resolve issues (they are inherently, and damn well should be, extremely conservative institutions), so the fact that this has been going on for 10-15 years is actually a point in favor of the &quot;the judicial system is working on it&quot; side of things. </p>
<p>eventually, something egregious enough may come to light and the court system will accept a lawsuit and modify the standing doctrines to allow it - this is how the law generally winds up evolving to address things. </p>
<p>for an example, abortion restrictions typically evaded another &quot;Justiciability&quot; requirement (this is the general term used to explain what each litigant needs to have in order to properly present a claim to a court) - that of mootness. Because, by the time an abortion restriction lawsuit came to the court, easily 9 months could have passed (and you didn't have a claim unless you were pregnant, because of the opposite justiciability requirement, ripeness, - no point fighting over an abortion law if you weren't pregnant) and, poof, there's no abortion to fight over. </p>
<p>So the supreme court changed the doctrine of mootness to account for this and the &quot;Capable of repetition, yet evading review&quot; exception to the (non-)mootness requirement was borne in Roe v. Wade itself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
