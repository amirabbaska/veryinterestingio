		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, warming up brings the body from its natural state of rest closer to its exercising state during training, performing etc. Essentially, it makes the transition from rest to exercise much more efficient as our heart rate is already substantially increased due to warming up.  Our blood circulation is subsequently increased, leading to increased delivery of oxygen and removal of metabolic waste products from working muscles. Warming up allows athletes to jump straight into performance without having to worry about the stage known as oxygen deficit, where the body literally needs to take in a greater amount of oxygen to satisfy the increased demand for oxygen by the muscles. </p>
<p>So to answer your question, a cyclist that has warmed up will be able to cycle harder and faster as their heart rate, blood circulation, respiratory rate and more are already substantially increased. A cyclist that has not warmed up will need an increased amount of oxygen delivered to working muscles to satisfy the sudden increase in demand. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most important reason for doing a warm up is to allow the body to prepare steadily and safely, thus preventing the possibility of an injury during the performance.  In case an athlete didn't do the warm up exercise and an injury like a hamstring strain did occur that will obviously affect the performance, otherwise a considerable difference in performance is highly unlikely.   Basically it's a matter of safety, gradually increasing the heart rate and circulation thus loosening the joints and increasing blood flow to the muscles. There is also a psychological factor that helps athlete when doing warm-up because it's an opportunity for the athlete to prepare mentally for the performance ahead.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough there might not be much of a difference. There was a study done with runners that showed that people who did warm up and stretch before running had the same rate of injuries as those who didn't. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well I'm no expert but I do play hockey. When I myself do not warm up the first half period of my game is warm up, and I only start playing at my full potential around 2/3 of the way through. Also I notice I have significantly less stamina the entire game, and it feels like I didn't get enough sleep. I'm sure It has something to do with circulation perhaps. Warming up also tends to put me into a mental mindset to where I at least feel more awake and focused.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's very much like a car, you let it warm up so the &quot;oil&quot; can do it's thing and go where it needs to. If you cold-start a car and then slam on the acceleration you can expect to do a lot of long term damage because it wasn't prepared. In this case, stretching or warming up allows the blood to pump a little quicker to where it needs to go. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
