		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You should look up some videos of Koko the gorilla. Not a chimpanzee, but worth the watch. She has so much caring and compassion and she knows sign language. She was upset when Robin Williams died. When her keeper found a sink torn out of the wall, Koko blamed a kitten. She is extremely interesting. The videos make me really think about how alike humans and gorillas are. Or for that matter, how alike humans are to any animals if you really watch their behavior. Definitely worth the watch for anybody with some extra time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Take an old Tandy 1000 from the 1980s with a dot matrix printer and ask why we can't just write a program that allows it to print high resolution photos. It's not just that the computer can't be taught how to do it, it's that it doesn't have the processing capability or the hardware.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't have vocal chords like ours. People have tried and, while they have learned to understand spoken language, they can't speak it themselves. They can and have definitely learned sign language though and even invented  and combined signs for objects they didn't have a word for yet(I think Koko the gorilla invented &quot;finger bracelet&quot; to refer to rings.) Macaques on the other hand do have vocal chords that can make human sounds but they don't seem to be smart enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chimpanzees have been taught sign language, but their abilities only rise to the level of a human 2-3 year old child. At that age, children produce what is called &quot;telegraphic speech&quot; which are simple 2-3 word sentences that lack grammatical complexity and variety. They do not use function words (and, if, or, but, for, etc) and use limited verb forms.<br />
Psycholinguists interpret this to mean that chimpanzees are capable of symbolic thinking (to understand how symbols refer to things and actions) but are not capable of grammar, which is the crucial part of language that gives it &quot;generativity&quot; or the ability to say the same thing in a variety of different ways, and to produce novel/original ideas.<br />
One of the main theorists on this topic is Noam Chomsky, whose claim is that that grammatical part of language is instinctual and unique to the human brain, embedded into what he calls the Language Acquisition Device.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, the idea that their vocal tracts prevent them from speaking is false: <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/12/e1600723" target="_blank">http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/12/e1600723</a></p>
<p>Second, it's not like nobody has tried to figure it out. There were attempts to teach them sign language, but they just don't seem to get it. They don't understand what the researchers want them to do, they don't even try to attempt imitating human words like some other animals do. The idea of verbal communication seems to be completely alien to them. The aswer will likely be found in their brains, but so far nobody will be able to give you a more specific answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
