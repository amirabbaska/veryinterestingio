Anyway, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4msj5s/do_we_suspect_there_are_galaxies_were_already/" target="_blank">this is the thread I intended to link earlier</a>; it goes over all the gory details that I either skipped or summarized (possibly sloppily).</p>
<hr />
<p>The big bang is the only naked singularity allowed to exist in the cosmic censorship hypothesis, which otherwise conjectures that all singualarities in nature must be behind an event horizon. (Also, just to clarify, modern physics is incapable of describing the universe before the big bang. Classical GR predicts that the universe has existed for a finite amount of time. Specifically, the universe has existed for all time t&gt;0 and that there is a spacelike singularity everywhere in space corresponding to the limit as t--&gt;0. It is meaningless to talk about what happens at or before t=0.)</p>
<p>In general, there are two very important horizons in cosmology, the particle horizon and the cosmic event horizon, which both exist for each point in space. (Each point in space has its own pair of horizons.) Implicit in the definitions of either horizon is that we are describing spacetime in cosmological coordinates. The particle horizon for a point P is the surface beyond which any signal emitted at the big bang could not have reached P yet. In other words, the particle horizon defines the boundary of the observable universe about point P. The cosmic event horizon is the surface beyond which any signal emitted now will never reach point P. In other words, the cosmic event horizon roughly describes the points in space we can still communicate with today. </p>
<p>The evolution of both horizons is very important in cosmology and intrinsically linked to the matter distribution of the universe and the density of dark energy. The distance to the particle horizon is always increasing over time in comoving coordinates but current evidence shows that the distance will asymptote to some finite number. In other words, there are galaxies we will never see at all. The distance to the cosmic event horizon, on the other hand, is decreasing over time in comoving coordinates. That means that eventually all we will see in the sky are stars in our own galaxy. </p>
<p>Note that these horizons are unlike the event horizon of a black hole. For a black hole, the horizon is a single surface in space and a universal and eternal feature of that spacetime. That is, every observer has the same horizon. The cosmological horizons are different at each point in space. </p>
<p>I have written more details about the cosmological horizons on this sub before, so I can get the link later once I'm not on my phone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Described by whom?  Singularities are just what happens when your maths no longer applies to the situation at hand and goes all wonky because your model is too simple and is missing important details; it's not something that most experts in the field expect to actually be a real physical thing.  You get singularities appearing in the maths for water spiralling down the plughole in your bath if you use simple enough maths for describing it, and although the maths says that the water right in the middle of the vortex spins faster than the speed of light, that's just a problem with the maths, not something that actually happens.  The same goes for the big bang and black holes; we just see singularities in the maths when we model space as being this smooth idealised thing that exactly obeys the equations of relativity, but space isn't smooth and isn't well described by relativity at those energy scales.  To extend the bathtub analogy, we reach a point where the water isn't a smooth, continuous fluid that follows fairly simple equations, but is better described as a bunch of molecules bouncing around and interacting in complex ways.</p>
<p>The best current understanding of the big bang is that there was a region of space with a large but finite amount of dark energy that inflated, and then the dark energy decayed into the normal matter and energy we see today, without there ever being a point where anything was at an infinite density.  The funny thing about dark energy is that it makes more of itself, since it makes more bits of space from the existing bits of space and the new bits of space also have more or less the same amount of dark energy as the old bits of space, so it doesn't get diluted as space expands.  This means you can start off with a tiny region of space with less than the mass-energy of 1/10th of a grain of salt (the plank mass) and end up with a much larger (though still small) region of space with the mass-energy of the current observable universe once all this dark energy has replicated itself many times and then decayed into normal particles.</p>
<p>Regarding event horizons, the universe doesn't really have one in the way a black hole has one.  It has horizons of a sort, but they're more conceptual than anything, and vary over time as the universe expands, pushing things further away from other things, and time marches on, giving things more time to reach other things.  It's less a matter of where you can or can't go, like with a black hole, and more a matter of what you'll find once you get there (or won't find once you get there, because space is expanding too fast to reach it no matter how far you travel or how close you get to the speed of light).</p>
