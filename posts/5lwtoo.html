		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You actually would know because the moon passes in front of the sun (eclipse), but the sun never passes in front of the moon. This is called occlusion and is a monocular depth cue (although it is a relative cue to depth, only telling you that one object is farther than another, and not an absolute cue which would tell you the distance to an object). </p>
<p>You may be asking about the effectiveness of stereopsis. This is the sense of three-dimensionality most normally sighted individuals with binocular vision experience when looking at the world. Stereopsis can arise from several cues including horizontal disparity on your two retinas (objects at different distances relative to your point of focus will project to relatively different areas of your retinas). You can also get the effect monocularly from motion parallax as in <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7P9t0eU_drQ" target="_blank">this</a> cool video. </p>
<p>Traditionally, it has been said that stereopsis is only for near vision and is effective to about 20 feet or so and after that vision is effectively monocular. However this isn't true. There just needs to be more distance between objects in order to achieve the same binocular disparity as they get farther away from you (<a href="http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2191614" target="_blank">Palmisano et al. 2010</a>) up to a resolution limit. This follows from simple geometry. If you know the distance between your two eyes and the angle at which they are rotated inward, you can compute the distance to an object and consequently the distance between two objects. The relative position of objects on your eyes also provides the same information. The closer two objects are to you, the smaller the distance between them has to be to produce the same binocular disparity (see intro in above paper for equation and clarification). Based on the minimum binocular disparity we can resolve, we should have stereopsis for about 1km out. Beyond that, binocular disparities are too small and eventually go to 0 (very distant objects have parallel projections).</p>
<p>Edit: I made a mistake. Corrected now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At large distances all that your eyes will see is the <a href="http://www.thermopedia.com/content/4761/2.gif" target="_blank">angular projection</a>. So absence of other factors (like albasri mentioned), you couldn't tell the moon size from the sun size. Another factor you would notice is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixroBOCm8M8" target="_blank">libration of the moon</a> as it sits at different parts of the sky versus its orbit. Notice you can partially see around the edges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the distance information we get ends up being from how the way things look to changes as we move, or the difference in how things look to our right and left eyes.  This is called parallax.</p>
<p>Using parallax to calculate distance is a function of a couple of things:  (1) the distance between measurement, (2) the position of the ojbect relative to the displacement,  (3) the angular resolution of the measurements.</p>
<p>The ability to detect depth variations also doesn't stop abruptly, but, instead, becomes less sensitive.  You can notice that something is 1 inch closer one foot away, but you can't detect the same difference at 100 yards.</p>
<p>Given the limits of human vision, and the distance between the eyes, for someone who's standing still, anything more than half a mile away might as well be at infinity.</p>
<p>But better vision and more movement can change that.  Astronomers can detect parallax into the hundreds of light years.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't assumed size also play a part in how we perceive variations in depth? Say the only information that I had was that the sun was 400 times larger than the moon. I would assume the sun to be further away from me than the moon because I perceive them to be roughly the same size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two issues here:</p>
<p>1) You don't just use binocular (two eye) depth cues (the sort that make 3d glasses work) to judge depth. You also use a lot of monocular cues that include all sorts of high level logic on a second by second basis. Such as your brain instantly knowing that a chair is far away not because of optical info, but because you know how big chairs usually are, and the size along + that semantic info = depth. So you cannot separate out the concepts of optics vs. logic and world knowledge. They are deeply intertwined. INCLUDING the knowledge that the sun is far away from your science background. That info is literally part of your depth judging processes itself. So in that sense, <em>&quot;there IS no maximum distance, as long as you have the knowledge that lets you know depth in any way&quot;</em> since knowledge is part of your depth system. You can know the difference in depth between objects you can't even see at all, and in a very real sense, that's the same system at work as the ones you use to navigate a classroom.</p>
<p>2) If you're talking only about binocular cues, then the maximum distance would be based on your retinal neuron precision. Both the precision of individual neural activation levels (they wobble and have noise, so whatever point the noise drowns out the tiny difference in signal beyond whatever confidence level you consider sufficient), and also the non-identical nature of your left vs. your right eye. I.e. unlike a camera sensor, your two eyes don't have perfectly identical photoreceptor layouts, so you could also end up with some noise/confusion about depth when you get down to the individual photoreceptor level of precision, due to differences in layout between the two not aligning helpfully. You also use many cells at once in your brain/retina to gain extra precision by averaging over noise. So..... lots of insanely complicated math would be required for any answer, and it'd probably differ a lot between individuals (also: near-sighted/short-sighted, cataracts... etc.)</p>
<p>But fun answer: &quot;When two objects get far enough away that the amount their images move from one eye to the other falls somewhere in the range of a small fraction of a retinal cell's distance on your retina, you couldn't use that cue anymore&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
