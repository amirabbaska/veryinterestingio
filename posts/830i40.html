		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Edit:</strong> [This is a better version of my words and more ELI5 friendly](<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/830i40/comment/dvew5ft?st=JEJDQCJX&sh=1006a123" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/830i40/comment/dvew5ft?st=JEJDQCJX&sh=1006a123</a> )</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong>...<em>In reference to another user’s deleted comment covering</em> <strong><em>THC, CBD, and TERPENES</em></strong> <em>(which I attempted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/830i40/comment/dvevgi0?st=JEJFMKSQ&amp;sh=f952a120" target="_blank">recreate</a> but is NOT as ELI5 as the first link):</em> This is a great answer and is exactly what I would have wanted to say.</p>
<p>To add. THC is the main psychoactive component, but other cannabinoids are responsible for many of the effects we usually attribute to weed’s effects.</p>
<p><strong>CBG:</strong> (Cannabigerol) is the primary precursor to the three major branches of Cannabinoids (except Cannabinol). It is the primary suspected small molecule responsible for the changes in interocular pressure and drainage from the eyes. The primary source of hearsay (as well as factual evidence) regarding cannabis as a treatment for Glacuoma. If I remember correctly this is also why you gain bloodshot eyes. CBG is also a very potent anti-inflammatory and may be just as or even more potent than CBD. It shows much promise in GI tract related inflammation. It has been purported to be a major contributor to <em>Synergy</em> in the plant when taken as a whole plant (ie <strong>Entourage Effect</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>CBN:</strong> (Cannabinol) is another Cannabinoids, but it is one of the only ones not derived from CBG. It also carries many anti-inflammatory influences on the body. The main momentum stems from analgesic (pain relieving) properties 3 times as potent as aspirin. This if validated could mean a whole new non-narcotic. Aside from pain relieve CBN is also characterized as a sedative in some circles. Being the main or contributing molecule to sedation caused by some plants. (All if you consume enough) </p>
<p>Lastly <strong>11-Hydroxy-Δ9-THC:</strong> (what Joe Rohan (Rogan) likes to call 11-hydroxy metabolite). This is the main molecule that THC become within your system. Although some THC can remain THC and is psychoactive in said state. 11-Hyrdoxy is way more potent and way more psychoactive. It’s responsible for the “vegging” out or “space walks” you tend to take if you ate your homie’s best homemade edibles or your first dive into the deep end of retail/medical high dosage edibles. It’s also why people tend to “freak out” if they have little to no tolerance and consume to much of an edible. More of this metabolite is made when you ingest cannabis due to digestion. </p>
<p>Hope this helps as an appendix to this awesome top level comment!!!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have ADHD. I like sativas and sativas only. I like to play my video games first person shooters during 'golden hour'. It's a stimulant like too much coffee without the nervousness/jitteryness, but breaks up train of thought, and affects your memory. Nothing, NOTHING works better to rid your nausea than a good sativa. Enjoy in small doses - once you start partaking ritually so much, it's a waste - take a tolerance break. For me, it's better to get SMASHED on Friday/Sat night than every night, but realistically I'd like to be un-sober every night - but that's a waste if you truly enjoy getting high. Tolerance break - get smashed is best, for me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
