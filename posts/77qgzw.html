<p>A common theory is that the brain is trying to make sense of the lack of signal (probably due to damaged hair cells) by cranking up the sensitivity, resulting in basically static noise. Imagine turning up the volume on the radio because you can't hear anything. But since there's no signal you just get louder white noise. </p>
<p>Regardless what it is though, there is no actual sound. Tinnitus ultimately happens in the brain, not the ears. Misinterpreting signals, or neural circuits thrown out of balance</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm probably late to the party here, but tinnitus is most analogous to phantom limb pain. When there is a (near) total lack of stimulation from a nerve, your brain makes up for the loss in one way or another. Just like the usual &quot;prescription&quot; for phantom limb pain is to stay active to keep your mind from dwelling on that lack of stimulation, white or pink or grey noise generators (I know they exist, just don't know the difference) can help calm tinnitus by stimulating the hair cells in your inner ear that detect sound at specific frequencies. This is usually the best option if you do not have appreciable hearing loss that warrants the investment in a hearing aid. Most people who suffer from tinnitus, though, <em>do</em> have hearing loss as well, so hearing aids that are programmed to help stimulate your hearing nerve(s) can work wonders in reducing (although not totally eliminating) tinnitus in affected patients.</p>
<p>Source; I am the husband of an Au.D and an engineer with interest in acoustics and hearing. We joke that I have an honorary doctorate, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nerve hairs inside the ear send signals to your brain that tell it what they hear. When there is hearing damage, some or more of these sensitive nerve hairs are broken off, and their signals go crazy instead of sensing an actual sound. The sum of all these broken hairs is the sound we experience as tinnitus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read a study last year that referred to it as&quot;hidden hearing loss&quot;, they found that in cases where people were around noises above 90db for extended periods tinnitus was often a precursor to permanent hearing damage. At least for people who work in loud environments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In permanent tinitus there is no sound, your brain makes it up. Some say the frequency of the sound is a frequency your ear cannot hear anymore but your brain expects it to be there. So by the lack of that frequency, your brain is confused and tries to compensate by creating this false processing sound. So if the hearing part is queried or checked by other parts it can tell them &quot;i'm ok, look at the stats, i got every frequency covered i suppose to have&quot;. </p>
<p>I got it proven by undergoing an EEG in a soundproof room staring at a white wall. The EEG registered brain activity in the hearing part of the brain. Meaning the brain was processing something that wasn't there.
There is a (experimental) treatment where they electrify the part of the brain responsible for the phantom sound so it overloads and &quot;breaks&quot;. The tinnitus will be gone for about 3 months until the brain recovers. Then it is time for a new treatment. I never tried that because i don't want to know what life is without tinnitus and get it back every 3 months.</p>
<p>Other treatments suggested are anit-depressant or anti-epileptic medication. How does that help? In order for a part of your brain to give an alert to your consciousness, the signals of that brain part have to rise above a certain threshold level so it is worth mentioning (if we didn't had those thresholds, we'd be overwhelmed by signals and go crazy). Those medications make that threshold higher so weak processing signals do not get to the threshold and never revealed to your consciousness. If they can get the threshold higher than the signals of the tinnitus, they wont go through to your consciousness so you wont experience them.
Extra info: that is what your body does during sleep, set the threshold higher. That is why you dont feel mosquitoes or spiders, the signals from your skin do not pass the threshold so it doesn't get passed on to your consciousness (which would wake you up)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
