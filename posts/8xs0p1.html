		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SLI stands for &quot;Scalable Link Interface&quot;, and it's Nvidia's name for the technology (ATI/AMD call it &quot;Crossfire&quot;). Basically, it's using two or graphics cards to split the workload up and increase your graphical processing power. </p>
<p>It <em>can</em> be good for gaming, but the trend is usually that a game at release is at the 99% support mark for SLI/Crossfire, and then after a GPU driver update or game update it becomes better. Some games benefit from SLI, some don't. Of course if you're doing two 1080s, then yes you're going to notice a performance over a single 1080, but it's a toss-up between two 1070s and a single 1080. Here's a site that shows some comparison charts: <a href="https://babeltechreviews.com/the-gtx-1070-ti-sli-vs-gtx-1080-ti-performance-review-35-games-tested/3/" target="_blank">https://babeltechreviews.com/the-gtx-1070-ti-sli-vs-gtx-1080-ti-performance-review-35-games-tested/3/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SLI is essentially NVIDIA's method of linking two GPUs together for a single output.</p>
<p>Is it good for gaming? That depends. Some games can see notable improvements, but in some cases you can actually see a decrease in framerate (though that's not very common).</p>
<p>Obviously it's more expensive because it requires you to have two graphics cards. They also have to be the same model (You can't combine a GTX 1080 with a GTX 970, for example). Not all motherboards support SLI. You can also bottleneck one if they're not EXACTLY the same, since the &quot;slower&quot; card will become the &quot;dominant&quot; one and the &quot;faster&quot; one will match it.</p>
<p>There's also the problem of micro stuttering, which can make frame rate wonky.</p>
<p>In general, you do tend to see an increase in performance, but it's not guaranteed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a technique to use two NVidia brand graphics cards (of the same type) to improve game performance. </p>
<p>The way it works is frame <em>interlacing</em>. While one card is preparing a frame to be displayed, the other already works on the next frame. This allows many frames to be displayed per second (smooth motion) even if each frame takes a long time to complete.</p>
<p>It does not help, and can worsen, the <em>delay</em> in getting a frame to the screen. If it takes each card 1/30 of a second to render each frame, and they take turns you may see 60 unique frames displayed per second. But if you do something, it will take (at least) 1/30 of a second for the results to appear on the screen. An updated frame after you move/shoot/whatever needs to be created from scratch.</p>
<p>It also never <em>doubles</em> the performance, and sometimes it works very poorly. So it’s usually better to buy a 1080 instead of 2x 1070s, for example. It will get you a performance boost which is more consistent and without the drawbacks of SLI. It’s also more power efficient and usually cheaper.</p>
<p>If you have an enormous budget, and you’re already getting a 1080Ti or other top-tier card, getting 2 of those is your only option for better performance because there’s nothing for you to buy that’s better on its own. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SLI stands for &quot;Scalable Link Interface,&quot; and it's nVidia's technology for linking up to four graphics cards together to produce a single output.</p>
<p>However, games need to explicitly support the technology, and with the advances made in GPU power these days, you don't really accrue much benefit from it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like everyone else said, it's NVIDIA's way of combining 2 graphics cards to run 1 game. The thing is, games have to specifically support it, or else the 2nd graphics card will be 100% wasted, and even when the game does support it, you need 2 of the exact same graphics cards and it won't straight up double your performance.</p>
<p>Something no one else has posted: <a href="https://www.geforce.com/games-applications/technology/sli" target="_blank">Here is NVIDIA's list of all games supporting SLI</a>, so if it's not on that list, you're wasting a GPU.</p>
<p>IMO, it's a meme that is becoming more and more outdated as time goes on, and it's not at all worth it. Not 100% sure, but I heard a while back NVIDIA used to go around and get devs to support SLI with the games they were making, and since they don't do that anymore it's becoming less and less popular.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
