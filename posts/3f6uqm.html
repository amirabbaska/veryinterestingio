Ken Griffey Jr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dale Earnhardt Jr. But I bet you've never met a woman who was named after her mother. I certainly haven't. Does a word for the female &quot;junior&quot; even exist?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><del>No, there isn't a female form of junior that I know of.</del> Female juniors do exist, but they're not very common. I think that's primarily because traditionally, women change their last names upon marriage, so they're unable to pass down the legacy of the same full name. If a woman named Jane Brown had a daughter named Jane Brown Jr., and Jane Brown Jr. married Bob White, she would then be known as Jane White. Also, let's say the original Jane Brown's husband died, and she remarried Joe Green. Now she's Jane Green, and her daughter is Jane Brown Jr., which doesn't seem to hold as much water.</p>
<p>Now, although there is no female form of junior, many families have the tradition of passing down middle names. A former co-worker mine had the middle name Nurse, and so did every woman in her family going back 6 or 7 generations. My mom made her middle name my first name, and her first name my younger sister's middle name. </p>
<p>EDIT: My fellow redditors gave me some good examples of women named Jr. Thanks guys!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Women name their daughters after themselves all the time. There's just no codified &quot;junior&quot; naming convention. Which is probably more to do with the fact that until recently, women didn't have public identities of their own that needed to be established. </p>
<p>Men use things like senior/junior and the like to establish who is who for public-facing purposes, like business. Since women were not supposed to participate in business or the public sphere, women didn't use these even if they were named after someone.</p>
<p>I have an old copy of a Ladies' Auxiliary charity cookbook from the 50s. All the recipes are attributed to Mrs. John Anderson, Mrs. Peter Jones, etc. rather than using the women's given names. These would have been very traditional women writing in an old-fashioned way, but it's still a great example of how little of their own public identity women had even as recently as the mid 20th century.</p>
<p>Nowadays, very few people name their kids after themselves regardless of gender, so it's less of a big deal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things to add to the discussion:</p>
<p>Thing #1: Beware that when you name your son after their father, with a Jr or II, you are REALLY risking the two's credit reports getting mixed together. Also happens with mail, and all kinds of official records. Not worth it, I would think, but to each their own.</p>
<p>Thing #2: Jada Smith technically named their son after herself...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>my friend is the eleventh woman in her family to have her name. her mom has the same first name, as did her grandmother, and so on. sometimes her family will refer to her and her mother as &quot;the eleventh&quot; or &quot;the tenth&quot; when trying to distinguish between them. i think it's pretty damn cool. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
