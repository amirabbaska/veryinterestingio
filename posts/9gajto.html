		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Albedo is the proportion of of light that is reflected off a surface. It’s low for things like pavement, and high for things like snow. Albedo has the ability to affect climatic systems (do a quick search on albedo feedbacks in the arctic). An example off the top of my head is how permafrost thaws more quickly with an absence of snow. The vegetation beneath the snow is able to absorb solar radiation that would normally be reflected by snow (high albedo). I would argue that there are possible consequences to covering our surface with solar panels (low albedo I suspect), yet it is most likely negligible at our current land use. Good question, sorry my answer isn’t more insightful</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://cleantechnica.com/files/2009/06/desertecsolar1.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is the famous pic about how much space you would need to cover power needs with solar. Of course it looks tiny but the logistics to get there would be insanely complicated.</p>
<p>While we certainly would need to install back-up panels and due to weather, day/night and so forth we would need to cover at least double that area but it's still tiny compared to total earth surface. So no, it will not have a measurable effect.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Since I'm getting this many replies, yes I'm aware that this is entirely hypothetical, the region is not stable, you would have huge loss of power due to long-distance cables, the projection is probably not all that accurate and so forth. I only wanted to make the point that covering your needs with solar would not have a negative effect on global temperatures (albeit yeah, I obviously don't have proof for this, no one really has). </p>
<p>And even if the area looks tiny it's still bigger than a small country, all filled up with solar panels. the logistics would be insane. I'm actually specifically against wasting money on solar and wind and use it for nuclear, especially IFR research / commercialization. And for US actually <a href="https://www.bauen.de/media/_processed_/5/2/csm_Gutex_Daemmung_a9df1b9624.jpg" target="_blank">insulating your homes</a> would just safe massive amount of energy, yes also in warm places because you then need less AC.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This particular effect would have no significant impact on the planet's heat budget, as opposed to the much greater effect of reduced greenhouse gas emissions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Around 20 percent of the energy, give or take, is converted to electricity, which is then converted to light, movement, heat or whatever. Eventually, almost all of this end up as heat somewhere. The 80 percent is either bounced back as light, same as if the sunlight hit the ground, or converted to heat in the solar panels. In fact, solar panels might have a lower albedo, i.e reflecting less energy as light, than the ground, thereby “heating the atmosphere more than otherwise”. However, if the alternative to solar is fossil energy, the greenhouse effect would have an even higher global warming impact than solar. By orders of magnitude. In the big picture, this is not a real concern, though. The amount of surface arena needed to cover our entire global energy consumption from solar is a fraction of a percent.  I have heard it can be roughly compared to the size of a fingernail, compared to your entire body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
