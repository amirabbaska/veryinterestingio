		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Destructive interference, such as that found in ANC earphones, <del>will</del> can, in theory, completely cancel the soundwaves it interferes with, hence &quot;destructive&quot;. The problem with super loud noises, however, is that they are beyond the capabilities of the headphones. They simply can't reproduce the right amplitude and frequency of sound needed to cancel the part of the sound wave that is going to harm your hearing. They might help, but they are far inferior to proper safety ear plugs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A jet engine is something like 140 dB. Decent noise cancelling headphones can cancel about 30 dB of ambient noise (this is approximately what the Parrot Zik 2.0 does, others may vary). Assuming it can cleanly cancel the noise (i.e. it isn't clipping or distorting due to the extreme volume of the jet engine), you still have 110 dB getting through which is serious hearing damage. Occupational health and safety typically requires reduction below 85 dB.</p>
<p>Add some extra cancellation due to the over-ear nature of the headphones, and if you have foam earplugs inserted, you can probably reduce by an additional 30 to 33 dB. So maybe you wouldn't go deaf. Good aviation or gun range ear protection probably works better.</p>
<p>This is all moot if you're saturating the microphones that are being used to compute the noise cancellation in the headphones, which is almost certainly happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
