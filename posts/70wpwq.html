		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, you get lucky. A number of things have to go correctly, and the terrain has to be correct for landing as well. If you fall on something like snow, and it is on a steep incline you increase your chances of surviving. Hanging onto debris can also help. It is all about the impulse of landing, so if you can get the landing to occur over a longer amount of time, then your body won't be subjected to the same forces. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that terminal velocity puts a limit on the speed at which you can fall. At some point the aerodynamic drag on your body reaches equilibrium with the gravitational attraction of the earth and you fall at a constant speed (ignoring varying atmospheric density). So while 33,000 feet sounds impressive, it's essentially no more impressive than 10,000 feet (discounting the substantially larger time that person spent in utter terror at the prospect of their impending doom). A person would reach terminal velocity even well before that point, although I don't know the exact number. Wikipedia claims 1,500 feet, just to get a rough idea.</p>
<p>So while yes, it's crazy that someone survived falling from so high up, the exceedingly high altitude didn't make them less likely to survive than someone who fell from, say, 2,000 feet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In 2007 a guy fell 12,000 feet (bit over two miles) and punctured his lung and had a broken ankle or some other minor bone breaks - He had a camera mounted on his harness, I think?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neN71Sg_o0w" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neN71Sg_o0w</a></p>
<p>I imagine that there's not a lot of difference between 33,000 and 12,000 feet, in terms of likelihood of death. You'll hit terminal velocity either way and air resistance will buffet you slower on the way down depending on where you are. Then depending what you land on (pavement v.s. thick foliage/sand/water) you've got quite a varying set of odds.</p>
<p>After 33,000 feet it does get really <strong>cold</strong> so I guess there's that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
