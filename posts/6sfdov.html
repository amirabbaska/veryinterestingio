		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>None as best we can tell. </p>
<p>People like to say stuff about specific nutrients and your body knows and etc but there's literally zero worthwhile proof or evidence of it.</p>
<p>Cravings in pregnancy tend to take two forms. One form is generally for &quot;high energy&quot; foods. Calling this a craving however is a bit much, it's not really a craving, they're just hungry and high energy foods make people feel good.  This can be a bit unusual for folks, since growing a tiny human requires more resources from someone's body than normal.</p>
<p>There's also something to be said here for that food just plain tasting good. food is tied to emotional responses for people (and pregnancy hormones fuck with that like nothing else), and tastebuds change during pregnancy. If someone wants chocolate or pickles or whatever it probably has more to do with those things being tasty than &quot;your body magically knows it's short on magnesium!&quot; or whatever. </p>
<p>The other sort of craving is pica. It's not exactly particular to pregnant women, however pica isn't really all that well understood. however there's a reason it's classified as a mental disorder, not a nutrient deficiency and why treatment doesn't consist of &quot;here take this multivitamin&quot; . Brain chemistry and etc is fucky enough under normal conditions, let alone during pregnancy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two thoughts on why it happens, both are probably somewhat correct. One is that hormone production changes during pregnancy and that stimulates the desire for certain things. For example, as a woman's insulin levels drop or rise their body wants certain things that will adjust those levels. Some women report that they experience changes in tastes or desire for food in relation to menstruation, another time that hormones fluctuate.</p>
<p>The second reason is that pregnancy is very physically demanding and it's necessary to increase both blood volume and nutrients. The brain is a very greedy organ and initiates cravings to not only supply the body and baby with nutrition, but to meet its own needs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tricky ELI5, but during pregnancy your body processes food differently. For example, you absorb up to 6X more nutrients from your food. You also have changes in hormone levels and energy requirements, and overall you desire more food. It is unlikely you are lacking a specific vitamin, mineral or amino acid, but this is the most common interpretation: 'the body' needs something it doesn't have. For the majority of cases the most likely explanation is that it is an evolutionary trait that no longer serves its original purpose, like waking up during the night to tend the fire (now we just wake up and pee and/or go back to sleep). Your body 'wants' energy and you desire food, but the type of food you choose might be something weird (eg pickles); it's not really the type of question biologists can decipher easily, but it's quite interesting if it's happening to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have an anecdotal reply -- when I was pregnant, I found myself craving fennel grass. You know, that tall plant that looks like asparagus fern, and smells like licorice? I used to eat the really tender inner shoots. After I had my son, I found out that fennel increases milk production. As it happened, I didn't produce that much milk and after three months I had to switch to bottle-feeding. I've always felt that I might not have been able to breast-feed at all if not for the fennel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
