		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three main ways to stop a program.  </p>
<p>You can quit from inside the program. The program does whatever it's programmed to do when you click quit, saving data and closing files and such normally.</p>
<p>You can use End Task (on windows), this is the operating system sending a signal to the program that tells the program &quot;Time to quit, finish what you're doing and then exit.&quot;.  The program (hopefully) responds to the signal, finishes up what it's doing, saves data and such, then quits.</p>
<p>You can use End Process (also Windows).  Windows just ends the program, and frees up any memory associated with it.  There's no communication with the program.</p>
<p>In terms of the other guy's restaurant metaphor:  Quitting is finishing your meal then paying up and leaving, end task is being told to pack your shit and leave, and end process is being thrown out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

That's closing a program normally. Now when you end task. They bring in some bouncers and kick your ass out before you get to pick up any of your shit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always heard it explained this way. Closing a program normally is akin to being in your car driving down the interstate @ 70MPH, taking the off ramp, braking slowly, coming to a complete stop, shutting the engine off and exiting the vehicle.<br />
Ending the task is like having someone throw a cinder block through the windshield while driving @ 70MPH. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the main parts of a desktop application is called the &quot;message loop.&quot; It is code that continually runs, checking for new messages from the operating system or other programs. Messages include things like user input (you clicked a mouse or pressed a key) as well as other notifications that an application is supposed to respond to.</p>
<p>One of the messages that you can receive is the Quit message. This is how the operating system tells an application that it should shut down. The application should respond to this message by trying to exit in as graceful a manner as possible - for example, giving the user a chance to save any unsaved work. This is generally the same flow as normally exiting out of the application.</p>
<p>Selecting &quot;End Task&quot; from the Task Manager in Windows sends a quit message to the application and then relies on the application shutting itself down. Because it's up to the application to handle this, there is a valid response which is &quot;No.&quot; For example, if you have an unsaved document the application might ask for confirmation if you want to quit and you could click no. So the OS does not actually enforce that the quit message results in the application terminating.</p>
<p>However, if the application is in a bad state this message might not ever be received, or the application could still fail to shut itself down. In that case, the operating system can terminate the program by simply not running its code any more and unloading all of its code and data from memory, as well as cleaning up any shared resources it was using such as files or network ports. This means any saved work will be lost so it is the method of last resort. The OS will generally ask you if you want to terminate a process in this way if the message loop stops running for an extended period of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Programs usually have various operations to do before they shutdown. If a program is frozen, it is unable to perform/finish these operations, and does not shutdown. 'End Task' closes it regardless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
