In stars, deuterium and protons are fused to create helium-3 without the production of a neutron, in the second step of the proton-proton chain reaction. Wouldn't deuterium-proton fusion be the much better choice, considering they have the same amount of electrical repulsion, wouldn't generate power in the form of neutrons, and are much cheaper?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difficulty in fusion is over coming the positive repulsion between protons in the 2 nuclei. The closer 2 nuclei get, the more the protons push each other away. Sounds like you're probably aware of that, and also aware that the only way to overcome this barrier is the strong nuclear force exerted by all nucleons at close enough range. Thus, isotopes with more neutrons in their nucleus fuse more readily, because their is the same amount of electric (Coulomb) repulsion, but additional strong nuclear force to bring them together.</p>
<p>In stars, the pressure is huge, and the temperature is huge, but the real key to fusion in stars is sheer number of atoms. The  odds of two nuclei passing close enough to fuse is ridiculously low (hence the sun burning hydrogen for 10 billion years), but because there are so many of them, they over come the probability issue. If the odds are 1 in a million, and you have 10 billion, you're going to have a lot of events (these aren't the real numbers; but it gets the point across).</p>
<p>In fusion reactors on earth, we don't (currently) have the luxury of an excess number of particles or lots of time for the reactions to occur (the National Ignition Facility for example uses a DT mixture to initiate a fusion reaction that lasts a few billionths of a second). So we need all the help we can get from the fusion materials. Its basically stacking the deck! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason is because deuterium-tritium fusion has <em>by far</em> the lowest triple product of <em>any</em> fusion reaction. The triple product is a quantitative statement of the necessary conditions that are required in order for the reaction to reach ignition (self sufficiency). In its most common form it is the product of the temperature, density, and confinement time of the plasma. The larger the triple product, the greater the temperature, density, and confinement time have to be, and the more difficult the reactor will be to design. </p>
<p>Deuterium-proton fusion has a far greater triple product than deuterium-tritium fusion. When you say that both reactions experience the same Coulomb force (electrical repulsion), you are correct, but you have to take into consideration the mass of the particles experiencing this force. A tritium nucleus is 3x as heavy as a proton, which means that if both experience the same force the tritium nucleus will only decelerate at 1/3 the rate of the proton. If it takes 3x longer to slow down, its much easier for the two reacting particles to &quot;crash&quot; and fuse. Of course, fusion is very much a quantum phenomenon, but the intuition given by this classical physics holds. Additionally, deuterium-proton fusion produces less than half the energy per reaction, meaning that more reactions have to take place to compensate for heat loss from the plasma (which is roughly the same in both cases). This drives up the triple product of the reaction substantially. </p>
<p>If you really want to do aneutronic fusion (fusion that does not have a neutron as a product), then the best candidate is deuterium-helium-3, since it has the lowest triple product of all a-neutronic fusion reactions. It is still an order of magnitude above deuterium-tritium though (which means it is at about 10x more difficult to achieve).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
