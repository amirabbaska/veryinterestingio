		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The phenomenon you are describing is called sudden brief unilateral tapering tinnitus (Yes it is called SBUTT for short) and the cause is unknown. There are some theories according to this article <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/08/what-causes-ringing-in-the-ears-tinnitus.html" target="_blank">What Is This God-Awful Ringing in My Ears?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But what causes these phantom sounds? No one knows for sure, but there are a few theories. One involves the small muscles that attach to the three bones in the ear. These bones conduct sound vibrations, which get transferred into the inner ear and converted into neural impulses to the brain; the nearby muscles can help dampen sounds that are too loud, Dr. Jethanamest says. It’s possible that if one of those muscles spasms — kind of like an eyelid twitch — it could pull tightly, making your ear feel “full” and blocking external sounds. You hear a high-pitched sound, and then the spasm stops.</p>
<p>Another theory involves misfiring neurons of the small sensory cells in the inner ear, known as hair cells. These cells move in reaction to sound waves, which trigger the release of electrical signals to your brain, which it interprets as sound. If one part of this production line is messed up, you might hear something weird. “Maybe there’s just some slight change for half a second and some of those firings are a little bit off or changed a little bit in the neural activity, and that’s what creates that one-second thing that you hear or you feel,” Dr. Jethanamest says.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody fully understands tinnitus. In some cases, tinnitus has a logical explanation: hearing loss will sometimes cause it, which makes sense in the same way that phantom limb pain makes sense. However, things like aspirin and TMJ can cause it as well...and why a musculoskeletal thing in the jaw can cause your ears to ring is beyond me </p>
<p>If the ringing persists, however, <em>see your doctor right away</em>. There are very few ear emergencies, but sudden changes in hearing is the biggest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cells bearing cilia (hairs) in your inner (middle?) ear that detect pressure waves (sounds) in the air get damaged from over-stimulation, ie very loud noises (in my case, anyway.). For some reason, they can't turn off and keep sending signals even when there's no external stimulus. Lots of combat vets come home with this condition, I understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question. I've always noticed this happening when an older tube tv was turned on near me - my ears would start to ring and over 30-60 seconds the sound would &quot;normalize&quot; (I have no other way to describe it) and just disappear. Not sire if it went away or just faded into the background as my body processed the new sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello, Massage Therapist here. There are a few muscles on the front of your neck that are typically responsible for that ringing. The main one, (sternocleidomastoid) connects from the middle of your upper chest, (where the sternum and clavicles meet) to the back of your head just behind your ears. If this muscle is tight it can cause that ringing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
