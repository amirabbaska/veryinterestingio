		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The smell is indeed a type of distress signal. This has been studied and confirmed. However, the signal is not for other plants, it is for insects. One job of the secreted compounds that give out the smell is to act as an insecticidal against the plant eating insect and the other effect is to attract other insects - parasitic wasps to come to the rescue and lay eggs in the herbivorous insect eating the plant.</p>
<p><em>I doubt that these secreted compounds can be detected by other plants</em> </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to signal to other plants, as well as to insects. In many cases, these volatiles trigger plants from <em>other species, even distantly related ones</em>, an well as nearby members of the same species.</p>
<p>However, the response time is pretty long. It's tough to quantify, but it's almost certainly longer than it takes you to mow your lawn.</p>
