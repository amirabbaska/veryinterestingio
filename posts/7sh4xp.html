		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Starting with dental, dentistry was not something that doctors used to perform. Teeth pulling was actually performed by barbers! And there was no other options than pulling. So once we got dentists, medical insurance didn't want to touch them. They weren't sure of the future costs, or what was reasonable, and people didn't expect to see the dentist enough to need to deal with insurance.</p>
<p>For vision, vision insurance, for the most part, only covers routine or preventative care. Glasses, contacts, annual exams. If you have a significant eye issue, glaucoma for example, the treatment would be filed under medical. So vision insurance isn't insurance at all, its more of a savings plan for eye care. The money you pay is used to pay the doctors later, minus a small fee, or the doctors just agree to give you a discount as arranged by your vision plan. It can be useful as your vision plan can haggle for discount services/goods for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure why this is the case but you also need a dental plan attached to your health insurance policy for coverage here in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Prices are set by the government though and they're relatively affordable (e.g. A check up is €21, x-rays are €16,  filling a cavity is somewhere between €50 and €100)</p>
<p>Dental insurance adds around €15 to your health insurance (which should normally be around €90 per month) so lots of people just pay for dental treatments separately.</p>
<p>Edit: for those who are interested in a Google translated list of Dutch tariffs... Here you go: <a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&nv=1&rurl=translate.google.nl&sl=auto&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://www.tandarts.nl/tandartstarieven/2018&usg=ALkJrhiHbuMEaHI372BlZDcSbf4-bE9eMQ#preventieve-mondzorg" target="_blank">https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&nv=1&rurl=translate.google.nl&sl=auto&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://www.tandarts.nl/tandartstarieven/2018&usg=ALkJrhiHbuMEaHI372BlZDcSbf4-bE9eMQ#preventieve-mondzorg</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very complicated problem here. When dental treatment is a covered benefit from a government program, eg. Medicaid or similar programs for low income people, the reimbursements for the care giver are pennies on the dollar and cannot support a practice. Since many (not all) dental pain and disease is caused by preventable habits, there is stigma attached to disease.  But tell that to the 7 year old child who is in severe pain due to an abscessed tooth.
Even with “good”dental insurance plans, the yearly maximums are around $1500. An amount that has not changed in many decades. This is NOTHING when faced with even a few teeth needing complex treatments.
The reality is that employers are not going to provide expensive coverage for dental benefits, the government is certainly not interested in providing good dental coverage for even its most needy citizens and dentists are not interested in going out of business trying to treat people.  Good dental health = good luck + good habits or $$$.
If things are to change, there has to be a huge paradigm shft and I don’t see it happening soon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
