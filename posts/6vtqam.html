		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would also be interested to know. Over the years I've read reports of the &quot;Ubermensch&quot; sleep schedule that hews to this principle, but I've never seen any peer-reviewed research of it. I do know that inventors such as Edison are reputed to have slept only in short bursts, but I do not know if that's fact or just speculation.</p>
<p>Good question; hopefully someone will pipe in with a comprehensive answer!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nah. A sleep cycle lasts around 90 mins and has 5 stages. Biological functions differ per stage. Allowing your body to through the entire cycle in maintaining your body's fitness as well as mental performance since it's during deeper sleep that your brain really processes memories.</p>
<p>The time of day you sleep is important too. At night, you go through the deep sleep stages longer while lasting only a few mins in the earlier stages especially with succeeding sleep cycles.</p>
<p>15 minute naps are only okay as naps. Taking another nap an hour later won't resume the previous sleep cycle so you lose the benefits of undergoing whole sleep cycles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>So get enough sleep, rather than max/min-ing this aspect of your life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I did this.  There were some hiccups, but it was pretty great once I got used to it.  I stopped though.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, it can't work, your brain would melt and it's impossible.&quot;</p>
<p>(anecdote:  A friend did it.  She didn't have any problems outside of being bored, and her spouse's frustration at the regularly scheduled naps interfering with socialization and recreation.  Me?  Depression kicks my ass too hard for me to deal with being sleepy.  I have enough trouble wanting to lay in bed all day as it is.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
