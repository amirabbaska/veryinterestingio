		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Processing video to make it look better takes time. This increases the delay between when the signal comes into the TV and when it gets displayed. If you're watching a TV station or a movie, all the TV needs to do is delay the sound by the same amount. You're not going to care about a fraction of a second delay. But if you're playing a game, you make some input via a controller and expect the see the results of that input immediately. A fraction of a second delay can be very annoying. So, game mode skips the processing, reducing the delay but making the quality worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest thing game mode does is turn of the chip that processes the video to make it smoother and have less noise on normal TV viewing or movies. This can have a huge response on the TV response time at the expense of, in some cases like your describing, the <em>smoothness</em> of the images.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in CG/production, and personally I <em>only</em> run my TVs in game mode.</p>
<p>Game mode puts the image right through to the screen. Exactly as it was intended when it was painstakingly made. Boom. There it is.</p>
<p>Then come along the people who make TVs. &quot;Oh, you know what would make video better? Cranking the saturation up to 11 because nuance is stupid, adding tons of extra fake frames to make the motion weirdly smooth because obviously more frames is always better, and lets also make the brightness levels wobble around like a drunken sorrority girl dancing on a slick bartop, because that's <em>dynamic.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>I hate all that shit. So much. It makes even the most carefully crafted work look like shitty soap operas directed by Michael Bay.</p>
<p>But yeah. All that shitty stuff takes time to process, which means shitty lag for your games.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I purchased a Sony Bravia 4K TV to go with my new ps4 pro, and I have been looking for the answer for this, I feel like it looks worse when I switch it to game mode, and I question if I'm looking at a sharper image than a regular ps4 image all the time. I haven't gotten one of those moments where people go &quot;look how much better this looks on the ps4 pro!&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If youve played many computer games, you probably have seen the anti-aliasing option in the graphics menu. Higher anti-aliasing looks nicer, but requires a faster processor. If you have a slower one, you can turn it down or off. The game won't look as nice, but it'll run better.</p>
<p>The &quot;game mode&quot; is the same idea. Turning it on reduces the quality of the display, but improves performance.</p>
<p>Note that it doesn't do the same thing as anti-aliasing, i was just using that to demonstrate the idea with something most people would  be familiar with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
