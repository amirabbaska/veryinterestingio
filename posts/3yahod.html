		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The truth is that books smell good for the same reason you can get high from sniffing glue! In both cases the odor (and kick) you feel comes from a bouquet of different volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MnF4Lsl.png" target="_blank">nicely summarized in this infographic</a>. These compounds come from the adhesives used to tie the books together, from the ink used to write the text, as well as from various byproducts that form as the cellulose fibers and the supporting network of lignin in the paper start to break down. Because those last byproducts only form gradually over time, the smell of a book will also slowly change until you get that slightly sweet and musty &quot;old book smell.&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question: why do trading cards smell good? If anyone plays any trading card games, you probably know what I mean. That fresh pack of Magic cards smells so good. Also, I noticed a change in the smell of fresh Yugioh cards at some point. I'm not sure when, but classic yugioh cards smell fresher than ones released later. </p>
<p>Edit: I guess this was answered. It's the glue that holds the several pieces of paper together that make up a card. I didn't think there would be glue involved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I use to only choose books from the library based on their smell partially because I couldn't force myself to keep reading a book that I thought smelled bad but also because I theorized that the oils from peoples hands made the books smell better to me (i actually had a pretty high success rate that a good smelling book was a good read)... is there any truth to this?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
