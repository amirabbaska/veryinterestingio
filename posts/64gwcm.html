		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Resonance frequency.</p>
<p>Microwaves operate at a frequency/energylevel designed to heat water in a food.  If you deviate either of those, then your microwave will actually take longer to cook food.</p>
<p>But that frequency/energylevel can also be shared with other objects.  Some of those will absorb the waves just as readily, if not more so, than water.  This is where our nonmicrowave safe container labels originated.</p>
<hr />
<p>Check this out.  It's for neutrons, but the concept translates for any particle.  <a href="http://nuclearpowertraining.tpub.com/h1019v1/img/h1019v1_113_1.jpg" target="_blank">http://nuclearpowertraining.tpub.com/h1019v1/img/h1019v1_113_1.jpg</a></p>
<p>The neutron is created at a high energy on the far right, and has a low chance of interaction (cross section) with a particle.  But as it collides, it loses energy.  As it loses energy, it has a higher chance of interaction.</p>
<p>Those peaks in the middle?  That's the Resonance Absorption Region, and it's where a microwave is designed to work.  In that area, we have a very high chance of the neutron just getting absorbed.  </p>
<p>In a reactor, that's bad, the neutron was wasted and didn't cause a fission.  In a microwave, it's good.  We just heated the water up even more.</p>
<hr />
<p>Next.  Heat propagates through materials differently.  So yoru plate might heat up just as quickly as the food, but the hot spots spread out very quickly and burn your hand when you grab the rim.  </p>
<p>An option for you, add a little water before you microwave something, especially if it's drying out.  The free water will boil and the steam will heat up your food as it rises through it.  It'll be a lot faster than trying to boil just the internal water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves induce rotation of water/fat molecules at the atomic level, which generates heat. If your food is frozen the rotation doesn't occur very well. The portion of the food touching the plate thaws first, allowing the free molecules to move. So most of the heat is generated right where the food touches the plate. Hence the plate gets hotter than the food. </p>
<p>The material of the plate or possible coating might conduct heat very well allowing that plate to absorb more heat from this process, which will also make your plate feel much hotter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the different materials (plate vs food) absorbing radiation differently and heating differently one should also consider how we perceive temperature. Your skin does NOT measure temperature, it senses the transfer of heat. </p>
<p>For example if you go into a room with a wooden table and a metal chair both are the same temperature (room temperature). However if you touch the metal chair it feels much colder. This is because metal can transfer heat much faster than wood, as a result the heat leaves your hand and flows to the metal chair very fast leaving your hand feeling cold. </p>
<p>If you stood in outer space without any clothes on you would not feel cold as there is nothing for you to transfer your heat to, you will slowly radiate heat in the form of light but this would take a long time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>if your plates and bowls get hot in a microwave you shouldn't put them in a microwave. They'll get brittle and may even break in there. There's dishes that are made for microwaving, they're not usually more expensive either, just get them instead. Glass usually is best</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all depends on what the plate (or cup) is made of.
Some stoneware can get very hot. Hotter than the food on it.</p>
<p>If I remember right, the amount of iron in the ceramic or glaze can make a big difference. I know a few people that gotten rid of coffee  cups because of this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
