		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In WWI the combatants lobbed enormous volumes of artillery shells at each other, to not much effect (on a per-shell basis, at least): it's estimated that over a hundred shells were fired for each combat fatality during the war. The ineffectiveness was because the shells were mostly impact-fused, meaning there's a little gadget in the nose of the shell that is deformed on impact, setting off the explosive charge in the shell. This detonation, while quite fast, still took a little bit of time, during which the shell would usually bury itself into the earth. When it finally exploded, the surrounding dirt absorbed most of the force and shrapnel.</p>
<p>Artillerists experimented during the war with timed fuses instead of impact fuses, set before the shell was fired. The idea was to calculate how long the shell would take in its path through the air, and set the fuse to burst the shell while it was still a few meters in the air. When it worked, this was extremely effective and greatly multiplied the destructive power of the shell. The problem was that it was very difficult to get right and rarely worked, resulting in the shells usually exploding high or in the ground anyway.</p>
<p>In WWII, the British invented a device called the cavity magnetron, capable of generating high-energy radar waves. The secret of the technology was given to scientists in the United States, who embarked on a project of miniaturization and mass-production. The end result was a device that cost $18 and could be screwed into the nose of an artillery shell and used to trigger the detonation. This device (called the &quot;VT fuse&quot; misleadingly) could be set for a variety of ranges.</p>
<p>The original purpose of the VT fuse was for anti-aircraft work; hitting a moving target directly with a shell was essentially impossible, while detonating nearby required precise estimation of altitude and proper setting of a timed fuse. With a VT fuse, it was only necessary for the shell to come with 60 feet or so of the plane and it would detonate.</p>
<p>But it also occurred to the developers that it could be used to air-burst shells, with the radar reflection from the ground detonating the shells at extremely precise preset altitudes, causing massive destruction to whatever/whoever was underneath. While the VT-fused shells were used by naval vessels from 1943 onwards, they didn't appear on the battlefield until their first use in late 1944 during the Battle of the Bulge (and <em>very</em> handy they were then, an under-appreciated reason for eventual American success in the battle). The navy got them earlier because of security concerns - the US didn't want the Germans or Japanese to get their hands on a fuse that had failed to fire, but over water this would have been virtually impossible. By late 1944 it was clear that Germany was finished, so even if they had acquired one of these fuses it would have taken too long for them to reverse-engineer it and put it into production.</p>
<p>Bonus factito: the cheap miniaturized cavity magnetrons eventually made an appearance in consumer goods - inside the microwave ovens we all have now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an impact detonation (bomb that explodes when it hits something), that &quot;something&quot; absorbs most of the force of the impact. If it is the ground, a majority of that force is transferred into the ground and some of it is reflected back up into the air (think of a ball bouncing off the ground, it bounces back in the air at a very similar angle that it impacted the ground). For harder targets where you want to concentrate the force in a smaller area, this is the technique you want to use.  </p>
<p>In an air burst bomb (using either a timed fuse or a radar proximity fuse) the shockwave travels toward the ground, is reflected by the ground, similarly to the ball theory and meets with more shockwave. The meeting of this ground reflected shockwave and the Air shockwave change the direction of travel of both and causes them to run parallel with the ground. This amplifies and shockwave and pushes it outward, away from the central point of detonation with more force. </p>
<p>Fragmentation damage is an effect in both cases. In impact detonation the frag is reflected upward and out from the ground (since it impacted the ground first) and is slowed somewhat by the contact with the ground. This is the desired effect for harder targets.  In an air burst the frag pattern is directed toward the ground with more force (initially) and then pushed outward by the outward directed shockwave. This is more desired for softer targets (vehicles, radars, personnel). </p>
<p>Alternatively in a delay burst, the weapon impacts first and then a set time delay is executed prior to fuse actuation. This allows the velocity of the weapon to penetrate harder targets so that it may detonate inside the target. This is useful for concrete, buildings (sometimes depending on construction), armored targets (depending on the weapon), tunnels or bunkers. </p>
<p>There are caveats to each of these situations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>USAF Ammo Troop here (we build all of the ordinance that's dropped by aircraft)</p>
<p>Depending on the fuze, guidance unit, mission requirements, payload, purpose of the munition, etc. , you're able to set the fuse to when it should detonate, HOB (height of burst) for how far above the target it should detonate, or even set the fuze to wait after impact to detonate, and build the bomb accordingly to allow penetration before detonation. (Big ammo troop pun) search BLU-109 on YouTube. </p>
<p>Reason I mentioned guidance units, is depending on whether or not it can be controlled from the pilot or ALO on the ground, they're able to guide the munition and detonate it as they see fit. </p>
<p>To fully answer your question as to &quot;Why&quot;, it totally depends on your target. If it's a soft target, say personnel or just normal trucks, it's easier to use an air burst with small metal projectiles (brass normally I think) that will essentially shower the target with shrapnel. This can even be applicable with heavier targets, such as tanks, because there's certain types of shrapnel that can pierce straight through armor or even engine blocks. </p>
<p>A good example would be to search a flechette. They're like small little steel darts that are used as airburst shrapnel for personnel targets. We used this early on in the war, and back then the size wasn't regulated by NATO. Meaning each size of the flechette differed, some much larger than others. There were reports of targets being literally crucified to trees - so NATO demanded the regulated size of them to now be a 1/4&quot; long. </p>
<p>I may be off very slightly on some things, but that should answer your question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before fancy fuses, everything hit the ground and exploded. The problem with this is that when something hits the ground it takes a little tiny bit of time before the fuse can tell the explosive to go bang. By that time, especially in soft ground, the explosive is now slightly in the dirt. When it goes bang, the energy wants to go where it is easiest to go. So a lot of it goes up and out of the dirt. This makes a cone shape extending upwards from the explosive. The problem is that people and thing at ground level aren't in that cone. So most of your explosive is wasted unless you got really close. </p>
<p>Then people figured out how to make fuses explode pretty much whenever they wanted them to. So now we can use that explosive as well as all the sharp bits of metal along for the ride (shrapnel) to be more useful. </p>
<p>Anti-aircraft and missile defence applications explode in a cloud of shrapnel when their guidance tells them they are close enough to the target. This increases likelihood of hits to control surfaces, fuel, engines and electronics. </p>
<p>A lot of anti-personel applications also allow for airburst usually on a timer or range. This allows the warhead to send shrapnel downwards and means people hiding behind walls or in trenches aren't really safe. </p>
<p>Most anti-tank missiles use a shape charge warhead which requires a precise distance from the armour in order to be most effective. Most will have a long pointy bit on the end to trigger the warhead at this distance. It may therefore appear like it explodes before hitting the target. However some specialized munitions have various range finders that cause detonation if they are close enough. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With a ground burst, a lot of the explosion energy is used up by the ground/material very close to the explosion center.    An air burst can cause damage over a larger area, but causes less destruction at the explosion site than a ground burst.</p>
<p>It becomes a question of strategy.  Does the attacker desire to damage an entire city or level a single block?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
