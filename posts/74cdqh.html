You can buy these types of tests at chain stores and pharmacies. These types of tests are even being advertised on TV! Wow! Would someone explain the science behind them? I want to know if these are accurate or if they're a hoax.
Additionally, does the testing for these kits work the same way that other DNA testing works (like those used by detectives to identify a criminal)? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you don't already know DNA must be copied as cells grow and reproduce. The DNA you have inside you is a copy of a copy of a copy and so on. Now this copying is usually very reliable but sometimes a mistake can be made. These mistakes will also be copied as cells grow and divide. These mistakes can also be passed on to your children and your grandchildren. Passing on these mistakes allows them to spread and become common within specific groups of people. However, these mistakes cannot spread easily to other people in other places. This means different people from different places will have different sets of DNA mistakes.</p>
<p>In modern times, scientists have made tools to see these mistakes in people's DNA. By doing so they can compare the mistakes in one person's DNA against the DNA of other people. By doing so they can make very good guesses as to where your or anyone's ancestors are from. It isn't perfect, but it does work.</p>
<p>The tools used to identify criminals are usually different. There are many different ways scientists can look at all the ways someone's DANA is unique. Which one they use depends on how much money they have and what kind of information they need.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These companies sequence your DNA (typically only certain parts of it, such as the genes). They then look at mutations in your genome, and compare them to data from all over the world, which allows you to break down your ancestry. For example if you have a bunch of mutations that are very common in japan and nowhere else, the test claims you have Japanese ancestry. It's not a hoax by any means, but it's not perfectly accurate either. </p>
<p>Forensic tests are different. They don't test for relation between you and other people around the world, but test if two DNA samples are from the same person. They look at a small number of regions called short tandem repeats (STRs), which are regions where short patterns of DNA repeat many times. Mutations happen often in these regions, changing the number of times the pattern is repeated. Forensic testing counts the number of repeats in these regions and compares it to a sample they collected from a crime scene. If they match, it's a good indicator the sample from the scene might belong to the suspect. This kind of testing isn't all that useful for genealogy, since mutations happen often and there are so many variations that it's hard to establish regional patterns    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to note is that most tests these days (may change in the future) only sequence a small amount of your DNA. The major consumer DNA testing companies will look at only a small subset of markers in your DNA that are known to be <em>highly polymorphic</em>, meaning that they are likely to vary between people, often referred to as <em>genotyping</em>. This will be on the order of hundreds of thousands to several million positions (out of 3 billion in your entire genome). </p>
<p>How do we know where the differences between people are likely to be? There have been efforts in recent years to sample DNA from people from many all around the world and store it in publicly available databases - the two biggest projects are called HapMap and 1000 Genomes. Companies such as 23andme and ancestry.com are also continually collecting such data and building their databases. From these, it is possible to look at these DNA markers and see: which are the markers that appear in certain ethnic groups way more often than in others? (Note: When we talk about groups/populations here, we mean groups of people living and breeding with each other, different from what geographic/political borders may be.)</p>
<p>Ultimately, this means that when you want to know what your ancestry is, they can take your DNA data and compare it to the previously collected data and see: do you have markers that are known to belong to specific populations? The more closely your DNA matches patterns observed earlier, the more confident your assignment will be. </p>
<p>Of course the major caveat here is that your ethnicity prediction is only as good as the data available. Most available (in most fields of human genetics) comes from European populations, so you may be  able to get a more precise answer if you are European than Asian. There are other more minor experimental caveats (ie, errors in sequencing) that can happen as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They first take samples from certain geographic locations from people who claim to be 100% native from there.  They collect enough data to perform some statistical analysis to identify which DNA markers are most prevalent among those who claimed 100% native and compare how unique those markers are from other datasets from other countries.</p>
<p>So by the time you spit in a cup to get your DNA analyzed, it's being compared to control groups that the company has already identified in its research.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But their &quot;native american&quot; stretches from alaska down to the southern tip of chile.
