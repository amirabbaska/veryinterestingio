		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, it will actually be a much shorter time, but the exact time depends on the speed of sound through the material of the pole.</p>
<p>For example, a pole made of steel would have to be about 6100 meters long for it to take one second for the other end to move. This is because of how quickly a wave can propagate through a medium.</p>
<p>A wave can (generally) move faster through a solid than through either a gas or liquid.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/sound-speed-solids-d_713.html" target="_blank">Here is a handy table that includes some common materials and their respective <del>speed of sound's</del> speeds of sound.</a> </p>
<p>*edit:
We call it &quot;the speed of sound&quot; because that is how most people conceptualize what is going on, but in actuality sound is just a wave that is propagating through the air.</p>
<p>We don't have to be able to perceive a sound for a wave to actually be present. A more accurate way of thinking about the speed of sound would be how quickly a wave travels through a medium at a given temperature and pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The push would propagate from one end to the other at the speed of sound (speed of sound in the material).
If you consider the pole to be a wooden pole (say beech wood)and the axis of the pole is along the grains in the wood , then we have</p>
<blockquote>
<p>YOUNG'S MODULUS OF BEECH WOOD ALONG THE GRAINS : 14 * 10^9 Nm^-2</p>
<p>DENSITY OF BEECH WOOD: 680 Kgm^-3</p>
<p>Therefore speed of sound: 4537ms^-1</p>
<p>Time before other end of the pole moves: 75.6ms</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My question is: does the energy of the matter wave not decrease through released heat as it moves down the length of the pole? Is there a length of pole long enough to where pushing one side has no effect at the opposite end? Does the pole heat up? Does the pole get more dense at some point?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I feel stupid.   I was an art major.</p>
<p>Are you guys saying when I push a steel rod from one end, the opposit end does not move at the same exact time?   there is a delay?   How can that be?   What is the term I should google to learn about this?</p>
<p>EDIT: thank you everybody for the awesome answers. I'm looking at the world in a new way right now!  It's like a free acid trip.   </p>
<p>So here's a follow up question...   </p>
<p>Would it be true to say when I push on the hull of a cruise ship, I'm denting it?
(Temporarily and very shallowly of course.).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. 343m/s is only the speed of sound in air at atmospheric pressure. In metals and other harder objects, the speed of sound (i.e. the transverse vibrations of molecules) increases. It's different for all materials but steel is about 5400 m/s give or take</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
