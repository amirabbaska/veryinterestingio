		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>E=hf
E=6.6261 x 10^-34 * 0.00000060 meters         [0.00000060 being yellowish light]
E=3.97566 x 10^-40 joules</p>
<p>E=mc^2
m=E/c^2
m=3.97566 x 10^-40 joules / 299,792,458 m/s
m=1.3261374 x 10^-48 kg</p>
<p>At most it would take about 1600 psi to break a strong bone, or around 28,573 kgs/ square meter.
If your average human male is 1.9m^2 for surface area, an instantaneous force from light hitting him needed to completely crush him would be about 2 times the &quot;kg/m^2&quot;.</p>
<p>28,573 kg/m^2 * 1.9m^2 = 57,146 kg</p>
<p>So, the number of photons will be (L)...
L=57,146 kg / 1.3261374 x 10^-48 kg
L=4.3092066 x 10^52 photons</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>43,092,066,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 photons ALL impacting him at the same time from every direction to break his bones and smush him up. That's minimum for if he's only made of bone, flesh would be WAAY easier. But I'm not doing that. I have grade 12 homework to do. Good night reddit.</p>
<p>EDIT: After reading through some replies I realized how narrow minded science folk seem to be. He doesn't want your &quot;Well you see it won't cause&quot; answers. He wants a number. Even if heat would kill the man, CRUSH HIM! CRUSH HIM WITH LIGHT!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I can find, it takes about 5000 N to crush a human skull. I imagine the rest of the human would also be crushed under similar pressure. Light pressure is about 300 MW/N, so that comes out to 1.5 TW. For comparison, the total power consumption of the US in 2005 was 3.34 TW.</p>
<p>That being said, a much smaller amount of light could vaporize someone's skin, causing it to expand rapidly and crush them with the force of expansion.</p>
<p>Edit: A human weighs about 700 N, so to throw someone around you'd need over 200 GW, which is around the average power consumption of the first stage of the Saturn V rocket.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Side note, those little light bulbs that have a spinny thing inside don't use the momentum of light to turn. </p>
<p>The light heats the dark side more than the mirrored side, and the tiny amount of gas inside the bulb bounces off at a higher temperature (speed). This is what causes the spin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans require pressurized dive suits beyond about 100 ft of depth, which is roughly 4 atmospheres. Lets bump this pressure up to 10 atmospheres and say that the human would be sufficiently crushed  to death (i.e. bursting cardiovascular system and etc). </p>
<p>10 atmospheres = 1 megapascal of pressure. </p>
<p>Other assumptions are:
Surface area of a human ~ 2m^2
Indestructible box with perfect mirrored interior etc ~ 3m^3</p>
<p>There are a couple ways to think about how light exerts pressure.</p>
<p>We can think of the pressure of a classical wave absorbed by the human. In this case, the pressure or force exerted by the wave is </p>
<p>P = Ef/ c xcos(theta), where Ef is the flux in watts/square meter, c is the speed of light, and theta the angle of incidence. </p>
<p>We want a pressure of 1Mpa, so we require an energy flux of 3x10^14 watts per m^2. That's the same amount of energy you'd receive if you were 270 meters from the surface of the Sun. If you were using a man-made lightsource to shine on all 2 square meters of human, it would take 6x10^14 Watts of energy, which is 30 times the world's energy consumption in 2010. </p>
<p>Naturally, at that distance from such an energy source you'd be totally vaporized by the light itself.</p>
<p>Lets imagine you had a 100% superconducting superreflector that was indestructible to damage from light (but would not prevent you from being crushed). Instead of being absorbed, the light now bounces off, which transfers twice as much momentum as light which is absorbed. So we need half the amount of Watts per square meter, which we would find around 390 meters from the sun. </p>
<p>So, wearing your fancy suit, strapped to the outside of a spaceship that's stationkeeping at 390 meters from the surface of the sun, you'd be crushed to death by the radiation pressure. </p>
<p>But that's fairly inefficient. It would be far easier to use a big collecting surface, concentrate that sunlight into a box somewhere, and fill the box with light (and humans) until all the light crushed all the humans. </p>
<p>From Wikipedia, &quot;A body in a uniform radiation field (equal intensities from all directions) will experience a compressive pressure. It may be shown by electromagnetic theory, by quantum theory, or by thermodynamics, making no assumptions as to the nature of the radiation (other than isotropy), that the pressure against a surface exposed in a space traversed by radiation uniformly in all directions is equal to one third of the total radiant energy per unit volume within that space.&quot;</p>
<p>While the theory behind the above statement is complex, the application isn't. The pressure is simply a third of the energy per cubic meter.  </p>
<p>Let's suppose we build, in orbit around the Earth, a collecting dish with 10 square km of area. Pointed at the sun, it collects 13.6 Gigawatts of energy. Since our collector also uses sunlight to stationkeep around a lagrange point, it can only reflect 20% of the light it receives from the sun into our crushing chamber ( it uses the other 80% to deflect sunlight at different angles to produce thrust and correct its orbit). </p>
<p>Also, because our chamber is leaky, it lets out a bunch of light - say 90%. Even with these conservative estimates, our 2m^3 chamber reaches 1.5 MPa of pressure after only 30 seconds in operation. After 5 minutes, the pressure is in the tens of MegaPascals, enough to start crushing and deforming brass metal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
