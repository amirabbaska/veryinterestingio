		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The analogy I like, as an electrical engineer, is making a stack of objects of equal weight. Imagine stacking bags of flour from the bottom up. I think this is a pretty accurate analogy, as lifting an object gives it potential energy, the same way charging a battery gives it potential energy.</p>
<p>First, imagine you have one bag of flour on the floor. Then to put a second bag under it, you have to lift that one bag the height of the bag below it. Pretty easy! To put a third bag into the stack, you now have to lift two bags to the height of one bag, and put the third under. A bit more difficult. Then for a fourth bag, you're lifting three bags to the height of one bag, and so on. It gets progressively more and more difficult to put an additional bag of flour under the stack, because you're lifting another bag each time.</p>
<p>For a bit more accuracy, consider you only have a certain amount of energy per unit time. Like, you can only ride a bike so fast. So let's say you power the flour lift system with a 10-speed bicycle! The first bag is possible to lift in the highest gear, (the one that lets you go the fastest). For the second bag, it's too heavy, so you switch to the next lowest gear. You have to pedal longer to get the wheel to spin the same amount, that is to cover the same distance, so it takes a longer time to lift the two bags. Then you change gear again for each successive bag, so you can pedal at the same speed, but as a result, it takes longer to lift each successive bag.</p>
<p>Edit: To those who mentioned the water level/pressure in a column analogy, I fully agree with you that it's a more accurate representation of the system, and it's the way I usually try to explain it to engineering students. So if you're interested in a more mathematically consistent explanation, do check out the comments below! And indeed, the power and energy concepts are not totally consistent here, so if you're an engineer/electrician/etc., I understand if you disagree with the explanation. In the interest of ELI5, I think something more discrete, like stacking objects, and one a child may have held in a grocery store, is easier to understand than a constant-pressure pump with an increase in water pressure at the bottom of a column as the water level rises, as far as RC type circuits and exponential rates are concerned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Coyote is preparing a spring loaded boxing glove in order to catch the road runner.</a> At first it's easy to press the spring back into it's 'loaded' position, but the closer he gets the more effort he has to put forth. As he nears the hook it takes all his strength to move a few inches. The same is true with these batteries. Basically, as it increases in charge it must overcome more and more resistance, so the battery charges slower the closer it reached max charge. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Batteries do not charge linearly. The fastest portion of charge happens at the beginning. Without getting too sciencey, this is because the rate of charge is based on the difference in charger voltage and battery voltage. The larger the difference, the faster the charge. As the battery charges, that difference continuously gets smaller, so it charges slower. This is demonstrated in the following chart: <a href="http://www.progressivedyn.com/images/page_graphics/charge_wiz_curve.gif" target="_blank">http://www.progressivedyn.com/images/page_graphics/charge_wiz_curve.gif</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, this comment is generic lithium-ion battery information. It is not Tesla specific. </p>
<p>It is for safety and for extending the lifetime of the battery. A battery pack can be destroyed and may catch fire if even one cell is over charged. Most Li-ion chargers use two charging methods. </p>
<p>First, a constant current is applied until the battery reaches around 4.2 volts/cell. That is the fast charge. </p>
<p>Then the voltage is maintained at 4.2 until the current has dropped to a certain level- somewhere around 10% of fast charge. Then charging ends. This second charging method takes longer because as the battery becomes charged the current naturally drops because there is a smaller difference between the charging voltage and the open circuit cell voltage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you want to understand how Tesla Supercharging works by reading analogies on Reddit. Reading the first couple of analogies is easy and gives you a basic understanding of the subject. To gain a better understanding you need to read more analogies, however the more you read, the more you lose the will to read analogies, and the harder it becomes to learn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
