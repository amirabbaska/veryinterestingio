<p>It's hard to feel this force as it's very subtle in commercial aircraft. </p>
<p>An example is if you hold a cup of water and spin yourself around with your arm and cup extended. You will notice the water will pull to the outer most side. With enough speed you can actually turn the cup to its side, with the bottom of the cup outward, without spilling a drop. </p>

<p>The centripetal force of the airplane making its turn is the force that simulates gravity.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I'm a pilot and I think I can answer your question. </p>
<p>In the cockpit we have a little instrument called a turn coordinator that looks like a little plane above a curved tube with a ball and fluid in it. Most airliners, for the safety and comfort of their passengers will perform &quot;coordinated turns&quot;.</p>
<p>before we continue you must know that to turn a plane you need to be able to alter the yaw, pitch, and roll of a plane.</p>
<p>Most people think that to turn, pilots just roll their aircraft to a side, and that the plane just follows. However, the plane can't actually turn effectively like this (and it would lead to the aformentioned spilled drink). During a turn we actually pull up slightly and use the rudder to make the plane turn faster. if we properly combine our control inputs, we perform a coordinated turn, in which the force pulling your to the outside of the turn due to inertia works together with gravity to make the force you feel go straight through your seat, and not straight down.</p>
<p>Remember the instrument I talked about? Well, that instrument helps us perform these turns. By keeping that little ball and fluid right in the middle of the tube, it indicates that we are performing a coordinated turn.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, I'm on mobile at the moment, so can't really do this too thoroughly, but here goes.</p>
<p>The airplane is banked by ailerons, and yaws with the rudder. In any &quot;standard&quot; (not just standard rate or 3 degrees per minute) turn you'll experience in a commercial flight, the bank and yaw are input to perform a coordinated turn. The long and short of this is objects on the plane will feel as if they are being pulled &quot;down&quot; through the vertical axis of the plane rather than down to the ground.</p>
<p>So imagine you're in a car. If you have a cup of water and initiate a turn, the water would spill to the outside of the turn. If this happened in a plane (too much yaw, not enough bank) this would be called a skidding turn. If you were to apply only bank with no yaw, the airplane won't really turn (it won't turn very well, but it will turn) this would be the same as just tipping your cup. This is called a slipping turn. </p>
<p>Back to the coordinated turn. Imagine the first scenario where you're driving a car. You initiate a turn to the left. The water wants to spill out to the right. If however the road at this moment banked to the left such that the &quot;tipped&quot; angle now counteracted the centrifugal force of water spilling right, no water would spill out. </p>
<p>That's how it's done. You can look up coordinated turns in airplanes. There's tons of info on this and it's one of the first things you'll learn in flight school. Also, one of your main instruments is the turn coordinator that shows if you're skidding, slipping, or coordinated. </p>
<p>Sorry I can't spend too much more time on this. As a former CFI, I'd usually do this with drawings and charts and pictures, and then we'd do a demonstration in the plane. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
