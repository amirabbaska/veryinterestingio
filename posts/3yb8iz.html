		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I guess you got a million answers, but hey, here's another.  </p>
<p>It's a slate. Or clapperboard. Either name works, I call it a slate, because common versions of it are, well, a slate of chalkboard.  </p>
<p>A lot of them come as whiteboards as well, so any dry erase marker can be used.  </p>
<p>Fancier ones are electronic and can write metadata into your camera or something. Never used one of the electronic ones but I know they exist.  </p>
<p>Anywho, the basic function of it is scene labeling AND audio/video syncing.  </p>
<p>See, when you usually record a video with, idk, your phone or a dslr, you don't really need a slate because the device records the audio and the video from the same device, meaning it's writing the audio and video into the same file. Which is fine, if your video project only needs one camera.  </p>
<p>But let's say you're recording with a boom mic. Like, one of those mics you see in those 'behind the scenes' with the big fuzzy thing.  </p>
<p>Cameras usually have an integrated mic, but is shit in most situations. If you want to record someone's voice, you gotta get in REAL close with a boom mic. Trust me, even when recording people in a small room where the camera barely fits in the corner of the room, you <em>still</em> need a good shotgun mic to get quality audio. Mics that are integrated on the camera, or even just a generic stage mic will get you bad results because they pick up EVERY damn sound in the room, including the hum of the fridge.  </p>
<p>And I know what you're thinking. &quot;Just edit in post&quot;. Not audio. Sure, you can squash out some of the hums and background noise with something like Audition or some other sound software, but the more you edit sound, the more it distorts, <em>especially</em> when you try increasing audio levels.  </p>
<p>So, having a decent shotgun mic that you can have pointing right at the actor's mouth that's like 1 cm off screen makes a world of difference.  </p>
<p>Sometimes I've even had to use those lapel mics (the little clip mics people usually use on the news or whatnot), so that records audio on its own source.  </p>
<p>So, when you got different audio sources, having the slate reallly helps. &quot;Clacking&quot; it is used for syncing the audio. When I edit video/audio, and I'm taking audio from multiple sources, I stick it all on my timeline, view the waveforms of the audio, and just look for that spike in the waveform that's the &quot;clack&quot;. Just make that shit line up on the timeline and gg, synced audio.  </p>
<p>Another function it serves is a visual cue as to what scene and take it is. Usually you got someone else taking notes, like what takes were the 'good ones' and which ones were shit. Ok, so, you do that, you give that list of good shots to your editor, (which is usually me), and I don't have to sift through 100 shit takes to find the 10 good ones. It helps. A lot.  </p>
<p>It also prevents an editor like me from trying to figure out what shot is what. If I can just look at the first 2 sec of a video vs the entire thing to figure out A) what shot it is and B) if it's even worth keeping, that saves post-production a LOT of time.  </p>
<p>One other thing slates serve is a light level adjuster (the technical term escapes me). Slates are usually black and white, but some have color along the top. If you're in a room that has those god awful orange lights from the 17th century, tuning your camera to 'true white' helps a LOT. I mean, jeeze, the difference is night and day. It turns yellowish colors to, well, true white, and colors are actually, ya know, colors and not this muddy yellow-orange color. Sure, I can also fix this in post, but it's always best practice to get as good of an original shot as possible. Garbage in, garbage out. Get good shots and don't expect it all to be fixed in post, cuz not everything can be fixed in post (in a reasonable amount of time).  </p>
<p>You have your 3-4 audio sources, you have your director call silence on the set, everyone preps to spit out their lines, guy steps in with the slate labeled with what scene it is, the camera adjusts its white balance from the slate, the slate 'claps' so that I can line up all of the audio sources, camera records, and that's it. It's a simple tool that makes post SO much easier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The clapperboard serves two purposes.  The first, as stated by others already, is that the visual and audio are easier to sinc when you can look for the moment the board goes &quot;clap&quot; and sink it to the &quot;clap&quot; sound in audio.</p>
<p>It also tells you during editing which scene, take, and camera you're looking at.  Post production work is done days or weeks later for small productions, months or even years later for major films.  Even if the editors were present for filming they may not remember what happened or in what order.  It helps the directors and editors know which takes they're using when the film is cut together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

That's why it makes a snapping noise as well as being clearly visual.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is called a &quot;slate&quot; by the professionals, it is called a slate because they were originally slate and were written on with chalk. </p>
<p>The purpose for them was to create a unique &quot;event&quot; in time for two separate devices to capture both visually and audibly. The assistant director (or 1st AD) would call &quot;roll sound!&quot; the mixer (aka A1) would engage the audio recorder. Once the audio machines motors began to turn he/she would reply &quot;sound speeds!&quot;</p>
<p>Then the AD calls for the assistant cameraman (or 1st AC) to &quot;Roll camera!&quot;. Once the 1st AC has verified that the camera was rolling film, the 1st AC would reply &quot;Camera speed&quot;. </p>
<p>At this point the 2nd AC will hold the slate in front of the camera and call out the scene information &quot;Roll 1, Scene 1, Take 1 Marker&quot; (closes the slate <em>clack</em>).</p>
<p>If for some reason either the camera or sound recorder was not &quot;speeding&quot; during the slating process, they would need to re-slate to insure that a unique event in time was present on both devices. The AD would then call &quot;Second Sticks!&quot;</p>
<p>Not much in this process has changed over the years, the slates have become quiet advanced. Here is mine, it is a Denecke TS-TCB with wifi and LED screen.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slate/Clapper.  Often information about the scene #, the take, the director and DP are written on the slate so you've got a record of what you're about to see (unless it's done after a shot in which case it's called a tail slate).  As others have said, the <em>snap</em> sound when the slate closes allows for easy syncing of audio and visual.  Side note - even on shoots where audio is built into the camera, a slate is sometimes used when multiple cameras are present. This allows the editor to sync the cameras in post production. It's hard to get perfect sync between cameras visually (easy to be off by a frame or two) but the sharp, percussive <em>snap</em> gives a reference point by which you can connect the same frame of each cameras media.</p>
