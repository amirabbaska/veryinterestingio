		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a way to think about this problem that was--IIRC--in Stephen Hawking's <em>A Brief History of Time</em>. </p>
<p>Imagine a big famous actor walking through a room. They travel at a constant speed that we'll call A. The actor always moves at speed A, no matter what. When the room is empty, they're able to walk into the room and out of it easily in a straight line. </p>
<p>However, if the room is full of people then the actor can't walk in and out of the room in a straight line. They keep moving at A, but because of the people they have to bounce around and take a much more circuitous path to get out of the room. This means that despite remaining at A the entire time, it took them <em>longer</em> to get out of the full room than the empty room.</p>
<p>The same is true with light. The light doesn't 'slow down' in water. The light's still moving at c. However, water is much more dense than air or a vacuum, so in order to make it through the water, the light has to take a much more circuitous path. Despite never changing speed, we as an outside observe perceive the light taking more time to cross through the same distance as a difference in speed, rather than what it actually is: the distance having changed. </p>
<p>Then again, I'm not a physicist, so this could be wrong, but I think it serves as a good ELI5. </p>
<p>Edit: I’m seeing a lot of comments that this explanation is either wrong, too oversimplified or some combination of the two. As I said, I’m not a physicist, and am only repeating what I’ve heard from what I believed to be a reputable source. I would encourage anyone reading this to also look at the discussion underneath this comment and in the rest of the comments as well. Just because I got the most upvotes doesn’t mean I’m right. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people on here saying things that are decent analogies but aren’t true, others are simply sharing flat out false misunderstandings. </p>
<p>The light goes into the water. The water is made up of molecules and empty space between them. When traveling between molecules, light is traveling at its universal speed of c. </p>
<p>However when a photon of light hits a molecule, it is absorbed. The energy spends some time affecting the molecule—maybe with movement, or electron energy level alterations, etc. Then the photon continues, popping out the other side at speed c. </p>
<p>So yeah if you measure entry time and exit time you would say, “light slowed down in the water.” But thats not true at all. It simply took some breaks to hang out with the local folks on its path. </p>
<p>TL;DR—Light is just bar-hopping, always driving the same speed but stopping for a drink at a few molecules. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Feynnman lectures have a good example.of this. Don't have time to search for a link but it's on the refractive index or permittivity stuff. </p>
<p>It comes down to the light wave cause atoms in the new medium to oscillate at the same frequency as the incoming wave. They oscillate out of phase however. It turns out the addition of the original wave and the induced waves sum up through super posistion to be a new wave with a lower wave speed in the medium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, but I have to step in. I have a degree in physics, however, I was never a good student. But I'm pretty sure that light actually do slow down.</p>
<p>I don't know how to eli5 this, but the speed of light is not constant. It depends on Permittivity, Permeability of the medium. Basically, how easy electric and magnetic field 'travel' through the medium. <a href="http://www.reciprocalsystem.com/rs/satz/permit.htm" target="_blank">equation 9</a></p>
<p>In water, or any other medium that is not vacuum, the Permittivity and Permeability are higher, and thus the speed of light is slower. I'm not a good enough physics student to actually understand why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
