		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your bladder has a layer of muscle that helps it empty. When your bladder fills up, this muscle is more likely to squeeze, which is helpful when you’re trying to pee. Sometimes it squeezes while you’re still holding on to your urine, and this can feel uncomfortable or even painful. This muscle contraction stops after a few seconds.</p>
<p>Some people have this bladder squeezing problem at all hours of the day, not just when they are full of urine, and are generally pretty miserable as a result.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have two sets of muscles that control the flow of urine out of your bladder- internal and external. The internal urethral sphincter stops the leakage of urine from the bladder. As the bladder stretches, signals are sent to the brain to let you determine if it is an appropriate time to empty your bladder. </p>
<p>If it is, you voluntarily allow the external urethral sphincter to open and you'll pee. If it's not a good time to go, then your brain overrides the stretch receptors for a while and tells them to calm down for a bit. The process is repeated as the bladder expands. </p>
<p>If you wait too long, eventually you'll have no control over the external muscles and you'll pee no matter what. Or, worst case scenario, your bladder can burst if there is a blockage preventing the release of urine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The smooth muscle in your bladder has what is called the 'stretch-relaxation response'. Initially a special area at the base of your bladder is stimulated, causing the need to pee. Then the bladder will self expand outwards to decrease pressure by increasing its volume, meaning the sensitive area is stimulated less, and the need to pee subsides. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have different sets of muscles that help empty your bladder. One is controlled autonomically (I️.e. you can’t control it voluntarily.) When your bladder distends, your parasympathetic nervous system sends a signal to the muscles in your bladder to contract and internal urethral sphincter to relax. Your nervous system will keep periodically sending these signals until you willfully relax your external urethral sphincter or the pressure in your bladder forces open that sphincter (you pee your pants).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
