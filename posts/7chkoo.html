		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tl;dr: Most likely at least a decade. Probably more.</p>
<p>u/ninjawrangler hit a lot of the biggest issues in their post, but I wanted to add with my own experiences with graphene.</p>
<p>I'm currently doing my master's research on graphene, and that includes producing my own for my experiments. I make mine using CVD (chemical vapor deposition), which essentially produces the graphene onto a substrate (in my case, copper). I regularly produce samples that are ~6 cm^2 (1 in^2). Evidence suggests that the CVD process can be scaled up very well. There <em>are</em> a few issues with CVD graphene, though. It can be difficult to produce &quot;pure&quot; mono-layer graphene. You need <em>very</em> precise control over your conditions, which is hard to do. The end result is that you get mostly mono-layer graphene with some add-layer spots. </p>
<p>Another process is exfoliation. This is how graphene was first &quot;made.&quot; Literally just peeling off layers of graphite with scotch tape until you were left with a single layer. Produces higher quality graphene than CVD, but almost impossible to make large areas.</p>
<p>The other issue with getting to &quot;every day&quot; graphene use is how to transfer it from the substrate you grow (or exfoliate) it on to the substrate you want to use it on. Currently, for CVD graphene, we have to use a process called &quot;wet transfer&quot; to get it from the metal substrate to something useful. This can take upwards of 24 hours and would be completely unfeasible to use in a manufacturing process. The goal (and this is what my research is on) is to develop &quot;roll to roll&quot; (R2R) transfer of graphene from its growth substrate to the target substrate. This is... rather difficult. There are a lot of factors that go into it, which is why it's currently a research focus for a lot of groups around the world.</p>
<p>So basically, to answer your question, I think we're at least... 10 years from seeing increased graphene usage in &quot;every day&quot; life. Probably longer for it to become &quot;common.&quot; If you wanted more info, I have some research papers I could send your way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest issue is producing large enough &quot;sheets&quot; of monolayer, monocrystalline graphene so that it can be useable. That is the graphene I assume you're talking about, that can behave like a super conductor and has no band gap. Some scientists can make monocrystalline graphene, but the largest I've read about (and this is probably outdated) was only a centimeter or two in diameter. Many places can make &quot;graphene,&quot; but it has impurities, multiple layers, polycrystalline variations of the pure, monocrystalline graphene that has the super properties everyone reads about. If any one has corrections feel free to make them, I only worked with it for a little over a year so I'm by no means an expert.</p>
<p>Tl,dr: it's hard to mass produce the really conductive graphene everyone wants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you're an audiophile, maybe you'd be interested in <a href="https://www.ora-sound.com/" target="_blank">headphones</a> incorporate graphene in the sound-producing membrane.</p>
<p>If you play tennis, you can get a <a href="https://www.head.com/en-GB/sports/tennis/technology/graphene-xt/" target="_blank">tennis racket</a> that has graphene.</p>
<p>If you're a cyclist, you can potentially get a <a href="https://dassi.com/product-range/interceptor-graphene" target="_blank">bicycle</a> that has graphene in the frame</p>
<p>If you play golf, you can get clubs that have graphene embedded in the shaft.</p>
<p>If you ski, you can get <a href="https://www.head.com/en-GB/sports/ski/technology/graphene/?_ga=2.127386825.572423212.1508361804-1851373932.1508361804" target="_blank">skis</a> with a graphene core.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
