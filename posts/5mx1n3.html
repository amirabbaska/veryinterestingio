		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It turns out that lightning doesn't know where the high points are, although there isn't obviously a reason why they wouldn't since both the cloud and the ground are oppositely charged.</p>
<p>When the cloud conditions exceed some threshold (or there is some other initiation process e.g. cosmic rays, it isn't well understood exactly how it starts) then small scale discharges start. These discharges are called leaders and they come from the cloud downwards along the largest electric field gradients. </p>
<p>What they physically are is the visible artifact of the ionization of the gas along a path. As electrons are accelerated by the high fields of the strike they ionize and excite gas they encounter, this makes the gas glow and also leaves behind a conducting trail that takes a short while to dissipate.</p>
<p>The leaders travel something like 40 or 50 metres before stopping, this is the distance it takes for the motion of the charged particles in the streamer to cancel out the initial electric field and thus halting the streamer. Charge continues to accumulate at the end of the streamer though and eventually the field once again reaches a level where a new leader can be launched. Often the same point can emit several leaders in different directions which causes forking of the bolt, although they will always be roughly directed down since that is where the field gradient is pointing.</p>
<p>In this semi random way the strike works its way towards the ground, until it gets close to something, preferably something conducting. Now it is far far more likely to strike if the object is already charged enough to be emitting something we call a corona discharge, this means there are already charged particles in the vicinity of the object which lowers the resistance of the air and thus becomes a preferred path for the leaders. It is for this reason that both tall and conducting objects are likely lightning strike points since that is where charge on the ground will want to accumulate.</p>
<p>Once a leader reaches the ground/tree/church then there is suddenly an electric connection between the ground and the cloud (remember each leader left behind an ionized, conducting channel). This path of low resistance allows a huge amount of charge to be transferred between the ground and the cloud and that is the very bright part of a strike, called the return stroke. While the leaders have tens or hundreds of amps the main strike will have millions. Also even though the leaders may have formed many branches only the first to connect with the ground will have a return stroke, another reason why high objects get struck is that they can be reached quickly by leaders. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dukkO7c2eUE" target="_blank">I would highly recommend you watch this incredible video (or any others) of the leaders and the return stroke in slow-motion that should make the whole thing clear.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cloud actually sprouts &quot;feelers&quot; ahead of the actual lighting strike. These are lower strength/higher resistance paths because they don't connect much of anything: just the cloud to the air. They tend to branch out like a bush, in random directions. </p>
<p>Air itself is a pretty good insulator. What these feelers do is ionize a path through the air, thus making it much more highly conductive. </p>
<p>Once one of these random feelers makes contact with the much higher electrical potential of the ground or a solidly grounded object like a tower or tree, the full lightning &quot;strike&quot; actually travels from the ground upwards towards the clouds.</p>
<p>Story Time:</p>
<p>I was once in a small boat on Lake Oahe with my father and brothers. We were surprised by how rapidly some storm clouds blew in and were putting away our fishing rods when my father yelled &quot;get down!&quot; and nearly dropped his graphite fishing rod in his haste to put it away. He had received an electrical shock in the palm of his hand from the rod. A feeler had touched him. </p>
<p>We all feel very lucky that none of us got struck by lightning as we rushed to shore that day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does lightning strike from the sky down, or the ground up?</p>
<p>The answer is both. Cloud-to-ground lightning comes from the sky down, but the part you see comes from the ground up. A typical cloud-to-ground flash lowers a path of negative electricity (that we cannot see) towards the ground in a series of spurts. Objects on the ground generally have a positive charge. Since opposites attract, an upward streamer is sent out from the object about to be struck. When these two paths meet, a return stroke zips back up to the sky. It is the return stroke that produces the visible flash, but it all happens so fast - in about one-millionth of a second - so the human eye doesn't see the actual formation of the stroke.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine gripping a piece of cloth and having a device that attaches to it at all points on the exterior. Have this device pull outwards in every direction. Some point in the cloth will be the weakest point and it will tear there and the rest of the material will catastrophically fail. </p>
<p>Lightning works similarly. Some point will breakdown first and it's nearest neighbor will fail because it failed and this will feed all the way to the cloud.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
