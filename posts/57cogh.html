Just think about how much the Hubble Space Telescope has discovered in 20 years, and think of having a telescope with 7x more light collection.  Plus JWST will work in infrared which is much more advantageous for seeing through dust clouds.  With this we will get much more detailed findings on exoplanets and for the first time detect liquid water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are very exciting things on the horizon in nuclear physics. A new facility called FRIB is currently being built, and it will allow us to study lots of new nuclei that have never been produced before. FRIB is going to be a big linear accelerator which will be used to produce beams of radioactive nuclei which we can then shoot at a target and make measurements.</p>
<p>These new nuclei that it will be able to produce are not your superheavies that recently made headlines, but they're nuclei very far from stability. Basically, nuclei with <em>extreme</em> neutron to proton ratios.</p>
<p>FRIB will go online in the early 2020s. The number of new nuclei it's expected to be able to produce is enormous (see slide 28 <a href="http://2016.lecmeeting.org/FRIB_vision_balantekin.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>None of these individual nuclei is as big of a deal as a Higgs boson, but I think if you take into account how many there are, it starts to add up.</p>
<p>This is a <em>huge</em> deal in nuclear physics, although probably not really in other subfields of physics.</p>
<p><a href="http://indico.ictp.it/event/a13191/session/3/contribution/13/material/0/0.pdf" target="_blank">Here's</a> another set of slides which goes into the exciting things on the horizon for nuclear physics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Six months ago, you could have said LIGO or LISA for the first detection of gravitational waves. But i guess you can still say that they will start marking out the territory on the gravitational wave map of the universe. (Including compact binaries, solar mass, intermediate mass, and super massive black holes, and the gravitational wave background from inflation.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After ATLAS and CMS found the Higgs boson, it was basically going into &quot;here be dragons&quot; territory, and it didn't find any dragons. Lots of analysis went into determining whether it had detected superpartners or signs of extra dimensions or whatnot, but it hasn't so far. Last year there was hubbub about hints of a very large particle, but it turned out to be a statistical fluke.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
