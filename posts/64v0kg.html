		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To understand this a brief history of liberalism and conservatism is needed.</p>
<p>Liberals emerged in opposition to the European monarchies and favored individual liberty. As liberalism evolved, they became divided on how to best pursue liberty. Initially, liberals generally sought freedom from government coercion. Other liberals argued that the least well-off needed to be helped by the state to truly obtain liberty. The division is basically between how much the government should intervene into the economy with classical liberals on the more free market side and social liberals on the more state-welfare side. </p>
<p>Due to this history, a lot of European &quot;liberal&quot; parties are rather centrist. The US is strange because the libertarians and conservatives (pre-Trump) were actually pretty close to classical liberals. The social liberals are more like the moderate Democrats. </p>
<p>Plus, the far left parties in Europe have strong communist and socialist influences that are absent in the US. Also, the conservative parties were the &quot;Church and State&quot; people that defended the monarchies. The US also didn't have that same dynamic. And of course, the US always has to be unique so we call anyone on the left &quot;liberals&quot; and those on the right are conservative. So the Aussies probably have things labeled correctly and it's the US that's making things difficult.</p>
<p>Related - The right and the left is not the same in every country. For instance a labor party might be center-right in country A, but center-left in another country B even if they have the same positions because country A and B are ideologically different as a whole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is the use of the term &quot;liberal&quot; in the sense of &quot;classical liberal&quot;, which is something closer to &quot;libertarian&quot;. The US uses the word &quot;liberal&quot; in the sense of &quot;social liberalism&quot;, which basically means &quot;left-wing&quot;. The other senses of meaning of the word liberal seem to have been lost over there. </p>
<p>The modern Australian Liberal Party came about in the mid 1940s after a series of previous different conservative parties had fallen over. It was called 'Liberal' basically for two reasons. Partly it was to sort of honour the former 'Liberal Party' of the 1900s, which was the first major conservative party in independent Australia. And partly it was due to the circumstances of the time:</p>
<p>Immediately post-war, the ruling Labor party was trying to use Post-War Reconstruction to pursue a range of Socialist, Big Government policies such as nationalising the banks. The conservatives positioned themselves as &quot;Liberals&quot; in the libertarian sense of being opposed to this sort of government interference in private enterprise. Which of course, is a fairly typical conservative position. So while it might look funny to Americans, there is no ideological inconsistency in the use of the word Liberal. </p>
<p>As with other countries, the ideology of both major parties has hardened over time, so the Liberal Party is more explicitly &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;right-wing&quot; these days. You occasionally see people on both the Right (enthusiastically) and Left (pejoratively) proposing the party be renamed to The Conservative Party as in the UK. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question.</p>
<p>Technically in terms of ideology they SHOULD be the same. If you look in any Poli-Sci text book it'll tell you that the number one plank of liberalism is a belief in the supremacy of the individual, and the freedom of said individual to live their life as they choose, so long as they don't interfere with the freedom of anyone else. You may have heard the expression 'laisez-faire'. That is essentially what that means. </p>
<p>But, as you've probably realised the real world rarely sits neatly with what text books say.</p>
<p>In Australia at least the Liberal Party, while including people people who identify as liberal in the sense described above, it also contains people who identify as conservative. They tend to drag the party toward the right on the political spectrum.</p>
<p>Also, left and right are relative terms. The alternative party in Australia is the Labor Party. The labor party is the political arm of the union movement and is more interested in collective rights over the individual. While there are 'liberals' in the labor party, and in terms of social policy there are similarities with liberals in the US, the labor party also includes people that identify as socialist or even communist.</p>
<p>A long winded answer, but I hope that is reasonably clear. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liberalism, traditionally is about protecting personal freedom as much as possible. It is about giving citizens liberty (thus the name). This means that is trades back and forth between the progressive and conservative side of politics depending on the current nature of politics. </p>
<p>When you have a society that has very few personal liberties and you are fighting for more then it is a left wing/progressive concept. When you have a society that has a lot of personal liberties but a government trying to ratchet those down (such as with hate speech laws, or laws banning types of clothing) then it is a right wing/conservative concept. </p>
<p>Now we get to what conservative and progressive mean. </p>
<p>Conservatives see change as something that is a potential threat. They resist it until it is proven to be safe or absolutely necessary. They find tradition to be something of inherent value. </p>
<p>Progressives see society as something that can be refined. Change is inherently good and tradition only gets in the way of potential progress. </p>
<p>So when the government is wanting to strip away rights and liberties being liberal means you are fighting this, thus you are conservative. When you are fighting for new rights in society for a group you are fighting for change and that makes liberals progressive. For the US the civil rights movement, women's suffrage movement, and modern Gay rights and Trans rights movements have firmly put liberals into the progressive side for nearly a century. But that is rapidly starting to change with the way that congress is eroding our constitutional rights. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
