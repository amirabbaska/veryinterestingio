<p>Just to note it's not that bleach may only kill 99.9% of germs its more an advertising 'get out of jail free card' as they cant say it kills everything and thus leave themselves open for legal challenges if and when it doesn't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, this post is really long.</p>
<p>To fully answer your question, two things factor into play here: The Limit of Detection of how the germs are enumerated post-testing and the Log reduction from the test inoculum.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Limit of Detection</strong>  </li>
</ul>
<p>Let's jump straight into an example.<br />
Suppose you have a tub of dirt and you want to know how much bacteria is in each gram of dirt.  </p>
<p>We aren't able to sprinkle dirt onto an agar plate and get a reliable count so we must dilute the dirt down with a liquid solution.  </p>
<p>A typical method would be to put 1g of dirt into 9g of liquid diluent solution (a 1:10 dilution ratio), from the subsequent dilution you repeat the same thing: 1 mL of the dirt+liquid mixture into 9g of the liquid diluent solution.<br />
<a href="https://www.studyblue.com/notes/hh/serial-dilution-technique-microbiology/30103775913908257" target="_blank">This is a serial dilution.</a><br />
For each dilution done you put 1 mL of the resulting liquid onto an agar plate which will grow out individual bacteria into colonies you can visually count from.  </p>
<p>The idea behind serial dilutions is that if there are too many bacteria in the dirt, you won't be able to count it directly from your 1:10 dilution plate - it might be from the 1:1000 or 1:10000 dilution plates that you start to be able to distinguish between individual colonies of bacteria, depending on the concentration of bacteria in the dirt.</p>
<p>But let's suppose our 1:10 dilution plate had no colonies on the plate. Is there really no bacteria in the 1 g of dirt we sampled?<br />
From our method of testing, we have to count the colonies we can observe on the plate.  </p>
<p>The lowest number of bacterial colonies we can visually see is <strong>one colony on the plate</strong>. If we account for the lowest dilution factor (from the dilution ratio of 1:10) we tested - which is simply adjusted by x10 from the 1:10 ratio - the lowest number of bacterial colonies per 1 g of dirt we sampled would be 10 bacteria... or to rephrase: 10 bacteria per gram of dirt.</p>
<p>Thus, <strong>no bacterial colonies</strong> on the 1:10 dilution plate would mean there would be <strong>less than 10 bacteria per gram of dirt</strong> (&lt;10). Due to the quantity of sample we tested, we can not definitively say there are no bacteria in our gram of dirt tested - only that there are &lt;10 bacteria per gram of dirt due to our limit of detection.   </p>
<p>The limit of detection can be improved by reducing the dilution factor used - or if it is a liquid sample, by testing a greater volume of it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log reduction</strong>  </li>
</ul>
<p>In order to evaluate how effective the bleach is at killing germs, you must start with subjecting the bleach to known concentrations of germs.  </p>
<p>A typical method of doing this would be to add a known concentration of bacterial inoculum into a bleach solution, waiting for X time... and then enumerating the resulting bleach+bacteria solution through serial dilutions (as described previously).  </p>
<p>This kind of microbiology deals with large numbers (typically in the millions), so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_logarithm" target="_blank">logs</a> are used to make the data easier to understand.  </p>
<p>^For ^a ^quick ^guide ^on ^logs: ^Log(1)=0, ^Log(10)=1, ^Log(100)=2, ^Log(1000)=3...  </p>
<p>Let's run a hypothetical where you have an initial bacterial inoculum of 1,000,000 bacteria, you add the bleach and wait a while. You then take the solution and test to see how many of those bacterial cells were still alive...</p>
<p>Let's say... you found that out of the 1,000,000 bacteria (log 6) that you inoculated, only 100,000 (log 5) survived the bleach treatment. This result would mean the bleach killed off 900,000 bacteria.<br />
Log reduction is the difference between the initial inoculum concentration and post-treatment concentration, in this instance, there is a 1 log reduction, which translates as a 90% reduction in bacterial levels.  </p>
<p>Lets quickly run through a few more examples with the same 1,000,000 (log 6) bacterial inoculum: -  </p>
<ul>
<li>If 10,000 survived (log 4), there would be a 2 log reduction, or 99% reduction.  </li>
<li>If 100 survived (log 2), there would be a 4 log reduction or a 99.99% reduction.  </li>
<li>If 10 bacteria survived (log 1), there would be a 5 log reduction or a 99.999% reduction.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Our lowest dilution ratio is 1:10, since we have to put/dilute our bacterial inoculum into a bleach solution to test it. If we do not find any bacterial colonies in our 1:10 dilution ratio, our result would be that the 1:10 dilution test solution has &lt;10 bacteria (based on the limit of detection).<br />
Typically for challenge testing, we presume the worst case scenario if we get a result lower than our limit of detection, that you'd meet the limit of detection for your testing - 10 bacteria surviving (log 1).<br />
This would mean the bleach solution has a 5 log reduction or a 99.999% reduction.  </p>
<p>Typically marketing folks for disinfectants present these statistics as %'s and in fewer significant figures than you'd expect. Instead of 99.999%, they'd cut a few 9's and say 99.9% to make it more palatable for the typical consumer - this also doubles as a 'cover-your-ass' in the case of liability/litigation/legal issues at the expense of accuracy.  </p>
<p>The 'cover-your-ass' cases would involve: persistent microbial spores, contours on surfaces not allowing contact with the bleach solution, biofilms, not enough contact time, the bleach solution being diluted down too much or some/most/all of the above.  </p>
<p>TL;DR: -<br />
It's not that there is anything surviving the bleach, it's just that scientists evaluating the effectiveness of the bleach aren't confident with saying that that the sanitizing solution is 100% effective at removing bacteria due to the limit of detection arising from the testing method. And marketing folk/legal folk caring more for the perception rather than accuracy of their claims.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that the 99.9% number refers to the proportion of microbes  on a surface which the bleach is applied to. If your wondering about the inside of your bottle of bleach, I don't think there would be anything growing in it. Microbe growth requires specific environmental conditions  (eg temperature, ph) and a source of nutrients. It wouldn't surprise me if certain microbes tolerate temporary exposures to bleach, I don't think you'd find any that could thrive there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work on Pharma water systems.  Bleach is used to kill bacteria in those systems, but many bacteria firm a polysaccharide protective “wall” called a biofilm around a colony.  The colony essentially goes dormant under the wall.  They “wait” there, occasionally sending out individual cells looking for another place to colonize.  While bleach will eventually dissolve the biofilm, it can take a while and up to 100 ppm in concentration to do it,  so, unless you are very strict in your protocol, some bacteria will survive your attempt.  Free floating organisms die very quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria that form endospores (dormant, REALLY tough microbes) are the most resistant type of pathogenic microbes. The genus Clostridium is one of these spore formers that cause really nasty diseases like tetanus and gas gangrene. In order to kill these, very strict standards are put into place. If you can kill endospores then the object in question is said to be sterilized meaning that ALL microbes have been killed/removed because these spores are so durable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
