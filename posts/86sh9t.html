		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Source: was an MRI-operator and researcher for years.</p>
<p>A lot of metals, such as iron, are &quot;ferromagnetic&quot;. This means they can 1) form permanent magnets, and 2) are drawn towards magnets.
Most body implants are however made out of metals that are <em>paramagnetic</em> such as titatium. This means that while they are not drawn into a magnet (or only very weakly), they still have some kind of interaction with a magnetic field.</p>
<p>For this reason, many body implants are safe for an MRI scanner. Pins, plates, screws, etc, which are strongly affixed to for example your bones, have no risk of moving. They <em>will</em> distort the magnetic field because of their paramagnetism, and it can be problematic to make scans of an area with metal (for example, making an MRI of the head when someone has braces will lead to huge distortions on the image). </p>
<p>The reason that some implants made out of titanium or surgical steel are NOT safe to go in, is 1) objects may still want to align to the magnetic field, so if it's not affixed to something, it can rotate and damage the tissue around it, or 2) especially in larger implants, the magnetic field can induce a &quot;standing wave&quot; in the metal and heat it up very rapidly. Sort of like induction cooking. It can be really dangerous as it can fry you from the inside and lead to severe burns, but this typically only can happen at strong magnetic fields and very large implants (&gt;30cm). </p>

<p>That said almost all the metal put into your body is gonna be non magnetic. </p>
<p>According to my dad, who has a titanium plate in his back, they said it'd be fine because it wasn't magnetic but the metal still got extremely hot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It depends on the type and size of the implant.  Modern implants are made from non-ferrous alloys of stainless steel and titanium.  Smaller implants generally don't cause a lot of issues.  People with much more metal, like me, wouldn't be MRI'd partially because of the risk, but also because the implants create voids in the imaging, making MRI useless.  They do CT scans instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright so after some googling, it seems that any metal placed in your body is going to either be titanium or surgical steel. As far as I can tell, surgical steel is not responsive to magnetic fields the same way normal steel is. So the real danger is the induction heating of the metallic implant and not the danger of it getting ripped out. I'm sure there are some circumstances where implants can be dangerous, especially things like pacemakers that do contain ferrous metals.</p>
<p>Secondly, and I'm not sure if this is true, but if we're talking about a small pin or something then it's likely pretty small and fixed to bones ect. The reason that large pieces of steel like oxygen tanks get sucked into mri machines is because they are very large and thus can &quot;grab&quot; more of the magnetic field. The smaller the item the less force the magnet can exert on it. I am just assuming this because of my loose understanding of how magnetism works. So take this with a grain of salt. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
