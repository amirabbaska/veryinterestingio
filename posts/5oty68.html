		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see others are using analogies here, I'll just keep it simple. :) Voltage is measured between two points. In the case of your two parallel resistors, the ends of each resistor are effectively shorted together, just one big piece of low resistance metal. As such, they must both have the same voltage on either end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the higher resistance side will have less current and the lower resistance side will allow more current. </p>
<p>think about it as a canal that splits into two smaller canals of different sizes for a while before joining together at some point downstream. Consider elevation to be like voltage and the volumetric flow of the water to be current. The smaller canal has a bigger resistance to flow and allows less &quot;current.&quot; However, downstream the two canals still meet back together at the same &quot;voltage&quot; elevation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Put a black box covering the resistors such that only the two terminals are coming out. There's either a single voltage differential or there isn't one regardless of what's in the box. There cannot be two values.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>V= I*R This basic, foundational equation demonstrates that voltage can stay constant as current and resistance vary. As long as current and resistance change proportionally.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is that if node 1 is the high side of the resistors and node 2 is the low side, voltage can only have one value at node 1. Same for node 2. It's analogous to pressure in a pipe. If there were two plumbing routes from node 1 to node 2, pressure would be a single value at each node. However, flow would be determined by the resistance in each route. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the more formal term for voltage is <em>potential difference</em>.  Electricity is a flow of charged particles (electrons) and they really don't care about gravity very much.  To them, potential difference is the same thing as height and thus it doesn't matter how much resistance they run into on the way down, they still &quot;fell&quot; the same &quot;distance&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
