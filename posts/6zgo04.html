		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I'm actually an estimator for a large electrical contractor, so I think I can comment on this pretty accurately. </p>
<p>In large cities you're correct, there's a reason you don't see power lines draped across buildings in Manhattan. And even more affluent neighborhoods will have the lines buried. But there's one enormous reason that ALL lines aren't buried: cost.</p>
<p>Now this answer had been given, but there's some details you might find interesting. </p>
<p>The first is initial installation. Most underground cable at distribution voltage (4kV to about 35kV but that definition fluctuates) is installed in buried conduit, and basically every construction company can tell you that digging sucks. Even with a geotechnical report, some areas of the country are a total crapshoot as to what you'll find 3' down. In parts of VA it might be the water table, in parts of ID it might be lava rock. Usually the ground is either too soft and the hole/ trench doesn't hold up, or too hard and it takes forever to dig. Either way that means money. </p>
<p>Digging also isn't very pretty, and most places have lots of rules regarding how you dig, when you dig, what you do with the spoils (dirt you dig up) and what you have to do to clean up afterwards. If you dig in the middle of nowhere this isn't bad, but God forbid you're in the rich part of town. Then on top of all this money you spent following the rules you now have to spend another big pile fixing landscaping (ya know that bush you dug up? The fourth one from the end that was almost dead? Yea, that was my great great grandmother's golden bush of infinite happiness! You owe me $5000 for it! No an almost identical bush isn't good enough!).</p>
<p>Not too mention underground conductor is more expensive. The conduit it goes into is an added cost, but it pales in comparison to the price difference between underground wire and what you'd spend on overhead wire for a similar amount of current. Additionally this wire has to hold voltage that is desperately trying to release itself into the surrounding earth, so if you nick it when pulling it in, or damage the insulating jacket in some other way, congratulations you get to pull that wire in again! Because that electricity will arc that gap and the line won't work. </p>
<p>If that happens later on down the road, it's also much more difficult to diagnose and fix. With an overhead line, you can usually tell what's wrong (hint: what parts that should be in the air are now on the ground?) But with underground lines you have to drag out the thumper. </p>
<p>The thumper is a piece of equipment that applies a voltage to a line. The voltage goes higher and higher until it arcs through damaged insulation and makes a thump sound underground. Then a worker has to locate the fault (damaged piece of line) by walking the route of the line and listening for the thump. Now newer equipment is fancy enough to help you get pretty close without much work, but there's still a lot of experience and good luck to finding the fault quickly. By the time you add in the cost of the thumper, the crew's time to actually dig up and fix the line, and the outage time for the customers being fed, you're taking a pretty penny. </p>
<p>Not to mention, mother earth is not kind. If you go to more remote places you can find lines that have been around 60 or 70 years. Not going to find many underground lines that old. </p>
<p>There's also the fact that adding capacity to overhead lines is easier in most cases, but that's a bit too nuanced for this post.</p>
<p>And finally, electricity is pretty easy to move overhead. Water, oil, gas, and sewage are not. In most places the ground where it would make sense to bury power lines is <em>crowded</em> and most of those companies don't want high voltage anywhere near their stuff. Hell they don't even want the pole in the ground because most of the poles are grounded. But any company that will even let you bury near them is going to, at minimum, want an inspector on site while you build, and you get to pay his wages while he's out there. Most companies would rather take you to court than let you build though. </p>
<p>So most of the time, high lines are where it's at!</p>
<p>Edit: All of my experience is in North America. I don't know why Europe manages to get everything underground, but as I mention below I expect its a combination of denser urban areas and government regulation. Some places in the US are experimenting with that, but others probably won't for quite some time.</p>
<p>/u/thekbob linked a great study here: <a href="http://www.eei.org/issuesandpolicy/electricreliability/undergrounding/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.eei.org/issuesandpolicy/electricreliability/undergrounding/Pages/default.aspx</a> </p>
<p>That goes a lot more in depth about why underground electric utilities are better at some things, and still unlikely to catch on in the states.</p>
<p>Also, I may have given enough information for some really dedicated soul to deduce who I work for. For the record I am not an official spokesperson for any company, any opinions expressed here or in other comments are solely my own and do not reflect the opinions of any other entity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some good answers but I'll add my two cents. The answer is actually quite complex, and you actually touch on a few points that dont talk about reliability. Source: Am utility engineer in Planning now and was designer for the distribution network.</p>
<p>So true ELI5: Cost a lot of money, presents new types of challenges for future, causes issues when the power does go out, and no one wants to pay for it.</p>
<p>And now the longer, probably still 5 year old version. Just a quick note for those not in the loop (after I wrote this whole thing). OH = Overhead. UG = underground.</p>
<p>1.) The biggest is typically cost. Burying a line is a ton more expensive. You need sand backfill, have to open the trench somehow which usually involved a hydrovac (especially in town) and pushing under existing roads. Plus underground wires need to be bigger than OH wires for a variety of reasons. Mostly capacity. A wire in the air has a lot of surface area and is exposed so it can cool a lot better. A wire in the ground is either in duct or direct buried and gets less cooling effect, plus there is an insulating material on the cable, further reducing it.</p>
<p>2.) Getting location to 'convert' from OH to UG can be sometimes impossible. The location of switching points (take those big green boxes the police hide behind to catch you speeding) are massive. You need lots of those, plus underground pedestals, transformers, convert everyones house from OH to UG.</p>
<p>3.) Any new customers, new growth or upgrades are a lot harder. Wires in the road in front of your house could be old and designed when no one had cell phones, computers, 17 TV's and AC. Now, even thought their more efficient, electrical use is going up. Add in electric cars and other components and the amount of work to rebuild an UG line for capacity and OH line is quite a bit more effort.</p>
<p>4.) Restoration is a lot harder. So sure, the power might stay on (assuming it doesn't flood, it has happened and they shut the power off anyways) but when there is a fault it is a lot harder to find. For underground we have lots of ways to detect faults, but worst case you dig up the whole cable you know has failed until you find the break. On OH it is a lot easier, you drive along until there is a pole on the ground. So while the reliability is up, it can translate into a longer outage. Most utilities are measured on two metrics for reliability. SAIDI and SAIFI. One is the standard average duration (so 30 minutes) and one is frequency. UG usually has a higher SAIDI and OH might have a higher SAIFI.</p>
<p>5.) Cost, everyone bitches about costs as it is. I'd suspect a 100% increase (depending on what all got buried, did we go back and replace all the old OH or just new to UG) to your electric bill to accomplish this.</p>
<p>6.) Electrical characteristics. This isn't as easy but USUALLY UG cannot carry as much, for as far, so in town it isn't an issue but rurals can be a problem.</p>
<p>7.) Some components that we have for OH are a lot harder to get or a lot more money on underground. Certain things like regulators we only stock OH ones. So you have to be creative where we put those pieces as it is.</p>
<p>To specifically point out your question about burying in residential subdivisions. There are really three major components.</p>
<p>1.) The disappearance of the back alley. Most OH lines were run in back alleys. Most new URD's (Underground residential developments) no longer have back alleys.</p>
<p>2.) It is for aesthetics, either driven by the municipality or the developer themselves.</p>
<p>3.) Cost, since the ground is already all dug up to put in gas, telephone, sewer, roads, and foundation. Plus no one technically owns the homes yet, so no one can complain about placement of facilities, it is quite a bit cheaper than browfield construction.</p>
<p>Hope I cover it, I am sure there are variations depending on region and my area is not prone to hurricanes, but I'd be happy to answer more questions or discuss differences further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for a power utility contractor and we hear this a lot.</p>
<p>Building new developments with underground power lines is easy.  Before you put up the buildings, pour the asphalt for the roads, and plant the lawns, you can plan it all out and dig trenches to bury the electrical lines.  It looks nicer, it's easier, and anyway, you're already digging trenches for water, sewer, gas, cable, etc... so laying another set of conduits in the same trenches isn't much additional cost.  Look at most new master-planned housing developments, and this is how they do it.  </p>
<p>However, when you have a city that's already standing, buildings intact, streets covered with traffic 90% of the day, and water, gas, sewer, etc already crisscrossing underground, it becomes a lot more difficult to do.  It involves getting easement rights from just about every land owner whose property you cross.  It involves digging up existing streets, sidewalks, lawns, etc.  It involves blocking traffic for several days to lay a couple hundred feet of cable.  And then every transformer, switch, and other bit of equipment requires a bigger hole to be dug (some as big as 12'x15'x8' (4m x 5m x 3m ish for you metric folks).  These require access manholes on the surface, vents, sometimes above-ground cabinets.  More easement rights for these.  Nobody wants a manhole in the middle of their lawn.</p>
<p>So it's expensive.  It's annoying to everyone in the area while the work is taking place.  And while there are clearly benefits... there are downsides to underground power too.  Vaults fill up with water and need to be pumped before workers can access them.  If a segment of cable goes bad, it's much more difficult to test for the fault, pull it out, and replace it.  And all of this work requires, again, traffic to be blocked, streets to be dug up and re-paved, all of the same hassles as installing them to begin with.</p>
<p>And then consider the cost of replacing an existing overhead system with an underground one.  Who pays this?  The city?  Fat chance.  The power company?  They're shelling out millions (billions) just on regular maintenance, hard to justify the cost of a project like this for dubious material benefits.  The homeowners?  Never gonna happen.</p>
<p>And despite all this, it still does happen.  Little bit by little bit, neighborhoods are getting converted across.  Mostly it's suburban areas (it gets exponentially more difficult in tightly packed cities).  Rich communities, for the most part.  But to convert the whole country, even a whole major metropolitan area like Miami... would not be feasible, at least on any timeline not measured in centuries. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Underground powerlines are only a solution for one problem. They mostly make sense when in a large metropolitan area where you've got conduits, and concrete/metallic sewers running throughout each building.</p>
<p>Suburban areas have dirt, and are much farther away from switching stations, in order to replace the entirety of lines from above to below grade would require a tremendous amount of money, research of soils, and construction work to not only dig trenches, but also get civil utility planners out there to secure the ground space.</p>
<p>For reference in Bellevue, WA; when replacing the power lines from above to underground for my apartment building, I needed to pay over 100k to service 4 buildings on the street, just for inspection, permits, and engineers. I then paid another 150k for the equipment, and the actual work cost another 60k, which required, yet another permit because it was in a city right of way. Since I was doing all that work in this area, I had to pay the entire bill.</p>
<p>The work that they did afterwards was also pretty ugly, even though the lines were moved underground they still had to create a pole that stuck out from underground that fed to the existing buildings, because they weren't originally built with underground powerlines in mind.</p>
<p>Update: Asked local power company and it usually costs nearly $1,000,000 per mile of power lines if you want them dug underground.</p>
<p>Edit: 4 buildings not units.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As this is my bread and butter I will answer however I won't go into too much detail as it will probably be buried. If this does end up gaining traction I will go into more detail or you can PM me.</p>
<p>First is cost: Typically the average cost to bury a Main line primary feeder is about 3 million dollars per mile. This is just the Overhead cable not necessarily all the devices that allow it to go that far nor does that include secondary (which powers things normal consumers use like your house meter, street lights, traffic control signals and cell site equipment)</p>
<p>Second is age: Please remember that in most &quot;established&quot; places electricity has been around for a hundred+ years and most anything pre 1990(excluding townhomes and certain subdivisions are fed overhead and to change it would be to require every homeowner to change their house configuration to go underground)  and in alot of other places most of it used to be farmland and which brings me to my next point.</p>
<p>Space. The amount of space need for the distribution system is mind boggling. Imagine Time Square in New York City. All the pretty lights and signals and billboards and stores are powered by something right? Well underground cables, but the amount of cable needed to provide that is sizable and so is the conduit that houses and protects the cable and the manholes that house the devices and allows people to work on them. Not to mention everything else in that street such as water, sewer, gas, fiber, cable, all of which also have mains and services branched  off of the mains.</p>
<p>Finally ease of repairs due to normal maintainance and damages. If we have a fault and even if we know it is between two manholes that are 200 feet apart. Well how do we know exactly where and how  do we fix it. Tear up the road, pull the cable out an put a new span in? What if the conduit collapsed and we can't pull the new span and now we need to dig the entire road up and block traffic to fix it?</p>
<p>Again OH is easier to see, easier to fix, easier to maintain and overall much more cost effective. However all that being said with better standards, materials, and technology putting it underground is becoming a more competitive option.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
