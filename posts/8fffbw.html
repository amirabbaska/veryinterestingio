		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On average, air is air. However, on a very small scale, there are pockets of low/high pressure, and low/high concentrations of all sorts of chemicals. You can see <a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-IjkTuqVzlmQ/TzGSimjBP3I/AAAAAAABmEA/qvkOoHKhtNw/w506-h413/slow-motion-lightning.gif" target="_blank">in this incredible gif</a> how &quot;tendrils&quot; of electricity are extended first. They travel through as low-resistance a path as they can find, and the first one that makes contact with the ground allows the massive current to flow through. </p>
<p><a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/nature/natural-disasters/lightning.htm" target="_blank">How stuff works has a great, thorough explanation</a> on how lightning works. The third and fourth pages explain how these tendrils work.</p>
<p>TL;dr - Lightning follows the path of least resistance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once the voltage at the bottom of the cloud is high enough, electrons start forming an ionized path down towards the ground. On it's way down from the cloud, it starts at one point and branches out, each branch avoiding the others, because all these branches are negatively charged.</p>
<p>Once it gets closer to the ground, the negatively charged lightning starts pulling positive charges up towards the cloud, these positive charges behave in the same way, generally moving towards the negative charges and avoiding each other. It's easiest for these paths to start at sharp points closest to the cloud(like a flagpole)</p>
<p>As the negative charges get close to the positive charges, the attraction get stronger, and one of the negatively charged paths will contact either the ground, or one of the positively charged paths. As the ionized paths have much lower resistance than normal air, all the remaining charge will flow through this established path, and you may get several pulses of lightning as more negative charge regions within the cloud use the established path to get down to ground. </p>
<p>Basically, the shape is established before there's a connection all the way from the cloud to the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With everyone focusing on the zig-zag path through the air, I'll take a stab at the precise points such as the end of a pole part.  Basically, an electrical charge tries to spread out evenly across the surface of an object, balancing against the repulsive force of neighbouring charges.  On a curved surface, the component of the force along the surface becomes less, so more charge particles can balance there.  The sharper the curve, the higher the charge.  Since lightning is attracted to the highest charge, lightning rods are made thin and pointy.  They become the place of the highest charge on a building, so the lightning is attracted there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The flow of electricity is like cars on streets. When you’re in the car, the path of least resistance is to follow the streets. You could take a straight line from A to B, but only if you drive through houses and buildings and stuff.</p>
<p>So the lightning travels the streets, the path of least resistance, until it touches something that conducts better than air. Then it’s like hitting the open highway, you can go faster with nothing slowing you down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
