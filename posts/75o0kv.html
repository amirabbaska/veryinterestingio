		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the behavior of subsonic vs. supersonic flow. You are right that subsonic flow will increase in gas speed as you narrow down a nozzle, but this is only true up until the speed reaches Mach 1. At that point, the flow is said to be &quot;choked&quot; and you can't increase the speed. This is because subsonic flow is considered incompressible, in that the density doesn't significantly change as the conditions in the nozzle change. But as the gas approaches the speed of sound, it becomes more and more compressible and at Mach 1, if you try and increase the speed by narrowing the nozzle further, you're just compressing the gas more without increasing the flow velocity.</p>
<p>So because of this compressibility, supersonic flow will also <em>decompress</em> as the nozzle area increases, which in turn increases the velocity as the nozzle area increases. This type of nozzle is called a &quot;de Laval&quot; or &quot;converging-diverging&quot; nozzle if you're interested in learning more.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually a lot of good answers here but no one has addressed the bell shape part of it. The reason that rocket nozzles are bell shaped instead of cone shaped is because it straighten out the flow, so to speak. Right after the combustion chamber the nozzle quickly opens and then the angle gradually decreases towards the opening. This shape redirects any of the gases flowing radially out of the combustion chamber towards the opening in an actual direction, resulting in an increase in thrust since the sideways forces don't result in forward thrust which is what is desired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to this is non-trivial, and I remember pulling my hair out in 3rd year fluid mechanics courses trying to understand it. It comes down to the fact that the air leaving the nozzle is supersonic, and that supersonic flow behaves differently than subsonic. Pressure waves move through the air at the speed of sound, and thus once your flow goes supersonic, increasing the pressure of the gas in the exhaust doesnt result in a bigger flow rate (or thrust). It does, however, result in a bigger shock wave at the exit. But your flowrate is 'capped' at mach 1 with this system.</p>
<p>Why the bell shape exists is something I will have to look up, but essentially it is there to manipulate flow rate into rising above the sonic threshold, and thus provide more thrust.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It looks like there is are already great answers, but I want to clarify and simplify a bit. When gases are traveling at subsonic speeds: when you decrease the flow area, such as with a nozzle, the gas speeds up. When increasing the flow area, the gas slows down. Supersonic is the exact opposite, since it is hypercompressed, it wants to expand: by increasing the flow area, velocity increases! The diverging section (bell) allows the gases to expand, speed up, and drop in pressure. </p>
<p>The specific bell shape comes about to control the expansion of the gas. Ideally, the gas is allowed to expand just enough that the pressure of the gas at the nozzle exit equals the pressure of the atmosphere around, and the shockwave from the gas changing from super to subsonic occurs at the exit plane. If the nozzle is too big at the exit, the gas pressure drops below the atmospheric pressure and atmospheric air actualy enters the engine and drops efficiency. Shocks also form inside the engine nozzle. If it is too small, the gases exit the nozzle at a higher pressure than atmosphere, and you lose efficiency because the air has left over energy that could be converted to velocity still. Shocks also form at weird places outside the engine. The characteristic smoothness of the bell helps the flow change continuously and in a laminar fashion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers are right, so I'll just summarize and fill in a few gaps. Subsonic flow accelerates when the nozzle diameter decreases. Supersonic flow accelerates when the nozzle diameter increase. The derivation for this has always seemed counterintuitive to me, but it is not hard to follow if you have some calculus experience. Search for &quot;converging diverging nozzle&quot; and you'll find some examples.</p>
<p>The short version is that the isentropic flow equations (no heat added or viscous effects) creates a relationship between changes in pressure and changes in density. Conservation of momentum creates a relationship between changes in velocity and changes in pressure. Conservation of mass creates a relationship between changes in area, changes in density, and changes in velocity. Combining all of these together gives you a relationship between changes in velocity and changes in area, and that relationship changes signs when Mach number is greater than 1.</p>
<p>The bell shape specifically is to control shocks in the supersonic flow. Any diverging (increasing area) nozzle should accelerate the flow, but the bell shape does it while minimizing the energy lost to shock waves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
