		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not that we forget our earliest years, it’s that we don’t form memories in the first place. The term for this is infantile “amnesia”, but this is not actually a form of amnesia — that would require forgetting. As infants grow into toddlers, their brains grow fantastically quickly. So much so, that any pathways that are deemed unimportant/weak are “pruned”. Pruning is the technical term actually. By age three, pruning calms down to the point where toddlers can start forming the memories they’ll remember for possibly the rest of their lives. However, usually the very earliest memories are traumatic or notable in some way. Pruning continues for some time into childhood. Maybe age 4. </p>
<p>Edit: this has gotten more traction than I anticipated, and I have to clarify: when I say “we don’t form memories in the first place” what I’m saying is that we form memories that we will NOT be able to RECALL after our brains grow and pruning occurs. Toddlers can remember things, but, as we’ve all experienced, they forget an exceptional amount of their day-to-day experiences. As another user pointed out, toddlers actually are learning a metric ton of stuff (motor, language, etc.). </p>
<p>Edit 2: another user pointed out that it is the delayed development of the hippocampus (learning/memory/encoding center) that contributes to infantile amnesia. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you are taking about is autobiographical memory.  Infants easily form other types of memories, including procedural memory (eg learning to walk), and semantic memory (learning what things are).  Infantile amnesia is limited to autobiographical memories.  There are lots of ideas as to why this is.  One is a lack of self awareness - the child hasn't yet learned that they are an individual and that there are other individuals.  The second is language development.  Autobiographical memory is often descriptive, eg. &quot;I went to the store &quot;.  Encoding this memory may rely on language skills that have not yet developed.  These are all related to the underlying neurophysiological development.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Check out this article, it's essentially saying that the brain isn't really concerned about memories at that age, it just needs to get a grip on how reality works.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.livescience.com/32963-why-dont-we-remember-being-babies.html" target="_blank">https://www.livescience.com/32963-why-dont-we-remember-being-babies.html</a></p>
<p>This article covers a much wider range of subjects including the gap in memory varies by up to 2 years depending on where you're born, the article says one theory on that is some cultures don't value early childhood memories and that may affect how hard we try to hold onto them. The article has no definitive answer but covers what appear to be reasonable theories such as the brain isn't &quot;recording&quot; episodic memories or <em>can't</em> record them yet due to a still-growing hippocampus.

<p>This article is more focused on the explanation being proposed that the brain is still developing neurons in the region where memories are formed.
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-can-t-you-remember-being-a-baby/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-can-t-you-remember-being-a-baby/</a></p>
<p>I am absolutely not an expert in this field but I've read enough to know that memories are the connections between neurons in specific parts of the brain. There is also an element of flexibility, called <a href="https://www.brainhq.com/brain-resources/brain-plasticity/what-is-brain-plasticityhttps://www.brainhq.com/brain-resources/brain-plasticity/what-is-brain-plasticity" target="_blank">plasticity</a>, in the brain that defines how easily connections are made or broken. </p>
<p>When we are very young the brain is very flexible, we have a lot to learn. Connections are made and broken quickly. </p>
<p>It would seem plausible that driving force for not being able to recall specific memories while the brain is still adding neurons to the memory-related parts of the brain(the bbc article mentions this) and while the brain is still extraordinarily flexible, those connections that make memories may not last very long. New neurons would disrupt those networks of connections and new memories could be making use of connections involved in other memories until there isn't enough left of a given episode's network to recall the memory. </p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if culture played into that as well, if you try to hold onto a memory your attempt to access it can strengthen the connections to the episode over time and make it harder to forget(no idea if that affects accuracy of the memory). If no one in your culture gives a shit about a specific type of memory why bother trying to recall it? </p>
<p>I know just enough about this stuff to get myself into trouble so check the sources and don't quote me on jack shit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2 Memory systems are in place, subconscious instinctive learning, which is active even earlier than described, responsible for recognizing patterns much quicker than a cognitive approach, such as potentially dangerous situations or markers of danger, speech tones, etc. and is very resistant to change once a pattern is learned, which also has the potential to be problematic later in life when our mind is reacting in a non-beneficial manner. &quot;Unlocking the emotional brain: Eliminating symptoms at their roots using memory reconsolidation&quot; addresses much of the research surrounding this, as before 2007, research had largely concluded it was so difficult to change subconscious patterns once formed that the focus became cognitive behavioral therapy of trying to create entirely new pattern recognition on top of already learned responses.</p>
<p>The second memory storage is the conscious one, which is much more plastic and changeable. Memories are being recorded again at very early ages, but the issue with this system is that the catalogue and recall system hasn't developed until around 3 years, so there isn't a way to recall memories beyond that point.</p>
<p>The difference in these 2 systems can be very distinctly seen when memories of a traumatic event fade or are blocked from the mind, but the pattern recognition still causes anxiety when faced with a similar situation</p>
<p>Subconscious pattern recognition is also much faster than cognitive thought, consisting of learned knowledge and truths, such as being able to recall that fire is hot and not to touch it or phobias, the event where we learned it doesn't need to be recalled for the situation to be assessed very quickly by instinct built over our lifetime</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
