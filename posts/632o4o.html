		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way is the scale of the energy of the photons. Gamma rays are generally understood to be produced by subatomic interactions. An electron has a mass-energy of roughly 511 KeV (kilo-electron volts. An electron volt, or eV, is the energy to move a single electron through one volt of potential.) and so an electron annihilating with a positron puts out gamma rays that together reach around ~1 MeV. Now, an electron and a positron can only decay into two gamma rays or more (not just one) so usually the energy gets split and you get gamma rays with around 0.5 MeV. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/fermi-thunderstorms.html" target="_blank">This energy</a> is often used to identify matter-antimatter collisions in space.</p>
<p>Gamma-ray bursts are mysterious and we don't know exactly what their source is, but certain types of GRB's are associated with supernovae. These can generally reach very high energies which is part of why we can see them from so far away - these not only reach higher energies than annihilating particles, but the scale of the interaction (an entire star collapsing as opposed to cosmic particles colliding) also multiplies the energy to extremely high levels and produces a wide range of other effects, like longer-wavelength (x-ray and UV) energy bursts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The frequency of a photon is directly related to the energy that the photon carries. In an antimatter annihilation between two particles, a specific quantity of energy is released in the pair of gamma ray photons emitted. Therefore, every annihilation between an electron and a positron releases two gamma ray photons of the same frequency, every time* (0.511 eV to be precise, which is the energy quantity of an electron or a positron). By measuring the frequency of received gamma rays, we can tell that they were produced from an annihilation reaction, rather than, say, a gamma ray burst, which has different properties entirely.  </p>
<p>*this assumes that the particles had negligible momentum. If extremely fast moving particles collide then the photons released will have higher energy, and therefore frequency, because the kinetic energy of the particles cannot be destroyed and so ends up in the photons. However, generally this doesn't really change much, as the particles have to be moving <em>extremely</em> fast for this to make a significant impact. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energy spectrum. Electrons and positrons have a very specific amount of rest-energy, and when they combine they naturally produce gamma ray photons of corresponding energy levels (511 KeV). Note that even proton/anti-proton annihilations will result in the creation of electrons and positrons as well so they will end up having the same gamma ray photons produced. If you look at a source of gamma rays and you see a strong peak around the 511 KeV line that's pretty conclusively the result of matter/anti-matter annihilations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
