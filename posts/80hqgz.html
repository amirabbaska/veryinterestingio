		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Garlic's pungent, but generally pleasant smell is due to a variety of sulfur compounds.  As these are broken down by bacteria and our digestive systems, these sulfur compounds convert into much less pleasant smelling ones.</p>
<p>This is only partially what makes garlic breath so pungent.  Some of the metabolic products enter our bloodstream and are subsequently volatilized through our lungs.  This is why no amount of mouthwash, brushing your teeth, or chewing gum can get rid of garlic breath (these only mask it temporarily).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>imo the unpleasant garlic (or onions) breath is not the one from someone's mouth right after they eat garlic. this just smells like garlic. it's the garlic burps that come up to a few hours after that smell like rotten garbage</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the smell of cooked garlic is not the garlic you smell on someone's breath.</p>
<p>That's without getting into the contextual markers humans use to tune their senses.  Being greeted to the general odor of things cooking is step one to enjoying that garlic smell.</p>
<p>Finding it within the general odor of another person's mouth?  </p>
<p>The sense/sound/warmth of food cooking makes our body primed for food, with &quot;good&quot; feelings as a byproduct.</p>
<p>Other human mouths prime us to assess what the heck might be afflicting this other human that we'd want to avoid for ourselves.  If we find nothing, we can focus on our other impulses.  If we find a garlic smell, that's not the one we got from the food cooking in any form or context.</p>
<p>The real question here: Do cannibals have a pleasant response to smelling garlic on someone's breath?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
