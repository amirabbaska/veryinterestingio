		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To address the simple &quot;monoatomic element&quot; part: Lithium as medicine is in the form of charged lithium ions rather than stable atoms. Swallowing a chunk of metallic lithium would not be an effective medicine. Usually lithium carbonate is the form of the medicine</p>
<p>Lithium ions have the same charge as the other alkali metal ions (sodium, potassium, etc). Thus we know that lithium ions can substitute in for sodium and potassium in <em>some</em> of the body's complex machinery.</p>
<p>We aren't totally sure which parts it substitutes into because we don't have the tools to actively track the ions in a living person. Instead we can only observe the effects of the medicine and work on hypotheses about where it may bind and why it would cause the effects that we see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its function isn't understood well, but we know it increases production og seratonin and decreases norepinephrine, along with some other neurochemical changes. </p>
<p>Seratonin is one of the main components in the depression aspect of bipolar disorder, so lithium helps to ease depression related symptoms. It also helps to moderate anxiety and mania, helping to bring everything to a sort of middle ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit: Yes, I understand the salt breaks down to a lithium ion. I took chemistry too, y’all. I literally only said we don’t give monoatomic lithium because I couldn’t tell from the way they said it if OP was thinking that we did.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a psychiatric pharmacist, so I'll take a stab at ELI5:</p>
<p><strong>ELI5:</strong> Bipolar is a brain illness that might be caused by too much of a chemical that can be toxic if it's not treated over time. A healthy brain should be able to change and grow with you and form new connections as you grow. This is very hard for a bipolar brain to do. Lithium, even though we don't know exactly what it does, improves the ability of the brain to regulate all of its chemicals and grow new connections.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> altered gene expression causes a shift in glutamate/GABA balance which dysregulates dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine leading to mania/depression symptoms. Lithium mostly works <del>at the gene level</del> on intracellular signalling cascades to re-regulate neurotransmitter expression, improve neuroplasticity, and reduce neurotoxicity.</p>
<p><a href="https://psychopharmacologyinstitute.com/mood-stabilizers/mechanism-action-lithium-illustrated-review/" target="_blank">This is the best compilation of references</a> I can find that illustrates these points, and touches on others that I didn't mention or only briefly mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> Neurotransmitter dysregulation, primarily between GABA (inhibitory) and glutamate (excitatory) can cause over-expression of glutamate which is directly neurotoxic and prohibits neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to turnover neuronal tissue and form new connections and is a healthy function of any brain. Glutamate overexpression can also cause further downstream dysregulation of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, leading to psychotic, manic, and depressive (not necessarily respectively, it's more complicated than that) symptoms. Lithium inhibits the intracellular peptides <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16044535" target="_blank">PKC</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1850891/" target="_blank">GSK3</a>, both of which are implicated in reduced neuroplasticity and glutamate dysregulation. This increases the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4294125/" target="_blank">(BDNF) and BCL-2</a>, both of which promote neuroplasticity and overall neuron health. Valproic acid (depakote, depakene) does this as well in addition to blocking the reuptake and catabolism of GABA, as well as blocking sodium channel-mediated signalling. No other mood stabilizers possess the function of inhibiting these specific peptides. Will furnish references when I get back from rounds!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
