<p>All of the troopers over the years have communicated with me in the same voice from the films and I do not know how this is done. I assume it is with some sort of voice changer or soundboard, but they have addressed me by hat and shirt color before as well. Any information and explanations on how this is done is appreciated, as I simply do not understand how. Thanks!</p></div></div>

<p>BUT then one time I went and there was a guy that was not as good as the previous actors and it became totally oblivious.</p>
<p>Storm troopers, Vader, and Ren all probably have voice modifiers too that makes it easier to sound just like the movie.</p>
<p>Any of the scripted shows mostly use pre-recorded lines that are played back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ones walking around have pre-recorded phrases they can trigger. At meet and greets they most likely have someone else watching and listening that chooses what they say so they can be more interactive.</p>
<p>This is how the talking Mickey, Raz and the Mr. Potato Head work. Someone can see who is there and hear what they are saying and respond appropriately. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>slightly</em> related, I hope you'll forgive me. 501st Vader's Fist member here. We use member developed voice changers (there are currently 3 or 4 accepted makes in circulation around the globe). We run them off a battery pack and have a mic. They usually have settings for static burst and amount of distortion. You can also get variants for popular characters, like Vader, or Fett.</p>
<p>Generally, ours will hide a bit of an accent, but you'll tell if someone's female right away or, say, from America or the UK (UK here).</p>
<p>They cost on average 100.00 GBP and are usually custom made, to order.</p>
<p>They are VERY convincing. People are always intimidated by us anyway but when we speak, it completes the illusion.</p>
<p>But it seems Disney do something else :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Unrelated to my answer, but those storm troopers are awesome! I had several &quot;run-ins&quot; with them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
