		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A similar reason why your smartphone is shinier and glossier when in use outside during the day instead of inside: the light reflecting off of the surface layer is brighter than the light transmitted through.</p>
<p>Think of light as sticky balls of different colors being thrown at a wall. The stickiness of the ball and the wall depends on the color. We only see the color of the balls that return to us. If 100 balls of 10 colors gets thrown at a green wall, only the 10 green balls gets bounced back. This is how an object looks green. Likewise, for a 50% gray wall, 50 balls, 5 of each of the 10 colors bounces back.</p>
<p>Usually, glossy or shiny things have a coating made of plastic or glass in front of the object which causes additional reflections. This is as if an additional wall with holes is placed in front of the colored one that only bounces balls back or lets them through. </p>
<p>Let's say this wall reflects one in 10 (10%) of the balls but lets the rest of them through. For a 100% gray (white) wall, 10 balls bounce back from the wall with holes (coating) but all 90 going through will bounce back from the white wall. You see some of the glossiness (10 balls) but it's overpowered by the balls bouncing from the white wall (90 balls).</p>
<p>Now, if the colored wall was 10% gray (close to black), 10 balls bounce back from the wall with holes and of the 90 that go through, only 9 balls bounce back. The 10 balls from the glossy layer are now comparable to the 9 balls representing the light coming back from the colored layer. The dark colors are more easily overwhelmed by the reflection from the glossy layer so they appear shinier and glossier!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As u/dragonnyx said - there are a few types of lighting of a material. The two most important ones are diffuse scattering and specular reflection. The diffuse light that reflects from the object goes in all directions and gives the object the color it has. The specular high lights are caused by a more proper reflection (due to a smooth surface eg glass) which causes the &quot;shine&quot;. Since an object being black means it reflects very little light, most of the light reflecting back to your eye is from the specular reflections making it much more noticeable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Darker colors are not glossier. It is the material which shines.</p>
<p>When the materials are coated with colors, there are two kinds of reflections. One is the reflection from the material and the other is the reflection from the color. When the material is coated with darker color, darker color absorbs some light and reflects some light. Material reflects some light. When the light reflected by materials is more intense or brighter than light reflected by color, you see the shine.</p>
<p>Jewelries should be a nice example. Jewelries are coated with a thin layer of very reflective metal which makes them shine. After some usage, that metal gets dull, so you polish them. When you polish them, you don't recolor them, you enhances that coating or cleans that coating which makes them shine brighter again. Diamond is not dark but shines a lot. It's because of diamond's reflective properties.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
