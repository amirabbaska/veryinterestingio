		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm three months into quitting smoking cold turkey, so all traces of nicotine should have gone from my body, and from what I've read it seems my nicotine receptors should have returned to the state of a non-smoker too (&lt; as you might be able to tell, I'm not entirely sure what this means, just something I read). </p>
<p>I admit there was a day last week when I lost the will and had three cigarettes :( Since then, the cravings have become 24/7 and I'm tense all over. The withdrawal has been almost as bad as the first week. (I have learned my lesson...)</p>
<p>A non-smoker who had three cigarettes would not experience an intense withdrawal (I assume); so is my experience because:</p>
<p>a) I have the &quot;brain&quot; of a smoker and my chemical addiction persists (physical);</p>
<p>b) Having a cigarette just kinda reminded me of how nice smoking is or reignited an old habit, so now I want to do it all the time (psychological);</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>c) Something else.</p>
<p>Also, I'd like to know if any brain changes are permanent. Would a smoker who had a cigarette 30 years after their quit experience the same intensity of withdrawal? Would they get (re)hooked on cigarettes more quickly than someone who had never smoked? Or is there a point where your likelihood to become addicted to smoking falls to the same level as a never-smoker?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a reason  many drugs have such high relapse rates with some, like methamphetamine, having over 90% relapse rates.  The memory of the drug is very powerful.  Not only do you have the reward associated with the drug itself, and its effects on dopamine, but you also have a myriad of &quot;cues&quot; that act as part of the reinforcement of the memory. For instance, drinking alcohol in the bar with your friends can create a reinforcing cue that means watching a TV show (like &quot;How I met your mother&quot; where basically the whole show takes place in a bar) can flood the brain with cues that trigger craving.  This phenomenon is consistent across drugs (e.g. cocaine, opiates, nicotine...) and is known to be mediated by interactions between two specific brain regions (the ventral hippocampus and the nucleus accumbens). In animals cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking behavior can be manipulated by stimulating or blocking these specific regions.  There are many other brain regions involved, but this is a simple breakdown.  Further, there is good evidence for relatively long-term changes in many brain regions using techniques like functional connectivity analysis with fMRI.  There is also evidence for permanent changes in brain volumes with some drugs like cocaine.   In short, there is quite a bit of evidence for long-term changes in brain structures and networks.  Some of these changes may abate with time but this aspect (i.e. how long it might take) is not as well studied, but in the case of smoking anecdotal evidence suggests that the urge for cigarettes does abate over time.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It could have been a specific taste in your mouth or smell that set off your bell for a cigarette.</p>
<p>Something that might help is to drink a shot of grapefruit juice to kinda reset the taste in your mouth and might break the urge/bell. </p>
<p>Also drink tons of or take tons of vitamin c. it scrubs nicotine out of the system. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
