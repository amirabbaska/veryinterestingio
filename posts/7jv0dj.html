		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain is effectively a bundle of billions of interconnected neurons. </p>
<p>A neuron, like all cells in the body, maintains an electrical potential difference between the outside of the cell and the inside of cell. This electrical difference occurs due to different concentrations of charged ions inside and outside of a cell. A neuron can &quot;discharge&quot;: special ion channels in the cell membrane open up, allowing positive ions to flow into the neuron, increasing it's potential.  The increase in potential triggers other changes in the neuron that can involve the release of neurotransmitters outside the cell or release of ions outside the cell into an area known as the <strong>endplate</strong>. The amount of ions released generates an <strong>end plate potential</strong>. This is how neurons transmit signals to each other at a synaptic junction.</p>
<p>The receiving neuron has special receptors on it that can detect the <strong>end plate potential</strong>. When the potential is greater than a certain threshold, that neuron becomes activated as well. It then undergoes a similar process, releasing ions or neurotransmitters into the end plate shared by a third downstream neuron. This keeps process keeps going to affect every neuron in a massive network of interconnected neurons. </p>
<p>Whenever you form a new memory, millions of inter connected neurons are activated in that manner throughout your brain. Lets call the sequence and combination of neurons involved a <em>memory cluster</em> (my own made up term).</p>
<p>Learning and forming memories involves a phenemonom known as <strong>long term potentiation</strong>. Essentially, the more times a synapse or connection between two cells is activated, the easier it becomes to activate next time. This occurs due to the upregulation of receptors or channels that either increases the amount of ions released by the upstream cell, or increases the sensitivity of the downstream cell. Research shows that receptors for the neurotransmitter NMDA plays a key role in this. </p>
<p>That's why the more you practice something or rehearse a fact, the better you are able to remember it. The connection between the two neurons literally becomes stronger with use. </p>
<p>A single neuron can be connected to tens of thousands of downstream neurons, thus <strong>long term potentiation</strong> is critical in ensuring that only certain upregulated / commonly used pathways are activated. When every neuron is triggered indiscriminately in no meaningful sequence, that's how a seizure occurs.</p>
<p>When you recollect a memory, the neurons involved in your consciousness is able to successfully transmit a signal down a path of neurons to the <em>memory cluster</em> responsible for that memory. To review, that actual physiological process or &quot;transmitting&quot; a signal involved the generation of end plate potentials and opening of ion channels.</p>
<p>When you are unable to remember something, it could be that the signal has stopped somewhere along that neuronal pathway because there hasn't been enough <strong>long term potentiation</strong>. Only a part of the neurons involved in the pathway are able to fire. </p>
<p>During the struggle to remember something, your brain is &quot;searching&quot; for alternative neuronal pathways to get to that <em>memory cluster</em>. Sometimes, you'll first send signals to the <em>memory clusters</em> of associated memories. And from these associated <em>memory clusters</em> you might be able trace a neuronal pathway to the <em>memory cluster</em> youre trying to recall.  That's why using associations is an effective memory tool, because it expands the number of neuronal pathways that can be traversed to reach the memory. </p>
<p>Sometimes, the neurons WITHIN a memory cluster are linked together very strongly, but the path to them from your &quot;consciousness neurons&quot; is lost and the memory gets &quot;buried&quot;. But when you experience a particular trigger, a neuronal pathway leading to that <em>memory cluster</em> is reformed, and you recall that memory  almost as vividly as when you first experienced it (traumatic memories for example).</p>
<p>Other times, the connections between neurons within a <em>memory cluster</em> is too weak and that memory is lost forever no matter how hard you try to recall it.</p>
<p>The consolidation of a long term memory can be thought of a strongly connected <em>memory cluster</em> as well as strongly connected neuronal pathway to that cluster, such that even a weak neuronal discharge can always reach the correct <em>memory cluster</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I got taught in school that memory recall works by “pushing down” all the memories around the requested memory exposing the memory you want.  When something is on the tip of your tongue,  it’s because the path you are taking to get to the memory is so close to the desired memory  it is “pushing down” the  memory you are trying to remember.  That’s why stopping requesting the memory can help you remember because you aren’t incorrectly trying to isolate the memory, or why remembering different “triggers” can help you free up the section of the brain that will remember.  Feel free to correct me, I’m struggling to remember what i learned 20 years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one knows yet for sure how the brain memory works. i'll explain how scientist thinks the brain memory works nevertheless.</p>
<p>The brain memory is made up of alot of parts. Unlike the memory cards on your computer these parts are also made up of another little parts which will help one another to build a memory for you from scratch, and it is quite common sometimes that some of those little parts fail to help and thus you have an incomplete memory.</p>
<p>Scientists believe that the memory process goes through 3 sections:
-encoding(brain recieving information)
-consolidation (brain storing information)
-retrival( brain picking up information)</p>
<p>the memory goes through these 3 sections alot quicker if that specific memory had went through it a lot of times before, this is why when you keep repeating a sentence you'll memorize it and it will take less time for you to remember.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
