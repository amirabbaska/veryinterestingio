<p>For peppers, The air in the void mostly has the same composition as the atmosphere and the air got there largely by diffusion through the fruit's tissues as the fruit (and the space) grew bigger.
With regards peppers; wild peppers are small and fairly packed with seeds, so there isn't a lot of space inside them at all. What space there is is present because, unlike their close relatives the potato and tomato they don't fill the cavity of their fruits with a liquid or gel. I'm not sure it is understood why chilli fruits don't also have a gel filling the fruit's interior but I would hazard a guess that it is likely to do with the fact that capsaicin (the spicy chemical) is not (very) water soluble.
Coming back to the larger sweet or bell peppers, these have large interior spaces because humans bred these peppers to have large fruits with lots of flesh and clearly the mutations which were cultivated for these traits did not also increase the size of the seeds by the same proportion.</p>

<p>So I'm being original, here's what I get from it.
The air inside a pepper is the same as the air outside the pepper. Kinda how water from the ground becomes the water in the fruit, the air around the plant diffuses into the air inside the gaps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I remember being a kid and going to an aquarium and having the guides say that kelp stays verticle because it has air in bulbs on the stem.  I asked each guide where the air comes from and none knew.  Does reddit know?

<p>The bell pepper flesh is semi-permeable. The air inside it is mostly just air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
