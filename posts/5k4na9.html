In the city of Yakutsk, temperatures reach well below -60 degrees Celcius, so why is it so difficult to live in Antarctica?</p>
<p>Also, wouldn't Antarctica be a prime location for trading ports since ports wouldn't be too far from South America, Africa, and Australia?</p></div></div>

<li>the coast of Antarctica may not have as severe lows as some cities, but its average temperature is still much, much lower, below freezing for most of the year</li>
<li>due to the low temperatures, liquid water is scarce and agriculture is not possible...a city in Antarctica would never be self sufficient with current technology</li>
<li>the seas are rough and treacherous, and impassable for some winter months</li>
<li>the coast of Antarctica is <em>not</em> particularly close to New Zealand, Australia, or South Africa...and the portions of South America it is near to are sparsely inhabited</li>
<li>there are not many resources in Antarctica that make it worthwhile to have a city there</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually trading ports start because there's some resource <strong>on the land</strong> being farmed/manufactured/mined/etc to bother shipping.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Antarctica is not on the way to or between anything. <a href="https://www.shipmap.org/" target="_blank">here</a> is some info on where freight shipping actually travels.</p>
<p>Ports of value in the modern world either have a lot of big spendy buyers  (is a destination for goods), cheap labor (is a destination for raw materials), or has a lot of manufactured goods or raw materials for export.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of infrastructure to make a new settlement habitable. Farming to provide plants to eat. Fresh drinking water (wells, dams), and waste water removal and treatment. An energy source for general power needs, heating/air conditioning, vehicles, communication. Roads, bridges, piers-- and raw materials to make them, and all the buildings. Garbage/ waste management.</p>
<p>In the future, if the Earth becomes quite warm overall, it may turn out that humans populate and farm more and more remote, formerly icy regions. The extreme north and south are the final frontier (on land). So imagine any frontier story (Wild West for e.g.). Settlers on virgin land needed to fell wood to have wood for shelter and heat, dig wells and latrines, till the earth, and everything else.</p>
<p>In the US frontier days, the land provided necessities. Imports were for luxuries like glass, and sugar. If Antarctica was a frontier now, would it be viable, or would it need to import necessities like food? In the future, could the land support farming? What would the land and sea not be able to provide?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
