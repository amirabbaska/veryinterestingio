However, the part of the brain in the macaques that responded so strongly to the snake images is conserved across primate species, including humans. I'd say it's likely. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember a show talking about how humans instinctively recognise spider and snake like shapes. They did the test on babies.  Although that's as far as it goes the fear of danger they seemed to suggest came from nurture... Hence why some people love spiders and others are terrified... It is from how people react to them as you develop that influences your reactions to them. </p>
<p>We recognise those as traditionally in the wild they were two huge dangers to our survival. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about humans but there was a study from my psychology class that showed  captive monkeys who've never seen snakes before do not instinctively fear snakes. However, when shown videos of alternating frames of scared monkeys and snakes vs. scared monkeys and flowers, the captive monkeys started fearing snakes but not the flowers. This could be evidence of prepared learning (easier to learn certain things than others)</p>
<p>Edit: the monkeys have never seen flowers prior to the video either</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Fear of snakes is one of our oldest fears - there is a file deep in the most primitive part of your brain that's just a bunch of snake diagrams.
