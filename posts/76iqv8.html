		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you start to get hungry your body starts preparing for food by producing stomach acid and other fluids that will help with digestion. If you don't eat, those fluids are still there in your stomach and for some people that can create a sensation of nausea. It will fade if you keep not eating as those fluids will be reabsorbed by your body. Or you can eat something <del>blad</del> bland, like bread or crackers, to put the fluids to use and that should help as well.  </p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the gold!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“Hunger” is actually, loosely, a few different things.</p>
<p>Your body has structures that can track and maintain a natural circadian rhythm, not only involving when you sleep or wake up, but also when your brain is active, when to raise or lower your body temperature, and when you are eating or resting.</p>
<p>Your body learns to estimate the time and amount of certain food that comes into your body, and appropriately releases hormones like insulin to deal with this intake of food.</p>
<p>When you tend to shock your body with energy-dense food every lunchtime, your body will release large amounts of insulin around that time every day. This large amount of insulin causes your blood sugar to quickly leave the bloodstream, as well as trigger other food-digestion-preparation things in the digestive system.</p>
<p>The experience of “hunger” you describe is when your body starts doing this food-anticipation thing, but the food is nowhere to be found. In this situation, you can experience hypoglycemia (really low levels of blood sugar, or low levels of absorbable blood sugar) which can cause the nausea.</p>
<p>Arguably, hypoglycemia to the point of nausea isn’t “normal”.
If you eat a more balanced diet and significantly less sugary stuff on a regular basis, you body will learn to not overdo the insulin. And you should experience a normal craving for food, rather than weakness and nausea. That’s ideally speaking, anyway. Different people’s bodies can have different quirks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A different perspective:  you have two brains.  One is in your head.  The other is mixed in with your gut, end-to-end.  Both are connected to each other.</p>
<p>Eating is critical enough to your survival that when you don't have enough food, it's critical that eating be a priority above all other thing.  So it's like having both flashing lights and a loud alarm.  </p>
<p>The criticality is linked to the reason you have two brains - <strong>the gut brain actually came first, evolution-wise, because simple animals could do without a &quot;head brain&quot; but not without a &quot;gut brain&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>So nausea is the gut-brain equivalent of pain associated with hunger.  The head-brain version you are conscious of, as a human, is the tacked-on after-thought version that evolved from having a gut-brain first.</p>
<p>This dichotomy probably has something to do with eating disorders.   It's also related to other head-gut experiences as well.</p>
<p>&quot;Gut-feelings&quot; are when a deep, emotional reptilian brain sense kicks in, and that's the part most directly connected to your gut-brain so you get queazy.  </p>
<p>&quot;Getting Butterflies&quot; when you fall in love is something you feel in your stomach and gut.  Again, the part of your head-brain involved in emotions is most directly connected to your gut-brain, so you feel it there as well.</p>
<p>This also has medical implications - you have the same neurotransmitter receptors in your head-brain and gut-brain, so often when you take a medicine for your head, you have side-effects in your gut.  And vice versa.</p>
<p>There is also evidence now that your bacterial friends in your gut can affect your health rather profoundly.  It's also very likely that includes mental health indirectly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My doctor explained that it was due to low blood sugar, so your body activates the sympathetic nervous system causing a symptom like nausea. Term being &quot;hypoglycemia&quot;
Growing up it was really hard for me to eat breakfast in the morning because I would feel nauseous because my stomach was so empty. I thought something was wrong until he explained it was due to my glucose levels and low blood sugar. So now i usually eat a little before bed and I don't get that feeling anymore. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nausea is being caused by low blood sugar.</p>
<p>Apparently, when your sugar drops too low (or too high), your body alters your stomach contractions in order to change the rate that food moves through your system.</p>
