<p>Think of it like hot asphalt in the summer, which, because of the build up of heat from sunlight, gets much hotter than the air temperature. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary reason that icicles can drip in a below-freezing environment is because they're receiving heat from another source besides the ambient air around them. The two cases that I can think of off the top of my head are the following: 1) That the icicles are near or attached to a house with heating, and the heat from the house is causing the icicles to receive heat and melt a little. This is similar to the reason that the snow on the roofs of houses will melt over time even in below freezing temperatures. 2) The icicles are receiving solar radiation, which provide energy to their surfaces separately from the energy provided by the air. This effect is most pronounced in places like Arizona, where in the summer temperatures can wildly vary (20 degrees plus) when moving between shade and lit areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming they’re outside and it’s been sunny at least a bit, water/ice may be mostly clear but it’s still absorbs energy from light. That light might not be enough to heat the air to 32f+ but in direct contact with the ice it can still heat up the surface to cause water to form. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So far everyone's mentioned heat but 1 factor no one has mentioned is purity. Pure water will freeze at 32F / 0C but impure water will freeze at a lower point. Salt water freezes at 28.4F / -2C. Altitude and pressure also play a role so when you take heat, purity and altitude/pressure into consideration, ice can melt when it's below freezing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The icicles are not melting. The heat of your house is melting the snow on the roof. That water runs  down to the edge, when it gets to the edge its no longer above the warm house so it starts to freeze where it drips off the roof. Eventually the drips of melted snow from the roof freeze on top of each other and an icicle is formed. Not all of this water freezes before it makes it to the bottom of the icicle so some of it drips off. If you have a lot of icicles on your roof it means the insulation in your attic is not sufficient and you are loosing a lot of heat through your roof.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
