		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for the worlds largest pigment manufacturer so this is right in my wheelhouse.</p>
<p>/u/Siarles worded it perfectly before. The UV light from sunlight breaks the chemical bonds in the pigment molecule. There are bigger, bulkier, pigment molecules that are most resistant to UV degradation. Meaning, they will last longer exposed to the sun. Which is why we use more durable pigments in car paints and building paints than we do for interior wall colors.</p>
<p>Take [Pigment Red 3] (<a href="http://www.dyestuffintermediates.com/pigment-dye/pigment-red-3.html" target="_blank">http://www.dyestuffintermediates.com/pigment-dye/pigment-red-3.html</a>) versus <a href="http://www.dyestuffintermediates.com/pigment-dye/pigment-red-122.html" target="_blank">Pigment Red 122</a>. You can easily notice Red 122 has many more rings, and is much more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system" target="_blank">conjugated.</a> This conjugation and rings are commonly double bonds and have functional groups (such as Cl) that improve UV resistance since single bonds are much more easily broken by UV than double bonds. This is why Red 122 is commonly used in exterior paints that you would use to paint your house.</p>
<p>Now on to bleaching. It depends for each pigment. Some will bleach completely white. Some will get darker or even shift colors. For instance, a red pigment exposed to the sun may bleach white, it may get bluer (think more violet) or it may get more yellow (turning orange-ish). It may stay the same shade and just get darker or lighter. It just depends on the chemical structure and how the UV is breaking the molecule apart.</p>
<p>So no, the pigment doesn't evaporate. It decomposes into smaller, often colorless (white) molecules. Sometimes they decompose into very similar molecules that just shift the shade slightly until it eventually turns white (reflecting the sunlight so we see white).</p>
<p>Feel free to ask any more questions about pigments, I will likely be able to answer easily!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The UV light in the sunlight is what does the bleaching. That component of light has a wavelength small enough that it is smaller than the length of the chemical bond in the pigment. Pigments are rather large molecules. You can look up the chemical structures of some of them. The UV light will break this bond and render the pigment, no longer a pigment. The color doesn't go anywhere, it's simply not chemically a colored molecule anymore. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

I'm not sure if everything works this way, but in my line of profession:</p>
<p>The molecules that reflect color have conjugated double bonds (single-double-single-double-etc), and are known as chromophores.  As energy is absorbed, usually as UV in light, it would interrupt this pattern.  As less and less molecules have the preserved conjugation, our eyes interpret this as lessoning in intensity.</p>
<p>Look at any piece of red playground equipment (consumer level) for an example.  Those are notoriously the hardest to preserve original intensity.</p>
<p>Energy is not the only way to disrupt this sequence, as can chemical (bleach, for example).</p>
<p>At my plant, we have to do accelerated light fading tests and rate on a scale from 1-5, which is stated on our C of A with other properties.</p>
<p>You can use coatings/etc to slow this process down, in the form of UV stabilizers.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best way to think about this is a topic of absorption. You ever notice that when you wear white, you are physically cooler than when you wear dark outside in the sun. This is because the visible light has energy too. If something is red, it will absorb the entire spectrum of visible light except for red and reflect that. That's why you see it as red. The light reflecting off that object is only in the red spectrum of visible light. Darker colors absorb more. Lighter colors reflect more. All that absorbed energy is going to do some work. Most of it simply increases the temperature of the molecules that absorbed it. Because those exact molecules (the red paint), individually absorb the most energy, they are the most altered by the energy. This energy can cause chemical changes (partly due to heat, but also due to just energy absorption) to the paint. These chemical changes continue until the resulting surface reflects more light (lightens) as then less energy is being absorbed and the rate of change goes down. This is why a dark surface fades faster than a light surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
