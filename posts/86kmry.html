		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>New Materialism is a new body of theory that is still being developed. There are a lot of different thinkers that are part of this emerging field, and there isn't clear agreement between all of them. They come from many different disciplines as well (e.g. study of science and technology, philosophy, sociology, quantum physics, ecology). </p>
<p>The few things that they appear to agree upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The world, and everything in it is always changing. Nothing is stable -- whether that's the earth beneath our feet (e.g. constant tectonic plate movement, microbes helping to decompose soil), our social institutions (e.g. governments, religions, families), or ourselves (e.g. emotions, bodily mass, etc.) Because of this, new materialists don't focus their work on explaining what something IS, but what it DOES in this flow of constant change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The world is not made of opposites (like good/bad, nature/culture, social/material, man/woman). The most fundamental of these opposites that new materialists reject is social/material. They feel that postmodernists focused too much on the social (e.g. using language, culture, or economics to explain too much), and so they want to bring the material realm back (but do so with some of the lessons of postmodernism in mind). This is why some new materialist theorists talk about an &quot;object-oriented ontology&quot; in which matter becomes central. <a href="http://bogost.com/writing/blog/what_is_objectoriented_ontolog/" target="_blank">See Ian Bogost's definition.</a></p>
</li>
<li>Everything in the world has the capacity to impact the world. Sometimes this is referred to as &quot;affect&quot; or &quot;agency&quot;. Humans are not the only ones with this capacity. This is why some new materialist theorists talk about &quot;post-humanism&quot; and use new materialism to discuss how humans can act more ethically in a changing world (e.g. with regard to animal rights, climate change, etc.). </li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t it weird that we were scared of the Jurassic Park dinosaurs? Like, they were just dead animals in the ground and with our huge scientific abilities we were able to create these living beasts once again, who immediately terrified us as soon as they got out of hand. What contributed to how we understood the dinosaurs?</p>
<p>They weren’t scary just because they were large killing animals, because Jurassic Park wasn’t any ordinary movie about lions</p>
<p>They weren’t scary because it was a kind of robots turning on us, because Jurassic Park wasn’t any kind of iRobot/Terminator/etc. movies</p>
<p>Instead, Jurassic Park was scary because of their interplay. Technology allowed us to bring back this freak species from millions of ears ago back, that weird technological feat then stayed true to its natural origin and fight against its constraining conditions — us. So what were the Jurassic Park dinosaurs? They are the widest spread representation of what dinosaurs were. They weren’t just scary animals, and they weren’t just technology gone awry, they were both. </p>
<p>New Materialism would say that the Jurassic Park dinosaurs are a really good example of the “mutual construction” (fancy word for two ideas building off of each other, like twins growing up together and influencing one another) of technology and life. As we get more material control over life, as we can do more things/enact larger change/achieve greater precision, we make life more technological (phone addiction, prosthetics, FitBits, workplace efficiency measures). With life as an idea closer to technology than before, technology is also closer to life than before. Digital images can go “viral”, programs can have “artificial” intelligence, dinosaurs made in a lab can turn on you and eat you.</p>
<p>This is happening all over the world, and in a lot more contexts than just technology/life. How we lay the line dividing “nature” (green forests n jungles and stuff) from “culture”(all the not green stuff with humans), “subject” (thing that does something) from “object” (thing that is only ever pushed around), and “self” (me! In my entirety?) from “other” (literally everything else), are all questions taken up by New Materialism, which attempts to answer them by investigating the histories of how certain concepts came to mean what they do now.</p>
<p>For example, let’s talk about the idea of uploading your brain to the internet. Did you know that spiritualism exploded in the 19th century because telegraphs were invented? Before then, you always had some kind of physical contact with whoever you were talking to, even if it was just that they had mailed the letter you opened. Now that you could get messages from literally the other side of the world without ever having to interact with the other person, people thought that talking to the dead wasn’t too much of a stretch. At the time, they could talk to them as much as they could someone in Eurasia. The electrical world of communication was seen as this cool other plane where just like human energy and spirit could exist. Yes, obviously the telegraph mechanics knew how telegraphs worked, but to the vast public it was still a marvel. Fast-forward a century, there’s this super cool new technology called the Internet. It does the same thing telegraphs do, but now it’s on steroids (if you want a fun internet hole to go down, look up Technopagans). As we’ve sequenced the genome and neural research is getting increasingly advanced (read: technology is increasingly improving our control and understanding over life), we have the idea that we can not only talk through technology, but actually exist in it. The idea that the important parts (those that we care about to prove “aliveness”: consciousness, ability to communicate) of a human can be uploaded to technology is not a new idea. It comes culturally informed by a long reorientation of what “life” means and what this fuzzy thing called “technology” might change it, while nonetheless being bound by the facts of the world (new technology made this more possible, the brain is a hard thing to image, etc).</p>
<p>New Materialism says “hey, we have these ideas about what things are, we also know that these ideas have had different meanings in the past, and nobody really intentionally pushed these changes in the first place. So why’d they change? What mix of actions, reactions, and facts of the world (material conditions/the physical way things are) caused them? To bring it back to Jurassic Park, it says that it’s significant that humans <em>made</em> the dinosaurs and not discover them, and that we care so much about the process of <em>genetically coding</em> them so that they were that much more scary when they were set up to scare us, but it’s equally interesting that the way the dinosaurs looked/the method of creation used (genes)/the fact that we had never interacted with them was influenced by factors we don’t necessarily always consider to be actors (things that do things). Dinosaur bone structure, genetic chemistry, and the procession of time all don’t really choose to go out and do things, but they have influenced one of our main cultural touchstones for the interaction of technology and life. Seeing this picture in its entirety is New Materialism</p>
<p>TLDR: new materialism is understanding that ideas/conceptions of things have complicated histories contributed to by not only people but also things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
