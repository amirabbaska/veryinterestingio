Given that drinking water pipes are not regularly flushed out with bleach or something, how is it that drinking water is not totally filthy from going through dirty pipes?</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for all the responses guys!  Especially from the water treatment and plumbing experts.  Didn't expect to get such a big reaction!</p></div></div>

</blockquote>
<p>They are, essentially. Drinking water supplies contain a low concentration of chlorine bleach or another disinfectant to prevent germs growing.</p>
<p>Also the pipes are sealed, with valves and taps designed to prevent air containing germs being drawn in, and they're opaque so light algae need to grow doesn't get in.</p>
<p>EDIT: As many people have mentioned, not all places and countries leave the disinfectant in the water. Ensuring that it's clean when it enters the pipes - either with chemicals that are removed or with UV light - along with the pipes being airtight and dark and unfavourable to life is when done correctly enough to keep the water clean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Public water supplies DO have chemicals added, but for people like me that live in rural areas with private wells, essentially it's just the process of using the water on a regular basis that keeps it fresh. </p>
<p>Algea and such come from surface contamination, but well water left in pipes for a few weeks or more may get stagnant or have rust from old steel pipes. </p>
<p>Last summer I inadvertantly left my garden hose running all day and ran my well dry.  After it finally refilled in a day or two from the surrounding ground water, I had to &quot;reprime&quot; the system and let the water run to clear out large contaminants like minerals and rust. The water smelled funny and was brownish for a few days. </p>
<p>Even under normal circumstances, I probably ingest small amounts of of microscopic minerals, small celled organisms, rust,etc.
Not enough to be harmful, some of the minerals might even be good for me. </p>
<p>Remember, humanity has been drinking &quot;dirty&quot; water out in nature for most of our existence. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It greatly depends the country you're in. A lot of commenters here mention chlorine as main means of desinfection, combined with copper piping. That certainly is the case in the US and many other countries. In other countries, like the Netherlands where I live, chlorine desinfection isn't common practice. Only 20รท of households in the Netherlands recieve chlorinated water and in that case chlorine isn't used as a primary desinfectant (as that's not allowed), so the chlorine concentrations are very low. Primary means of desinfection is UV or ozon treatment (at the treatment plant). Growth of biological contaminents in the (mostly PE or PVC) piping is prefented by making sure no contaminents are present in the water before it enters the system, combined with measures to prefent introducing contaminents during transport, such as desinfecting piping with silverperoxide before use and mandatory anti-backflush valves at house connections. Apart from the methods mentioned above, there are many more options that are used around the globe, with fluctuating results; in some countries tap meets drinking water standards, sometimes even of better quality than bottled water (like in the Netherlands), in some countries tap water isn't meant for consumption as drinking water but only for use. While the Dutch take great pride in their drinking water quality, something could also be said for not cleaning the water you use for your washer / dishwasher / shower up to drinking water standards. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In the drinking water plant they add more chlorine to the water than is necessary to deal with any of the bugs that lived in it. This leaves extra floating about ready to deal with any other bugs it might possibly encounter in the pipes under the road or in your own house.</p>
<p>On top of that to make sure that there is always water with some of that extra chlorine in it operators will sometimes run taps at the dead ends of the underground pipes.  These constantly run water, and make sure that the older water gets pushed out of the dead end pipe by fresher water.</p>
<p>Also, operators like me (or people we pay) will routinely go around to fire hydrants and open them up full bore and spray a bunch of water all over the roads or into ditches or whatever.  This not only makes sure fresh water gets to all the pipes, it also makes the water run really fast through the pipes and it scours off any bugs, or buildup in which they could live, and spews them out of the hydrants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who designs municipal water systems, if you have a length of pipe that isn't being used enough and the water sits for more than 48 hours, it is considered stagnant. This is a condition to be avoided. </p>
<p>To prevent this, we make sure to connect the water system to itself at many points to increase flow, not use excessive pipe sizes and avoid dead ends in the system. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
