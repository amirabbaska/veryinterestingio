Being low margin businesses, they're not economically viable alone if you have to pay rental, wages and utilities for each business separately. They also require little floor space, allowing you to squeeze them together which you can't do for many other businesses. </p>
<p>The skill threshold for both jobs is also pretty low and easily trainable, not requiring skilled workers. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key copying machine is easy enough to operate and doesn't take a lot of space, so it's a good product for supplemental income in a shoe repair shop. The biggest problem with the key cutting machine is making sure you have enough of all the different blanks to be able to duplicate any key that comes in. With the chip keys for cars, that gets harder.  </p>
<p>I can't imagine cutting keys on shoe repair equipment. I guess it's technically possible, but wouldn't be easy. The key cutting machine uses the existing key as a guide. Without that guide, trying to cut a key would be difficult. I suppose you could rig up a device to do that with shoe repair equipment, but, at that point, you're better off just getting a key cutter.</p>
