		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Referencing personal experience, but I assume you're talking about non-STD type of ulcers, which are canker sores.</p>
<p>These are generally caused by crumbs of food still being in your mouth after you're done eating.  As they sit there, they feed bacterial growth at that spot and the acidity from the bacterial metabolism causes sores to form.</p>
<p>That's not the only cause, but that is one of the most common ones. If they are generally forming near the gums, that is the most likely cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you talking about kanker sores? If so then I've had thousands of them since childhood. I have one that just healed a actually. Although the Internet and the medical community are dumbfounded by the ulcers I have noticed some things about them over the decades. Obviously if you bite/cut the inside of your mouth you're pretty screwed. That's how I got most of mine as a child. When I got older I would seemingly randomly get them. I think I've narrowed it down to mild dehydration. My theory is that if you let your mouth dry out while your sleeping you get micro lesions or 'cracks' in the soft tissue of your mouth. These in turn become ulcers. No one has figured out where they come from yet but they can be prevented. </p>
<p>Brush the living hell out of your whole mouth every day. And not just your teeth.  All the soft tissue in your mouth. Every last crevice. </p>
<p>If you feel one starting focus on that area while brushing and put some salt on your finger tip and press against it. I recommend this only if it hasn't  'opened' yet. </p>
<p>Drink more water! If you wake up and your mouth is super dry then you're not getting enough water. Try to start with a minimum of 2L a day. I think that's half a gallon or so if you're American. </p>
<p>Limit sugary drinks like pop and alcohol. They dehydrate you. Also I found if you limit you citrus drinks that also seems to help, not sure why.</p>
<p>I'd like to note I'm not medically trained or anything. I've just had then my whole life ( I'm 36 now). I hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking about mouth ulcers that appear on the inside of your mouth, tongue and gums you can get them from trauma. So accidentally biting the inside of your tongue or mouth, jabbing yourself with your toothbrush etc. </p>
<p>Also ingredients in toothpaste can bring on mouth ulcers. My boyfriend used to suffer with mouth ulcers basically every few weeks. He started using a SLS free toothpaste a couple of months back and he has one since then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I get them because I have a condition know as Beh√ßet's Disease. It is an autoimmune disease that causes my immune system to attack the healthy tissue in my mouth causing ulcers. I have had this condition my whole life, living with at least one ulcer in my mouth at all times for for over 20 years (sometimes as many as 10-20 at one time). I have tried brushing more, brushing less, not drinking sodas, drinking more water, eating less spicy food, eating less gluten, etc., etc. Nothing works for me at getting rid of ulcers except steroid treatment with prednisone to suppress my immune system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
