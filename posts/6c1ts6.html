		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit, this is the first time I can answer a Reddit question as an actual &quot;professional&quot;. I'm a prehistoric archeology student, so basically trying to figure out exactly that is (hopefully) my future job. The answer is, we really don't. <strong>A lot</strong> of what we 'know&quot; is conjecture, which is fancy talk for &quot;educated wild ass guess&quot;.<br />
But we obviously base our guesses on some evidence. The more evidence you have, and the more detailed it is, the better your reconstruction. Finding out all those details takes a lot of highly specialized skills. And that's where we &quot;archaeological scientists&quot; (as opposed to archaeologists) come in. Archaeologists paint the broad picture, we fill in the little blanks. </p>
<p>The amount and kind of evidence you have depends on location and age, but older doesn't necessarily mean less evidence. Here in Switzerland, the Neolithic is one of the best studied prehistoric ages whereas we know next to nothing about some parts of the pre-roman Iron Age. That's because many Neolithic settlements were built on lake shores or even in lakes. And waterlogged environments cause excellent  preservation of organic remains. Let's try a simple reconstruction of a Neolithic lake shore town so you see how we work and what kind of evidence we use.  </p>
<p>We find wooden remains from stilt houses, which allow dendro-dating, which is precise to a few years, sometimes even to a few months. So we know how the town looked, how many houses there were and how old they are. The patterns of stilts also allow us to reconstruct certain dimensions of the houses, size of the settlements and so on.<br />
Inside the houses, we find bones of livestock, charred grains and fruit seeds, so we know what the people ate. Sometimes, we can analyze the remains of fats from ceramic shards to tell if they've been used to store milk or cheese.<br />
We find tools, fishing hooks made from bones, axes made from stone, arrowheads made from flint, maybe loom weights, if we're really lucky also wheels, oars and so on. In very rare cases, we might even find fishing nets or fabrics. If we map certain remains, like animal bones, we might see patterns that could indicate a hierarchy. Pigs are usually food for &quot;richer&quot; people because pigs aren't really good for anything else. A cow you can use for milk or labor and eat it when it's old.
If we're lucky enough to find corresponding burials, we can find out even more. Bones can tell you what a person did for most of their lives. Did they carry heavy loads, were they mostly sitting (working on a loom), is there evidence for malnutrition, are there signs of past, non-fatal injury? Isotope analysis can tell us what they ate. The more &quot;carnivorous&quot; a human is, the higher a certain value of a stable carbon isotope. We can also compare different isotope ratios between bones and teeth to determine if a person might not have died in the same broad geographic region that they grew up in (migration).<br />
Finally, we can analyze pollen from lake sediments of the same age. With those, it's possible to reconstruct the landscape. For the Neolithic, for example, you will find loads of tree pollen and very few grass pollen, which tells us that there were no large, open pastures, so livestock was kept on wood pastures. </p>
<p>For pre-agricultural societies, it gets more difficult. Large paleolithic find complexes are rare because there were no towns (not strictly true but let's keep it simple) and there are almost no areas where conditions were stable enough for long enough to allow for preservation of delicate organic material. But we can still find out details. We find stone tools made from flint, we can usually tell if they've been used and how, we find the cut marks the tools left on animal bones. Unfortunately, we basically never find any organic material, so we don't really know anything about paleolithic clothing, tool mountings and so on.  What we do find are burials, and that fact alone tells us that whoever buried their dead there had some sort of abstract concept of an afterlife. Because if life just stops with death, there's little that's stopping you from just dumping the dead body into the next ditch. There are some buried skulls that clearly show that the person had lost their teeth long ago, which means the rest of the group had to care for them for months or even years, telling us something about social structures.  </p>
<p>In some very rare cases, you might make the find of the century which reveals details you couldn't possibly have discovered otherwise. For the Neolithic Europe, that find was Ötzi, an ice mummy found in Italy in 1991. Ötzi and the stuff he carried when he died helped us reconstruct Neolithic clothing, everyday accessories, general health and so on. Of course, the problem with such unique find is always that you can't be sure how representative they are of the general situation.</p>
<p>In summary, archaeology is similar to detective work on a crime scene several thousand years old. You will never know what <strong>exactly</strong> happened but if you know what to look for, you can start to paint a general picture. There are facts you can rely on but some blanks you'll always have to fill in with your creativity and &quot;gut feeling&quot;. The art then is to strike a good balance between seeing those ancient people as humans who functioned in similar way to you, and projecting too much of your worldview onto them. Some of your traits as a human are universal, some aren't.  If you find a concentration of flower pollen in a paleolithic dwelling, it's not absurd to assume that maybe the inhabitants picked some flowers and put them in their hut because they looked pretty. But if you find a man and a woman buried in the same grave, don't claim they were &quot;husband and wive&quot; just because that seems to make sense in <em>your</em> culture. </p>
<p>tldr: To find out what humans did before they could write down what they did, a bunch of lunatics will carefully sift through metric tons of mud and then make educated guesses based on what they found.</p>
<p>I know this was a super long reply but I get kinda excited if someone is interested in what I do \^\^ Keep in mind, this reply is rather Euro-centric. The archaeological situation and methods are different in other parts of the world although the general idea is the same.
If anyone wants to know more, just ask, I'd be happy to try and reply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can check out the research done on footprints. There are fossilized footprints. When Australian aborigines were asked about them they could fill in a large amount of detail about the group just from the footprints.</p>
<p>We do miss a huge amount. I do not think archeologists focus enough on rope building, or making nets, or snares, because these things perish.</p>
<p>There is a site in South Africa filled with fish bones. The sea was never that high. The fish were carried there for a fish fry. The fish live fairly deep. Someone stood on the shore and lured them in. There are puncture marks in the ribs. Someone speared these fish after they were lured in.</p>
<p>You can picture it. There is a party on the shore where the fishing is done. A group is catching the fish, stringing them up on a line or thin branch. After plenty of fish are caught they are carried up higher for the cooking.</p>
<p>There are caves in Africa with layers of deposits. The deep ones show that the caves are dens. There are many bones of prey animals including human ancestors with gnaw marks on them. The later layers have human skeletons intact, and many many prey animals with scrape marks from slicing the meat off with stone tools. There is evidence of hearths used for fires for a million years.</p>
<p>We do not know a lot of things. But there are remains of things in deposits of volcanic ash. The ash deposits built up over a million years. There is evidence of human ancestors traversing through this separated by that time.</p>
<p>Every fossil, every bit of bone, is intensely scrutinized and tested to get the maximum information. Isotope analysis is done which can determine the diet over a lifetime. </p>
<p>Humans have put their palms against cave walls for a long time, and blown colored dust over their hands. Individual hands can be picked out. Some had a broken finger which healed crookedly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just like any other scientific or academic discipline - we follow the evidence.</p>
<p>This includes pottery and stone fragments (mostly tools), footprints, ancient drawings / glyphs / paintings (like you'd expect to find in a cave), and sometimes ancient structures (from burial sites, to megaliths, to temples and other settlements). Bones of course are also very important (both human/humaoid bones and animal bones with signs of human activity).</p>
<p>Some people also focus on geological evidence e.g. &quot;oh look, this desert used to be an ancient lake!&quot; This is a big part of the puzzle.</p>
<p>Put all these together, and this gives you a pretty good idea of the kind of lifestyle these ancient people used to have. Ultimately, a lot of this is educated guesswork. Some things are just impossible to know with 100% certainty - but the more evidence you gather, the more support you get and the bigger the likelihood that this was how these people lived back then.</p>
<p>The biggest issue really (aside from lack of written records) is the lack of organic / biological matter, which leaves out a huge piece of the puzzle. This is because organic matter is the first to simply decompose - so it's super rare to find preserved biological matter.</p>
<p>Bones certainly go a long way to help, but these pale (in terms of information you can find out) in comparison to actual preserved bodies (as are sometimes found in ice, bogs, or sometimes mummified even today).</p>
<p>Also there is still a lot of study into cultural &quot;myths and legends&quot; to see if these are stories with any historical basis (albeit, often greatly exaggerated). The &quot;great flood&quot; is a particular one which is believed to have occurred (though that doesn't mean that there was a guy called Noah or anything like that).</p>
<p>Tl;dr - we look at all the available evidence, and draw (usually) educated conclusions based on this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Huge areas were flooded and traces of human habitation there are mostly lost...like Doggerland</p>
<p>&quot;The archaeological potential of the area had first been identified in the early 20th century, but interest intensified in 1931 when a fishing trawler operating east of the Wash dragged up a barbed antler point that was subsequently dated to a time when the area was tundra. Vessels have dragged up remains of mammoth, lion and other animals, as well as a few prehistoric tools and weapons&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I highly recommend A Brief History of Humankind. And humans (the homo genus) has existed for a couple million years.  Homo sapiens for around 200,000 years. </p>
<p>Humans were mostly foragers and left behind few artefacts before about 12-13k years ago so not much for sure. There was some sort of Cognitive revolution and proof of exploration and craftsmanship prior. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
