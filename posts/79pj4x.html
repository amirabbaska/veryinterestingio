		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Metals are better at conducting heat. The heat from your hand flows quickly into the metal, cooling your hand and your nerves detect that. Air is a much poorer heat conductor, which is why you can safely put your hands in a 250Â°C oven, as long as you don't touch the dish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you don't actually sense temperature directly (your body temperature stays almost constant in most situations), you sense the flow of heat into or out of your body. Metal conducts heat very well, so when your warm hand touches it, a lot of heat flows out of your hand and spreads out into the metal before it can reach equilibrium, and your body has to work harder to keep your hand warm. In contrast, touching a good insulator like wood will not feel that cold, since you almost immediately warm up the part you are touching and that heat stays in just that location, requiring little flow. For the same reason, a hot piece of metal will feel hotter than a piece of wood at the same temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has internal sensors, which measure temperature in your body.  So what matters in the change of those temperatures is the heat flow into or out of your body.  That relies on Conduction, Convection, Radiation, and evaporation.</p>
<p>Highly conductive things that are cooler than body temperature feel colder than things that are bigger insulators.  Like why concrete floors feel colder than carpeted floors, even though they are the same temperature.  It's the same reason when it is 70 degrees out in the sunshine, it feels great, but if you are in 70 degree water in the shade, you'd shiver, and actually, if you stayed long enough (a day or 2), you'd die from hypothermia because it would transfer heat away from your body too fast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It feel colder because metal is a better thermal conductor than air. Your body only senses changes in temperature, not absolute temperature, so something that conducts heat away from or towards you hand faster will seem colder or warmer, respectively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Your body doesn't have an absolute thermometer, it can only feel the degree that it loses or gains heat between the body and some other object. Metal is a good conductor so cold metal conducts heat away from your body faster than for other materials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
