		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Played at the same speed, the difference is in the accent â€” that is, where you put more emphasis.</p>
<p>Listen to Sousa's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr0ZI3j-fT8" target="_blank">Fairest of the Fair</a>. As soon as the drums kick in, you should be able to get a really strong &quot;one, two. one, two.&quot; sort of feel. That's what 2/2 or 2/4 sounds like.</p>
<p>Now pay attention to the bass line for Queen's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO6D_BAuYCI" target="_blank">Crazy Little Thing Called Love</a>. That's a &quot;one two three four&quot; feel. That's your 4/4.</p>
<p>Let's try the ones that are multiples of three now. 3/4 vs 6/8 is the difference between &quot;One and Two and Three and One and Two and Three and (...)&quot; for 3/4, and &quot;One and a Two and a One and a Two and a (...)&quot; for 6/8: one has three beats that divide into two halves, the other has two beats that divide into thirds. You can hear this difference in Bernstein's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy6wo2wpT2k" target="_blank">America</a> from West Side Story: The bit that goes &quot;<em>I</em> like to <em>live</em> in A-<em>me</em>-<em>ri</em>-<em>ca</em>&quot;. Note how The first half has two accents (&quot;I&quot; and &quot;live&quot;) and is in 6/8, and the second half is 3/4 with emphasis on &quot;me&quot;, &quot;ri&quot;, &quot;ca&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its not always about the ratio, its mostly about where you want the emphasis to be and how fast that beat goes.  Also keep in mind that in many 20th century arrangements composers will stick in measures with different time signatures to produce a certain effect, and those measures don't always behave the same as if an entire piece were written in that meter.  </p>
<p>Some time signatures are close to interchangeable.  2/4 is often really similar to 2/2 or &quot;cut&quot; time even though those aren't the same ratio as 2/4.  Having the beats on quarter notes is a little easier to read for some musicians that haven't played a lot of the old marches written in cut time. </p>
<p>Others are not.  3/4 is 3 beats per measure, each beat being subdivided into 2, while 6/8 is 2 beats subdivided into 3.</p>
<p>6/4 can mean a few things.  If an entire piece is written in 6/4, it probably is in a slow 3.  But if a random measure is in a piece, it may just represent a 4/4 + a 2/4 measure to extend a phrase by a couple of beats.</p>
<p>In addition to 2 vs 3 feel, the composer arranger will take other things into account, like how much work would the conductor be doing, and how much effort is to write everything out.  Going back to 2/4 vs cut time, the advantage of 2/2 is that really fast notes can be written as 16th notes instead of 32nd notes.  That makes it easier to read and easier to write.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main difference is a combination of which notes get emphasized, how the notes are distributed in the measure, and what kind of music is traditionally played in that time signature.</p>
<p>2/2 with emphasizing every other beat, divide each measure into two parts, and have a march-like quality.  4/4 emphasized every fourth beat, and you might see a quarter note-half note-quarter note order you would be unlikely to see in 2/2.</p>
<p>Similarly, 3/4 is usually a waltz 1-2-3, a measure's rhythm would rarely be divided between two dotted quarter notes.  In 6/8, when it is divided, it is almost always going to be divided into two parts between the third and fourth beats.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally an ELI5 I can answer.</p>
<p>One of the important things in music when composing is how the accents are placed. This is basically just musical emphasis. It can either be marked directly, where a little symbol is placed underneath the note, or indirectly, where a time signature is used.</p>
<p>Take, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/Nz0b4STz1lo?t=1m35s" target="_blank">this section</a> from Gustav Holst's <em>Jupiter</em>.</p>
<p>As you can hear, the emphasis is a &quot;<strong>dun</strong> dun dun <strong>dun</strong> dun dun&quot; where each of the emphasis (I'm unimaginative) is on the third beat. If you try and imagine the emphasis on each other beat in a &quot;<strong>dun</strong> dun <strong>dun</strong> dun <strong>dun</strong> dun&quot;, it would sound much different (if we stripped the piece of the chords and had just the horns playing at that point).</p>
<p>Now, here's the kicker: <strong>This should explain it.</strong> Now, of course, you might not understand it, so here goes:</p>
<p>The piece is currently in the time of 6/8. This is a series known as <strong>compound time</strong>. This is basically where you get groupings of 3 in one beat.</p>
<p>The visualisation where the duns would be on the other beat is what's known as <strong>simple time.</strong> This is basically where you get groupings of 2 in one beat. (it would be in 3/4 btw)</p>
<p>Next, to answer your question, listen to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dPn9M7TLlI" target="_blank">Colonel Bogey March.</a> You can feel a 2 feel - 1,2,1,2 -  this is due to the accents, which are naturally placed. Listen to the bassline in particular - you can hear a repeating pattern in groups of 2s.</p>
<p>Now listen to Queen's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4Mc-NYPHaQ" target="_blank">Break Free.</a> Hopefully you can feel the 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4. You'll notice a lot of pop songs are written this way.</p>
<p>Both of those pieces can have a 4/4 time signature or a 2/2 - but it doesn't work for either.</p>
<p>As for why composers just use 2/4 instead of 2/2 - the way music is written, it's a lot harder to read if the music is fast.</p>
<p>I hope I explained myself well, this being the first ELI5 I've written.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference is in the grouping of beats which translates into a different feel when used correctly.</p>
<p>For example, 3/4 and 6/8. 3/4 is one meter divided into three beats, while 6/8 can be two groups of three beats or three groups of two beats. To simplify, think of 6/8 as two sets of triplets and you'll maybe be able to feel the difference. </p>
<p>Now, technically, if you wrote a piece in 3/4 but made your primary beat division the eighth note, then yes, you're basically playing 6/8 while being numbered 3/4. Nothing technically wrong with doing that. But even then, seeing 3/4 at the front should make the musician play differently than he would in 6/8, just because they create different mindsets even if they're technically the same thing. Different beat groupings translates into different accented notes, which can totally change the feel of an instrument line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
