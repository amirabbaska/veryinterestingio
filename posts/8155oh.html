		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Survivor(ship) bias.</p>
<p>Even with age correction, one of the most likely explanations is that survivor bias spans all age groups.  In a less developed country with limited access to healthcare, everyday infections, diseases, and ailments in general become much more severe.  </p>
<p>Still, there are other factors that contribute to differences in cancer incidence rate.  These are, but are not limited to, regional diet (particularly diets that are high in anti-oxidants and micronutrients), genetics and epigenetics, lifestyle, and the prevalence/absence of certain occupational hazards.</p>
<p>Also it should be mentioned that the method and frequency of detection of said cancers may not be on equal footing.</p>
<p>I will also mention that some people believe the higher incidence rate is linked with obesity, diets with copious amounts of processed food, and higher substance abuse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know this for sure, but I would guess access to diagnosis. I'll use my own story for example. I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer two years ago (caught early, total thyroidectomy, and didnt even have to do radioactive iodine. Booyah). Had I not had access to health care, that thyroid nodule probably would have grown until it impacted the function of my thyroid, which could either straight up kill me on its own (if my thyroid stopped functioning entirely) or increase my risk of death otherwise. I would still have had cancer, but it could possibly never be known. </p>
<p>In richer countries  (like the US), cancer rates are higher among those who are poor, because of decreased access to health care and other increased risk factors (those in poverty are more exposed to pollution, for example). Chances are, a big factor is diagnosis access. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in cancer therapy.</p>
<p>The difference is not in the real rate of cancer - it's in the diagnosed rate. </p>
<p>In poor countries, people die first of other reasons - malnutrition, infectious diseases, warfare, etc... in the rich world they grow old to die of degenerative diseases, like cancer.</p>
<p>In poor countries, people get sick and die without ever seeing a doctor. In rich countries, you bring grandma to the hospital, so they know to write &quot;metastasized breast cancer to the brain&quot; as the cause of death.</p>
<p>In poor countries, there is no screening tests to detect the cancer ahead of time. In rich countries, we do it for breast, prostate, rectum, probably lung at some point. Note that this is a big reason why the survival stats look better in the rich countries. Even if the rich person lives not one day longer, if we've known about their cancer for 7 years we'll jot that down as &quot;7 year survival&quot;, while the person from the poor country who walks in with half their face covered by a tumor and dies the next day, will not.</p>
<p>Then there's lack of access to easy treatments. Pap tests allow for us to discover the pre-cancer disease which is very easy to treat. As a result (also the HPV vaccine), cervical cancer is pretty much eradicated in the rich countries. The only people to get it, are essentially those who don't get their pap tests done for mental/social (outside US) or financial (inside US) reasons, with very rare exceptions. However, it's the third most common cancer worldwide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In poor countries people die young. In rich countries they don't die young nearly as often. The number one risk factor to developing cancer is age. More people die of cancer in rich countries because they aren't dying from malnutrition, preventable diseases, lack of access to clean water etc. They live to ripe old ages, where the odds of getting cancer skyrocket.</p>
<p>EDIT * Didn't catch that the stats were age-standardized. No idea now. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it’s as simple as the food supply.</p>
<p>My family is from Nicaragua. People down there live a really long time, even though healthcare sucks. However, they eat super healthy foods. Mostly beans and rice, fruits and veg, with just a little meat here and there,</p>
<p>I’ve got 3 members of my family in their late 90’s and early 100’s living there.</p>
<p>Now, almost all the food you eat in Nicaragua comes from a farm that is literally walking distance from where you’re eating it. </p>
<p>Outside of Managua, and the other touristy areas, you’ll find no processed foods. No fast food. No frozen dinners, etc...</p>
<p>Pretty much everything you eat is organic. Farm animals are not given growth hormones and vegetables are not GMO. This is simply because farmers can’t afford this technology. They’re still farming like they did 100 years ago, for the most part. </p>
<p>Here in America, the bulk of everyone’s diet consists of foods drenched in chemicals, which  are also full of additives and fillers.</p>
<p>I imagine this is true for all industrialized counties, since obesity rates are skyrocketing within these nations.</p>
<p>There’s a strong correlation between obesity and cancer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/obesity/obesity-fact-sheet" target="_blank">https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/obesity/obesity-fact-sheet</a></p>
<p>This is why my wife and I literally remodeled our kitchen into a full on commercial kitchen, so we’d have the technology to make all our own foods from scratch. </p>
<p>We cure our own meats - bacon, pancetta, corned beef, pastrami, deli turkey loafs, etc...we grind our own meats, stuff our own sausages, we grind our own flour, etc... pretty much anything at a grocery store that’s processed in a factory, we make at home now.</p>
<p>We buy all of our veg from local farmers, only when the vegetables are in season, and we pickle and can them for the rest of the year. Additionally, we buy all our meats from the local slaughter house that only takes animals from local farmers.</p>
<p>We’ve taken control of our food supply and not only do we feel healthier, the quality is profoundly better.</p>
<p>Considering my acid reflux has totally disappeared and my wife and I have lost weight, without changing our diets, proved to me that most food at the grocery store is tainted and probably should be avoided.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
