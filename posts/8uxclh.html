		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For one day, it doesn't matter. You will have lost the same amount of fat.</p>
<p>If you do that every day for a long time, you will have grown more muscle, that will need more energy. So if you don't change your daily caloric intakes, you would lose more fat with working out. (Assuming you eat proteins and results depend on your work out.)</p>
<p>That said, most want to look better and be healthier when they try to lose fat, and in that case, more muscle mass is better. <a href="https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/build-muscle-better-health#1" target="_blank">source for healthier</a> </p>
<p>Anyhow if you are like me, you will have problems with your hunger. Try eating protein rich for breakfast. (Like half the proteins for your day.) Drink more water and always a glass of water 10min before eating. And if you still want more to eat, brush your teeth, drink a glass of water and if you are still hungry, try instead eating some alternative like some (frozen) fruits after drinking a glass of water. Also google &quot;how to prevent hunger&quot;. Most sound like placebo, but as long as it helps you.</p>
<p>Oh and try to keep to a time table. Eat meals always at the same time and sleep at the same time (sleep is important for good decisions like what to eat)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is: Yes! In idealized conditions, and excluding any mitigating factors, if you eat exactly 500 calories worth of food, and you perform enough aerobic exercise to burn exactly 500 calories above your resting energy expenditure, then the net effect on your body fat would be 0. (Note: that simply means this particular exercise &amp; food combo would have no real bearing on your fat loss/gain situation. That's not to say you wouldn't ultimately gain or lose weight: that's dependent on the bigger picture of your  diet and exercise situation.)</p>
<p>The slightly more nuanced answer is still basically yes, but with caveats. As with much of our biology, an array of factors can influence exactly how much food-energy we consume vs. expend. u/aquabug918 and others have alluded to some of these factors.  Also, the calorie counts we use for food and exercise are rarely precise. At the end of the day, though, if you have a normal metabolism and maintain a relatively balanced diet, the effects of those factors will be negligible, and your results are the same for most practical purposes: 500 calories - 500 calories = 0 change in body fat.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Yes. But in another, much truer sense...still yes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
