		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly lets take down a misconception. GIF (<em>Graphics Interchange Format</em>) is a static image protocol, much like JPEG, mostly intended for portability and compression. However, it supported more than one image in the same file. You could see each image individually or play them sequentially. If these images are different frames of a short movie, you got yourself an animation.</p>
<p>Therefore it was never really intended to be a video format. But since it became famous for such feature and for its simplicity, some optimizations were introduced but still a far cry from proper video formats. However, video formats do demand much more resources and are found in a myriad of different algorithms and protocols, many proprietary, while GIFs were supported natively by browsers since the Netscape days.</p>
<p>[EDIT] It's worth mentioning that, despite not being the most bandwidth/storage efficient format, GIFs were still preferred in the old Internet days due to the way they store the image. When you're downloading a GIF over a slow connection you can kind of guess what the image looks like early in the process. The image would start showing up as a very blurred version of the original that became increasingly more detailed as more data gets downloaded. If you decide that you don't need to see the final image you can abort the transfer and don't bother with the rest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost all videos are optimized, not all gifs are. Now, what is this optimisation? When you watch a video the subsequent frames are nearly identical. It is rare that all pixels of a frame change. So the videos store only the changes and viewing program updates the pixels that change and leave the pixels that haven't changed alone. this reduces the size of the file, like, a lot. Gifs can do that too but they rarely do. They store all the pixels of each frame regardles if they changed or not.</p>
<p>Also gif must usually be loaded in full before it starts playing. video can start playing when it is partially loaded.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>GIFs (the real ones, not the gifv which are actually muted videos) are full images put sequentially together so if you have a 10kb picture and you want a smooth framerate (say 24 fps, which is the minimun you can use before the eye starts noticing somethign is wrong) if you make a minute long GIF of the same 10kb pic, you end up with a 14,400kb GIF, or about 14Mb to round.</p>
<p>On the other hand, videos store the initial picture and then track the pixels that change each frame, so you'd start with the initial 10kb pic, and then add nothing because nothing is changing, so you end up with a minute long video wich is only 10kb.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the video is extremelly scrambled frame to frame, it could weight as much as the GIF, but then if you watched it you'd probably would see somethign resembling to weird interferences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All modern video and image formats are compressed using various tricks unique to their file format.</p>
<p>PNGs use a decoder which allows pixels to calculate the value of one of their adjacent neighbors, and according to their specification, are also compressed using the DEFLATE algorithm.</p>
<p>JPEGs take color and brightness and lossily convert the image into &quot;blocks&quot; that look pretty close to the original pixels but take far less data to display.</p>
<p>Videos use lossy but extremely efficient codecs (eg. H.264) that are optimized for only storing enough data to show a frame based on the previous frame and a list of differences.</p>
<p>GIFs have none of these compression tricks or optimizations. A GIF is a series of 8-bit indexed images with some metadata for telling the renderer how to animate it.</p>
<p>The format is similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>[Header]

[Colors: 256 * 3]  
[Image: 1 * Width * height]  
[Metadata: 1]  
Repeat for each frame...</code></pre>
<p>For a 800x455 image that uses a color table for each frame, it would end up being somewhere along the lines of 350 KiB for every single frame. When animating that at 24 FPS, it takes 8.5 MiB to display a single second animation.</p>
<p>This can be reduced a little bit (3/4 of a KiB per frame) by using a global color table instead of a per-frame one, but it still doesn't come close to an actual video.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gifs are horrible for video because it's litterally a sequence of frames and it shows every frame in order. Most video formats are smarter then that and only update what changed. Often in video the frames aren't completely different so you don't need to load every frame completely. You just need to know some keyframes and then the changes from the key frame. GIFs just have way too much unnecessary data taking up space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
