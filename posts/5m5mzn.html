Mostly interested in European self-sustained abbeys.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said about the work monks do to support themselves (teaching, making jams/fruitcakes/coffins/honey, etc.), there is the daily running of the Abbey.  </p>
<p>Sacristans take care of the church and religious services.  Guest Master welcomes and sees to the guests.  Kitchen Master oversees the meals/menus/kitchen staff.  The porter answers the door and maybe the main phone line.  The business manager oversees the financial office(s).  There is often an Infirmarian who may be a nurse or nurse practicioner who oversees the in-house infirmary and/or nursing home.  Then you've got the choir master who outlines the liturgies (religious ceremonies) and works with the choir and instrumentalists.  You've got an Oblate Director who manages/organizes programs with people who live on their own, but have a strong, committed tie to the Abbey.  The Development director oversees things like endowments and publicity.  Then there's the monk who oversees the groundskeeping and maybe indoor maintenance, though they may be two jobs, depending on how large of an Abbey it is.  There is the Abbot who is like president/rector of the community who is overseeing it all and has the big picture in mind.  Also, there is the Novice Master who works with new members who join, and the Vocations Director who engages with people out in the world who are interested in learning more about joining the Abbey.  I am sure I am forgetting some others...</p>
<p>In Catholic monasteries, which I'm mostly talking about, some monks are priests, so they will often serve in priestly roles at local parishes, hospitals, prisons, schools, convents, etc.  </p>
<p>So, you've got the stuff that the monks do to support themselves and then the basic housekeeping stuff that is required by a religious community.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Here is an abbey in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan </p>
