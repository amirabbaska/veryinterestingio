<p>A blender would likely just make a powder but to answer a more interesting question, what if we used an extremely fine grinder? </p>
<p>At some point we have a fluid of very fine particles left. They're still going to be enormous relative to a water molecule though so they'll contain many locked together. The powder will generally behave like a liquid though (think pouring sand but much much more finely divided). This won't have a bunch of water properties like dissolving things well) but it will have fluid properties. </p>
<p>What if we grind all the way down to the atomic scale somehow. Well if we managed to we'd end up with something more like a gas than a liquid since we've forcibly separated the atoms. Just prior to that we'd get something increasingly more water like (with a few caveats, letting them touch would tend to cause them to start sticking again but this process isn't instantaneous) but if you imagine this you can see there's not really a nice point where we can look at a small cluster of atoms and say &quot;these, these are definitely a liquid now&quot;.</p>
<p>Solid -&gt; liquid transitions only really make sense to talk about for bulk substances but the whole premise of mechanically dividing particles to try and force them to behave like a liquid fundamentally concerns itself with the microscopic</p>
<p>Edit : I said atoms, read molecules. I just woke up when I wrote that</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people here are kinda speculating. There is no definitive answer if you don't define more parameters, since &quot;below zero&quot; could be -1°C or -250°C. As some people pointed out, ice will melt because of local increased mechanical pressure, and that will locally melt the ice, because if you look at <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/512px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png" target="_blank">this diagram</a>, you will notice that above a certain pressure you go back to the liquid state, so depending on your temperature you might form some kind of slush perpetually melting and refreezing, or just some fine powder (even the best blender would make particles that are around 10000 times bigger than water molecules). Another interesting thing is that if you lower the temperature enough, or the blender is high power enough, you might provoke an allotropic transition of ice, and end up with a different crystalline form of ice, which is pretty damn interesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

At some point the agitation of the blender isn't going to be enough to split the tiny crystals, or the cooling isn't going to be enough to prevent the energy input from heating them enough to bind together again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Damn tough question.<br />
If at all times the 'water' was kept below 0C then it would remain in a crystalline structure (Ice).
However, if you just said &quot;The air temperature was 0C or lower&quot; then it's a different kettle of fish.  (Friction of blades etc).<br />
So how about I answer your question like this:<br />
If at all times, every molecule of water was kept below 0C (Below freezing) it would remain ice, no matter how finely it was chopped up.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
