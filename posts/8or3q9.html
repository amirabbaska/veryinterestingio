		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you have the same water source and it's consistent (tap water, for example), then the adsorption capacity of the filter will eventually get used up. Most filters like a Brita have adsorbents an ion exchange resin (white particles) for capturing metals (lead and copper) and activated carbon (charcoal) for capturing organic compounds and some metals as well. Once the adsorbents have reached their capacity, then the metals and organics that enter the filter will leave the filter unchanged.</p>
<p>There are some compounds which actually react with the adsorbents. Residual disinfectants (chlorine, chloramine) are <a href="http://www.wcponline.com/2009/06/13/chlorine-chloramine-removal-activated-carbon/" target="_blank">destroyed by activated carbon</a>, so they will not pass through the filter. Residual disinfectants are added to the water so that organisms do not grow in the time between the water leaving the treatment plant and it coming out of your tap (through the distribution system). An old Brita filter will still destroy residual disinfectants. That can improve the taste/odor of your water if you don't like chlorine.</p>
<p>The last thing to consider is that if there are no residual disinfectants, then bacteria can grow within your Brita filter. It's unlikely that it would harbor pathogenic bacteria, but bacteria can easily grow on activated carbon if there's no chlorine present. If you leave it long enough, bacteria will grow. For that reason, I'd eventually get rid of an old filter instead of keeping it in place indefinitely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in Dialysis, and part of my job is taking city water and turning in to 99% pure H2O.</p>
<p>This entirely depends on what the filter is made of, and what its actual function is.</p>
<p>Is it designed to remove chlorine? If so it's probably charcoal, and when it reaches its expiration it's generally exhausted and simply won't work anymore.</p>
<p>Is it designed to remove magnesium and calcium, like a softener? Then it'll again, just stop working.</p>
<p>Is it designed to remove larger particulates, often referred to &quot;Sticks and stones&quot;. Then again, it'll generally just stop working. However in this case, it'll also severely reduce water flow/pressure.</p>
<p>The only case, that I know of, that will actually decrease the quality of water once it reaches its exhausted state, is a DI, or a Deionizer. These are designed to remove certain molecules from water, such as Flouride. Once they reach exhausted they will actually start bonding with the free hydrogen and oxygen and releasing what they originally picked up, essentially making your water worse than it would be without it, until it finds a natural balance.</p>
<p>As a general rule though, it really doesn't matter. What's considered safe drinking water has a massive area of tolerance, and unless your filter starts growing bacteria from stagnation and age, you never really need to worry about changing for health reasons. It's largely psychological, some times for taste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it's unused and sealed properly it will be fine.</p>
<p>If it's exposed to oxygen both activated charcoal and DI resin will exchange with oxygen and reduce the amount it will filter, thus you won't know how long until  of water until it's not working well.  Activated charcoal for aquarium filtering is stored a long time, it can absorb a ton.  DI resin is usually vacuum sealed and can't be exposed to air for a very long period.</p>
<p>Activated charcoal will leach back into water if it's used way too long though.  But it's not dangerous, it will just taste unfiltered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>'Point of use' filters typically contain carbon impregnated with silver, and possibly some ion exchange resin. The carbon will remove the chlorine residual and some organics.  The silver is there to provide bacteria control.  The ion exchange resin removes charged ions such as dissolved  metals. The entire filter removes particulates in the water. The replacement frequency is based on expected removal capacity of the filter and to get you to replace it before the bacterial control loses effectiveness.  So if you leave it on past the due date- at some point you can get biogrowth in there. The IX resin will eventually load up and quit removing ions, and even release ions it previously took up.  Ultimately, the carbon will lose effectiveness, and enough solids will accumulate to restrict flow.   If you're in the US, unless directed otherwise (see Flint, Mich), you really don't need to do extra treatment as a health issue. If you are concerned about your water quality enough to pay the money to use a filter, than it's kind of defeating the purpose by ignoring the recommended change out frequency </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a filter had an NSF our WQA seal on the box like Brita or PUR, it is tested and certified to 200% of the life on the box (if there is no indicator light) and 120% of life is there is a life indicator on the device. So if a filter claims the  life is 40 gallons for a pitcher filter, it will remove all contaminants listed on the box to at least 80 gallons. Some contaminants can be removed for a longer life, but that number on the box is based on the contaminant that fails first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
