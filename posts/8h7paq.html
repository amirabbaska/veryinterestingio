		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello! I understand that when taking oral antibiotics, you're strongly recommended to finish the entire prescription, since finishing early could allow resistant survivors to reproduce and cause an antibiotic-resistant infection. However, with topical antibiotics like creams and ointments, it's recommended to apply liberally as needed either with or without a bandage. Is there a reason that topical antibiotics can be used only as needed? Wouldn't using them in this way enable antibiotic resistance?</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your help!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because most topical antibiotics work by mechanisms that bacteria can't build resistance to ie they rip cells open.  They're too toxic to use systemically but resistance isn't really a problem.  Plus to be honest anything you can &quot;treat&quot; with a topical antibiotic probably doesn't need to be &quot;treated&quot; in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can only speak to the field that I work in (Dentistry) and how it relates to that but the general tenets of what I am about to state.</p>
<p>In dentistry, generally speaking, dentists understand and agree that in a healthy adult, we really only need  a course of 3 days-worth of antibiotics (assuming it is something along the lines of amoxicillin 750 mg every 12 hours let's say) before a treatment like a root canal or after extraction is performed. </p>
<p>However, we always say that it is necessary to have (aprox.) 7 days worth of antibiotics after an extraction (For example) due to the fact that, for example the open wound left by the socket in a post-operatory case,  is prone to infection of  the many rapidly colonizing agents of the oral cavity (Ex: Streptococcus sanguis), especially if there is a pre-existing condition but even in a healthy individual can become infected very easily if oral hygiene is poor and depending on diet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>since finishing early could allow resistant survivors to reproduce and cause an antibiotic-resistant infection</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In dentistry that is almost never a concern.</p>
<p>Streptococcus mutans and sanguis for example, two of the primary sources of infecto-contageous colonization have an extremely low incidence of being induced into becoming a resistant strain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a reason that topical antibiotics can be used only as needed? Wouldn't using them in this way enable antibiotic resistance?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer to that is two-fold.</p>
<p>One is that topical antibiotics function directly through raw absorption.</p>
<p>Antibiotics like , again, amoxicillin, have a fairly lengthy pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics  and excretion process compared to raw topical substances. In simple terms, they have to be metabolized by the body in several steps, first to reach the liver, then to be broken down and disseminated where they will achieve their proper function. It requires a far more roundabout method of distribution, is the point.</p>
<p>Once again, I cannot speak to other disciplines in the field of medicine, but in dentistry, a full 7-day set of antibiotic is more to do with preventative measures than antibiotic resistance.... </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think that external antibiotics are used to clear a wound for instance from bacteria and prevent (further) infection, when cleaned your done. The important thing is, you can see when it gets better and is clean.
When you swallow antibiotics it is usually to get rid of an infection inside your body that is hard to see. So the prescription is basically a calculated gamble to how much is needed to kill the problem. There is a risk that one may not have cleared the problem when only half of the prescription has been used and although one might feel better the problem is actually not gone and could rise again making the patient sick again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t about the tropicals specifically but important to know!!!</p>
<p>Antibiotics kill the weak strains first and strongest ones last. If you don’t eradicate them all right away you are left with only the stronger ones. Sure that is a danger to you specifically, but it’s putting those close to you, and the potential entire world at a bit of a greater risk each time.  </p>
<p>If your body learns to fight it and you feel fine that great! But say you cough on someone, they don’t catch what you have, they catch a strain that is harder to fight off</p>
<p>Or even more frightening: bacteria is known to share resistances cross species. If a strain in your body develops resistant to an antibiotic it could give that resistance to an entirely different disease. (This mixing often happens inside a mosquito that has bitten a few people)</p>
<p>Antibiotic misuse is what is causing things like the malaria epidemic.  We have a cure for what people are suffering from now, but it won’t be released to public use until a even stronger backup is created. We can only treat people with weaker solutions so a even stronger disease doesn’t  emerge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
