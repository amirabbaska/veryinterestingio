		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is interesting how many people in this thread see mouth-breathing as an unintelligent &quot;choice.&quot;  For the vast majority of the time, people don't actively think of how to breathe; it is subconscious.  Normally, the mouth will open if the nose is not providing enough airflow.  The majority of mouth breathers cannot breathe well through their nose due to things like allergies, polyps, or a deviated septum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Breathing through your mouth is a bad idea compared to your nose, as your nose can warm and filter the air. Breathing through your mouth is more likely to make you sick.</p>
<p>The implication/joke is that someone is <em>so</em> dumb that they can't manage to breathe correctly. Plus, having one's mouth slightly open creates an expression that can be interpereted as confusion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The term 'mouth-breather' was an insult from older generations and you still see references to this. Its basically calling someone an idiot. I dont think its hard to see why; look at someone staring at something with their mouth open.  its similar to someone walking around with their button shirt off by one button. It shows a lack of awareness. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to just list several concepts, make of them what you will.</p>
<p>People often naturally consider it as a lack of self-awareness. They breath on others and possibly even drool.  You can't drool with your mouth shut.</p>
<p>It's also often not pleasant visually.</p>
<p>Concentration and thought are often associated with tightening of the face in general to include closing the mouth.  This makes a certain kind of sense on a basic level.  It can be a subtle defense mechanism(no catching bugs) and aid to balance. One can become more aware of their whole body via this mechanism and counter or adjust for that which comes along, be it a wind, shifting ground, bugs(as mentioned) or dust, or debris(say, you're working with tools on something that has a possibility of spattering or squirting). In this sense, closing the mouth is just one more means of avoiding distraction.</p>
<p>Keeping it closed, as a practice is actually a boon to expression, you can open the mouth in shock or clench it further for anger.  If it's already hanging wide open, it can very much be taken as someone who is always shocked or surprised.</p>
<p>I'm sure I left some out....it helps retain moisture in extreme environments is one simple benefit.</p>
<p>In general, there are so many benefits, biologically and socially, to keeping the mouth closed that someone would have to be....a bit lacking....to have a habit of just letting the jaw hang there.</p>
<p>There are always exceptions, say you've had your nose broken so many times that you just can't breath well through it, allergies and sickness and minor deformity.  A lot of people with these or similar problems still often tend to come to a middle ground instead of just leaving the jaw hang freely, but the difference can be subtle sometimes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've never cared about how people breathe, just whether I could hear it or not. I've always found it  annoying when somebody is breathing exclusively through their nose and that's all I can hear. But I also have a problem with hearing anything like chewing, breathing, smacking lips etc. Because of that I find I'm always making an effort to keep all my face noises as silent as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
