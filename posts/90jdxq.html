One of these, TNF-a, makes you lose your appetite. It's the main cytokine that causes cancer patients to get skinny and have very little appetite. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a very interesting question and still not clearly understood. I work in Critical Care / ICU and we know that if you force a patient to have calories early in their critical illness with intravenous nutrition they have worse outcomes.</p>
<p>We do know that mitochondria - the key subcellular generators of energy - essentially hibernate during critical illness from sepsis / systemic infection. Overloading them with substrate results in free radical generation which causes harm.</p>
<p>When you're very sick your body enters a catabolic state. That is, it utilises all the body's resources to fight the infection as well as putting the brakes on the human inflammatory response. The key feature is protein loss. The result of high levels of adrenaline, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and other inflammatory mediators, cause insulin levels to drop and energy to be released from stores.</p>
<p>An area of research I'm interested in is whether we can use indicators of hunger to determine whether a patient is improving and use that to guide when we start feeding the patient.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an add-on question to the original question, why do you lose your appetite for an extended period of time after getting food poisoning?</p>
<p>I got food poisoning in Nicaragua a couple of years ago.  I lost my appetite, a couple hours later my stomach said 'EVERY ONE OUT!' and after that I felt much...much....MUCH better.  </p>
<p>The thing was, I had to force myself to eat for the following week.  </p>
<p>Still, I barely ate anything due to a <strong>total</strong> lack of appetite, not feeling sick in any way.. just no desire whatsoever to eat food.  </p>
<p>It was a bizarre feeling to not have an appetite for such an extended period of time even though, otherwise, I was fine.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is a different but similar question. When you're hungry from fasting or skipping a meal, sometimes you will get weak &amp; you will have other symptoms such as shaking hands, etc. However, when you lose your appetite due to stress, you don't usually have the physical symptoms. Is the hand shaking due to lack of calories/nutrition? If so, why don't you get these symptoms when you're not eating from stress? Don't you still need nutrition when you're stressed?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Top comment only mentioned the mechanism of action not the adaptive reason why this happens.</p>
<p>Digesting food requires metabolic pathways that need to be used for fighting off infection. Breaking down nutrients for use tomorrow is pointless if an infection is going to kill you today. On top of that, eating food increases the pathogen load on your body thus putting more work onto the immune system. It is better for the body that you don't eat.</p>
<p>A good analogy is that if barbarians raid a medival castle the peasents stop farming and take up arms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
