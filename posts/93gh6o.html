I know plants (in general) 'breath' through stomata in green leaves. If they are in a very dense smoke environment, would their respiratory systems become blocked like a human's would in a smokey environment? If so, how dense would that smoke need to be? How long would the exposure need to happen over?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They won't be affected in the same way, but the high concentration of other gases and fumes do harm them to some extent.  A few leaves being damaged is inconsequential.  For that matter, some trees remain alive in the roots and would sprout anew even if the entire trunk has been burned away.  As forest fires have been around for as long as forests have existed, they've evolved to deal with the occasional burn.  A notable example is that of the giant sequoia, where the pine cones <a href="https://www.nps.gov/seki/learn/nature/fic_segi.htm" target="_blank">won't open and release their seeds</a> unless they've been scorched by fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another example of smoke interference in plant health* is that grapevines burned or affected by fires will yield smoke-flavored grapes (and unpalatable wine) for several years. I’m not sure whether it’s due to smoke getting into plant tissues through stomata, or general ad/absorption into soft tissues (I kind of doubt it) or chemicals present in ash in the soil being take up by the roots (this seems more likely to me). I haven’t heard, but I don’t see why fire could affect pomes, tree nuts and other permanent crops in a similar way. </p>
<p>Which is one reason why the wine-country fires last year in CA, and in Victoria in 2009 were so devastating. </p>
<p><em>I’m using that term loosely, this effect isn’t really on plant </em>health*, per se - but it’s biologically interfering with the fruit quality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dense smoke environment is a very toxic place for human beings because carbon monoxide bonds very effectively with hemoglobin in our erythrocytes and doesn't want to dissociate. Since plants haven't got any system like blood (for oxygen transport I mean) they can die just because oxygen concentration in smoke is too low. Oh, or because there will be not enough light in smoke-filled territory to maintain photosynthesis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
