		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a nutshell, yes.  At the tips of the plant shoots are hormones called auxins, which are responsive to light and function in making the plant get taller.  They auxins themselves are negatively phototropic, which means they migrate to the side of the plant that is getting less sunlight.  So, shine a light from the north, all of the auxins go to the South.  This causes the plant to grow more on the dark side, which pushes the stalk tip towards the light source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is only somewhat related, but you can actually make solar panels do this without a computer.</p>
<p>Place a large solar panel on a motorized pivot. Attach smaller solar panels outside the large panel, angled slightly inward, and hook those up to the motor in such a way that when one small panel is receiving more direct light (creating a net voltage), the motor turns slowly to equalize. If you have two motors (one for &quot;pitch&quot;, one for &quot;yaw&quot;) you can make a solar panel perfectly follow the sun without a computer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a great long duration capture of a plant on Planet Earth.  If you saw the plant normally it just looked like a plant, but when sped up you could actually see it &quot;reaching around&quot; through the air to try and find the spot with the most sunlight ... although it wasn't for 30 feet (more like 5).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I loved learning about this in biology! From what I learned, there's a growth hormone called auxin which stimulates plant growth, but it's destroyed by sunlight, so the auxin is then only located on the shaded side of the plant, causing that shaded side to grow longer, while the side exposed to sunlight doesn't, causing the plant to lean towards the sun! This is called phototropism :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants have photoreceptors that in the absence, or presence, of light lead to molecular process such as moving the planthormone auxin to the shaded sight of the plant.</p>
<p>A particular interesting phenomena is shade avoidance syndrome, where molecular signals in the plant  lead to extra growth when plants are growing near eachother and casting their shadows on eachother. The plant that grows fastest will have all of the light for itself, while the slower plants have to live in the shadows :) This is a different response then when a plant grows in the shade of something different than a plant, so a plant will react different to both types of shadows! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
