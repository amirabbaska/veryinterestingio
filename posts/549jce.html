		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, but its difficult. As others in this thread have said the yield of a specific isotope in a supernova will be a function of things like the starting composition of the star, the distribution of that composition and the degree of mixing between layers in the star, the time dependent temperature and density profile of the star/supernova and the energy (and thus temperature) dependent cross sections of every possible nuclear reaction that can occur.</p>
<p>Stellar nucleosynthesis is typically modeled with network calculations that track the abundances of all possible isotopes. For example <a href="http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr328/Notes/BBN/BBNreaction.jpg" target="_blank">here is the network of isotopes and reactions relevant to big bang nucleosynthesis</a>.^* Neutron capture, proton capture, alpha and beta decay transform the initial isotopic abundances to a new steady state that depends on the temperature and density. In a supernova where temperature and density change rapidly this gets even more complicated. Additionally photonuclear reactions like (gamma,n) and (gamma,p) may come into play.</p>
<p>Accurately modeling stellar nucleosynthesis is limited by uncertainties in the reaction cross sections, lack of knowledge about the mixing mechanisms that bring material from the core to the surface of a star (and vice-versa), and the ability to model the hydrodynamics of a star as it goes through the supernova process. These are all active areas of research.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more there is a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02213" target="_blank">nice white paper</a> on the current state of nuclear astrophysics that has some information on the different network calculation codes available. </p>
<p>^* Edit: For the sake of clarity I linked the simpler big bang reaction network. A supernova deals with significantly more neutron rich nuclei due to rapid neutron capture (the r-process). The reaction network would then have to model the blue regions <a href="https://groups.nscl.msu.edu/SuN/images/chart_nuclides_2.png" target="_blank">in the chart of nuclides</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are asking what I consider to be the single biggest open question in nuclear astrophysics. </p>
<p><strong>The short answer to your question is &quot;sorta,&quot; we have incredibly complicated models that we can use to make predictions of nucleosynthesis, and they can be used to run simulations that tell us how much of each element is produced, but they require a tremendous amount of input which requires a lot of guesswork at the moment, so they're not perfectly accurate yet.</strong> </p>
<p>Let's start at the beginning. </p>
<h2>How are the heavier elements created?</h2>
<p>In (possibly) supernova, and (probably) neutron star mergers, there are a lot of hot protons and neutrons getting thrown out. These protons and neutrons clump together to make 'seed nuclei' - small, unstable nuclei, immersed in a bunch more neutrons. As the system cools and expands, the free neutrons are captured by the seeds, quickly making them grow in size as large neutron-rich radioactive nuclei, until they exhaust the free neutrons and then begin to beta decay (or even fission) back to stability. </p>
<p>This is called the <strong>'r-process'</strong> which stands for the rapid neutron capture process.</p>
<h2>How do we calculate what's made?</h2>
<p>Today, nuclear astrophysicists can calculate the yields of these events by using things called &quot;nuclear networks.&quot; These are big fancy simulation codes that require a LOT of input. The initial ratio of protons to neutrons at your site is usually the most important astrophysical factor in determining the final yields/abundances of different elements. </p>
<p>But other things go into it too. You need to know how neutrinos interact with your matter. You need to know beta decay half-lives that have never been measured before because <em>we've never produced those nuclei on earth before.</em> You need to know the masses and neutron capture rates for those same never-before-measured nuclides. The nuclear properties of nearly half of all possible nuclei must be known in order to make an accurate estimate. This is, quite frankly, the biggest hurdle the astrophysical community faces. </p>
<p>Since we haven't measured all these properties, we use theory to make predictions of their properties. Different 'mass models' will ultimately be used to run simulations to see what kind of abundances they produce. Basically, you call up a theorist and say &quot;Hey, make a guess for what the properties of these super exotic nuclei should be&quot; and they say &quot;Sure! Here you go! Here's every property of every possible nuclei!&quot; You can then do your calculation. </p>
<p><a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1402-4896/2013/T152/014011/downloadFigure/figure/pscr445215f14" target="_blank">Here is an example of abundances produced for 2 mass models.</a>) The x-axis tells you A, the atomic mass of the nuclides produced, and the Y axis tells you how much is produced. </p>
<h2>So nuclear physics plays a big role... how do we study the r-process in different astrophysical environments?</h2>
<p>If you wanted to predict what would happen in different environments, you'd fire up your program, tell it the astrophysics of relevance (ratio of protons to neutrons, how quickly the ejecta expands and cools, how many neutrinos are going through the ejecta, and your favorite mass model, to name a few). </p>
<h2>Since it's so hard to estimate, do we know what's produced? Or is it all just guess work?</h2>
<p>Ultimately, this is <em>huge</em> open problem, but it's not all guesswork. We look out into space, and <a href="http://www2011.mpe.mpg.de/gamma/science/lines/workshops/AwR2011/fig_beers.png" target="_blank">we see many stars that may have formed from gas that may have been polluted by only one r-process event, and they seem to have the same abundance patterns.</a> This tells us that wherever the r-process occurs, it should produce pretty much the same ratios of elements - the yields should be independent of the astrophysical variables unique to different times and places the r-process occurs. Put another way, the astrophysical variables that determine the r-process, such as temperature, ejecta evolution, neutrino exposure etc, should be the same at every event.  </p>
<p>So we, as good scientists, can work backward from the observed abundances and try to constrain our mass models and astrophysical parameters as well... but it's hard. There are hundreds of knobs you can turn when working on this problem. Some knobs you can change a tiny bit and get really different results, like the initial ratio of protons to neutrons, or the number and energy of neutrinos coming out. Other knobs don't seem to matter too much, like the orbital properties binary neutron stars. </p>
<h2>Bottom line?</h2>
<p>This is an enormously complicated problem that requires both astrophysics and nuclear physics input. If only we knew everything, we could tell you exactly how much of each element is produced. As for now, we've just got our predictions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I know, it depends on the size and age of the star. But if I want to get a gram or kilo of &quot;fresh-squeezed&quot; gold, is that a fraction of what a single star might generate, or the output of a dozen stars?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
