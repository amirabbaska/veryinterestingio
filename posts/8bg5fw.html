		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some more food for thought: USB connectors were designed in the '90s. At the time, there weren't really any devices small enough to <em>require</em> super compact connectors. They did provision Mini USB at the time, and it took a while before devices got small enough to necessitate the introduction of Micro USB. Additionally, larger connectors are more physically robust, so this would have factored into the decision.</p>
<p>Regarding reversibility: either you make the connector keyed, so it can only be inserted one way, or you make it reversible/symmetrical. If there's no perceived advantage to one solution or the other, then both seem equally viable. It's possible that a keyed design was chosen at the time to minimize the complexity of the connector in manufacturing. Also keep in mind that at the time of USB-A's design, virtually every data connector standard used a keyed design. Reversible connectors were pretty distant on the industry's radar - consider again that connectors hadn't gotten super small yet, and reversible connectors are most useful at small sizes where it becomes a pain to fit the keyed ones.</p>
<p>Some better-informed responses already in the thread, but I wanted to add these points for consideration! The TL;DR of the whole thing would be that it wasn't a matter of technical limitations, but simply that there was no perceived need or benefit at the time to make tiny reversible connectors. Those just plain weren't necessary for the intended purpose of USB-A in the timeframe during which it was designed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the other deals with this: USB was meant to be a replacement for SERIAL interfaces (Eg, RS232). It was a way to quickly transmit data that happened to also provide a little bit of power. Today, it's primarily used as a power source that happens to have a data exchange.</p>
<p>In terms of transmitting information like RS232, USB was meant to be a semi-permanent, hot-swappable interface for things like mice, printers, keyboards, and gamepads. No one was thinking about charging phones. The USB-A and B ports were designed to be fairly strong on their own. USB C is a significantly &quot;weaker&quot; physical connection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In mass electronics the answer is almost always cost. Today on Mouser a USB-C socket is over 3x more expensive than a USB-A. Multiply this out across a few million units and you are talking real money. The USB forum, which represents device manufacturers, wanted to minimise these costs.</p>
<p>There were also design compromises which were made which were later shown to be less important than first thought. Notably the wear and directionality of the USB cables.</p>
<p>The USB forum decided on a deliberate policy of wearing the plug, not the device. So a USB micro B plug has small spring elements on the bottom that lock it into the socket. Being a mechanical bendy device these wear with time, a deliberate choice was made to take this wear on the plug. Time and the lightening connector have shown that the wear is less of an issue and consumers don't care. With USB-C the bendy fatiguing spring is in the socket of the device allowing for a cleaner appearing plug.</p>
<p>Initially USB was designed with a strong Master-Slave relationship. One issue they wanted to avoid was pairing a Master-Master or Slave-Slave, a common issue with Serial and led to atrocities like null modem adapters. Part of avoiding this was to have a distinct Master and Slave plugs so building the wrong relationship was physically impossible and obviously not going to work. Mobile phones buggered this all up with USB On-The-Go, which allows a device to be a Master one minute and a Slave the next. With this compromise made the initial rational fell through and now we have identical USB-C plugs on both ends of a cable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is obvious in retrospect was not necessarily obvious at the time.  Engineering always involves compromises, and reversibility would have been low on the list. At the time USB was relatively compact, robust, and convenient, but was pushing the mass manufacturing of the time.  Then you saw the mini USB, and later micro USB.  Reversibility wasnâ€™t seen as a necessary feature until Apple created the lightning port.  It was only then that the market began demanding reversibility in the plugs.</p>
<p>So really it is a combination of vision based on where they were coming from, engineering compromises, manufacturing capabilities, and market forces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of really good answers in here, but I think there's an angle that isn't getting much attention.</p>
<p>The direct answer to your question is that there was no technical barrier to engineering and mass-producing a reversible connector that would have had the same technical capabilities of a USB 1.0 connection. It would have been simple to create a connector that was mirrored on each side and thus could be inserted with either side facing up.</p>
<p>The problem is that engineers don't always consider the user experience. And to be fair, that's not their job. Their job is to make things work well. Sure enough, USB-A connectors work well <em>as long as you follow the instructions and insert them properly</em>. But as anyone who has used a USB-A connector knows, the experience is often mildly frustrating: you try to plug it in, but it won't fit, so you flip it over, and it still won't fit, so you flip it over again, and surprise, it fits.</p>
<p>The companies that got together and came up with USB -- including Microsoft, Intel, IBM, and several others -- should have done some user acceptance testing. That is, they should have asked a group of everyday, random, run-of-the-mill people to come in and try using the thing with no instruction other than &quot;plug this in&quot;.</p>
<p>The reason they didn't do this is, ironically, a huge part of why USB was invented in the first place. When USB was being developed in the early 1990s, most people had only a basic working knowledge of how to use a computer. They could turn it on and launch WordPerfect, but couldn't hook up a new printer. USB was meant to help by greatly simplifying (and standardizing) the connector, and greatly simplifying how drivers were installed (prior to USB, installing a peripheral typically involved a nightmare of IRQ, DMA, and address settings, as well as installing software that was not at all user friendly).</p>
<p>Since this was all beyond the grasp of the average computer user who wanted stuff to &quot;just work&quot;, the coalition beyond USB didn't really consider their experience. Since USB was such a massive improvement over the current standards, it was assumed that everyone would love it. And we did, mostly.</p>
<p>TL/DR: There were no physical, technical, or manufacturing limitations that prevented this. It was just never anticipated that it would be an issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
