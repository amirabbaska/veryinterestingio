		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the adrenaline and other stress hormones!</p>
<p>First, your body is all, &quot;Ugh, I'm tired. I wanna go to sleep. I'm so sleepy.&quot; But you say, &quot;Too bad, body, we're not going to sleep now.&quot; Then, eventually, your body is like, &quot;Dang, we're staying up all day/night, there must be a good reason for it! Like some kind of threat! We better be super alert!&quot;</p>
<p>Your body doesn't realize you're just playing video games or whatever you do if you pull an all-nighter (for example), it just knows you're awake when you shouldn't be and thinks there must be something important (i.e. dangerous) that requires being awake. So it responds by releasing adrenaline.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit I know why this is a thing! Okay so the jist of It is that man evolved a chemical mechanism by which more dopamine(a neurotransmitter that stimulates your reward centers and can boost wakefulness) is released into your brain. Basically your brain is trying to shift up to 11 because it thinks you're stalking a wooly mammoth or running from a saber tooth tiger, when really you're just grinding out those 99's on runescape.</p>
<p>The reason why you can't repeat it is because all that dopamine can disrupt normal brain function over a prolonged period of time, leading to that dopey heavy sleepy feeling. It also fucks up your metabolism, which can lead to weight gain. Fun fact, this is pretty similar, albeit less intense, to what happens when you take certain drugs. A dopamine rush followed by a plateu and coming down from the high. If you get great sleep for a long period, then miss a night, you'll feel it again, trust me guv.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One contributing factor in sleep difficulties is the production or lack of melatonin. Melatonin is a sleep hormone that makes you feel tired. Bright lights and so called blue light in the evening time essentially reduce your melatonin production as your eyes and brain believe it is day time if there is a sufficient amount of blue light available. Mobile phone, computer and TV monitors all emit blue light.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side" target="_blank">https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side</a></p>
<p>I personally got glasses with filters that block some of that blue light, making it a lot easier to go to sleep in night time. Most phones have night modes these days that do the same, and almost all modern computer operating systems have night time settings or applications available. Televisions, however, often lack night time settings, which makes them antisleepy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it means anything it's the same with sleeping meds. I have a lot of psych clients who fight their meds by walking them off. They make you drowsy after about 30min for about 30min and if you can push through that you can stay awake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
