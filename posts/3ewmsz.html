	<title>ELI5: Some members of US congress have notoriously low attendance ratings and this seems to get brought up a lot before elections (for example, John Kerry in 2004 and currently Ted Cruz). Not trying to exonerate anyone, but what are some possible reasons for a low attendance rate?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exec assistant to a Member here. They're campaigning or have a major illness/injury, is pretty much the reason. On most votes there around 5-20 not voting members out of 435; for the most part members don't miss votes just because they have a meeting. Committees break for votes, and you rearrange your schedule to make room for them. </p>
<p>While true that for really close votes Leadership makes sure members make a point of being there, unless members are on leave or otherwise out of the office, they typically bother to vote.</p>
<p>EDIT- generally they're not missing votes to be in the district, either. Most months have at least one recess week for folks to head home in the House, less in the Senate. Votes are always scheduled at 6:30pm the fist day of the legislative week and last votes end at 3:00pm the last day if the week to allow for travel time.</p>
<p>TL;DR votes are important, usually members don't miss them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Illness</strong> -- For example, Senator Mark Kirk had a stroke, so he missed quite a few votes.</p>
<p><strong>Running for office</strong> -- It's hard to undergo a continuous job application in one place while also doing part of your job in another place.</p>
<p><strong>Made other plans</strong> -- The legislative calendar isn't set in stone, but elected officials are <em>people</em>: their kids get married, grandkids get born, they go on vacation, they celebrate holidays. Sometimes that means knowing that they'll miss votes, and sometimes that means when the Christmas break is delayed 6 days because of some bill, some of the legislators miss the votes to do something else, either related to their jobs or not.</p>
<p><strong>Ducking a vote</strong> -- sometimes, for whatever reason, the vote is particularly contentious in that legislator's district. In that case, he or she might duck the vote to avoid going on record.</p>
<p>==</p>
<p>Remember, voting for legislation isn't the sole job of a legislator, and sometimes multiple simultaneous obligations require that a legislator has to choose to not do something. Sometimes that's voting, which, by the way, must be done in person. For close votes, it's not unheard of for legislators to travel via ambulance from the hospital to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/10/us/senator-brings-a-vote-from-his-hospital-bed.html" target="_blank">participate</a> in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/us/politics/24byrd.html" target="_blank">vote</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oooh, I worked for the House of Representatives, so I can answer this! There is an actual TON of legislation that is put before Congress. Most of the votes are on (comparatively) trivial matters - renaming a post office, for example. For votes like these, you would be lucky to have 20 representatives in attendance. </p>
<p>They get a message on their phones when a vote is called though, and a set of buzzers go off in the house office buildings. That being said, most use this time to catch up on the (comparatively) more important bills and to meet with constituents and lobbyists. In all my time working on the hill, I never saw a member of Congress who wasn't rushing somewhere or doing something important. They just have a ton to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time, everyone knows the result of a vote before it is taken, and it is more of a matter of putting your position on record.  Bills almost never fail to pass because someone didn't show up...in fact, Congress has an informal courtesy system, where if someone wants to be out of town during a vote, they pair up with someone who is going to vote the opposite way, and they both miss the vote.</p>
<p>So low attendance isn't always as bad as it seems.  If you are travelling the country trying to drum up support for a bill, that can be more important than actually voting for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The only time a member of congress has to be present is for voting. Literally all other business they can conduct can be done anywhere outside of the Senate/House floor. You'll probably find that Senators/Members only show up for votes that it's critical that they attend (like McCain during the financial crisis while he was running for President). </p>
<p>The reality is that Senators/Members do a ton of stuff outside of voting, and much of it is usually done by their staff/Legislative-Affairs. </p>
<p>IIRC Obama didn't set foot in his Senate Office in the Hart Senate Office Building (in DC) more than once after he formally announced his campaign for President. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
