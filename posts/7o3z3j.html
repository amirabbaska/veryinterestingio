		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few reasons why you need to sleep. Your lymph system is 10x as active when your body is in it's resting phase. And during that phase, your cells go through a giant waste removal process. Just like your own body, every single cell in your body has its own butthole, and they all create shit, and need to remove it at some point, or else it builds up and causes problems. Besides that, your body also needs to do deep cell recovery. Like, repairing damaged DNA, refueling tired cells, remove the dead body cells, remove foreign bacteria and other foreign objects, all of that good stuff.</p>
<p>So when you lose more and more sleep, more and more of your body gets swelled up with cellular waste, harmful bacteria, just a bunch of shit that's more and more overdue for removal, and then more and more of your cells need repair or replacement, and that just simply doesn't get done fast enough when while you are awake, because your body can only efficiently allocate its fluid/neural activity for locomotive activity, like fight or flight, eating and digesting, being active in general, being on standby to do active things, etc, vs being in a state where it's doing nothing but waste removal and cell repair/replacement.</p>

<p>Drinking enough water would be a good start. That being said, it's not some magical fix for getting insufficient sleep, it only helps against dehydration. (and dehydration <del>is</del> has been quite common <del>these days</del> for decades, and can cause aching body parts)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been having this same problem alot lately, my knees will throb  and it can ruin an entire day. The only thing that I found to help is eating multi vitamins daily, now they still hurt, but not nearly as much. Also lack of use can cause this, so keep your knees active. You can do body weight squats and lunges, just do like 20 every two hours. Get a good brand vitamin like Kirkland But most importantly just get your sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
