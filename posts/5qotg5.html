		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They found mercury in century old fish samples that were in museums. Long before humans, rivers would wash heavy metal ores from mountains out into the sea. There they would bio-concentrate in the food chain. The <a href="https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/santaclara/Alm.htm" target="_blank">New Almeden valley in San Jose Ca</a>. was the second largest deposit of mercury in the world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some is naturally released into the environment from various sources like runoff, volcanoes, etc. So there is an amount that would be found in fish always. From my understanding natural mercury accounts for about half of current mercury released into the environment. So from preindustrial times we have doubled the amount going into the environment every year. Could be completely wrong but that's my understanding. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concentrations found in the current era are largely due to industrial pollution. Burning coal, without adequate scrubbers and controls, releases large quantities of heavy metals into the atmosphere, which in turn falls on the ocean, and works its way up the food chain.</p>
<p>The other issue is that most of the fish that we eat are the predators of the sea (Tuna, Salmon, etc...) so the metals that were initially consumed/absorbed by the plankton work their way up the food chain and concentrate in the local alpha predator.</p>
<p>However, even without the industrial pollution, it's likely that there would be detectable levels of heavy metals in these predator fish. Mostly for two reasons, the first is that the detection equipment is extremely sensitive, so it can detect things well below dangerous levels.</p>
<p>Secondly, it isn't uncommon to find heavy metals and other toxic materials, leaching into the water system naturally. I have been peripherally involved in a mine site remediation project, and one of the interesting side-notes of the project is what was in the river water upstream of the mine vs down stream. For example, there are detectable amounts of Arsenic in the water, but the levels are the same up and downstream. Somewhere, in the valley, there is an orebody exposed to a creek that contains Arsenic. It makes sense, as the valley is likely heavily mineralized to begin with, otherwise there wouldn't have been the orebody that was mined out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
