		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Flash applet is like a program. It can run it's own code and be used to write information to your computer. While modern up to date computers try and prevent this from  happening, unknown bugs or design choices in either Flash, your internet browser, or operating system can lead to exploitation. It's just one more security gap you have to worry about, and it was designed in a time where internet security was much less of an issue</p>
<p>From a usability perspective, it does not cleanly integrate with the rest of a website. You can right click &quot;inspect&quot; a webpage and see the various parts that make it work. Doing the same on a flash applet will basically tell you &quot;THERE IS FLASH HERE&quot; and tell you very little or nothing about what the app is doing. This is particularly bad for the visually impaired, as most screen readers are unable to read content from flash. The flash app does not work with back / forward buttons. Reloading a hung page will reload the app and usually erase any progress made. It is intensive to run on your CPU (not so much today, but computers are  just that powerful). Older apps may not run properly on modern browsers. Each browser needs it's own plugin. It's one more thing you have to keep updated and install on a new computer. IOS no longer supports it. Older android phones can be blocked from installing on Google Play.</p>
<p>Flash was a quick and dirty way to provide multimedia content when people were on 33.6 Kbps modems. Most apps would utilize vectors rather than store bandwidth intensive bitmaps. It was never meant to become a video streaming standard. Feel free to dive down the rabbit hole of Microsoft and W3C battles over web standards if you want to unravel the history there. (TLDR; without a standard, it was the only semi-universal way of doing it without licensing issues).</p>
<p>It was neat gimmick that stepped up when there were no viable alternatives. Removal of IOS support was the writing on the wall, as it lost support for one of the top Smartphone manufacturers. It's limped along with Adobe (who bought it from Macromedia) threatening to kill it every few years. Like Internet Explorer 6, it looks like it may finally be laid to rest.</p>
<p>SIKE! </p>
<p>IE6 still trudges along with a 1% market share as of 2015! Flash's zombified corpse will probably still haunt at least a few of our grandchildren.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flash was a huge step forward for adding rich web content... when it was new. This tool came around in 1996 when webpages were absolutely lifeless compared to now, the most you could do was scrolling text and a MIDI song. Flash gave you tons of bells and whistles.</p>
<p>But the tools built into HTML and javascript got good and browser support for them got much better. What used to take fancy Flash now works with just built-in browser abilities, even games or video playback. Flash was getting squeezed out, and didn't really have a new area to grow into. However, even without Flash adobe is still heavily cemented as a go-to tool for creators... tons of content on the web, even if it's not flash, was probably made with Photoshop/Dreamweaver/After Effects. They're still making money as &quot;the digital creative stuff people&quot; and don't have to support Flash anymore. If anything, that's better for them.</p>
<p>Adobe Animate CC is ultimately the replacement for Flash, offering similar functionality and animation tools while running on top of HTML5 instead of requiring users get the Flash Player plugin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Steve Jobs signed its death warrant when he refused to allow it on the iPhone because it was inefficient and riddled with bugs and exploits that are still causing problems today. It was likely built that way so ot could perform on the lower power equipment common when it was built. Moving into speculation, Adobe were likely blindsided by Jobs' decision and didn't hsve enough time to redesign Flash for the modern mobile world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is going to be brief, but it's basically because Flash had the ability to run full programs on a system, and this opened a <em>lot</em> of holes in system security. Programmers could write whatever they wanted in a Flash program and the system wouldn't know to check it for viruses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply because hackers started taking security flaws in Flash to their side, so that once a user views a site, he is already hacked, and Adobe pretty much has go much more important projects to work on, and as Adobe started letting Flash die, hackers took more opportunities and got into the flaws more, which pretty much killed it all for Flash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
