		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming you mean microsaccades.</p>
<p>Our senses acclimate to the world around us pretty quickly. If you're in a theater, you'll eventually adjust to the smell of popcorn until you don't smell it anymore. After a day at school/work, you might not feel your underwear anymore. This lets your brain focus only on important (which here means &quot;new&quot;) information. </p>
<p>Your vision is the same way. If an eye were to fix on, say, a lamp too long, the lamp would disappear. However, a lot of animals, like humans, rely on our vision a great deal and can't afford to stop perceiving something just because it doesn't move. A lot of edible plants don't move, for example.</p>
<p>In order to keep the world in focus, but using eye cells that quickly lose interest in still objects, our ancestors developed eyes that jiggle, just a little bit. It's called a microsaccade (saccade is basically an eye movement). Because the eyes jiggle, the world is constantly &quot;refreshed&quot; and the eyes don't loose track of a still moving environment as easily. The visual system evolved to account for this, so you don't actually perceive a jiggling world.</p>
<p>Edit: it's worth noting that when I talk about our ancestors there, I'm talking about maybe fish, probably a lizard. Not Grog the cave man.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I'm understanding OP correctly, I don't think it's nystagmus. Nystagmus is <em>usually</em> slower and can last for long periods of time. I think what OP is experiencing is a split second, back and forth eye movement that is really rapid. I also have experienced this a few times in my life since I was a kid. No history of seizures, eye problems or anything. There is nothing online that I was able to find about what causes this and not very many people seem to have this either. </p>
<p>But from the 1 forum I found online that discussed this, it doesn't seem to be harmful. <a href="http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Eye-Care/eyes-moving-side-to-side-very-rapidly-for-a-split-second/show/476777?page=1" target="_blank">Here's a discussion post I found.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I went looking for an answer to this. (I suffer from what I believe OP is describing) and I found that I share a large number of symptoms in common with Meniers disease. Might be worth looking at this OP, if you get a chance. <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000702.htm" target="_blank">https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000702.htm</a></p>
<p>My best description of the eye movements are as follows:
It occurs for less than half a second. It is a little startling and my brain only realises after that fact, what has occurred. The eyes move around the centre point in the horizontal plane. They move just over 50% (I estimate) of their full range of motion either side of the half way point. I can sense no objects when they move (ie. They don't settle on anything, like a saccade). The symptoms are not accompanied by anything else (directly, could be Meniers, see above). </p>
<p>I have a friend who indicated that this sort of involuntary eye movement, for him, indicated he was about to have a seizure (he is a photo sensitive epileptic), however I have tried to note any cognitive or neurological impairment after an 'attack' and have noted no such symptoms, I feel perfectly normal. I have spoken to a doctor about this and they indicated that it may just be ocular fatigue and while I can't be sure I think all attacks have occurred in either low light or while reading. </p>
<p>I am going to ask about the possibility of Meniers when I next see my doctor but they have previously said not to worry about it, so if it is your only symptom then try and self diagnose whether you might be having a complex partial seizure and if not then don't worry about it. :) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I get this sometimes, especially when I'm looking at the same thing for a long time (paperwork, distance driving, etc.), assuming I experience the same thing that you do. I'll be looking at something and then my eyes will suddenly &quot;shake&quot; and my vision will be interrupted for a split second.</p>
<p>My eye doctor told me that it occurs because my left eye drifts, like a lesser version of a lazy eye. Once the brain &quot;catches&quot; the eye drifting, it refocuses my eyes so that they're both looking in the same direction again, as they're supposed to. The &quot;flickering&quot; is essentially my eyes snapping back to looking in the same direction and focusing on the same thing.</p>
<p>Sorry if someone already posted this, or if this isn't what you're referring to. I hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most folks are saying Nystagmus or Saccades, but I'm not sure what you are talking about is either of those phenomena. Not that I'm any kind of expert, but I do experience something similar to what you are talking about on rare occasions. It most often occurs when I'm looking at one thing, decide to shift my gaze elsewhere, but as I try to do so, I reflexively notice something about the first thing I was looking at and my eyes attempt to return to the first thing, resulting in a rapid and involuntary shifting back and forth several times between the two points of focus which lasts for less than a second. It occurs to me probably no more than 2-3 times a year and whenever it does it is not unsettling or disorienting, merely surprising. I often attempt to recreate it voluntarily after it happens, but the movement is so rapid and specific I can't ever seem to emulate it. I don't know if there's a scientific term to describe it, but I would suspect it is merely your involuntary and voluntary eye movements momentarily fighting for control of your visual focus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
