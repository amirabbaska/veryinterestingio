		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on to what's already been stated about the extended shelf-lives of the payload as well as live fire tests, in larger and more complex weapon systems such as ICBMs and cruise missiles, the systems themselves are modular and have internal diagnostics that can be run on the hardware and control systems.</p>
<p>In most cases there's an entire support chain that revolves around testing, maintaining and repairing these systems to ensure they're operational and ready when needed. Many times this includes Intermediate level support where individual modules can be removed from the weapon system for further analysis, repair, and easy replacement.</p>
<p>A regular maintenance schedule will prolong the life of the equipment significantly, and the use of proper measurement and diagnostic tools will help ensure weapons systems are utilized safely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, the Department of Energy and the military jointly conduct what's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockpile_stewardship" target="_blank">Stockpile Stewardship</a> program designed to ensure as well as possible that nuclear weapons will function as intended.</p>
<p>Even though nuclear weapons can't be tested anymore, many individual components can be tested separately under certain extreme conditions that occur during a nuclear detonation, like using a particle accelerator to simulate extreme neutron flux, or testing bomb materials under high pressures using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_anvil_cell" target="_blank">diamond anvil cells</a> (for example).</p>
<p>Other aspects of the detonation that can't be separately tested are simulated as well as possible on computers.  The <a href="https://ornl.gov/news/oak-ridge-jaguar-supercomputer-worlds-fastest" target="_blank">Jaguar supercomputer</a> at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, for example, was built in part to model virtual nuclear detonations under different conditions, including the aging effects seen in older weapons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The engineering behind what makes them work is extremely precise and has been shown to reliably make efficient use of the materials used. So as long as the device passes routine maintenance checks, they are assumed to be in working order. They are on regular maintenance schedules, where the entire device is checked for corrosion, serviceability, etc. If the radioactive materials reach a certain age, I would assume that material is replaced with fresh material and the old materials are reprocessed to remove the pollutant isotopes, produced from the radioactive decay, and re-purify it. Even if the half-life is on the order of millennia, there are still decay isotopes mixed all throughout, and the ratio of decay isotopes to pure material increases daily. These decay isotopes get in the way of the reaction and slow it down. If there are too many impurities, the reaction will stop altogether and you get very low yield. So the materials are re-purified. Mind you, this is all just for the warhead, which can be removed from or attached to the carrying body as needed.</p>
<p>The carrying body is just a guided missile that goes really, really high so that when the warheads are released they come in at mach WTF!!, making them virtually undetectable. That missile is also well-engineered, but also goes through routine maintenance checks as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're really interested in this subject, there is a great book by Eric Schlosser called &quot;Command and Control&quot; that covers it.</p>
<p>One of the things he documents is the terrifying number of accidents that have happened in the past 50 years with nuclear weapons - they have fallen off racks, been accidentally dropped from planes, have been set on fire, etc.  The main part of the book documents a huge explosion at a ICBM silo in Arkansas that killed several people and sent a warhead flying miles away.</p>
<p>None of these accidents have resulted in an actual nuclear explosion, which is good.  However, it's debatable whether or not this is because a) the failsafes in the triggering mechanisms are that good, or b) the weapons themselves are not very reliable.  </p>
<p>This is also one of the reasons that Trump's decision to appoint Rick Perry head of the Department of Energy is so concerning.  Remember, in the presidential debates Perry wanted to eliminate it.  One of the DOE's primary roles is operating the national labs that design, build, and maintain our nuclear weapons.  Michael Lewis wrote an <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/department-of-energy-risks-michael-lewis" target="_blank">article for VF</a> about the terrifying lack of interest displayed by the Trump admin in transitioning control of the DOE from the Obama administration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
