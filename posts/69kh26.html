		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's samples per second aka the sampling rate of an audio signal. When you convert analog sound to a digital format it is done by sampling the analog wave thousands of times a second to convert it into a number like a voltage. The higher the sampling rate, the greater the frequency in hz that can be represented. It ends up needing about twice the sampling rate, to correctly sample a specific frequency of sound. </p>
<p>For instance if you need to record a 20,000hz analog soundwave, you need to sample it at 40,000 times a second or 44.1khz which is what music on a CD is sampled at. </p>
<p>The other factor is the size of each sample which effects how many levels of sound it can encode for each sample. This is analogous to how many colors an image has. An 8 bit sample allows for 0-255 levels of sound, or 256 colors if it were photographic data. Where as a 16 bit sample allows for 0-65,355 levels or voltages, or 65,356 colors if it were an image. </p>
<p>So a 16 bit 44.1khz wave file encodes 65,356 discrete &quot;loudness&quot; or voltages in each sample and it samples (or does it) 44,100 times a second. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several people have mentioned that the sampling rate of a digital audio signal needs to be at least twice the highest frequency you want to accurately capture. This is called the Nyquist limit, and <a href="http://imgur.com/a/PcWxd" target="_blank">I whipped up a quick graphic to explain why here.</a></p>
<p>The gist is that to produce a faithful representation of a continuous periodic function using finitely many data points, you need to have at least two points present in every period, or you won't have enough information to recreate the original signal. </p>
<p>Real audio signals have many component frequencies, not just one like the pure tone in those images, so you need to decide what the maximum frequency you want to capture is, and then sample at least twice that often. For most people, human hearing really drops off past 20-25 kHz, so sampling at 40-50 kHz will sound good, hence the CD audio standard of 44.1 kHz.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes - samples per second (s/s). &quot;CD Quality&quot; was set at 44,100 s/s. The reason for this that you need at least twice as many s/s as the highest frequency you want to capture, which for humans is about 20,000 Hz. These days a pro studio records at 96,000 s/s (96k).</p>
<p>The other major digital audio parameter is bit depth, which is a measure of the potential quality of each sample - like the film or frame size (35mm, 70mm, 1080p, 4K) determines the quality of film or video. &quot;CD Quality&quot; is 16 bit depth, now 24 bit depth is typical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For digital audio there is the sample rate.</p>
<p>Audio is recorded in digital form by taking the amplitude of the sound wave at regular intervals. CD quality audio does this at 44.1kHz, in other words 44100 times a second.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
