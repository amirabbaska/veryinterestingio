<p>edit:  There are a lot of great replies and I learned a lot about the stock market and the economy in general. It seems the biggest thing I learned is that there isn't a convenient answer but a complex network of interrelated forces beyond any one person's control.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK I'll actually try to explain this as if you were a five year old instead of just spewing progressive propaganda at you.</p>
<p>The stock market is like anything else; it gets bigger when you put more stuff into it. People keep on adding more money, so it continues to grow. Now why would they want to keep doing that? Well, money needs to be kept somewhere, and people would rather that their money grows instead of just sitting around doing nothing.</p>
<p>At the same time, the country hasn't been growing as healthy as we would like (recession and follow up low growth). So to get people to put their money in a place that will help the country grow the most, they want to steer people towards placing their money in the best spot. In general, you can put your money in the bank, in the government (bonds), or in the stock market/private investment. Well, the government's bank (the Fed) thinks the best place for money to go right now is in private investment and the stock market, since this is historically where we see it help grow the country's economy the most.</p>
<p>So, we're seeing the country start to grow, but it's still pretty slow compared to where we would like it. Problems like war in the middle east, debt problems in Europe, war in Ukraine, and the slowdown in China have all been dragging our growth down.</p>
<p>On the other hand is unemployment. When people talk about feeling the recession, they generally are talking about how it's hard to get a good paying job. This is caused by there not being enough jobs for everyone to go around. Since lots of people don't have jobs and want them, there's no reason for companies to pay more money since if someone wants more money, they can just go to someone else who will take the job for less.</p>
<p>But why aren't there enough jobs if the economy is growing? Well, like I said economic growth is slower then we would like. Also, the growth has mostly been in companies like Google, Facebook, and Netflix, which can make really cool stuff with not a lot of people. In the past, we would see growth in stuff like GM and Ford and Boeing and construction companies, which need lots of workers to build big complicated things. So the combination of slower growth and growth in companies that don't need a lot of workers means that there are less jobs.</p>
<p>Still, every day there are more and more jobs. Even if most of growth is making jobs for tech guys, the tech guys still spend their money on coffee and craft beer and vinyl records or whatever. So when they spend their money, it makes more jobs for other people. So unemployment goes down and down, until it gets to its &quot;natural level&quot;.</p>
<p>After the crash in 2008, lots and lots of people lost their jobs. But now that's it 8 years later, and we had all that growth, people who are looking for jobs are finding them. Also, people who gave up for looking for jobs will start looking for them now that they see that there are more jobs out there. Now, looking into the future, it looks like there will start to be more jobs then there are workers.</p>
<p>When this happens, companies start to compete with each other for workers. Are you unhappy at your job because they stopped giving raises? Well, lots of people are starting to find jobs across town that pay more. Companies looking to hire people for new jobs are having trouble finding workers, so they start offering more money hoping that they'll finally find the worker they are looking for. Now, instead of workers competing with each other for jobs mostly, the employers start competing for workers, and wages go up. That's why a lot of economists think we are going to start to see pay finally start to go up in 2016.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's 2007 and Yu-Gi-Oh cards are all the hot sh*t.  You, your friends, and all of the other kids trade and sell the cards at your elementary playground for a quarter for the rare cards.  Every kid decides to open up a lemonade stand to make money so they can buy more rare cards.  Well with all the kids having more quarters to spend the price of rare cards go up so some kids get desperate and start spending money they don't have by paying a portion of the quarters up front and promising that they will pay the rest of the quarters owed when their lemonade stand rakes in more quarters.  It gets to a point where everyone starts promising more and more quarters they don't have an event happens where it blows up and every kid realizes that nobody will be able to pay back their promised quarters b/c everyone owes too much quarters they don't have.  Every kid is depressed and scared from such event and stops going to the playground to trade/sell Yu-Gi-Oh cards.</p>
<p>A year later the teachers get mad that they can't buy cheap delicious child labor slaved lemonade so they devise a plan.  They'll raise lunch prices and give extra quarters to the popular kids so they can go around and buy lemonade from the lemonade stands and get more kids to open back up their lemonade stands.  Well the plan backfires since all the popular kids do with the extra money is go back to the playground and buy Yu-Gi-Oh cards from each other at a lot of quarters prices.  Pretty soon the cards are trading at higher quarters than they were trading in 2007 but only among the popular kids. Majority of the other not so popular kids have not returned to the playground b/c they can't afford to open up lemonade stands to buy Yu-Gi-Oh cards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The not-even-vaguely-like-you're-five explanation: <strong>labor force participation rate.</strong></p>
<p>Now the ELI5 version of that, and it starts with this picture: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/JLkXQ7v.jpg" target="_blank">Civilian Employment-Population Ratio, 2006-2015</a>. That graph shows the least politicized, simplest answer to the question, &quot;who's unemployed?&quot; by asking the exact opposite question: out of all Americans aged 18-65, what percentage of us have jobs? Before the recession began, that number was 63.4%. At the bottom of the crash, it hit 58.3%. It's only barely crawled back up to 59.5%.</p>
<p>What that means is that about 1/20th of the American working-age population, millions of people, would have jobs if the economy were still going as strong as it was before the bubble burst. You can argue about whether or not we should be judging employment rates by that standard, but that's what people have for a recent comparison: a mere 9 years ago, there were millions more jobs.</p>
<p>The stock market doesn't care what the unemployment rate is, except indirectly. The stock market could consist of two ultra-rich guys trading shares back and forth between each other and as long as they bid them up each time, the stock prices would still be going up. Yes, they would need something like a normal economy to keep getting more money to bid up the stocks. You're very smart. But 5 million or 10 million missing customers aren't enough to permanently crash the market. It is, though, just enough that every working person knows at least one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Because the owners, the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now, the BIG owners! The Wealthy… the REAL owners! The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
Forget the politicians. They are irrelevant. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice! You have OWNERS! They OWN YOU. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought, and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls.
They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying,  lobbying, to get what they want.  Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don’t want:
They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. Thats against their interests.
Thats right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that!
You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork. And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shitty jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? They’ll get it. They’ll get it all from you sooner or later cause they own this fucking place! It's a big club, and you ain’t in it!  You, and I, are not in the big club.
By the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table has tilted folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care! Good honest hard-working people; white collar, blue collar it doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest hard-working people continue, these are people of modest means, continue to elect these rich cock suckers who don’t give a fuck about you….they don’t give a fuck about you… they don’t give a FUCK about you.
They don’t care about you at all… at all… AT ALL.  And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Thats what the owners count on. The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick thats being jammed up their assholes everyday, because the owners of this country know the truth.
It's called the American Dream,because you have to be asleep to believe it.&quot;

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an effort to shorten the depression, the Federal Reserve Bank made money very readily available. They even put the Federal Funds rate to zero. In other words, it cost NOTHING for the nation's largest banks to borrow money from the federal government, and virtually nothing for large companies to borrow money from the banks. Interest rates were really, really low for everyone. The intention was that companies would borrow this money to increase production and create more jobs.<br />
Fat chance. There is no company on the planet that is going to increase production and hire more help when the demand for their products is low. So, the cheap money got borrowed by people to invest in other things. The stock market was really the only place to put money and hope to get any kind of return. So there was a ton of money invested in the stock market, which drove up stock prices and we saw a <a href="http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/SPX-Dow-Nasdaq-Since-Their-2000-Highs" target="_blank">long beautiful bull market starting in 2010.</a><br />
Now that the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates a little and ended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing" target="_blank">Quantitative Easing</a>, this period of cheap money for investing is OVER. Which is why the stock market has been so volatile in the last few months.<br />
In addition, there were quite a few companies that used the cheap money to invest in technology that REPLACED WORKERS. So, the money intended to create jobs had, in some cases, helped to permanently eliminate them.<br />
TL;DR: The stock market does not reflect the economy. It reflects how much money is invested in the stock market. </p>
<ul>
<li>EDIT: Yes, I did over-simplify the current stock market volatility. The implosion of Chinese markets, the low price of oil and probably several other factors are at play. I sit corrected. </li>
