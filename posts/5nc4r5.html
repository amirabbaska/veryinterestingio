		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation/abuse where you deceive someone to the point where they begin to question their own reality and sanity. It is probably better explained via an example.</p>
<p>Let's say you had a brother growing up. Then, one day, you came home, and there was no trace of him. He isn't in any pictures, all of this things are gone, and no one you talk to recalls him.</p>
<p>Let's also say that this is a big deception. Everyone is in on the conspiracy. Your brother has moved away, your parents replaced all the pictures and got rid of all of his stuff, and everyone else is feigning ignorance.</p>
<p>But the deception is so thorough, and they are so adamant about the lie and stick to it so well that you begin to question your own memories of your brother to the point where you begin to consider not that everyone is lying to you, but that they are right and you are just crazy.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Some people are getting this confused with the Mandela Effect. I'll admit they are similar but there are some crucial differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They both involve questioning ones memories, but in the Mandela effect the memories are false, with Gas Lighting the memories are true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mandela effect originates with the person experiencing the effect when confronted with a contrary but true reality. It is not fully understood and is a psychological phenomenon. Gas Lighting is a form of psychological abuse that originates externally, from the person presenting the false reality.</p>
</li>
<li>The Mandela effect is unintentional whereas Gas Lighting is malicious and deliberate.</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT2:</p>
<p>Yes, the Asian-Jim joke in the Office is a humorous example of Gas Lighting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to use a more feasible example than some of the ones above. Let's say you see your wife kissing a coworker at your office Christmas party. You're shocked and hurt, and don't know how to react, so you just stand there stunned for a second. Your coworker sees you and pulls your wife out of your sight line and into a room with people.</p>
<p>You follow and tell your wife you two need to talk. You ask her what's going on. She pretends she doesn't know what you're talking about. You say that you caught her kissing your coworker.</p>
<p>Then she says she's been in that common room with the large group of people all night. You must have seen him kissing someone else. Also, haven't you had a few drinks? And weren't you smoking a cigarette while some other coworkers were hitting a joint outside? Maybe that joint was laced with something weird, that one coworker is kind of sketchy. It feels like maybe you aren't in the best place to be <em>sure</em> that was her you saw. You two should go home, she'll drive since you're a little drunk. You aren't a little drunk, but you're mad and also want to leave, so you can talk about this more.</p>
<p>All night you argue, and all night she denies. You talk about breaking up, she calls you crazy and gets angry. You're angry too, but eventually you decide to sleep on the couch and deal with the logistics of probably breaking up the next day.</p>
<p>At first you're so sure. But then...you aren't. The next day, the memory is a little more faded. It was dark in that side room. If you ask your coworker, he'll probably deny too. So there's no point in asking him. Should you ask some other people that were in the common room? But then if you're wrong, or they didn't see, you'll look like kind of a crazy person in front of other coworkers.</p>
<p>Behind all of this, there's a big part of you that doesn't <em>want</em> this to be happening. Deep down, you kind of hope you're wrong. And eventually, you start to believe it. The more time passes, the more the memory fades, the less certain you can be. Your wife, meanwhile, is steadfast and resolute in her rightness, and angry at you for questioning her fidelity. Maybe you'll always sort of know what you saw, but you'll never be able to really talk about it without sounding crazy and you'll never act on it.</p>
<p>This is gaslighting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was in a relationship with a guy who gaslighted me constantly for almost two years. It would range from small things like he would ask for a cup of tea and then when brought it deny he ever asked for one. We would argue about things and he would say the most horrible, malicious things to me, but when I brought them up later he would twist everything to make it seem like I was the sole aggressor in the argument so I would end up apologising to him instead of getting the apology from him that I needed. We would make plans together but then when it came to it he would deny any knowledge of it. One time we were out with friends and I gave a guy he didn't like a hug/said hello, and he later accused me of kissing this person (which I absolutely did not and would not do), insisting that I was drunk and I didn't remember and that all of our friends witnessed it. This blew into a huge argument and he kept making up more elaborate scenarios and continuing to insist I was so drunk I didn't remember (I wasn't that drunk and I remembered everything, though by the end of the argument I started to believe him). One of the most bizarre instances was that he got a couple of books for Christmas once, and when I was gathering my books from the house to move out he insisted that they were my books so I should take them, and began to get angry, which led me to question my sanity even as I was moving out and so I took the books, but that was one of the most fucking weird occurrences in the entire relationship. He was also repeatedly physically aggressive, often for no apparent reason, but afterwards would claim that I started the fight, that he never hit me, that I needed help/I was making it up/was losing my mind. </p>
<p>When I first met him I was quite confident, outgoing, fun-loving. After two years I was an agitated nervous wreck, having regular panic attacks, in a pit of despair and depression, genuinely believing that maybe he's right, maybe I am crazy, questioning all my friendships (because he did a very good job at making other people believe I was crazy as well as myself) which led to me pushing many of my friends away because I didn't trust them anymore, blaming myself for every argument we had and desperately seeking forgiveness because I believed he was the only person I had left. It's a process of slowly chipping away at a persons sense of self and their sanity until they no longer even believe or trust their own thoughts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>C'mon, /u/hamsterberry, this'll be the third time today I've explained gaslighting to you. Are you not smart enough to understand or do you just not respect me enough to listen? This is why everyone calls you a scatterbrain and no one wants you around. You're lucky I love you because no one else would be willing to put up with this. Anyway, that's what gaslighting is. Now did you remember to pick up the thing? Seriously, we talked about it this morning and you promised you'd pick it up for the party. Oh, <em>of course</em> you don't remember the party. Heaven forbid you remember something that's not entirely centered around you. Luckily I'm used to you disappointing everyone, so I did it myself. This is why our friends never come over anymore. They just can't stand being around you. Is it my fault? Is it something I did to make you like this? Oh there you go, blaming everyone but yourself. Typical /u/hamsterberry. You're lucky I love you.</p>
<p>^^ That ^^ is gaslighting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From Wikipedia: &quot;Gaslighting is a form of manipulation through persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying in an attempt to destabilize or delegitimize a target. Its intent is to sow seeds of doubt in their targets, hoping to make them question their own perception, memory, and sanity.&quot;</p>
<p>It's a common tactic used by abusers. </p>
<p>In simpler terms: Person A (usually a narcissist or sociopath) does something harmful or wrong to another, often dependent/trusting Person B. When B tries to call out A or question them concerning the wrongful act, A insists that B was misunderstanding or misremembering the situation and blowing things out of proportion, even though B was really in the right. Over a period of time, B will begin to doubt themselves and will be less capable of addressing any abusive or harmful situations because, after all, they have a history of &quot;blowing things out of proportion.&quot; Person A is now free to continue to harm B and get away with it so long as no outside party that has not been gaslit notices what's going on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
