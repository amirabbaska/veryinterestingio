		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So with the spread of humanism ushered in by the beginning of the renaissance, people started to take a keen interest in humanity. They started thinking that people were incredible and the individual was exceptionally important. As a result, we start seeing changes in a number of artistic modes of expression. To answer your question though, painters and sculptors wanted to idealize the human form which took on a whole new significance in renaissance art. The natural human figure presented an expression of beauty, perfection, and humanity.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Round about 1400 or so, people started thinking of humans as hot shit. As a result they celebrated the ideal human form - a nude figure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human form was what they were presenting.  So, you paint/sculpt nudes. And modern prudish society is actually pretty recent, seasonal, and geographical.  You won't find many equatorial societies wearing layers, fur and all of the added insulation.  </p>
<p>It's not  everything, but it's a start.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In periods that were more conservative, it was a way to have eroticism in an acceptable form. When you look at some of the biblical allegories etc it is pretty obvious that they were more about sex than Jesus. </p>
<p>As long as the subject was a classical theme, nudity was acceptable. That is why Manet's <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Déjeuner_sur_l’herbe" target="_blank">Luncheon in the Grass </a> was scandalous. If it had just featured the naked ladies no problem, but the fact that there were also clothed contemporary people in the scene made it shocking. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the time period. Male nudity has been the norm for most of western art history, female nudity is present but really begins to take off mid 19th century. Lots of reasons: the athletic male youth is idealized beauty &amp; human peak; the female is usually idealized beauty for consumption (ofc with exception, ex. Pauline Borghese's depiction as Venus). A lot of works post-Renaissance utilize the nude as a way of calling back to classical ideals (morality, nostalgia/perfect civilization, aesthetic, etc.). It's also used as a symbol of primitivity or being close to the earth - so you see it in religious stuff with Adam and Eve, portrayals of African and native peoples. </p>
<p>Basically a whole lot of purposes. Classical sculpture is an enormous influence on Europe's art, so that's a large part of why you see it so often.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The classical period I'm assuming you are referring to is that of the Renaissance. In Europe a few people experienced a return to the Romantic style of art. The Romantic style, popular in Rome, celebrated the human body in its ideal form. Hence, well-shaped nude bodies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
