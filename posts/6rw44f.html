This isn't the case with wet, water logged napkins. What causes oil stained napkins to be transparent? Is this property exclusive to lipids?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that oil acts as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index-matching_material" target="_blank">index-matching medium</a> for the paper. What that means is that oil has a refractive index similar to that of paper, or at least more similar than the refractive index of air. As a result, the napkin scatters much less light, which in turn allows more light to simply be transmitted through the paper. The end result is that the paper looks more translucent.</p>
<hr />
<p>The more detailed explanation for this effect is that, the way light &quot;distinguishes&quot; what medium it travels through is (to a good approximation) simply determined by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index" target="_blank">complex refractive index</a> of the material in question. In the case of paper, the refractive index is usually about 1.5. What is also important here is the fact that paper is made out of a bunch of irregular cellulose fibers, which is why it looks very rough <a href="http://i.imgur.com/glJqqaf.jpg" target="_blank">under high magnification</a>. Normally air fills these pores and its refractive index is very close to 1. As a result of this index mismatch and its rough structure, the paper scatters incoming like crazy through a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering" target="_blank">Mie scattering</a>. This diffuse reflection makes the paper look white, for the same reason that clouds or milk look white. But when you fill the pores with water or oil, which have a refractive index that is close to that of cellulose, then you effectively get a much more homogeneous medium, which scatters light far less, which in turn allows more of the original beam of light to pass through. Water with a refractive index of 1.3 does a decent job of bridging the gap, but oil with a refractive index of 1.5 works <em>really</em> well.</p>
<p>A related effect is how you can create polymer balls that look invisible in an index matched solvent, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/mGCJBmY.gifv" target="_blank">as shown here</a>. Again, the idea is that because the refractive index of the balls and the liquid is the same, the light effectively just encounters one continuous medium. As a result there is little reflection/scattering at the ball/liquid interface so you can't even tell the balls are there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
