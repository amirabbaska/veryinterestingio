		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We recently covered this in a linguistics class! It's basically all about intensification. I'm using English as an example, but other languages do this too. When we want to make a statement more intense, we put a word before it to emphasise it:</p>
<p>E.g. Good = very good.</p>
<p>But over time, people overuse the intensifier and it starts to lose its impact. So people use it more:</p>
<p>E.g. Very, very good.</p>
<p>This makes it lose its impact even quicker. So people look for another word to replace the overused word, the stronger, the better! </p>
<p>In the Early Modern English period (c. 1450-1800), people started to use words to describe terrible things for emphasis, such as awfully good, terribly good, etc. These words originally had much stronger meanings than today - terrible meant something more like disastrous. But because we've used them for several hundred years, they are losing their strength too, and so we look for other terms to replace them to get the intense meaning. Using awful, as in OP's post, is sometimes called 'terrible emphasis' in linguistics. </p>
<p>This is the same reason people use 'literally' for things like 'I will literally kill you' when they don't really mean they will kill someone. They are using a strong modifier for emphasis. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The adjectives which spring to mind - awfully, terribly, dreadfully, frightfully, fearfully, scarily - all come from words related to fright. And this, I think, is because for many things we fear, that fear is mixed with respect - we both fear and respect the mighty power of nature; we both fear and respect a large predator; we both fear and respect whatever god we happen to believe in.</p>
<p>So the comparison is being made with that - &quot;He is a terribly good footballer&quot; literally implies that he is so good that we must fear and respect his powers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of a technique in art and animation actually.   Contrast is not only beautiful but it can act as an amplifier. In Animation, if you want to show a character smiling, you can first move the corners of the mouth down and then spring it back into a smile.  The contrast gives the landing pose more impact.  So my guess is that the contrasting adverb makes the landing adjective more impactful.  </p>
<p>It works both ways by the way:<br />
POSITIVE - Awfully Good<br />
NEGATIVE - Positively Awful</p>
<p>EDIT:
There's a lot of focus on &quot;Awe&quot;, the problem is there are plenty of combinations not using &quot;Awe&quot;, for example:<br />
POSITIVE - Insanely Good<br />
NEGATIVE - Incredibly Bad  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

People overuse words like awesome and it cheapens it, but awe is mingled respect and terror. True awe is something that tingles your spine.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
