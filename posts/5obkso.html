		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Linguist here. In geek terms I think you're asking, 'how do researchers conduct monolingual field work on an unknown language such that they can eventually understand the vocabulary and grammar of that language in great detail, and/or become proficient in speaking it?'</p>
<p>The 'point at things and say their names' method (suggested by lacerik, who I suspect is not a field linguist) is not useless, but it will never uncover the full range of a language's words, sounds, meanings, grammatical elements, range of syntactic structures, etc. Successful monolingual fieldword and analysis is less <em>Dances with Wolves</em> and more about engaging with speakers, repeating linguistic forms, using contextual and linguistic cues to make inferences, and of course taking advantage of the pattern recognition abilities of our human brains.</p>
<p>Crucially, people tend to behave in predictable ways when engaged in conversation, even if they can't fully understand one another  (see <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/dravling/grice.html" target="_blank">Gricean maxims</a>). People also naturally recognize attempts at imitation and many if not most people can provide meta-linguistic feedback when a linguist asks questions about their language, or attempts replicate an utterance. By starting a conversation, recording what you hear, using contextual cues and pattern recognition to associate meanings with components of linguistic forms (i.e. sets of sounds), and then refining hypotheses through repetition and variation, a linguist can go from first contact to very basic language quite quickly, and then over a much longer time figure out myriad details. This is easier to do if you start with some sense of the range of sounds and grammatical constructions used in the world's languages, their relative frequencies, and ways in which they commonly interact than if you are a monolingual speaker of an unrelated language with little cross-linguistic experience or training.</p>
<p>I'm not personally a huge fan of linguist Daniel Everett, but there is <a href="https://youtu.be/sYpWp7g7XWU" target="_blank">a video of him from a linguistic summer school a few years ago that demonstrates how a linguist works through the beginning stages of analysing a language when (s)he does not share a common translation language with the speaker (s)he is working with</a> (simulating the sort of un-contacted situation you describe). It is not as exciting as an alien movie, but may be of interest.</p>
<p>Oh and fun Arrival fact: I haven't seen the movie yet, but word on the street is that linguists at McGill University did a pretty good job with the technical consulting and not letting Hollywood stray too fancifully far from real linguistics, and that the set design, right down to books on shelves, was right out of the McGill linguistics department offices...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The Language Log has some great links to articles by actual linguists (hallelujah!) about <em>Arrival</em> : <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=29296" target="_blank">http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=29296</a>. </p>
<p>The consensus about the movie is that its interpretation of the Sapir-Worf hypothesis is way deterministic, and that Louise's analysis jumps to a bunch of conclusions. However, most of us are just grateful for the first movie portrayal of what real linguists do (i.e., being descriptive scientists instead of just polyglots). Her approach, especially in explaining her process to the military, is relatably realistic, but pretty vague and very lucky, because...</p>
<p>[Maybe spoilerish?]
Basically, the entirety of descriptive linguistics is dependent upon human cultural or cognitive commonalities. We can translate and learn other human languages because we know a lot about their typology and limitations. The fact that she, as a human linguist, made any progress with the Heptapod language at all (let alone their orthography!?) means that humans and Heptapods must share some kind of cognitive functions. That's pretty lucky, but maybe also makes an optimistic claim about commonalities among all life in the universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
