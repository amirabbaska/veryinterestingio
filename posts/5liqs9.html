The number itself has its own meaning, independent of how you choose to represent it.  If you'd like an imperfect analogy, it is like writing a word in one typeface or another; the choice of typeface does not change the word.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, all bases are equally easy to work with and do any sort of math with for most general purposes. In niche situations, where for some reason certain numbers keep popping up a lot more than you would expect them to randomly, OR if storage &quot;fits&quot; a medium neatly, a particular base might be better (purely due to more compact or evenly divisible storage), but that's not the case most times.</p>
<p>Base 2 for computers makes sense physically due to how we designed the transistors, for example, but even that was just a largely arbitrary decision of how we CHOSE to design them. You can (and people have done so) build base 3 computers, etc.</p>
<p>It's hard to even think of any other example of a system that inherently has some numbers come up more often, or where storage is more natural only in one way. Even if you think of counting with your hands, you could imagine doing so in MULTIPLE ways that all seem about equally reasonable based on the biology. One finger = one integer? Base 1. One finger = a binary bit? Base 2. The first way, but only for the left hand, then the right hand does tens? Base 6. Counting half-extended fingers at the knuckle to get three gestured states? Base 3. Count every finger, then raise a foot for tens? Base 11. Count each knuckle on your whole hand with an index finger of the other, then use lowered fingers on the other for tens? Base 16. Blah blah.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no interesting and useful property of numbers that depends on the number base. The base is just a way to write down numbers. It doesn't change the number in any way. </p>
<p>Edit: Apparently many people don't like my blanket statement. The truth is these types of questions pop up on this sub fairly often because I think many non-experts think base representation is something fundamental or something that hinders our understanding of math or anything like that.</p>
<p>The answer to these questions is always the same: all of the important and useful properties of numbers have absolutely nothing to do with the base. The base is just a way to write down the number; it doesn't change the number in any way. So rationality, primality, being a power of 7, transcendentalness, etc. all have absolutely nothing to do with the base. </p>
<p>Sure, you can come up with some property that depends on the base. For instance, an integer is even if and only if its base-2 reprentation ends in 0. But who cares? That's not really too important and if you're going to reference the base specifically in your property, then you're just cheating the intent of my blanket ststament that bases don't matter. Because they really don't when it comes to the myriad of questions similar to that of the OP. </p>
<p>(Does base matter for some applications? I suppose it matters in how floating point arithmetic is performed. But, again, that's just so far from what OP is asking or what the myriad of similar questions ask. But I suppose part of one's expertise is knowing that stuff like floating point arithmetic is just irrelevant to the OP's question, and so I apologize for any confusion there.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its not particularly preferred by nature, but for everyday use, base 12 is superior to base 10 due to its divisibility. 12 divides by 2, 3, 4 and 6 whereas 10 is by 5 and 2. This property, when in constant use, would make simple arithmetic easier to do due to extra patterns that emerge.</p>
<p>(like how the 5 times table is easy in base 10, because 5 divides the base, we would have similar patterns in the the multiplication tables for 3, 4 and 6.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we are in a simulation, and the simulation used some limited precision arithmetic with a particular numerical base, then it is theoretically possible we might observe effects that depend on the base. Other people have answered that the mathematical properties of numbers do not depend on the base used to represent them, and that is true, but the numbers that we can represent and the accuracy of calculations do depend on the precision and base used to represent them. If a computed simulation used <strong>limited precision arithmetic</strong>, then there are numerical artifacts that depend on the base.</p>
<p>Suppose are are living in a simulation, and the simulation is implemented with a computer that uses floating-point formats like our own computers do. In the common 64-bit binary floating-point format, the unit of least precision is 2^-52 times the value of the largest bit in a number. E.g., if an object is at a location represented by 5 units of distance, the smallest possible move the simulation could represent would be a distance of 4•2^-52 units (4 because that is the highest bit in the binary representation of 5 and 2^-52 because of the width of available bits in the format).</p>
<p>Imagine our technology progresses to the point where we can see some of these quantum effects in experiments (by which I mean numerically quantum, not quantum mechanics quantum). We might see that a distance of 5 units can be altered by amounts of 4•2^(-52), a distance of (say) 11 units can be altered by amounts of 8•2^(-52), a distance of 23 units can be altered by amounts of 16•2^(-52). The binary nature of the floating-point representation is visible in the quanta: They appear in amounts that differ in ratios of powers of two. (We do not need any knowledge of the absolute magnitude or meaning of the units of distances. We just observe that the ratios of quanta are powers of two.)</p>
<p>If the implementation used a base-10 representation of floating-point, we would observe the ratios of quanta to be powers of ten.</p>
<p>So, if we are in a simulation, it is theoretically possible that the numerical base used to compute the simulation could have effects we might observe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
