	<title>Whenever I buy a lottery ticket I remind myself that 01-02-03-04-05-06 is just as likely to win as any other combination. But I can't bring myself to pick such a set of numbers as my mind just won't accept the fact that results will ever be so ordered. What is the science behind this misconception?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if there is a name for this heuristic, but is has to do with our ideas about randomness and what we think a &quot;typical&quot; set of random numbers or events looks like.</p>
<p>Another example of this occurs when you ask people to simulate flipping a coin 100 times. In the sequence of heads and tails that they write down, people will include many fewer and shorter chains of repeating values than would be statistically expected. For example, people rarely write down a sequence of 8 or more heads or tails and usually don't have more than one such sequence. However, these are actually much more likely to occur in 100 flips than people expect and a computer would generate more and longer sequences. </p>
<p>Edit: as others have pointed out, this is an example of the representativeness heuristic and gambler's fallacy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most likely it is due to a grouping issue.</p>
<p>We consider 5-23-84-11-12 to be identical to 7-32-16-75-22 in that they are completely random set of numbers.</p>
<p>However a number like 1-2-3-4-5-6 is &quot;unique&quot; and &quot;ordered&quot; in our minds. So our mind says &quot;there are thousands of completely random sequences, but only a few perfectly ordered sequences like 3-4-5-6-7-8 or 10-8-6-4-2-0.</p>
<p>Since we know the outcome is decided at random, we choose to pick a set of numbers that are random, not ordered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is our misconception about what the word random means. When we use the word random, we use it in two different ways. &quot;random&quot; means both the way that the numbers are selected where each possible number has an equal probability, and it also means not having a pattern. People confuse those two definitions when thinking about the lottery numbers. For the lottery, the method of choosing the numbers is random. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
