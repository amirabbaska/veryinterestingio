<p>Product differentiation - They look distinctive so that consumers can tell at a glance that these are <em>exercise shoes</em> and not <em>regular shoes</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>Marketing - The shoes are trying to grab your attention at the point of sale, and they <em>look like</em> they have &quot;advanced exercise tech&quot; integrated into them.</li>
</ol>
<p>A similar analogy would be electric/hybrid cars and why they're all arguably ugly. Part of it is for actual function reasons, but a lot of it is because consumers who buy them deliberately want to look futuristic, stand out, and appear <em>different</em> from regular cars.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: Some people are replying about the hybrid vehicles part. I assure you this is a thing. There's been studies that (particularly when the hybrid/green trend began) &quot;green&quot; vehicle owners want to be acknowledged about being green. Here are some links:

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, more than half of the Prius buyers surveyed this spring by CNW Marketing Research of Bandon, Ore., said the main reason they purchased their car was that “it makes a statement about me.”</p>
<p>“I really want people to know that I care about the environment,” said Joy Feasley of Philadelphia, owner of a green 2006 Prius. “I like that people stop and ask me how I like my car.”</p>
<p>“I felt like the Camry Hybrid was too subtle for the message I wanted to put out there,” Ms. Gatch said. “I wanted to have the biggest impact that I could, and the Prius puts out a clearer message.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this is just a strategy used by some manufacturers. Other brands like Tesla are trying to do the exact opposite, which is to appeal to a crowd that want a luxury tier green vehicle that looks sleek and normal. As green vehicles are becoming more commonplace, there will be less of a consumer need to stand out from the crowd.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't ignore confirmation bias.  I have solid black running shoes.  Plenty of people don't buy &quot;ugly&quot; shoes.  You probably just don't remember it because they don't stand out.</p>
<p>Also, mathematics.  There are only so many solid colors one can go, and there are only so many shoes a company will offer at a certain time (though they often do have a lot).  Color combinations and schemes have more than one color so naturally you get more combinations.</p>
<p>If you had 10 solid colors, getting any sort of combination means combining by the other colors.  So 9.  10 x 9 is 90.  So there are 10 main colors and 90 other shoes with different schemes that can be made in a variety of ways.  Different patterns can be made whereas solid colors can't have different patterns.  Shoes might have different physical designs but you can recolor any design, so it balances out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are saying the visibility thing, which I think is valid. But my best guess is that it has to do more with compartmentalism. When you're going to go work out or run, you're dressing in a unique way. And you're looking down more often, I think shoe companies make their running shoes &quot;ugly&quot; or neon because when we see them we're instantly reminded of running or working out. When I see a neon shoe I immediately associate it with running, it makes me want to run, reminds me I haven't in a while, etc. and furthermore, when I'm wearing them while I'm running I look down and get a psychological burst of energy because I've associated wearing the shoe with working out. So you know. Bright shoe makes me wanna move. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they can.</p>
<p>People are often restricted to the sort of attire they can were at work, which usually means boring shades of black and brown.  When you are exercising, you can wear whatever you want.</p>
<p>Also, there is some confirmation bias here, you only notice the really ugly shoes, not the black ones that pass for dress shoes.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a whole collectible industry for athletic shoes, particular those endorsed by athletes.  They are not meant to be worn, and have distinctive colors and styles to set them apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Running shoes come in many colors and designs. The brands that make running shoes make a variety of models every year. Every model has their own color schemes that tend to change year to year. There are two reasons that you would find ugly running shoes. The first is that the shoes that you see are the ugliest of color schemes for whatever shoe. The other is that you are falling prey to conformation bias and only remembering the particularly ugly ones. As someone who has run through many pairs of running shoes, there is nothing ugly about them. They aren't meant to be dress shoes or for any particular fashion, but they aren't deliberately made with clashing colors or whatever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
