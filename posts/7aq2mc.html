		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not aware of any studies or clear data on the effect of submarine earthquakes or associated tsunami on submarine creatures. In term of tsunami, it's important to understand the general characteristics of these <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/tsunami/info/faq.shtml" target="_blank">waves</a>. They are unique in that they involve the entire water column (unlike normal wind driven surface waves), but in the open ocean they have very long wavelengths so for most creatures in the water column the passing of a tsunami wave would be barely noticeable.</p>
<p>Earthquakes which generate tsunami do so by displacing water, which means there needs to be deformation of the ocean floor (i.e. a surface rupture of the fault that produced the earthquake). For example, in the Tohoku earthquake which caused the large tsunami in Japan in 2011, portions of the sea floor were <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6060/1240" target="_blank">vertically displaced by ~10 meters</a>. One could imagine if you happened to have misfortune of being some sort of benthic organism living right in that area, you may have been killed by debris from this scarp falling on top of you after the earthquake, but this would be limited to things living right at the rupture and again, we don't have any actual assessment of what this meant for deep sea creatures.</p>
<p>At the surface, tsunamis can have pretty big effects on marine organisms. Lots of shallow marine organisms can be washed on land (and die) and there is also the influx of material from the near shore into the shallow marine environment that can disrupt things. <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168261" target="_blank">Here is a paper looking at the recovery of the shallow marine environment after the Tohoku quake</a>. Tsunami can also do some pretty odd things to organisms, like this pretty wild example, again from the Tohoku tsunami of a <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6358/1402" target="_blank">raft of (still living) marine organisms that floated across the pacific from Japan to the US west coast</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of Ordovician  fossils that come from Morocco. It appears that the <a href="https://www.paleodirect.com/orx007-giant-sea-life-fossil-orthoceras-architectural-slab/#PhotoSwipe1509822969000" target="_blank">orthoceras</a>  were buried en masse. I have seen a 6 foot slab that's loaded with both orthoceras and ammonites from the same region. They were encased in what appears to be fossilized mud. It's likely they were buried in an undersea mudslide. </p>
<p>Quakes can cause huge slides such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storegga_Slide" target="_blank">Storegga slides</a> and the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JB094iB12p17465/abstract" target="_blank">Hawaiian Slides</a> that created 1000 foot high tsunamis.  </p>
<p>So the shaking might not do much but the ensuing submarine slides can be deadly.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am from New Zealand where we recently had an earthquake in a town called Kaikoura which ended up being the perfect earthquake for scientists to study this exact thing.</p>
<p>Because of where this earthquake took place, the seabed near the shoreline was thrust up and out of the water by, IIRC, 2 metres. The second image slider on this article shows the <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/nz-earthquake/87596704/Before-and-after-the-Kaikoura-quake-images-show-colossal-damage" target="_blank">before &amp; after</a> of the damage to the shoreline, and here is another <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CxRXB1YVEAA_ipz.jpg" target="_blank">after picture</a>. Obviously, damage as extreme as that would have a huge impact on a lot of the life that lives close to and on the shore.</p>
<p>The earthquake also caused the head of the underwater Kaikoura Canyon to collapse, which flushed about &quot;100,000 swimming pools of sediment into deep seas&quot; which would've killed billions of vertebrates. <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/94441539/kaikouras-alien-landscapes-once-lively-seabeds-now-a-wasteland" target="_blank">(source)</a> The long-term effects on the sperm whales that visit the canyon are still being studied.</p>
<p>The earthquake was very recent and there is still ongoing research into the long-term impact to the sea life. There is also a lot of factors that would change how impactful an earthquake would be. An earthquake like the one in Kaikoura, which happened close to the shore, and the seabed was thrust up and out of the water, the immediate damage is quite obvious. However if the earthquake took place further out at sea and the seabed was just thrust up, but not out the water that impact on the sealife probably wouldn't be as catastrophic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
