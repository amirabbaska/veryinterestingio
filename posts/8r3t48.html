		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For each moment in time, the event horizon of a black hole is two-dimensional. For stationary black holes (so black holes that are not changing over time, e.g., non-merging black holes), the horizon is also topologically spherical. It is possible in some complicated mergers to get a horizon that is not spherical, but this is only temporarily. For a simple binary merger, the horizons are always spherical.</p>
<p>(Again, this means <em>topologically</em> spherical. So the shape of the horizon in whatever coordinate system you are using and whatever frame of reference you want to use can be deformed continuously into a sphere and vice versa. So a squashed sphere and an elongated sphere are topologically spheres.)</p>
<p>What happens inside the event horizon we cannot say for sure since we have no direct observational evidence. However, we can well ask what our models of the exterior region say about the interior region. Generally speaking, the interior region is really no different from the exterior region. For a run-of-the-mill Schwarzschild black hole*, you can move around as you please and everything seems to be working just fine. For less massive black holes, the tidal forces can be strong enough to rip you apart, and this is all before you cross the horizon. For more massive black holes, the tidal forces can be weak enough that you can easily survive crossing the horizon.</p>
<p>Once inside the horizon, you are doomed to fall into the singularity in finite proper time (that is, in finite time according to you). But you shouldn't think of the singularity as some <em>place</em> or some <em>point in space</em>. And you certainly shouldn't think of it as the <em>center of the black hole</em>. The singularity is better understood as just &quot;some time in the future&quot;, and this time in the future is in your future if and only if you happen to cross the event horizon. If you were some magical being that could survive any tidal force, then your experience inside would feel pretty much like anything else, and you would feel no different. But then just at some point in the future, you're gone. You're done. Your world line (path through spacetime) has reached the singularity and you no longer exist.</p>
<p>That's what the model says, and the fact that the model is absolutely unable to predict your history beyond a certain time in the future is seen as a flaw in the theory. (But since GR is only an approximation, we shouldn't expect it to be true at the Planck scale anyway. So GR is not expected to be a valid model of physics all the way up to the singularity.)</p>
<hr />
<p>*For non-vanilla black holes, some more complicated stuff can happen. For instance, the maximally extended solution for a rotating black hole has some very bizarre implications if the model of the interior region were true. For one, it would be possible to time travel in some regions beyond the horizon. For a rotating and charged black hole, it would be possible to cross the horizon, then be doomed to go forward past another inner horizon, and then pop out into a region with a naked singularity, and this region seems completely plain and normal. Then you could go through the inner horizon again, be doomed to cross the outer horizon, then pop out into another exterior region, but an exterior region which is not the same as the one you were in originally. It's as if there were a sequence of disconnected universes all within the black hole.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just what the maximally extended solution predicts. That is, there is a solution to the exterior region of a rotating black hole, which we believe is physically meaningful. But the solution also predicts that the spacetime has these bizarre science-fiction-like regions. There's no reason to believe all of this other stuff in the model is actually real. <em>A priori</em> the model should only be valid for the exterior region, and that's the only region for which we have observational evidence anyway.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>edit:</em></strong> <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XUokp.gif" target="_blank">Here is a useful graphic!</a> To read this graphic, note the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>the horizontal axis is a spacelike variable, which means moving to the right moves you farther out to infinity</li>
<li>the vertical axis is a timelike variable, which means moving up moves you forward in time</li>
<li>these spacelike and timelike variables are not exactly the space and time variables you are used to</li>
<li>&quot;region I&quot; is the exterior of the black hole and &quot;region II&quot; is the interior of the black hole</li>
<li>the paths of light rays are always at 45-degree angles (e.g., the pink lines)</li>
<li>the paths of massive particles are curves but they are always at less than 45-degrees (e.g., the blue line)</li>
<li>the singularity is the red curve</li>
<li>the event horizon is the black line that is the border between region I and region II</li>
</ol>
<p>So now consider what happens if you cross the event horizon. Try to draw a path that is always at an angle <em>less than</em> 45-degrees but which crosses the event horizon. No matter what you do, you can't help but eventually cross the red curve. Also note that the red curve (the singularity) is <em>not</em> a single point in space. In this diagram the singularity is drawn as a collection of points, and it's more accurate to describe the red curve as occurring at some time in the future (but only for those paths that cross the event horizon).</p>
<p>(If you're curious about what this diagram is particularly trying to show with all the pink lines.... well, that's a very interesting question! The dashed black line is the path of an observer who is hovering outside the black hole at a fixed distance. The pink lines are regularly-spaced, periodic light signals the external observer sends into the black hole. A statement you will very commonly read in bad pop-sci is that you see the entire history of the universe flash before your eyes if you enter a black hole. Time dilation and all that. That's not true in the slightest. The blue curve is the path of an observer falling into the black hole. Only two of the pink lines actually intersect the blue curve. That is, the infalling observer only receives <em>finitely</em> many signals from the outside observer. The infalling observer essentially sees the history of the outside observer only up to t = t<em><em>2</em></em>. Everything that happens after that happens unambiguously <em>after</em> the infalling observer has reached the singularity. In particular, the infalling observer never receives the light signal emitted at t = t<em><em>3</em></em> (the upper-rightmost pink line). So there is absolutely no sense in which the infalling observer &quot;sees the entire history of the universe&quot;.)</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lIikg.gif" target="_blank">Here is another pretty graphic</a>. This graphic shows a zoomed-in version of a different object falling into the black hole. The falling object follows the blue curve. Again, note that the curve never turns at more than a 45-degree angle, and once it has passed the event horizon, there's no way it can get out and there's no way it can avoid the red curve. At some point within the event horizon, the observer emits two light rays (the two pink lines). One light ray is emitted inward (that's the pink line that veers off to the left) and another light ray is emitted outward (that's the pink line that veers off to the right). Notice that the inward light ray reaches the singularity, as you might expect, but so does the outward light ray! They are emitted &quot;in opposite directions&quot; but reach the singularity all the same. Of course, the outward light ray reaches the singularity much later, but it is doomed nevertheless.</p>
<p>The biggest thing to take away from these two graphics is that the singularity is <em>not a place</em>. The singularity is <em>not a point in space</em>. The singularity is <em>not the center of the black hole</em>. The singularity is just some time in the future of any travelers who dare cross the event horizon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Now, cut a hole in the third dimension. You leave a three-dimensional gap parallel to all three spacial dimensions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
