<p>With radios you have one &quot;speaker&quot; which is the radio transmitter, then you can have lots of &quot;listeners&quot; that don't really get in each others' ways.  With a WiFi signal you have lots of devices that all want to talk to the WiFi router with their own conversation.  Any attention that the router gives to one device is attention it can't give to another device.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK, so all the top answers right now are iffy. They're getting the jist: &quot;lots of people shouting&quot; but I'm going to give you the technical low-down in simplified form.</p>
<p>WiFi, like Cell networks and other wireless communications, use what's called a shared medium: the air. This means that, at any given frequency and place, everyone can hear everyone else: there is a lot of shouting.</p>
<p>Now, lots of devices use wireless signals, and most don't interfere: your Cell network uses different frequencies of EM radiation than WiFi does, so they don't compete. Where this matters is within one network, in your case, the 802.11 WiFi standard.</p>
<p>Since the WiFi frequency space is a shared medium, only one device can be &quot;talking&quot; at once, or everyone gets confused. If there's just you and the access point (router), this is simple: either the router is talking, or your device is. However, as soon as you add a second (or more) device, things get more complex.</p>
<p>The WiFi specification has a number of different ways around this; I won't detail them because they're boring. But most of them work on a token system, where each node has a turn to speak and if they do, for a small window they are allowed to talk exclusively.</p>
<p>The end effect of this is that <em>for each client you add to a network, you halve the effective bandwidth of the network</em> (the number on the box, e.g. 300 Mbps for N). Now of course, if only one device is ever speaking, you're probably still going to get most of that bandwidth to yourself, since the token times are fractions of a second. But as soon as other devices start sending packets, they start requesting little windows for themselves, which slows down your other host. Enough devices, and even the generic background updates of smartphones can kill an improperly-designed WiFi network.</p>
<p>This wouldn't be as much of a problem if WiFi could use more frequency space, but it's limited to a very small part of the EM spectrum, 2.4GHz. And within that very small spectrum, 2.4GHz WiFi is extremely saturated while also contending with other devices (e.g. cordless phones, and microwaves that blast out raw EM radiation at 2.4GHz). The 5GHz a,n,ac band helps with this, but higher frequencies have other limitations (lower penetration for one), and while the newer protocols are addressing this, but the tech is still a few years from primetime (802.11ac is half-way there).</p>
<p>Edit: Another thing to mention: most routers/access points are configured by default in a multi-version mode, e.g. 2.4GHz-g/n. This type of network will accept both 802.11g and 802.11n clients. However, if a g-only client is connected, <em>all</em> the clients must use g-mode connectivity, and your speeds are shot. Luckily with most newer routers you can set this easily, or they might even default to n-only, which helps with this problem, at the cost of cutting off older g-only devices (thankfully they're getting rarer). 5GHz n/ac isn't affected by this since there are very few a-only devices in the wild to connect and slow down the network.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of great explanations here, but I want to point out what I think is the source of this fairly common question. There was a time when a computer network was just that. People used computers, and they realize that a computer network allows computers to talk to each other.</p>
<p>For the last 5-10 years, people don't think of the Internet as a network in that sense anymore. Not a peer-to-peer network, where every device can talk to every other device. No, today people think about the Internet the same way that they think about radio or TV: someone (Google, Facebook, Instagram) <em>provides a signal</em> and everybody else is merely a consumer of information.</p>
<p>This is, of course, how almost everybody uses the Internet - and this is how those companies want everybody to think. They want you to think of yourself as a consumer, not as a peer, someone who could be contributing to the conversation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a bunch of people standing around in a circle. If just one person is speaking all the others can listen and hear it. If everyone is conversing with each other at once, it takes longer and is harder for every one of them to take in and put out information. The one person speaking is radio, the whole group talking over each other is wifi.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
