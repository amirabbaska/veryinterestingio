The &quot;p&quot; literally stands for &quot;peculiar&quot; since they show very odd features in their spectra.</p>
<p>They have really unusually high abundances of metals that are otherwise relatively rare in most of the universe. They also have unusually strong magnetic fields, easily as intense as those found in your typical MRI machine.</p>
<p>That said, if there are enough of them to have their own class, I'm not sure if they qualify as unique enough for your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several theoretically possible exotic stars. Quark stars, Q ball stars, Preon stars, Boson stars, Electroweak stars, antimatter stars, strange matter stars, and Planck stars are all examples that we don't have strong emperical evidence for but our current understanding of physics say may exist.</p>
<p>There is also the stellar population III stars, which are the hypothetical precursors to the current stellar population II and I stars. These first stars would have been bizzare super massive, 20 to 150 solar masses, and burnt out in only tens of millions  of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Looking for the lecture now. There is a theoretical type of star that results when a neutron star collides with a sun-like star. Because the neutron star is so dense, it sinks to the center and drives powerful convection currents stirring the layers of a normal star. Based on computer simulations, this rare beast would contain different elements in it light emitting layers, producing a wierd spectral signature. Last I heard, they have found one potential candidate in nature.</p>
<p>Edit; found it

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Betelgeuse is approaching its end and is way off spherical right now, due to huge convection currents welling up from its interior that are highly asymmetrical. But besides that, Betelgeuse is just another large, old star. It's predicted to go supernova in the next million years. When it does, it will be a very bright object in the sky because it's not that far away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a binary system of two white dwarfs known as HM cancri. Although the constituents are just normal white dwarves, they orbit each other just once every five minutes or so, moving at 400km/s or 840,000 mph, and orbit each other at a distance of less than a fifth of that between the earth and the moon.</p>
<p>Although they have not been directly observed, it is implied that the black hole collisions which produced the gravitational waves detected by LIGO involved even more extreme orbital configurations. Shortly before their merger, a pair of black holes can revolve around each other hundreds of times a second, moving at very nearly the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
