		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of answers to this question. </p>
<p>In some cases it is the same. Take a rock and heat it up really fast or slow, the effect is largely the same.</p>
<p>The problem comes with things like baking, which I assume we are talking about here. As we know, baking involves yeast. It also involves proteins and fats and all sorts of biological molecules. Baking them at a really high temperature kills the yeast, denatures the proteins, and potentially burns the fat.</p>
<p>The essential crux of it all is that some molecules are more stable, others not so much. There's a reason life can't exist in hot environments and that's because the molecules literally fall apart. Water, on the other hand, is extremely stable, for example.</p>
<p>There's also the issue of how long something takes to heat <em>through.</em> Imagine a steak. You sear it on the outside and it's still pink inside. We've all accidentally baked frozen chicken, too. This happens because it takes time for heat to transfer, also a major reason for slower heating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll add a non-cooking reason for your consideration.</p>
<p>When welding thin walled steel tubing for aircraft applications, you could weld it with an arc of electricity (3000 to 20,000 C), weld it with a gas torch 3400 C, or weld the ends of two tubes together using friction.  </p>
<p>Steel melts at 1500 C, give or take a few.  Arc welding is fast and works for just about any geometry of parts you want to join.  Gas welding is slower, but allows you to work on thinner materials without blowing big holes in them.  Friction welding is just hot enough to melt the ends of the two tubes so that they join, but joining tubes is its only use.</p>
<p>When you weld steel, as soon as you stop welding and look with your naked eye you can see the heat &quot;run away&quot; from the place you welded.  The steel is changing colors as the high heat disperses through the steel, running from yellow and red nearest the weld to violet and blue furthest away from the weld, to no color change where the wave of heat ran out of calories.  </p>
<p>The problem is this:  rapidly heated steel, especially from arc welding, becomes embrittled.  This means it will crack and break under real usage, like landing your plane.  This is never a good idea ;-)  </p>
<p>Therefore, the standard practice is to use a gas torch for thin walled tubing to limit the heat to only what's necessary, and slowly back off the torch so that the metal cools a little slower.  The is often followed by heating with a warm, large flame to further reduce any brittleness and ensure the metal parts will do their job in the real world.</p>
<p>It is the rapid heating and cooling that puts stress into the metal.  Metal's crystal structure changes as it heats.  Rapid cooling will freeze the metal at a particular crystal structure, some of which are very hard but brittle, and some of which are hard enough but tough and strong.  In my mind, I see this freezing happening before the sides of the crystals can align with each other, so energy doesn't flow smoothly through the metal.  This causes stress risers, little bottlenecks in the flow of energy, which are the ultimate cause of brittleness.  Reheating and cooling more slowly allows the crystal alignment to take place (chill out, little crystals!), smoothing out the energy flow during real use.</p>
<p>Back to food.</p>
<p>This is similar to what happens to that steak you ordered at that place with the wood fired grill.  They will have a hot zone and a not so hot zone on the grill.  They will sear the the outside of the steak on the hot part, because caramelization increases the flavor. We like that. Then, they will move it to the not so hot section to finish cooking the inside of the steak.  Keeps things moist and tender; we like that, too.</p>
<p>With fish, the chef will pan sear the fish to get that tasty crust then finish it under a broiler to preserve the crust but cook the filet through in a more gentle heat.</p>
<p>Neato heato!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>a lot of the answers here are needlessly complicated or specific, so let me try to give it a shot: </p>
<p>You can put the same amount of energy into a thing by heating it slowly (=with a lower temperature difference) for a longer time, or faster for a shorter time. That energy is the same. But what's different is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Heat distribution.
Think of a steak here. You can cook it really fast and really hot. That will not give the heat enough time to dissipate to the core, so it will stay uncooked. If you do it slower and longer, you'll end up with a thoroughly cooked piece of meat.</p>
</li>
<li>Specific things only happen at certain temperatures.
This is why you got so many field specific answers. There are lots of effects temperature has that don't have anything to do directly with the amount of energy put into whatever you're heating. Some are:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>material becoming softer and expaning (steelworking)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lifeforms dying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>phase changes (water evaporating, specific crystal structures like austenite forming)</p>
</li>
<li>chemical reactions</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that was a somewhat useful overview. As a sidenote, your terminology isn't like in physics. You call an amount of energy heat, to differentiate it from temperature. They don't directly translate because different materials need different amounts of energy per mass to reach a certain temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a piece of steak.  Properly cut, it's about 3cm thick, or more.  </p>
<p>Now imagine putting this in a really hot pan (maybe more than 200ºC).  The surface that touches the pan will heat up quickly, and the side that's far away will heat up only very very slowly.  The center of the steak will warm up as a result of conduction (heat being transferred from one molecule to the next within the steak), but meat is a bad conductor of heat.  So most of the heat will be stuck near the outside and not be transferred to the inside.  The longer you leave the steak on, the more likely the outside will dry out and burn.  Eventually the inside will increase in temperature, which will cook the center, but at a high heat, the pan side will be ruined.</p>
<p>Contrast this with a slow cooker: a device that uses a moderate or low temperature, and allows everything to reach one temperature over a long time.  So, if you leave a steak in a slow cooker for a long time, everything will end up being the same temperature (maybe 80ºC), and nothing will be burnt, and nothing will be &quot;rare&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't know if I'll be able to help, but Gourmet coffee roaster here. I just started the cool down sequence of our roaster (pictured below), so maybe I can take pictures of the process tomorrow.
My English is bad. </p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://imgur.com/xsxoCqV" target="_blank">picture</a> of coffee beans going through the
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction" target="_blank">Maillard reaction</a> .</p>
<p>For coffee roasting, the proper application of heat is crucial. Similar to baking and searing stakes, roasting coffee is highly dependent on how heat is applied over time.</p>
<p>If heat is applied too quickly, the energy does not go throughout the bean , and the Maillard reaction as a result does not occur evenl,y does not occur at all, or the desired compounds are not formed or transformed. In coffee this results in uneven color, loss of pleasant aromatics, and loss in flavor to name a few. </p>
<p>For example, let's say we have a coffee that we want to highlight its acidity, but a complex and approachable acidity like that of a red delicious rather than vinegar.</p>
<p>Let's imagine we are roasting coffee. To start the Maillard reaction, let's say our beans internal temperate needs to be at 280F. We need to apply heat over time slowly in order to raise the temperature and ensure that the bean is endothermic throughout, and that the beans hit the desired temperature of 280F at the same time and not unevenly based on how close they are to the roasters rotating drum wall. </p>
<p>Let's say acidity with our equipment starts to peak in the Maillard reaction around 350F. If we are to add heat too quickly, the Maillard reaction accelerates and the compounds that bring the character of acidity that just peaked can be fully burnt up, resulting in the loss of that flavor and aroma. When released from the roaster it will have been a dull coffee. If we are to gradually manipulate heat and observe the acidity slowly taper off however, we can observe the difference in acidity level by aroma and release the coffee when a desired amount of the compounds translate to acidity are at a desired level, which in turn translates to a balanced acidity over a harsh vinegary one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
