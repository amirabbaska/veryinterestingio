		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most cheap knives are either cut and ground or die-forged (a blank or sheet is stamped at very high pressure to smoosh it into shape, then ground to finish). Die forging or stamping is quick, cheap (per unit, not to set up), and pretty efficient use of material.  Decent knives are then heat treated to the desired hardness, sometimes differentially (edge is hard to keep an edge, spine is more elastic so it doesn’t snap)</p>
<p>Grinding a thick blank into a sword or knife can be time consuming, lead to spot-overheating and distempering of the metal, and wastes a lot of metal. Small-scale makers will sometimes do this. </p>
<p>Hammer and anvil forging is kind of hipster-y cool but also allows for mixing different steels together and delivers a unique product every time. It’s also hella expensive in terms of time, but doesn’t require a couple million dollars worth of press and dies. Most commercial swords and knives are not hand forged.</p>
<p>There’s a whole spectrum of methods between these - it’s just a quick survey of high points. </p>
<p>Edit: clarity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The folded knives and swords were made as a way to beat out the impurities in the steel. With modern steels folding is no longer needed, and actually introduces impurities.</p>
<p>Shaping steel, by either cutting away or hammer forging results in a fairly similar end result. However shaping rather than grinding and cutting means you can use less material.</p>
<p>Finally properly tempered, normalised, and hardened steel effects how well it will hold an edge and how brittle it becomes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sheet metal is also forged, pretty much.</p>
<p>The processes are called hot rolling and cold rolling when they are applied to sheet stock, but they're the same physical and chemical processes *<em>as hot forging an cold forging, respectively,</em> if you zoom in close enough.</p>
<p>Forging is needed because liquid metal crystallizes slowly enough that its atoms can diffuse around, causing non-uniform composition and (often worse) very large crystals. Larger crystals are better when we're talking gemstones, but large metal crystals are weak and unreliable. Forging mixes things up.</p>
<p>I agree with most of the other responses here, though.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to many other comments here, forging is sometimes more efficient for material use than stamping or laser cutting. Many swords require a distal taper (they get thinner as they get longer and narrower) and if you can produce that with forging then you're saving material. In olden times, there weren't sheet forging or profile cutting processes yet, so this was the best tool for the job all the way around.</p>
<p>This is an extreme example, but check out this machine:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/JVlVINAdrGk?t=428" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/JVlVINAdrGk?t=428</a></p>
<p>It takes a solid heated steel cylinder, about 16&quot; diameter and 30&quot; tall, and turns it into a huge ring that is 6&quot; tall, and over eight feet in diameter. You can't cut that out of a sheet without either making it out of segments (which creates unpredictable weld points when you re-assemble it) or having a huge drop.</p>
<p>Using modern materials, heat treating, and expert honing and sharpening, you can make a cut-from-stock sword that is equal or better than the best old timey or modern forged swords.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
