		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cells that become &quot;extra&quot; will apoptose(die) and otherwise be breakdown. This process especially on the protein level (necessary in skin because of lots of collagen). Is not fast and due to severe epigenetic effects from the obesity may not return to normal easily.  Cosmetic surgery is generally used to help this along for large differences. </p>
<p>They don't get &quot;burned&quot; per se but your body slowly realizes you don't need them and will devascularize the blood vessels and degrade the collagen/keratin in skin. This process is limited by both time and degree of change which is why you get stretch marks(skin collagen synthesis not keeping up)  when quickly get fat/ muscular and get &quot;flaps or a lack of&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the body fluctuates in size, cells themselves change in size. For example, with weight gain adipose (fat cells) physically become larger, and become small with weight loss. The actual number of cells change very minimally - because the primary change with weight is actually the size of the cells, not the number. In terms of nerves, nerves become responsible for a large surface area, but don't actually increase in number. They actually become less efficient because of this.</p>
<p>If someone wishes to provide a more detailed answer, they certainly can... my answer is though very ELI5, and it's been awhile since I learned all this in an anatomy class.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Periods of caloric deficit encourages the body to enter a mode of &quot;Autophagy&quot; where it begins to kill off excess, unneeded and old cells. Cells are broken down for their base components, for instance, the skin tends to have a lot of protein in it. </p>
<p>Incidentally, this is also the source of the health benefits of fasting. By encouraging your body to enter autophagy states, it allows you to rid yourself of the old cells that are the most defective and often the most likely to turn cancerous, but the jury is still out on how effective fasting is for that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it takes it apart, trashes what's not useful, and recycles what is. Your body is eating itself all the time anyway, so it doesn't really bother it that much.</p>
<p>Some cells don't break down well (like skin), and those just kind of... stay there. You may have heard of or seen fat people that have lost weight and have these droopy skin flaps. Those stay there a loooong time if you don't do surgery to remove them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So let me get this right: if you are 150lbs and gain 40lbs of fat your body creates fat cells. Then, if you loose 40lbs of fat and go back down to 150lbs you retain those fat cells but they are smaller. So if you gain fat then loose it you wind up with more fat cells in the end?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
