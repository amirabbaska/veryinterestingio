		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have an extremely good understanding that height is heritable. Tall parents have tall children. When analyzed on a genetic level, 75% of the variation in height is genetic. However, only 10% of that variation (7.5% of the total variation) can be explained by specific genetic factors. The unknown genetic factors are called &quot;missing heritability&quot;. </p>
<p>Tl;dr most of it is heritable, but most of the specific factors are unknown. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How would a bad diet consisting of things like almost exclusively drinking pop as a younger person or diets that arent the best for the bones change the genetic vs environmental factors percentage? Would you still see similar heights for two twins separated at birth but the one with the no calcium diet having a significantly thinner bone structure instead of just a loss in height?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Health and diet in your first five years of life is probably the most important period to be concerned with, and it can have enormous effects on things like height. </p>
<p>I am actually curious how we could do a study of a child that was fed and cared for, but then subjected to malnutrition during adolescence.  I imagine now's the time, with the unprecedented refugee population. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While others are commenting about twin studies and  such, it is important to note that the genetic contribution to the phenotypic difference is overestimated as the environmental factor is kept relatively constant due to similar growing up conditions etc. This is all the more so for adoption studies of twins as the screening for eligibility to adopt narrows the range of guardians and hence result in many environmental factors being kept constant. For example, when twins are raised separately by similar adopter profiles, they will have generally similar socioeconomic backgrounds and hence be able to afford the same abundance of food and nutrients etc. So if nutrients were to be a environmental factor of height, it would have been masked by the fact that it was kept constant and hence we incorrectly overstate the genetic contribution to determine height.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the best models predict height with a correlation of ~.65. while this doesn't directly address the question you're asking, you can use the R^2 (.65^2 = .42) to place a lower bound on the genetic component, so at least 42% is explained by genetics.</p>
