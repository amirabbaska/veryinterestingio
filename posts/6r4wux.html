I have lived in countries (and decades) with different impacts on global resources, and air conditioning is a common factor for the high consumption conditions. I know there is <em>some</em> impact, and it's probably less than other common aspects of modern society, but would appreciate feedback from those who have more expertise.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have mentioned that the amount of energy going to air condition is large, and that it is the primary driver of how much power plant capacity we need - peak power production, those are the two main power grid/engineering impacts that I know of.</p>
<p>The escape of the refrigerants used in air conditioning which are strong green house gases themselves is another impact.</p>
<p>Something I find interesting is due to cheap power and other priorities we have stopped designing our buildings to take advantage of local environment. For example Ancient Rome had the Justinian Code forbidding anyone from building tall enough to block their neighbors sunlight - something that we are having legal proceedings in the US today in regard to neighboring buildings and solar power production.</p>
<p>Another cool ancient concept that i cant remember the name of is free air conditioning by using a chimney to draw air up from underground.

<p>Movements like Passive House are moving people back towards designing buildings to take advantage of free energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think one of the biggest impacts isn't just environmental, but geographical. Specifically where people live. Until the advent of air conditioning the hotter parts of the earth were more sparsely populated. Now they're more full. The US South is an example of this. The population has grown considerably since AC because there's plenty of land there and plenty of space to move into. It means that I can live in what's essentially a sub-tropical rain forest area and not cook to death on 100 degree days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air conditioning is a pretty big issue. </p>
<p>First it is the reason big cities in southern Arizona can even exist(along with the massive increase in urban/suburban sprawl and it's resulting carbon footprint in those areas). </p>
<p>Second is the peak demand on electric grids is high afternoon when the heat/people are out and about. So huge power demands from not clean not sustainable energy sources(which is a problem we have the technology to address should government/corporate policy measures reflect an interest in doing so). </p>
<p>Third is they aren't all that energy efficient. Which could be addressed but is sidelined compared to issues one and two. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's cheaper to use A/C in the south than it is to heat your home in the north. Turns out, fighting 100 degrees outdoors to make your house 75 uses less energy than it does to fight 10 degrees outdoors to make your house 68. The mass migration of Americans to the south has been a net positive in terms of energy use for home temperature modulation. People just love to hate on A/C because it is a fairly new technology.</p>
<p>I have seen many environmentally minded people saying that people shouldn't live in AZ or TX or that people should sweat out the heat, but no one would ever suggest that people in Boston or NYC should just wear long Johns and buy a winter-weather sleeping bag in order to get through the winter.</p>
