I know efficiency is inversely proportional to molar mass, and oxygen is lighter than RP-1, so is that the main reason why ther RD-180 is such a good engine? If so, what made it possible to run it oxygen rich and what prevented the US from developing the same engine?</p></div></div>

<p>In a hydrogen-oxygen engine that's not a concern, so for example the SSME uses a fuel-rich mix in its preburner. That's also the easier thing to build, because an oxygen-rich preburner means you're piping a hot mix of oxygen and combustion products around, and that's really, really aggressively corrosive. The Americans didn't actually believe the Russians had achieved that until the Soviet Union collapsed and they got to see it for themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Russian rockets channel exhaust from the pre-burner turbine--which powers the main fuel pumps--into the primary combustion chamber. This improves efficiency of the rocket up to 25%.</p>
<p>The documentary is available on Youtube. <a href="https://youtu.be/TMbl_ofF3AM?t=12m05s" target="_blank">This link starts at the section describing the difference</a>, but the entire film is worth watching. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a misunderstanding. The only part of the engine that runs oxygen rich is the preburner for the turbopump. The actual exhaust is still fuel rich.</p>
<p>The reason they need to run oxidizer rich for the preburner is because if they ran fuel rich it'd produce too much soot that would clog the injector into the combustion chamber. Additionally, since by mass there's more oxidizer than fuel (it's still fuel rich though since that's about the chemistry taking place) running the preburner oxidizer rich means they have more mass flow to drive the turbine, which leads to more power generated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the other Russian engines run oxygen rich. The downside is that you have hot gaseous oxygen running through your engine and it's nasty stuff.</p>
<p>Having more oxygen should result in a higher ISP. It is also a staged combustion engine and it runs at a very high chamber pressure, and those have a big effect on ISP.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're confused, I think.</p>
<p>The main chamber doesn't run oxygen-rich; it still runs fuel rich as normal. It runs <em>less</em> fuel rich than many engines, but that's basically just because it's a very high pressure engine. With LOX/kerosene (or any hydrocarbon) the optimum Isp happens at a leaner O:F ratio as the pressure goes up. High pressure suppresses dissociation in the chamber. (At low pressures, you'll get species like H and OH present at the same time; it's an equilibrium reaction, and high pressures push toward the products side of the reaction.) You also get better nozzle efficiency (from higher expansion ratio), which makes the gas properties (Cp/Cv, mostly) in the nozzle less important. (The more fuel-rich mixes have better gas properties; higher expansion engines benefit less from that, so they optimize leaner.)</p>
<p>What runs oxygen rich is the preburner, which provides drive gas for the turbine that drives the pumps. Because that preburner needs to operate at a low temperature (by the standards of complete combustion of rocket propellants, anyway), it has to run either very rich or very lean. Running kerosene very rich produces a lot of soot, which is hard to handle in the turbine and injector that feeds that turbine exhaust into the chamber. Running oxygen rich also means you have more mass available to work with (since there is more oxygen by mass than fuel total), which helps make the turbine design more efficient (especially at the low pressure ratios required for staged combustion).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
