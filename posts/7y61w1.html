		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all it's an unsourced claim, so It's likely bullshit to begin with.<br />
If the genes responcible are well known people can use the Hardy-Weinberg equation and similar methods working backwards to calculate how common certain genes are based on how common certain traits are in the population. After you have those numbers you can calculate how likely a combination of genes is to create a specific combination of traits. The lobster in question may or may not be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics)" target="_blank">chimera</a> which complicates things further.<br />
Genetics has a lot of terminology and math, so it's hard to make an answer less vague without going into many other topics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well first off that 1:50million chance was probably calculated by how often the split lobster has been sighted in the wild. But after doing some reading, it appears that split lobster are also hermaphrodites (both genders). So the 1:50mil calculation probably also takes into account the statistical probability of such a nondysjunction (genetic disorder) appearing in lobsters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other comments have answered this more accurately but not in a very ELI5 manner so I'll take a swing at it:</p>
<p>In order to accurately describe how (un)common a trait is we need to know a few things. First, how many lobsters are out there? It's an educated guess, there's no census lobster scuttling on shore with a census report for your friendly hometown marine biologist! So theres always plenty of room for guess work. How likely is it that a perticular lobster has the possibility to make baby lobsters with that trait (allele frequency) and/or how frequent does this mutation  (if genes make the colors) or patterning problem (If it's a problem with development) pop up? Because for rare phenotypes it's even harder to get a number for how many of these guys are out there, you can't just count them and call it a day! If you know these it's not hard to figure out how common split color lobsters are! These numbers should always be taken with a grain of sea salt because it's really hard to get accurate numbers of wild populations, so the number you use for your math could be off by a lot.</p>
<p>Hope this helps, you can look for videos explaining the equations above, but my explanation is the basic principle.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no genetic analysis done, they just try to figure out how many split color lobsters have been caught divided by how many lobsters total have been caught while controlling for unknown variables, like how many split color lobsters have been caught but not noticed. </p>
<p>It's likely a bullshit statistic anyway. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem is more to define the probability than to estimate it. There’s only one universe we know about, and either all the life is on the Earth, or it isn’t. There’s no probability involved.</p>
<p>We could define a subjective probability by asking people to bet on whether or not there is life. But to make that even remotely reasonable, we’d have to narrow the question to, say, strong evidence of extraterrestrial life will be discovered in the next ten years.</p>
<p>We could define a frequentist probability by proposing some method of analyzing questions like this such that we expect long run frequency of statements being true to be near our estimates. But I don’t think anyone has the faintest idea how to do this, or what it would mean if we did.</p>
<p>We can build probabilistic models and compute model probabilities. These are not the actual probabilities, of course, but if the models are compelling, they offer some basis for subjective judgement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
