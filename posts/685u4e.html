		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wells Fargo was fined $185 million for identity theft in relation to those practices. </p>
<p>Charging the fired employees with criminal charges of identity theft leads to a very big problem for whoever wants to prosecute that - the fired employees have already claimed numerous times that this was company practice, and that they were pressured by management to do it. Those employees who did not do this were forced out or fired. Furthermore, Wells Fargo has already seen civil damages from this and has also paid off members whose accounts were affected. Any prosecutor who wants to charge the fired employees before the company itself is going to have a very hard time explaining that decision to anyone.</p>
<p>The employees were acting in their capacity as Wells Fargo agents at the time of the identity theft. The case would be different if an employee were fired and then continued to make new accounts in other people's names. It would be different if a person was employed by Wells Fargo, but was doing this in their own home at 11 pm on a Saturday, off the clock. But they were literally doing what management told them to do while they were on the clock - create this number of new accounts, no matter how you do it, or you're fired. Management is legally responsible for the consequences. Wells Fargo, the corporation, is legally responsible for the consequences. Why would anybody go after the individuals?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More like, why were the executives that worked for Wells Fargo allowed to keep their bonuses and not personally at fault for the years and years that this kept happening while they knew about it and swept it under the rug? They lied to the fed about when they knew (they really had known for years) and did nothing about it. Likely because it padded their pockets, vastly increased shareholder profits, and directly affected their hundreds of thousand dollar, in some cases millions, in bonuses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's prosecuting the same crime multiple times. Wells Fargo was at fault, not the individuals. To the law, the company is an entity of its own; people acting as agents of the company  are the responsibility of the company. It's a legal term called &quot;respondeat superior,&quot; because lawyers love breaking out the Latin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
