		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vantablack is made of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes. The level of &quot;blackness&quot; you might expect from a single carbon nanotube is similar to other forms of carbon, like coal. What makes it really black, however, is light trapping by this &quot;forest&quot; structure. When light hits the material, rather than reflect or transmit, it bounces around inside the forest. At every bounce, there is some probability of absorption. The more bounces, the more absorption. </p>
<p>In terms of what actually happens in the material, it works the same as in most semiconductors - the energy of the photon promotes an electron from the valence band to the conduction band of the material. This is the same as in a solar cell. But without the solar cell structure, the electron eventually relaxes back to the valence band, emitting a phonon (usually). Phonons are vibrations in the material, the microscopic manifestation of heat. So in the end, Vantablack turns light into heat.</p>
<p>As to the limit of absorption, you will always run into the problem of black body radiation. At a given temperature, an object is always emitting light. For room temperature objects, that light is mainly in the far infrared. For very hot things, like flames or metal taken out of a forge, you actually get visible light. So if Vantablack absorbed so much light that it got really hot, it would start to glow red.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vantablack consists of a lattice of alligned carbon nanotubes of specific width to trap the electromagnetic waves of wavelengths specific to visible light. Within the layer of vantablack that is coasted onto a substrate the light continuously bounces between the nanotubes becoming more and more absorbed, of which the electromagnetic radiant energy is exchanged to heat potential and usually dissipated through a high heat capacity substrate. The probability of visible light escaping vantablack is very low, as such almost zero visible manages to reflect from the compound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
