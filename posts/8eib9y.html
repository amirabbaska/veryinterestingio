		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called <strong><em>presque vu</em></strong> and, like so many thing relating to the inner workings of the brain, we probably don't fully understand this.</p>
<p>Basically you're remembering things <strong>about</strong> the thing that you're trying to remember, but without actually recalling it. This might be because another memory that is very similar is &quot;blocking&quot; you from remember the thing fully, so you only get bits of it (known as state).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may be due to Serial-position effect. Our brains are inclined to remember the first few and the last few items in a series the best. Also, in many languages the first syllable has more syllabic stress -new words are derived from the first syllable of an existing word giving more importance to the first letters.
This is purely anecdotal but usually when friends and I experience this phenomenon, the word we're looking for will not be beginning with the remembered letter more often than not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For me, I am better at remembering the shape of a word, or any patterns (without remembering specifically the letters). For example, if I couldn’t remember the word “yellow”, I would recall that in the middle were two tall letters, and the start would have a hanging letter. Or I can loosely recall where and how many vowels there were in the word I’m trying to remember. Rarely am I stuck remembering only the first letter though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
