<p>I was wondering what sort of geodesic they form in the microseconds before merger...as the event horizons draw nearer and pull space-time between them...is it a sort of torus, or elongated sphere?  What would happen to  certain particles, or even photons, trapped between them moving in an insanely fast figure  8; would they be accelerated out in escape velocities just before the merge?  Does that generate a sort of 'radio blast' that would follow millions of years after we detected the gravity wave due to redshift?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the short answer is that there is no exact solution to the Einstein field equations involving two black holes (and there probably never will be). This means that we wont know the exact form the geodesics will take. </p>
<p>But we can make solid guesses and do numerical calculations. The best source for these considerations I have found is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5260" target="_blank">here</a>. However, this review focuses mainly on the gravitational waves produced by these mergers. It does, however, consider your final question in one of the last sections. In general, the amount of electromagnetic radiation given off will depend on the size of the hole and the presence of an accretion disk or other matter between the holes. Also, this radiation is expected to arrive at the same time as the gravitational waves since they both travel at the speed of light. Any deviation from this would be evidence for some speculative physics theories like de Sitter Relativity or Causal Dynamical Triangulation. Also, keep in mind that since light always travels the same speed it will not be &quot;accelerated&quot; like you mentioned. It can experience red- or blueshift though.</p>
<p>Also, we can make some good guesses about the geodesics, and the paths of light, that occur in this system. There will not be any (observable) figure 8s since if it is meaningful to say they occur it would be within the event horizons of the merging black holes EDIT: this is not true, I don't know if there would be any stable photon orbits and what they would look like. Also, a lot would depend on the size of the holes since for supermassive black holes the local curvature outside the event horizon is extremely close to flat. This means that if not for the presence of other matter you would not experience any trauma from being between the two edges of the event horizons, no matter how close they were, and you wouldnâ€™t necessarily see any extreme optical phenomena when you look away from the holes. But from other perspectives or smaller black holes, there would probably be some very weird and extreme gravitational lensing. Light sources behind a single black hole will appear from a distance as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_ring" target="_blank">Einstein Ring</a>. But from behind the merging black holes, they might make an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_Cross" target="_blank">Einstein Cross</a> or even something weirder since the distribution of matter is elongated but in a more interesting way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
