		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a photo that showed up on the front page that showed crystal clear water in a stream (<a href="http://imgur.com/kmfy5Um" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/kmfy5Um</a> ); some of you may have seen images of the water off the coast of the Maldives, which is so clear row boats in the water look like they're floating in air. How does water get this clear without filtration and sterilization in the wild? Why doesn't algae and other life and biological residues fill it up and make it cloudy? In the case of the Maldives, aren't there plankton in the water? In the case of the stream in Sweden linked above, you can see dead grass in the water; if it flowed there across any sort of land and if the stream or pond has dead plant matter in it, why hasn't it carried suspended biological residues into the water?
(And lastly, is it possible to simulate those processes for man-made ponds?)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the water is completely lacking nutrients then nothing will grow in it and it'll stay clear. Tropical ocean water is nutrient poor, and the Swedish mountains (the Scandes) are composed mostly of limestone. Lime is used to reduce acidity in fertilizer polluted lakes, so I'm assuming it causes the water to become nutrient poor somehow, although I don't know the exact process.</p>
<p>From an ecological point of view, algae might be suppressed by a herbivore under no predation pressure.</p>
<p>Oh and the picture is most probably real. Streams this clear are not at all rare in the Scandes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have dived in water this clear, the water I dived in was subterranean, and I filmed the source. So in this case the really cold water from a limestone area was freshly flushed through the lake. If this came from snow melt, or subterranean sources, then there is no place to pick up the detritus in the water. It would be interesting to see the water temp. </p>
<p>Temperate waters typically have lots of phytoplankton in it, whereas warmer coral seas are filtered by the coral, increasing the visibility such as seen in the Maldives photo. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The clearest water tends to occurs in oligotrophic lakes, low accumulation of dissolved nutrient salts, supporting but a sparse growth of algae and other organisms, and having a high oxygen content owing to the low organic content.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Life needs nutrients to grow, no nutrients equals no algae. Suspended solids tend to settle on the bottom if the water isn't moving too fast. Plankton can be beneficial in keeping water clear as they filter it.</p>
<p>It is possible to reproduce this by using other plants to out-compete the algae. If you Google swimming ponds you'll find a pile of related info. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crystal clear water is water that has very low nutrient content. Water near stream headlands has not picked up the nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other nutrients. The ocean in the tropics is also very nutrient poor because the warm waters do not mix with the deeper more nutrient rich waters. The water simply cannot support the growth of much life. </p>
<p>You mention the grass, but if the source of the grass is close to where the picture was taken there is not time for the nutrients to become available this will be influenced by a lot of factors stream speed, temperature, or specific nutrient limitations. </p>
<p>Water in just about every habitat is filtered somehow. Rivers are filtered by wetlands and saltmarshes (which is why they are so important don't drain the actual swamp), in the tropics mangroves filter runoff from the land, and on small scales oysters, tunicates, clams, mussels, corals and sponges filter water removing organic material. </p>
<p>To replicate that in a pond generally requires mechanical filtration and chemicals.       </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
