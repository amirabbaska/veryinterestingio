		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Antibiotics don't &quot;know&quot; where to go and how to get to the infection.  However, different antibiotics distribute within the body differently and on different time scales - what we call &quot;pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics,&quot; or &quot;PK/PD&quot; for short.  Also, different antibiotics affect different pathogens differently (their &quot;spectrum of activity&quot;).</p>
<p>So, your doctor prescribes the correct antibiotic (and formulation) for your specific infection, considering both the underlying bacterial strain(s) and the location of the infection.  </p>
<p>For example, vancomycin is an antibiotic that is not absorbed well when taken orally - that is, it does not cross over from your stomach to your bloodstream, what we call &quot;oral bioavailability.&quot;  So, for specific types of gastrointestinal infections (such as those from Clostridium difficile) where you would want  to keep a high concentration of the drug in the gut, it's a logical choice.  </p>
<p>But, for an infection elsewhere (such as an abscess in the skin), it would be a terrible choice, as not enough antibiotic would get to the site of infection from the gut.  Thus, you would need to use an intravenous formulation of the same drug (or choose another antibiotic that is orally bioavailable).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question!  Some other posters are right.  The antibiotic goes wherever the body sends it.  The antibiotic is designed to be more toxic to the bacteria because it is designed to attack parts of the bacteria that ideally our cells do not have.  Bacterial cells have some important parts that our cells do not.  The things called enzymes that make these parts are what the antibiotics normally work against.  </p>
<p>We also can design drugs that behave differently in our bodies to make them more useful.  By making changes to the chemical structures we can make them absorb better in our stomachs so  they get in our bodies faster, or make them slower to leave our blood.  If you have a urinary tract infection, a drug that gets in your urine fast is great. If you have a bad case of food poisoning,  a drug that stays in the gut rather than being absorbed in your stomach is a better option.   So knowing where you are sick and what is causing your illness all are factors in deciding which antibiotics to prescribe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Some people suffer adverse affects after taking antibiotics because they can throw off your entire system.  We've got plenty of organisms in our bodies that are good for us.  Sometimes, they get caught in the crossfire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't. Antibiotics are like Alcohol. Once applied, it affects whatever it touches and has no bearing on where it goes. Antibiotics are distributed throughout your entire body from pills. </p>
<p>You can get site injections that help target antibiotics, but even at that point the antibiotics get absorbed into the bloodstream and wind up all over your body after a period of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Antibiotics, like most medication, is not able to target a specific area in the body. It travels throughout the body through the bloodstream reacting with ALL susceptible organisms it meets. This is why it is recommended you take a probiotic and/or eat yoghurt with live cultures while taking an antibiotic to help restore some of the natural organisms found in your body (digestive system in particular). </p>
<p>Antibiotics are either broad-spectrum (kills everything) or specific to certain sub-groups of bacteria. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
