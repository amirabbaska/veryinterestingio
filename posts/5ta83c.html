		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>None of the answers are quite complete / accurate.</p>
<p>Chinese characters can be ordered in two main ways, by pronunciation and by radical. The sound of each character in Mandarin can be written out using Roman letters (a phonetic system called pinyin), which can be arranged alphabetically, A to Z. For example, the character 你 (you) is listed under &quot;ni&quot;, and the character 她 (she) under &quot;ta&quot;. Mandarin also has 4 tones, so for each sound such as &quot;ni&quot;, there will be further ordering &quot;ni1&quot;, &quot;ni2&quot;, &quot;ni3&quot;, and &quot;ni4&quot;, where the number indicates tone. So 你 is actually under &quot;ni3&quot; and 她 under &quot;ta1&quot;. This ordering is useful when you know how to say the character, but don't know/remember how exactly to write it.</p>
<p>For radical, things are slightly more complicated. Most Chinese characters can be split into a &quot;main&quot; part and... the other part. The main part, called the radical, often gives a general idea to the meaning of the character. If you know Chinese, you can easily pick out which part is the radical (it can be on the left, right, top, bottom, left-bottom, top-left, 3-side-surrounding, 4-side-surrounding, etc!). At the start of every dictionary is an index -- a list of all the radicals. Under each radical, you see a list of ALL the characters having that radical (there are very very many). Take your time to find the one you're looking for, and it tells you which page to go to for that character. This kind of ordering is useful when you know what the character looks like but not how it sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Pros and cons</strong>: the radical ordering works everywhere, as long as you can read the written characters; the pronunciation ordering only works in a particular spoken Chinese language. Since Mandarin is the largest spoken language (not in Hong Kong!), that's what dictionaries always use.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS</strong>. You may ask, how do you arrange all the characters under the same pronunciation (for example 思斯絲司私撕廝 or 顆科柯棵苛)? Or how do you arrange them under the same radical (確礦碳碼 or 開關問聞)? Heck, how do you arrange the radicals in the first place (亻宀忄口火馬鳥)? In this case, we use the number of strokes. Basically, it's the number of times you have to lift the tip of your pencil to write the character, according to a standard way of writing that everyone must learn in school. This save you some time, but there can still be dozens of characters with the same radical and the same number of strokes. Check out and play with the <a href="http://unicode.org/charts/unihanrsindex.html" target="_blank">radical-stroke index</a></p>
<p><strong>BONUS2</strong>. Your title is not entirely accurate. Chinese is a language family made up of a wide range of different regional languages that cannot understand each other when spoken. Mandarin is just the name of a spoken language. There is only ONE written language, so the same character can be pronounced differently but still understood by everyone. (Except Mainland China writes most characters a bit differently than Hong Kong and Taiwan. We won't get into that here.) Since dictionaries are about the written language, you should write &quot;Chinese&quot; instead of &quot;Mandarin&quot; in the title.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Chinese characters can be ordered in two different ways:
(1) Romanised pronunciation -&gt; tone number -&gt; number of strokes
(2) Number of strokes of radical -&gt; radical -&gt; number of remaining strokes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some dictionaries are organized by radicals.  Most Chinese characters are made up of smaller characters called radicals.  好 being 女 and 子. Since 女 is on the left, you would search by that using the number of stroke.  Once you find all the 女 entries, they're organized by number of extra strokes.  So 女 is three strokes and 子 is also three strokes, so you can look it up that way.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The appearance of a character and its pronunciation has less correlation than other writing systems, so in Chinese the following two are both possible: knowing a character but not its pronunciation, and knowing a pronunciation and meaning but not knowing how to write it.</p>
<p>For the pronunciation to character index, some dictionaries have that as an appendix. The harder problem is looking up a character based on appearance with no knowledge of its pronunciation.</p>
<p>Every Chinese character is written using one or more strokes, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_order" target="_blank">stroke order</a> is more or less predictable. Furthermore, most Chinese characters are composed of simpler characters. Some of the simpler characters are considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(Chinese_characters)" target="_blank">&quot;radicals&quot;</a>, which you can think of as a &quot;meta character&quot;. There is a fixed number of radicals. </p>
<ul>
<li>First there is an index of radicals, sorted by ascending stroke count, since radicals themselves are also characters.</li>
<li>Then all characters are sorted first by radicals (in the same order as the index), then by the remaining stroke count.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are irregularities that come with the radical system, so here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>語 (&quot;language&quot;) has a total of 14 strokes. Its radical 言 (&quot;speech&quot;) happens to occur on the left-hand side. 言 has 7 strokes, so first you look up 7, and find arrive at the page where all 7-stroke radicals are. Once you locate 言, it tells you which page to start for all the 言-radical characters. Once you flip to that page, there are 14 - 7 = 7 strokes remaining, so you keep flipping forward until you get to the 言-7 section, and that is where you will find 語 as well as any other 17-stroke whose radical is 言.</li>
<li>情 (&quot;emotion&quot;) has a total of 11 strokes. Its radical 心 (&quot;heart&quot;) also happens to occur on the left-hand side. The inconsistency is that in radical form, it is 3 strokes, but in isolated form, it is 4. A lot of radicals diverge between radical form and isolated form, e.g. 水 (&quot;water&quot;) is the isolated form and the left-hand side of 河 (&quot;river&quot;), 氵 is the radical form. For the purpose of looking up the radical 心 itself, you use 4. But for the purpose of calculating the remaining stroke count, you use 3, so 11 - 3 = 8. The character 情 can be found in the 心-8 section.</li>
<li>慶 (&quot;celebrate&quot;) has a total of 15 strokes. Its radical 心 (&quot;heart&quot;) is in the middle of the character. Not every character's radical is on the left-hand side! In this case the actual occurrence is in regular form, so 15 - 4 = 11, so 慶 is in the 心-11 section.</li>
<li>花 (&quot;flower&quot;) has a total of 8 strokes. Its radical 艸 (&quot;plant&quot;, &quot;grass&quot;) is on the top of the character, in the radical form of 艹 with 4 strokes. This is a double whammy! Not only is the radical not on the left, but the radical itself has two different forms just like 心 (&quot;heart&quot;). Where you would find 艸 is a more interesting question: some dictionaries say 艸 itself is 6 strokes, while some prefer saying 艹 is 4 strokes. They are the same radical in two different forms, so it's a matter of preference and standards. The character 花 can be found in the 艸-4 section.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The radical can reside anywhere in the character, but the most common locations are on the left or on the top. The right or the middle are less common, but it can happen.</li>
<li>A radical may have two different forms. One is the isolated form, when you write the radical as its own character. The other is in radical form, when you write the radical as part of another character. Depending on how common the isolated form is, one may look more alien than another. For example the isolated form 水 (&quot;water&quot;) is just as common as its radical counterpart 氵, but you seldom see 艸 (&quot;plant&quot;, &quot;grass&quot;) other than in the context of radicals and the radical counterpart 艹 occurs much more frequently as part of other characters, e.g. 花 (&quot;flower&quot;), 草 (&quot;grass&quot;), 藝 (&quot;art&quot;).</li>
<li>How many strokes a radical has is trickier if it has two forms. The Taiwanese Ministry of Education, for example, prefers the stroke count of the radical form.</li>
<li>How many strokes a character has is less contested, but can happen. This is due to disagreement between whether a stroke is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_(CJKV_character)" target="_blank">simple or compound</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Going back to the two different problems whether you know the character's pronunciation: on a desktop computer it is very common to input a character's pronunciation and let the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method" target="_blank">IME</a> automatically choose and / or let you select the right character. Other IMEs work by letting enter a series of radicals (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangjie_input_method" target="_blank">Cangjie</a>) or straight up let you use a trackpad or touch surface to handwrite characters for recognition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>just to add on to this discussion, in my school, we use electronic dictionaries for examinations, which have a database of words that can be found through typing how they sound like. I'm sure anyone that has learnt mandarin since young would have learnt something similar to the phonics, which is how you find it in the dictionary. sorry if this was confusing but i'm just trying to contribute :/</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Arabic is organized by the root of each word. Most words have a 3 letter root from which are stemmed dozens of other words such as كتب which means to write. If you add م to the beginning it means desk or office. If you add م to the beginning and ة to the end it becomes library or bookstore. And so on. There are dozens of words that can be made from the 3 letter root so from Arabic to English, words are organized by the root in order of the script.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
