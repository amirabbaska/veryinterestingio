		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is something I can contribute to very well. I've given lectures at universities and museums on the history of beer. It's a fascinating topic that I love delving in to. If I go long my apologies, but beer is so important to our civilization. </p>
<p>As has been stated several times in this thread, it's the reason why we became an agricultural society instead of just hunter/gatherers. It's the reason we have society. In early Mesopotamia it was also used as currency. Hell, Jewish slaves were paid in bowls of beer, it wasn't beer as we know it today, but it was a porridge-like substance that was created with grain and water. The pyramids were built on beer.</p>
<p>I stated earlier that the reason why wine is used in Christianity is because it was easy to grow grapes in Italy and as Christianity spread through the Roman Empire that became the norm. If you couldn't grow grapes you had to buy it from Italians and thus helping their economy. It that time beer became a lesser drink in the eyes of many. </p>
<p>As beer became a drink and not just for food its secrets were passed down through the monks. Which has also been stated several times in this thread. What I havent seen mentioned is the importance of Reinheitsgebot. In 1514 Bavaria passed a law stating that beer could only be malted grain (barley, oats, wheat, rye), hops, and water (later amended to include yeast).  This is significant because it was the first food law passed in the history of humanity. At the time people were trying to balance out the sweetness of beer with whatever they could find. It was called gruit  and it could include figs, dates, sticks, and even charcoal (again, not as refined as we know it today). Beer was important because it kept people alive, but some of the ingredients were killing people or making them sick. They decided on hops because, like the Counsel of Nicaea, they chose an available crop that was easy to grow in the area. Hops.</p>
<p>Hops became the standard for the bittering agent in beer because both Germany and England could grow them and it helped the local economy. </p>
<p>Beer also helped the Champagne region of France with exploding bottles. The Belgians have many styles of beer that have residual sugars still in them, much like champagne. The Belgians figured out that if you have a flat bottom bottle the residual sugar can continue to build up CO2. If it builds up enough over time, it'll explode. The Belgians put a divot in the bottle to break up the amount of concentrated sugar in one area and thus the bottles wouldn't explode.</p>
<p>Pasteur was looking at wine when he discovered yeast, but IIRC refrigeration was developed to cool wort quicker. I have to look that up though. </p>
<p>Beer took a big hit after prohibition in America. With the WWII soldiers coming home from Germany and developing a love for the taste of pilsners, and the rise of Bud and Miller, beer was thought as a one trick pony.  It wasn't until Carter passed a law in the 70's allowing for homebrewing that we see the start of the rise of craft beer in America. Styles that were dead became revitalized (i.e. IPA) and depth of the beverage really started to emerge.</p>
<p>Beer is incredibly important to us as a society. It helped form us and shape how we became. I can literally talk for hours on the subject. This is the cliffs notes version that I can pull from memory, I'd need to do more homework to get it down a bit more proper. But, until I can get paid for it, why the hell am I going to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, some real booze historians could give you more info (consider asking r/beer or r/wine), but to me there's two ways to take this.</p>
<p>1) Beer isn't the sole important alcohol in history, you're forgetting wine. Wine dates back thousands of years, and in the AD calendar the importance of wine can't be underestimated (especially considering the rise of Christianity). There are monastic orders that have made beer for centuries (Trappist, others), but to my understanding wine has been an essential part of Catholic/Christian ceremonies for a long, long time. Wine even did relatively well during prohibition in the US because of church usage. So, I would argue wine is equally important, if not more.</p>
<p>2) Include beer and wine, same question. My best guess would be that a lower alcohol percentage drink allows people to still be functional after consumption, where something like Brandy is going to make someone drunk, worthless, and a social outcast (you can't function when you're hammered, and especially in early cultures you had to be able to contribute to the group in some way).</p>
<p>Also, distilled liquor required, well, a still. Wine or beer (I think) can theoretically be made in any kind of clay pot or vessel. Then liquor has to taste good. You still can't drink too much of it if it's high proof. There's centuries old liqueurs and Brandy and grappa that fit the bill, but for the few historical successes there must be thousands others there were lost to time because they didn't do a good job tasting good, being easy to produce, and allowing people to be functional.</p>
<p>Just my best guess, I'm not great on the technical side of booze but I work in the restaurant industry and these conjectures are based on my limited understanding.  </p>
<p>Edit: One of the big things I missed is the ease of growing grain compared to fruit (worldwide). Also, the proof is less important than the actual ease of making wine/beer. </p>
<p>Some people are pointing out beer was safer to drink than water, but some people are disputing it. I don't my know, I'm not a German beer doctor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beer (and wine and mead) come first. All other alcoholic beverages are products of refining (properly &quot;distilling&quot;) the various beers into stronger mixtures.</p>
<p>So to make vodka, for instance, one makes a potato mash, then ferments that mash into potato beer, then uses heat and condensation to separate the alcohol from the water, concentrating the beer into a liquor.</p>
<p>So beer isn't &quot;more important&quot; as a comparison of equals, it's a predicate. So the invention of the wheel is more <em>significant</em> than the invention of the tire, because you have to make the wheel <em>first</em> and wrapping that wheel with padding makes it into a tire.</p>
<p>Without the predicate the follow-on technology never happens.</p>
<p>So without beer there are no other alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p>In general the historians talking about this subject are talking about the &quot;big three&quot; - beer, wine, and mead - when they talk about the discovery of beer. Since wine needs specifically grapes, and mead needs the domestication of honey, while beer can be made from any grain or sugar in general, it's something of an understood generalization.</p>
<p>There is far more beer-making land throughout the cradles of civilization than there is wine or mead producing land.</p>
<p>So the beer is though to come before the domestication of bees for mead, the domestication of the grape for wine, the domestication and enrichment of fruit trees for cider.</p>
<p>So the various grain beers was likely first and foremost, and certainly lead to the invention of the other alcohols.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that it also lead to the domestication of yeasts and so the baking of leavened bread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food Scientist here. One of the fundamental importances of beer is the fact that it was the only safe form of drinking water for many people. As old towns grew, the water supply became more contaminated and disease was quite prevalent. The water supplies were full of bacteria.</p>
<p>Now, bacteria don't thrive in alcoholic solutions, even low alcohol, and so by fermenting the water, it was effectively disinfecting it for drinking. Why beer though, and not other drinks?</p>
<p>Grains are very prevalent and have been for millennia, they offer nutrition which carries through to the beer and when malted, are easily fermentable. </p>
<p>Originally the beer was spiced and flavoured with all sorts of plants to make gruit. The switch to using hops was because of the superior flavour, and more importantly, the antibacterial properties of hops which further improved the benefit of drinking beer over lake or river water.</p>
<p>EDIT: I hurriedly wrote this out and missed an essential part, which is the boil, which kills a lot of the bacteria. Much of the rest of the brewing and fermentation makes it harder for bacteria to grow. Just because not all bacteria will die in beer, does not mean it is just as unsafe as some water sources in the past.</p>
<p>Many breweries formed because of the increase in populations and industrialisation when the water was at it's worst (last few hundred years)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it goes hand in hand with the rise of agriculture!</p>
<p>Beer and bread were invented simultaneously in ancient Sumeria. as they involve the same basic ingredients - ground wheat and yeast. Yeast would have been airborne to start with, and both processes would likely have involved soaking the kernels to soften them. You could make bread from the solid bits, and the liquid bits would have been beer. It's an ancient drink. </p>
<p>In the Americas, the Wari went through a similar process with corn. Agriculture spread quickly across ancient Peru, because the Wari realized that by growing slightly more corn than you needed to live, you could brew it into a fantastic party drink. Their empire spread based on this teaching, they built huge stone terraces and had dance festivals, and worshiped gods of drink. The drinking cup was sacred. It was basically corn beer, and is still popular to this day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
