We'll cover everything from ways to protect from tick bites to first aid steps to take if one bites you. AMA! </p>
<p>Hi Reddit, we are John Aucott, and Mark Soloski and we are researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine studying ticks and Lyme disease. Ever wonder why Lyme disease and other tick-borne infections have become so common? What makes some people get sicker than others? And how can we prevent and diagnose Lyme disease - that the classic bull's eye target is not as common as people think? We cover everything from fundamental research to clinical treatments - AUA!</p>
<p>We will begin answering questions at 12pET (17 UT). Ask us anything!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, thanks for doing this! My question is: one summer backpacking in southern Ohio, I encountered a form of tick I had never seen. A local called them &quot;seed ticks&quot; and suggested they were actually just juvenile ticks. They were less than half a millimeter across and hung out in clusters of ZILLIONS. At some point, I must have brushed past one of these patches. I was brushing them off of me for two days before I knew what they were. Then one of them crawled across the screen on my phone, and I saw its teardrop body and forward-swept legs... I ended up having several bites on my ankles and had to &quot;excavate&quot; kind of aggressively to get the little bastards out. </p>
<p>My main question is: do these &quot;seed ticks&quot; carry Lyme? The internet seems conflicted.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm very interested in anything you have to say about seed ticks. I had somehow never heard of them and most information I can find is a just a testimony or an anecdote like mine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
