		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear, are you asking if a laser beam can block off part of another beam of light, creating a shadow in the process? If so, the answer is no. Or to be more exact, the answer is: not to any measurable degree. So let's say you have a room under vacuum, where there is a lamp on the ceiling and you are flying a laser beam above the ground. If you are looking at the ground, you will have no real way of knowing that there was a laser beam above it, in the same way you could if you had a solid object in the same place.</p>
<p>The reason why no shadow forms in the example above is that in most cases two light beams will fly through each other without affecting each other at all. To put it more technically, if you cross two photon beams, then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-photon_physics" target="_blank">photon-photon scattering cross-section</a> (the probability that two photons will come together and do <em>something</em>) is very, <em>very</em> low. It's only when you go to high energies and high beam intensities that you have to seriously start worrying about doing any measurable physics. For example, one such process is that two high energy photons can smash into each other creating a particle-antiparticle pair, in a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_production" target="_blank">pair production</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just wanted to address something it seems hasn't been mentioned: When you say a laser &quot;beam&quot;, keep in mind that a &quot;beam&quot; is only visible if that laser is going through something like dust. The dust lighting up is what creates the beam. Otherwise, a laser beam is no different from an intense flashlight. In that case, the dust itself could create a shadow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The laser beam itself is invisible in the first place. You can only see it if you look directly into it (don't do that, you will go blind) or if the laser beam is scattered by some particles (smoke, dust, steam or, under certain circumstances, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering" target="_blank">air molecules</a>) and bits of the scattered light hit your eyes which is what you see when you look at those fancy pictures of laser beams, like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Military_laser_experiment.jpg" target="_blank">this one</a>. </p>
<p>A shadow is cast when a beam of light hits an object and is absorbed by that object. The invisible laser beam can not cast a shadow as light waves/particles don't interact with each other (or the probability is very, very, very low) and if the laser beam is visible the scattering particles could eventually cast a shadow, but the particles hit by the laser wouldn't absorb more light than the rest of the particles, which would be the requirement for a shadow. So, under none of these circumstances would a laser beam cast a shadow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only way a shadow is cast is if something interacts with the incoming photon and sends it off in a different direction. Light does not interact with light in such a way that it changes direction, so the answer is no.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Laser beam does not cast a shadow under most conditions. </p>
<p>There are two cases where laser beams interact. If one is traversing a nonlinear crystal and the two beams have the right angles and colors, then they can interact in the crystal. </p>
<p>Also, in principle two laser beams can interact in free space but only at very very high energies. This is being studied in the Large Hadron Collider. So a beam of gamma rays might be said to cause something like a shadow when illuminated by a second beam of gamma rays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
