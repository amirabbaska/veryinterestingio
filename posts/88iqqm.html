		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Movie theaters and studios have a revenue share deal.  That is the studio gets a portion of the ticket sales, and the movie theater gets a portion ticket sales.  It starts by favoring the studio. For example, week 1 it may be 90/10 (90% to the studio, 10% to the theater).  Week 2, may be 80/20, and so on.   </p>
<p>The theaters get all the money from concessions though, where their margin is much bigger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do movie theaters send them a check every month or something?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not an individual theater, but the company that owns a theater (and most theaters are owned by giant companies with 100s+ of theaters) will add up all they owe each studio at the end of the month and send them a check or wire transfer. </p>
<p>So for all the example here. Regal Theaters (who own 500 theaters) finance department at their HQ in Tennessee will add up all their ticket sales for the month, figure out how much share goes to the studios, and cut them a check.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would add 2 points about the revenue share deal that WeDriftEternal talks about:</p>
<p>1) This is why it's really easy to slip into another theater and watch a second movie without paying for it. Theaters don't actually care that much about losing that ticket revenue, since most of it goes to the studio anyway. Which is why they don't really enforce people from skipping around. Indeed, they're likely to make <em>more</em> money because since you're in the theater for another 2 hours (and you just saved the cost of a ticket), you're more likely to buy some popcorn or coke, which is far more profitable for them than another ticket.</p>
<p>2) Cheating is actually a fairly big issue. That is, theaters undercounting tickets and not forwarding the proper amount of revenue. In deals between large studios and large movie chains, this isn't a big problem because large movie studios have entire enforcement divisions that look at the numbers and do their own audits to make sure they're getting the right amounts. Also, a movie chain knows that if it cheats a large studio that releases a big movie every month, they know that the studio can simply choose not to release their big movies with that theater anymore, thus losing them a ton of business. So among the big players cheating isn't a big deal.</p>
<p>But if you're a small indie producer struggling to get theater distribution, it's not infrequent that you get cheated on the ticket sales; the theaters don't really care about losing your business (many times, you're lucky just to get any type of deal with them), and they know you have no way of actually knowing how many tickets were really sold.</p>
<p>It's also a <em>huge</em> problem overseas. While domestic studios and theater chains have pretty good relationships, imagine trying to monitor a bunch of screens in some foreign country and dealing with their country's legal system if you find out they're cheating you. It's such a big deal, in fact, that most studios don't contract directly with foreign theaters. They rather find a foreign distributor who agrees to pay them an outright fee or some other payment structure. In exchange, that distributor gets the right to &quot;distribute&quot; that film to the local theaters, and collect whatever revenue that might generate. The studio then doesn't have to worry about arranging deals with individual theaters in 50 different countries.</p>
<p>While this can be a pretty good deal for foreign distributors (some of them are pretty large companies themselves), it's actually also a good deal for studios: when a big movie is coming (say the next Transformers movie) that everyone wants a piece of, they can pre-sell the foreign rights to the movie before the movie is even made. They can then use these pre-sales to finance making the movie, thus offloading a bunch of the financial risk before the first camera ever rolls. So for example, when you see that a movie made $100 million in China, oftentimes, the studio will never see any of that money. Instead, they were probably paid $20-$50mil before the movie was ever made by a foreign distributor, who then distributes it to local theaters and collects the ticket revenue himself.</p>
<p>Final fun fact: this may seem incredibly complicated, and maybe you're asking why can't studios just own the theaters themselves? They used to, until the Supreme Court found them to be violating antitrust regulations in the 1940s and forced the studios to sell of their theaters. Check out US v. Paramount: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Paramount_Pictures,_Inc" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Paramount_Pictures,_Inc</a>.
That decision totally reshaped the movie industry, killed the classic studio system, and allowed for the rise of independent films.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Managed an independent cinema for some time, ticket sales are sent to the studio rep each week and paid by bank transfer. How well you do and your relationship with the rep defines how likely you are to continue getting release date movies. You also have to match minimum scheduling criteria. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
