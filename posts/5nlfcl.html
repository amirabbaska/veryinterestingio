		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question, but it's also really tough to answer because any in-depth explanation very quickly ascends to levels of terminology that sound like technobabble. The simplest answer is that the math requires the extra dimensions to explain the interaction of the quantum (subatomic) world with the macro (atoms, molecules and larger) world, to model them and the underlying rules they follow. This is obviously the least satisfying, because it's like a parent saying &quot;because I said so&quot;.</p>
<p>To back up a bit, it's important to redefine the term dimension. We think of dimensions as basically &quot;something you can measure&quot; - length, width, height. In physics terms, they kinda are that, but kinda not. It's easier to think of them as ways of defining a specific parameter or quality of an object. Our main three dimensions define an object's size, which is easy to make sense of. It can also be a way of defining how an object moves through space. With String Theory, you're trying to explain the movement of and interactions with subatomic particles, some of which are very strange. All of these extra dimensions are not physical ones, but are said to be 'wrapped up at the subatomic level', which I think of as meaning they can't be measured with a ruler because they don't define a given space. They're not defining a physical thing, the way length, width and height do. What they do is allow subatomic particles to behave the way they do - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling" target="_blank">tunnel through barriers they 'shouldn't' be able to</a>, or the good ol' thing where they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality" target="_blank">act like waves and particles at the same time</a>.</p>
<p>Really, rather than &quot;allow&quot; we should say &quot;explain why&quot;, but then &quot;dimensions&quot; is probably one of the most confusing terms they could have chosen for what was being described, because it relies on a definition of the term is that isn't the way most people think about it.** If a subatomic particle tunnels through a barrier that it shouldn't be able to, but you recognize that there is an additional parameter that applies to both the particle and the barrier - say, they only exist 99.999999% of the time in our universe, but pop out to a higher plane of existence than the physical (for the record, this is an extreme example made to illustrate the point, not what particles necessarily do), then you can say they have a measure of 99.999999 in the 'existence' dimension (again, made up for the explanation). If you combine these two numbers, you get the one-in-a-trillion chance of a particle 'tunneling' through the barrier.</p>
<p>It's also necessary to point out that ten dimensions is just the number that the kaluza-Klein Theory suggested (initially five, later ten). I've seen theories that extend to thirty dimensions.</p>
<p>For the record, I don't believe that String Theory is what it purports to be. I am only a failed physicist, and the people who are working on it are <em>far</em> smarter than I am, so if there is an empirical right and wrong on the issue, you'd be better off betting on them to be right. I come to explain String Theory, not defend it. String Theory fails to simplify the discussion, though, which is what the entire search for the Grand Unified Theory is supposed to be. Ultimately, the answer to the Universe - if we can ever discover it - will never be something you can adequately ELI5. I don't think it will rely on purely mathematical constructs for its explanation, and I think it is the purest of hubris to think that we can go from discovering atoms and nuclear forces to unlocking their underlying principles in (on the scale of the universe) a fraction of a blink of an eye.</p>
<hr />
<p>**Kinda like a scientific theory and a 'real world' theory - same underlying concept defining both terms, but they become very different things within their specific contexts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One very short and unsatisfying ELI5 answer is that if the number of dimensions is anything else, then certain undesirable infinities show up in the theory. Therefore the assumption of extra dimensions is made in order to avoid these bad things from happening. (The harder ELI5 is to explain why this assumption of extra dimensions is much more reasonable than a layperson would assume.)</p>
<p>By the way, just to clarify a point: The number of dimensions depends on certain specifics of the theory. Bosonic string theory requires 26, superstring theory requires 10, and M-theory requires 11. Superstring theory is what most people mean when they simply refer to &quot;string theory,&quot; since bosonic string theory is not realistic. However, superstring theory comes in various flavors, all of which are unified in some sense by M-theory. When we say that superstring theory has 10 dimenions, we mean 1 time dimension and 9 space dimensions, 3 of which are the ones we perceive and 6 of which are tiny, &quot;compactified&quot; spatial dimensions.</p>
<p>Important caveat: I am not even remotely a string theorist. </p>
<p>Edit: Maybe &quot;undesirable infinities&quot; is not the right phrase to use (though I suppose one can probably get away with calling it that). It's more like you need a particular undesirable term that shows up to be zero in order to have the required symmetry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not a physicist, but I once asked a physicist to explain to me this very thing. Below is a reformulation of what he told me:</p>
<p>What does it mean that there are more than 3 spatial dimensions, and what does it mean that they are &quot;curled up very small&quot;?</p>
<p>Imagine you're a billiard ball, living on the surface of table where the cover is on. Above you, just barely touching you, is the bottom of the cover. Below you is the felt. You and I know your world is 3D, but you perceive it as 2D, forward/backward and left/right. You and I know that the felt is not evenly compressible, so when a billiard rolls over it in a straight line, the balls moves ever so slightly up and down. This up and down motion though, is too small for you in billiard-ball-world to observe. You don't ever think about this though, because your 2D physics completely explains all interactions between other billiard balls that you observe.</p>
<p>Now let's take it one step further. Imagine you're a billiard ball physicist. Just as before, your 2D physics completely explains all the interactions between billiard balls you observe. Your &quot;bouncing-off-bumpers&quot; theories explain how balls change angle and slow down when they hit a bumper, and your &quot;just-slowing-down&quot; theories explain how balls are always slowing down a little bit, even when they don't hit a bumper. You can very accurately predict where a ball will go by putting these two theories together. Many of your billiard ball colleagues are unsatisfied with this situation though. Both of these theories involve billiard balls slowing down, but the theories themselves are separate. One day, a billiard ball physicist colleague comes to you with a crazy idea. This colleague says that they can unify the two theories of billiard ball movement if you imagine that a ball slowing down results from that ball losing energy to the surface that it's directing a force against. However, this unified theory requires that there is a force pressing balls <em>down</em> against the felt. Down is not a direction that exists! The theory only works if there is a <em>third dimension</em>.</p>
<p>You and I know your world is 3D and has the dimension up and down, but you, as a billiard ball physicist, cannot perceive this dimension. The hypothetical existence of this dimension though, allows for a theory of billiard ball physics that is simpler, more general, more elegant, and thus more appealing than the two separated theories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very few &quot;like you're 5&quot; answers available on this topic. I'll take my best swing.</p>
<p>forget what you know about dimensions and think of a video game being played by a kid holding a controller. </p>
<p>The character in the video game can move in all of the spatial dimensions it exists in, like us. Forward, back, side to side, up and down.</p>
<p>So the kid finds a menu option called &quot;timeline&quot; and presses it. Now the kid sees a panorama of events that his character has experienced throughout the game. The difference between the player and the character is that the character has to experience the whole timeline event by event, while the player can see the timeline as a single object.</p>
<p>Now you've moved up a dimension. We've collapsed direction, position, and time into an object that you can hold in your hands and manipulate. If you were able to hold a timeline in your hands like an object, you could change it and affect it like any other object you can interact with. </p>
<p>Being able to interact with an entire 3 dimensional timeline as if it were an object would make the kid playing the game 4 dimensional. </p>
<p>It gets weird when you start to consider that the entire environment that the kid playing the game exists in, must also be made up of existential versions of the ideas of existence similarly to how the character's three dimensional lifespan is simply an object in a fourth dimension.</p>
<p>It is much easier to explain a timeline as a chain of events rather than to try and tell someone that every event in their life exists as a single object in a higher dimension. </p>
<p>This is where math comes in. Mathematics and moreover physics deal with the footprints of these intangible creatures rather than the beasts themselves. And with our current understandings in mathematics, we see footprints which actually call for up to 11 dimensions. (including m-theory, there are 7, 10, or 11 expected dimensions). So it isn't so much that we've seen these 10-dimensional beasts making the footprints, it's more that we've seen footprints that must have been made by a 10-dimensional beast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mathematically, it has to do with group theory, more specifically representation theory of Lie groups. These things are tough to explain to someone without a background in these things, so I'll keep this short and not super precise:</p>
<p>Symmetries are of fundamental relevance in physics for numbers of reasons. This goes so far that you can basically define a symmetry and some other stuff and determine all the physics of the system from that. Large parts of the standard model of particle physics were found this way. Mathemetically, these symmetries are expressed in groups.</p>
<p>Now if we want to create a new, more general theory from our old ones it needs to reproduce all the symmetries the old theory has. So mathematically we are looking for dimensions where there are relatively simple (read: small) symmetry groups that contain all the symmetries we know. It so happens that 10 is the smallest dimension where there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#Terminology_in_physics" target="_blank">Majorana-Weyl spinor</a> which is a good candidate for a number of reasons. Most common string theories use this or related symmetry transformations.</p>
<p>String theories are then sort of constructed such that they have the imposed symmetry. So you start with 10 dimensions because your symmetries are nice there, and build the string theory around it - not the other way round.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
