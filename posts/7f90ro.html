		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons boiling water works to kill pathogens is the denarurarion of protein, and the disruption of phospholipid bilayers with increasing temperature. These elements of physical biochemistry are linked to temperature, not the evaporation of the water.</p>
<p>This means that as you enter a lower pressure environment, boiling will be less effective. However, both of these processes start at comparatively low temperatures (~45Â°C, which is why slow cooking works), and depend on the pathogen in question.</p>
<p>To extend the concept, some places (including hospitals) use high temperature and pressure steam to sterilize equipment for surgical use (the devices used for this are called autoclaves).</p>
<p><em>tl:dr</em> ability to remove pathogen is bases in temperature, so boiling at lower pressure will work less well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not the boiling that kills pathogens. It's the heat. Water boiling at a lower pressure doesn't mean it's going to be hot enough to kill the pathogens.</p>
<p>When you're camping and you need to boil water, you don't even need to boil it that long. A lot of people will boil for 10 minutes. The reality is that once it's boiling, those pathogens are already dead. Go to a higher elevation, you may need to test the actual heat of the water, however.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily.  Pathogens are conventionally and reliably killed by exposure to a specific temperature for a duration that has been extensively tested.</p>
<p>Boiling water is just a convenient way to keep it at consistent high temp.  That boiling temp at a given air pressure may be enough for some pathogens, but not for others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you're trying to kill.  170F is considered to be good enough for poultry and other inherently contaminated foods.  170F is the boiling point at about 21,000 ft, or 40% of sea level pressure.  By the time you summit Everest, water is boiling at 158, which is still pretty darned hot...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shipboard water generation systems evaporate water at ~150-160 degF due to their operation in a vacuum chamber. Due to the low temps involved, further treatment is required to sterilize the water. Used to be done with bromine, but most modern systems use a UV lamp to treat the water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
