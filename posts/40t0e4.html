		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By sheer statistical probability, yeah. </p>
<p>There are organisms like naked mole rats that have numerous barriers to tumor development that enable them to resist cancer so well that we've never documented it in the species. However, <em>eventually</em> we would expect there to be mutations in enough of the genes that prevent tumor formation for one to form. DNA replication and DNA maintenance can't be 100% perfect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has numerous ways of detecting malfunctioning cells and destroying them before they become significant. Your cells themselves even have ways to detect when they are malfunctioning and signal to your immune system to come kill it. Your cells will mostly kill themselves when they detect an uncorrectable malfunction. Most fatal cancers are where these systems fail and not where the cell has malfunctioned. Cells developing problems are a everyday event, your body failing to deal with it is not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something I haven't seen addressed here yet: Cell mutations go wrong all the time and don't develop into cancer.  Your cells mostly terminate themselves when they go wrong, cancer requires both that they go wrong in function <em>and</em> that they go wrong in their termination process.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and essentially all statements demonstrating counter-examples have been debunked (e.g. for a long time we'd say &quot;sharks don't get cancer&quot;).</p>
<p>Further, for your statement to be true, you'd have to mean &quot;live long enough, including to ages that are not realistic for certain animals&quot;.  E.G. a mosquito doesn't live long enough to develop cancer and there is no way a mosquito is going to given the way death is programmed into their existence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much, yes.  That is why we focus on cancer so much more than civilizations in the past did (and yes they had encountered and recognized some types of cancer).  Life expectancy is so long for people a lot of health issues come up that weren't nearly as common before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
