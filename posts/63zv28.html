<p>Edit:
On second thought, maybe you are describing a gasp? Like when you drink a lot at once and you take a big breath after because you lack air? Maybe that's what you're talking about. It's likely that you make that sound not necessarily because the drink is refreshing, but finding it refreshing causes you to drink a lot at once, thus holding your breath for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Edit:
Third thought, calling it a gasp is incorrect actually. It's an exhale. The gasp comes after that.</p>
<p>Fourth thought, testing it now. I seem to exhale after every gulp I take. The longer I drink, the more exhale that follows. So I believe that's what the explanation is. When the drink is refreshing, you drink more/longer, meaning your exhale will be bigger. But you can exhale without saying &quot;Ah&quot;. Gyms and marathons aren't filled with people constantly going &quot;Ah&quot;. Adding vocals to it is purely theatrics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You're trying to taste more of that refreshing drink while at the same time slowly building up CO2.  When you stop drinking, you gentle exhale (possibly in the form of an audible &quot;ahh&quot;) to get rid of the CO2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Coca-Cola even coined their own marketed term for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The AHH Effect” is that multidimensional feeling of happiness, satisfaction and delicious refreshment one experiences after drinking an ice-cold Coke. It’s been described as the sound a smile would make if smiles made sounds, and it’s the centerpiece of a new teen-focused program from Coca-Cola. Bringing to life 61 dimensions of ‘AHH’ through a range of digital experiences, from games and films to GIFs, the program showcases all of the qualities of Coke and positions the beverage as the ultimate refresher.”</p>
