		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different types of asteroids, made of different things. Ones that most closely resemble Earth's composition in terms of the elements that go into them are the carbonaceous asteroids, but not necessarily in the same molecular configurations you'd find on Earth. The rocks formed on Earth can be made by very different processes, through compression of sedimentary layers as an example. Stony meteorites do resemble igneous rocks like basalt, though. Other asteroids are made mostly of iron instead, and don't much resemble things you'd find on Earth's surface - perhaps further down towards or in Earth's core things are similar, though - while others still are a mixture of iron and silicates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, that's one of the reasons why meteorites can be identified easily, and how we discovered Martian meteorites. Asteroidal material has give through different processes than most Earth rocks. For some, chondrites, they've gone through very little processing. Existing as fused together masses of tiny grains of primitive material. Interestingly, these types of rocks have a mixture of elements in them consistent with the average of elements in rocky planets, containing a lot more iron, gold, iridium, etc. than ordinary crustal rocks on Earth.</p>
<p>Asteroids do contain processed materials, but the processes are different than on Earth. As asteroids and other &quot;planetesimals&quot; accreted during the early Solar System some got large enough to hold onto enough heat to melt, and differentiate into metal cores and stony crusts. These objects were subjected to later collisions which shattered them into smaller asteroids, leading to individual metallic and stony asteroids. The stony asteroids tend to be more &quot;primitive&quot; types of silicate rock than you'd find on Earth, however.</p>
<p>Most rocks in the asteroid belt are chondrites, about 3/4 of them. About a sixth of the rocks are stony asteroids, which are the closest to Earth rocks but only as distant cousins, and the rest are metallic or other varieties.</p>
<p>Also, some Earth rocks undoubtedly do exist in space, and we will one day run across them as meteorites on the moon or Mars, but they are comparatively rare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
