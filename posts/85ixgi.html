		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clotting, or thrombosis, is thought to occur as a result of a number of factors, most easily summarized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virchow%27s_triad" target="_blank">Virchow's Triad</a>. It explains that three things primarily contribute to clotting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stasis of blood flow</strong>. The blood in a normal human body is constantly moving, pushed along primarily by the heart's pumping force. When blood stops moving, as occurs after one dies or when blood is drawn at the doctor's office, it clots quickly. The only reason you don't see your blood clot in the little tubes at the doctor's office is that the tubes contain substances that help prevent clotting, which leads us to the next factor involved in Virchow's triad...</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Hypercoagulability</strong>. This refers to changes in the components of blood that pre-dispose to or against clotting. Your blood is filled with proteins that promote the clotting of blood. They are kept in check by proteins that prevent clotting. Under normal circumstances, they balance each other out and no clots form. When a clot is necessary, as in a cut, the clotting factors win out and produce a clot. Some people are predisposed to having increased clotting. They may have a genetic disorder that results in higher amounts of the clotting factors or they may do something that causes their blood to clot more easily, such as smoking cigarettes. This would mean that the person is hypercoagulable.</li>
<li><strong>Endothelial Injury</strong>. &quot;Endothelial&quot; refers to the type of cells that line our blood vessels - endothelial cells. When these cells are injured, they release proteins that help promote clotting. Earlier I mentioned that a cut is one instance when a clot is necessary. Endothelial injury is one method by which the body identifies where a clot is necessary. When you get a cut, there will be damage to the vessels in that area of the body, resulting in endothelial injury. Those endothelial cells release proteins that promote clotting, and, voila -- clot.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason clots don't randomly form in our body under normal circumstances is that these three things don't occur. Now think about the people that do get dangerous blood clots. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>People in the Hospital: These people spend days in bed, which can result in blood stasis. They may also have had a surgical procedure resulting in large amounts of endothelial injury. Furthermore, they are getting stuck with needles for blood draws and IVs, which can also result in endothelial injury.</li>
<li>Irregular Heart Rhythms (i.e. Atrial Fibrillation): These irregular heart rhythms cause dysfunction in the pumping of blood. As a result, blood does not move through the heart quite as well as it should, resulting in blood stasis in the heart. This is why atrial fibrillation is such a common cause of strokes -- blood clots in the heart and then the clot is pumped out eventually directly to the brain. This is why so many patients with atrial fibrillation are put on anti-clotting medications like warfarin.</li>
<li>Clotting Disorders: These people are extremely hypercoagulable and, therefore, are much more likely to develop clots.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your blood doesn't clot due to the presence of anticoagulant such as Protein S, Protein C, Antithrombin lll etc and in case of any injury you definitely don't want to bleed out, so you do need blood coagulant such as fibrinogen ( produced in liver hepatocytes ) to respond immediately and clot your blood and prevent bleeding. Therefore, you need a balance of both .</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does clot inside your body, hence deep vein thrombosis, stroke, atherosclerosis etc. injury or blood stagnation inside the arteries or veins results in clots, which are generally dealt with by the body - but some are too large and cause all sorts of issues. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s an amazing system where a molecule called tissue factor (TF) is one of the most powerful blood clotters: one molecule of TF can make thousands of fibrin molecules from its precursor fibrinogen in milliseconds, and fibrin is the main component of blood clots. Soooo, the inside or “media” of every artery is loaded with TF. The second you cut an artery and the blood flows over the TF, the blood starts clotting so you don’t bleed to death. You have enough TF in your body to kill you (death by clotting) many times over, but wouldn’t it be dangerous to have all that TF around? Well first it’s not touching your blood (it’s in the middle later of the arteries) and there is a TF inactivator lining the arteries called Tissue Factor Pathway inhibitor  (TFPI) on the inner lining of the arteries that touches the blood. So the clotting system is like a hand grenade: the super clotty TF is physically separated from the blood until you get injured, and TFPI sits close to the TF to make sure it doesn’t activate any clotting when it shouldn’t. Cool system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does, at sites of injury. This injury exposes collagen to the blood, which activates platelets to clump up. Essentially while the platelets are in your blood, it is the exposure of your blood to locations where blood isn't supposed to be (i.e. outside the blood vessels), which activates the clotting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
