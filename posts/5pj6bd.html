		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Symptoms of the flu are actually often caused by your body trying to rid itself of the virus; high fever is a way to try and kill the virus by essentially cooking it, but in the process destroys a lot of your own cells, which can make you feel tired and shitty.
Increased mucus production is a way to try and expel the virus from your system by trapping it, then sneezing or coughing it out. Tiredness can also be a result of energy being funnelled into your immune system to try and combat the virus.
The virus affects you by invading your cells, reprogramming them to create more viruses, then lysing (exploding) them, which can result in overall reduced physiological function.
Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are also a bodily response to try and expel the virus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>for almost any disease, most symptoms will be a result of your immune system activating, and the cytokines produced from that activation- fever, aches, fatigue, etc. </p>
<p>these symptoms are grouped as &quot;flu like symptoms&quot;, and are very common and somewhat useless to diagnose anything without other symptoms- you might have a mild stomach virus, a cold, or something far worse. </p>
<p>other symptoms depend on what cells are being attacked. </p>
<p>respiratory attacks present coughing, excessive mucus production in the nose or lungs, sneezing, and the like. flu, cold, pneumonia, etc.</p>
<p>gastrointestinal attacks result in vomiting, diarrhea. &quot;mild stomach virus&quot;, cholera, etc. </p>
<p>lymph node swelling can occur for two reasons- normal immune response and increased fluid movement in that system, or the virus attacking the nodes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By my understanding, if it's a &quot;regular&quot; flu that you recover from relatively quickly, basically every symptom is due to your body's immune response. Except in more extreme cases, the damage actually done by the viruses is pretty negligible to your body as a functional unit.</p>
<p>EDIT: Should say though, I study biochemistry, which it pretty far removed from any practical clinical experience, so anyone with that feel free to overrule me!</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Actually though, as an extension to OP's question.. appetite? What is the biological reason to lose your appetite when you're ill? Do you not want to dedicate resources to the gut rather than the site of infection. Or to avoid eating more food that may contain pathogens?</p>
<p>EDIT 3: Sorry, breaking thread rules, shouldn't speculate, the thought just suddenly struck me!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
