		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple species of tardigrade. Some are hermaphrodite, many are predominantly female. It appears that they are mostly solitary, with no real evidence of social behavior aside from mating. Many reproduce parthenogenically.</p>
<p>&quot;Normally the individuals do live separately. They crawl on the vegetable underground with no apparent relation to each other.
None of their movements can be interpretated as social recognizing or some kind of social interaction.
But from time to time this indifferent behaviour changes, in particular but not only when the females undergo a moulting process and when eggs are existing in the ovary.
Under those circumstances it was not rare to find a male close to a female. When the male was separated from the female for about the distance of a body length by means of a needle the male tried to come closer to the female again. The male crawled around the female in a circular pathway whereas the female didn't move much. Finally the male climbed on the back of the female and touched its head with its mouth. The partners remained in this position for some time. So we can suspect that the buccal gland might have functions that are not known yet...it must be assumed that mating was performed in this position.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These types of questions frustrate me in the best way. As soon as science realized tardigrades’ extremophile properties all of the basic research and ecological studies that come with studying a species were overlooked. It’s not as flashy to study tardigrades as a pioneer species as it is to be the guy who crack the code on their DNA. </p>
<p>For most other animals we would have detailed info to answer your question, especially for a creature found all over the planet, less so but still for the microscopic organisms as well.</p>
<p>From every study I’m aware of they don’t communicate or work together past mating (which can last hours). That’s also pretty useful for a pioneer species like tardigrades because they are independent. </p>
<p>I’m not an expert but have been involved in basic research and ecological studies on tardigrades recently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
