		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have been teaching high school for the past 12 years. Over my career, my particular school has been increasing the number of in school suspensions and decreasing out of school suspensions. While completing a masters in administration I asked the principal why this was. His reply was, out of school suspension in the past was a harsher punishment when it was more common to have 1 stay at home parent. Now students do not view out of school suspensions as the deterrent it once was because (especially common to the group of students) they don't like school and they are home alone.  Therefore schools recognized this and now make students complete in school suspensions. This consists of completing a full school day isolated from the student body at the school. If teachers wish to they may send work to the student to complete while serving their suspension.   In most cases (for example a substance abuse violation which is an automatic 10 day suspension at my school) the suspension is completed as a combination of in and out of school suspension. A previous post mentioned legal reasons associated with the school distancing its self from negative behavior seem accurate to me.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a teacher and something I haven't seen mentioned is that out of school suspensions are often used when someone's safety is at risk. At the schools I've taught at, that's the ONLY time they're used.</p>
<p>Out of my students who got suspended last year, it broke down to:
Drugs? In school suspension.<br />
Cutting class three days in a row? In school suspension<br />
Stealing from a teachers desk? In school suspension<br />
Jumping up and down on a teacher's car in order to damage it? In school suspension.<br />
Taking a swing at another student? Out of school suspension.<br />
Threatening to get a gun, shoot me, then blow up the entire school? Out of school suspension.  </p>
<p>When the student has engaged in physical violence with other students or is threatening to hurt someone, they are removed; not as a punishment, but because if they are on campus it is extremely likely that someone is going to get hurt. Students need time to cool down and teachers/admin need time to instate a plan to prevent to keep the student from once again fighting or whatever and to keep other students from retaliating.</p>
<p>It also just gives the teacher a break. My very first year teaching, I had one of my freshman threaten to kill me. This was after he took a swing at me and tried to come at me, only to be stopped by another teacher. He was quite serious about it and the school was in an urban environment with frequent gang activity in the neighborhoods my kids lived in.</p>
<p>There was no way I wanted to see that kid on campus for a very long time. I would not have been able to keep teaching if I had to see him every day, even if he was not in my classroom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Out of school suspension is sometimes used as a method to make the children's ill behavior the parents problem. If the child is of an age that they cannot stay at home alone, the parent then has to take off of work to stay with the child which makes the parent realize that there is a problem. I do not understand why they kick the high schoolers out of school though. It is not productive for the kid, but it is unfair to the other kids who have to sit in class with this kid. There is no reason that this kid that is acting up should be able to prohibit the good children from learning. If you sorta understand this I can go in more depth if you would like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>School suspension puts you behind in classes, separates you from your friends, and can potentially lead to being held back a year.  Not to mention you're probably in trouble with your parents, are grounded in some way, etc.</p>
<p>Getting out of school for a long period of time is enjoyable when your friends are also out of school, and when it's not impacting/delaying your education.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting to compare this to being sentenced to prison.  Although being suspended might seem like you get more freedom, the same principles apply:</p>
<p>1) Denunciation (declaring your actions were wrong) - the school is making a statement that your actions were wrong and unwanted in that environment by excluding you from the group temporarily.  </p>
<p>2) Deterrence (giving you a reason not to repeat your behaviour) - although it seems like you get more freedom, you are actually being denied the privilege of attending school and being part of that environment.  When you're in school, you can choose to leave.  When you're expelled, you can't choose to come back = less freedom. The school hopes this punishment will wake you up. </p>
<p>3) Separation from society (just like it sounds) - sometimes people are sent to prison because they need to be separated from society to ensure the safety of the members of society.  In the same way, some people get expelled from school to decrease their disruption on other students. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
