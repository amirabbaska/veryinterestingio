<p>Hi! me and some other grad students have been discussing this for the last half hour. It's likely due to some kind of colour constancy illusion, where some people are perceiving the context to be something like &quot;lit by blueish daylight&quot; and others are perceiving it to be something like &quot;under yellow department store lights.&quot; In the former case, your brain will try and get the objective (if such a thing can be said) colour by subtracting out the blue as a shadow, and in the latter case it will do the same thing for the filigree by subtracting out the yellow as a reflection. This is a common illusion in psych : <a href="http://www.echalk.co.uk/amusements/OpticalIllusions/colourPerception/colourPerception.html" target="_blank">See here</a>. but it's not seen that often 'in the wild,' even though your brain does this constantly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>my (expanded) comments from an earlier discussion:</p>
<p>pretty sure this is a [color constancy] (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_constancy" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_constancy</a>) effect, where the argument is actually about the <em>illuminant</em> (the color of the light shining on the dress). There must be ambiguous information in the image about what the illuminant was for the dress part of the scene.</p>
<p>If we assume a white illuminant, the dress looks blue and black (or some dark brownish color); if we assume a bluish illuminant, the dress looks white and gold: the white parts are just reflecting bluish light. Some viewers might be led into seeing the illuminant as bluish, despite the bright yellow/white background, because the dress seems to be in shade (maybe this is actually <em>because</em> of the background being bright?); outdoor shade on a clear sunny day is bluish (the sky is blue), so maybe we all have a strong &quot;shade is blue&quot; prior when it comes to solving color constancy problems (you'd think there would be an obvious reference for that idea.. I can't find anything..).</p>
<p>Other viewers might see the whole scene as illuminated with white light (like sunlight, or lamplight), maybe similar with the background source; in that case, the blue tint of the dress isn't because it's in the shade - it's because it's reflecting only short wavelengths out of the white light and absorbing the rest (i.e. it's blue).</p>
<p>The gold/black relationship also fits this story: gold wouldn't reflect much blue light, so gold color will appear dark brown (and be interpreted as gold). But under white light, gold should be bright and shiny - it isn't in this picture, so if the illuminant is white, the best interpretation of the brown spots is that they are a dark color (black or brown).</p>
<p>I'm not a professional color guy, though, this is all just logic and guesswork... The real question is why different viewers default to such different assumptions about the illuminant, and I don't have even a good hand-wavy answer for that...</p>
<p>(for the record, first thing I saw: white and gold. then I covered the surround with my hands and focused only on the dress texture, and started to see it as bluish with black/brown stripes. now I can switch back and forth, heh.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People's brains are trying to account for the effect of possible colored lighting. A quick test in Photoshop will demonstrate that the colors in the image are blue and golden-brown. However, people's brains are automatically trying to account for the presence of lighting.</p>
<p>But because we aren't there, we don't actually know how it's lit. Some people assume it's in shadow, and is therefore a cooled-down image of a white and gold dress, while others assume it's getting lots of yellow light, and is in reality a much darker shade.</p>
<p>Basically, no one knows what color the actual dress is except the person who saw it in person. But that goddamn image is blue and gold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
