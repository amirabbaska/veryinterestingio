		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While hormone levels and the physical strain of giving birth are factors in postnatal depression, these aren't the only factors.</p>
<p>Father may also suffer <a href="https://www.nct.org.uk/parenting/postnatal-depression-dads" target="_blank">postnatal depression</a> despite not giving birth themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generally, depression is triggered by emotional and stressful events and having a baby can be an unsettling and challenging experience. The increased pressures of fatherhood, more financial responsibility, changes in relationships and lifestyle, combined with a lack of sleep and an increased workload at home, may all affect a new dadâ€™s mental wellbeing. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also applies to women who have their babies through a surrogate mother.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've not looked for any studies on this, but my OB when I had my first two kids was strongly of the opinion that postnatal depression was largely to do with sleep deprivation. If this is the case, fathers and non-birthing mothers could also suffer if they lose a lot of sleep caring for the baby. Certainly hormones and major life change can be factors in postnatal depression just as they can be in any other depressive episode.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is just a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3433270/" target="_blank">cross-sectional study</a> but it looked at postpartum depression for postpartum and adoptive mothers.</p>
<p>What they found was that depressive moods found in postpartum and adoptive mothers were comparable however adoptive mothers reported having less symptoms of anxiety and better well-being. There is research suggesting that giving birth may increase risk for anxiety due to the changes the woman experiences biologically and physically as well as any complications during birth- which is a stressful event and perhaps that's why adoptive mothers may not experience as many symptoms of anxiety. Also what should be noted is that adoptive women (at least in this particular study) were older, had a higher level of education, higher income. They don't talk about it, but that may contribute to why they report having better well-being.</p>
<p>So, there is a possibility that a mother having a child via surrogate may experience a postpartum-like depression but she may not feel as anxious as a postpartum mother. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think that PPD combination of factors such as fluctuating hormones, being isolated, (stuck at home caring for a kid 24/7)lack of sleep and maybe the realization that life has changed tremendously. I feel that therefore, even if a woman didn't carry her child, she still may be apt to suffer from PPD, especially if she is prone to depression in the first place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The diagnosis of postpartum depression is fairly vague, but is mostly focused on the birth mother, and the hormone changes are thought to play a major role. That being said, the definition is extremely broad, with more than half of cases starting prior to delivery (and often what is eventually diagnosed as postpartum depression may even predate the pregnancy--psych/DSM-5 diagnoses can be very broad). This somewhat turns the diagnosis of PP depression into a catch-all term for multiple diagnoses that all happen to overlap in timing with relation to delivery. So a &quot;true&quot; PP depression related to hormonal changes would be confined to the birth mother, but like any other extremely stressful, life-altering event, depression can occur in anyone associated with the process, including other parents, siblings, etc. At that point, though, it doesn't matter whether you term it depression or PP depression, it's still a depression that needs to be managed (until and unless we start better understanding those hormonal changes and can develop a targeted therapy for them).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
