<p>&quot;Once exposed, nausea and vomiting will begin almost immediately, and within a short space of time your tongue and eyes will swell, followed by the rest of your body. You’ll feel weakened, as if the strength has been drained from you. If you’ve received a high dose of direct exposure - as in this scenario - your skin will blanche dark red within moments, a phenomenon often called nuclear sunburn. An hour or two after exposure, you’ll gain a pounding headache, a fever and diarrhoea, after which you’ll go into shock and pass out.</p>
<p>After this initial bout of symptoms, <strong>there’s often a latent period during which you’ll start to feel like you’re recovering</strong>. The nausea will recede, along with some swelling, though other symptoms will remain. This latent period varies in duration from case to case, and of course it depends on the dose, but it can last a few days. It’s cruel because it gives you hope, only to then get much, much worse. The vomiting and diarrhoea will return, along with delirium. An unstoppable, excruciating pain seethes through your body, from the skin down to your bones, and you’ll bleed from your nose, mouth and rectum. Your hair will fall out; your skin will tear easily, crack and blister, and then slowly turn black.&quot;</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's the immediate damage like (edit: FIRE) burn which physically damages your body.     The body heals that just like a regular burn. </p>
<p>But the bigger problem of radiation is that it scrambles the DNA of your cells.  This isn't so big of a problem until your cells get old and try to divide and make their replacement, and it finds out that the code to do so is all messed up.  </p>
<p>Your red blood cells only live ~4 months. (Technical edit#2) and they don't care because they're mindless automatons with no DNA to scramble.  But the bone marrow where they get made go from scientists to igors cranking out poorly made franken-blood. And that's real bad. So 2 months go by and half your blood is this new batch of not quite right cells.  A percentage at least, it's not like you completely stop making viable new blood.   Your brain cells are in it for the long-haul though, so that's more ok with radiation. </p>
<p>Skin cells live only 2-3 weeks. If the replacement cells are messed up, and every other cell is this mindless idiot that doesn't know how to skin then the bodily janitors who have the job of killing off and hauling them away get overloaded. There's too many corpses and the piles of them start rotting.   That's the black part. </p>
<p>Come on skin. I need you. Please don't forget how to skin. You're my biggest organ and you're critical for hugs and keeping my insides in. </p>
<p>(edit: sunburns are actually same sort of thing, just only on the surface layer of skin. That was about the worse example I could have picked)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radiation damage is basically completely random: it goes through your body and when it hits a molecule, it breaks it into pieces.</p>
<p>If that molecule was something not too important (e.g. part of a cell's outer hull) and the pieces are by themselves not dangerous, then nothing much happens, the cell just cleans away the the pieces.</p>
<p>If the molecule was important for the functioning of the cell, or the pieces are harmful, then the cell is damaged and has to repair itself (which means it can't work properly for a while). If it is damaged too badly, it dies and has to be replaced. If too many cells are damaged, you die very quickly, but if it's not too many (but more than a few) you just get sick, but you recover - the &quot;latent period&quot;.</p>
<p>However, the radiation also damages the DNA (a very large molecule), the &quot;blueprint&quot; which cells need to reproduce and be replaced (also to create stuff for their daily work, but I'll skip over that aspect to keep things simple).</p>
<p>So if there has been to much damage to DNA, then cell reproduction will fail sooner or later or the new cells won't work properly. Your body cannot replace cells and instead produces garbage. This happens first with cells that are replaced quickly, such as the ones lining your digestive tract and the ones that let your hair grow. Eventually you die.</p>
<p>This is delayed because even the cells that are replaced quickly live for a few days, so it takes at least that long for the damaged DNA to show the full effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>High doses of ionizing radiation are disruptive at the molecular level.</p>
<p>Your body is made up of cells.  These cells are regularly destroyed and regenerated for your entire life.  There are precise instructions (DNA) on how they're supposed to be regenerated.  Radiation poisoning basically scrambles these instructions.  So the cells stop regenerating or the regenerations are all messed up.</p>
<p><strong>These cells are regenerated at different rates.</strong>  Your GI tract contains cells that are among the faster regenerating ones.  Then your skin, hair, nails, blood, solid organs and bones (oversimplification, but you get the idea). There's a gap in the &quot;regeneration rates&quot; of your GI tract cells and the next-fastest regenerating cells.  This is where you start to better, then start to feel much worse after a few days when your next set of cells are supposed to be regenerated properly, but aren't. </p>
<p>This is basically how chemo and therapeutic radiation works for treating cancer, which is basically cells that replicate too quickly and don't destruct like they're supposed to. </p>
<p>Patients experience symptoms you could describe as moderate radiation poisoning; extreme nausea, severe swelling of the entire GI tract, excessively dry/papery/burned skin, hair loss, low to nonexistent blood counts, excessive bleeding, shortness of breath, low to no immunity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it's (hopefully) temporary and recoverable, in this case.  The radiation is administered at a high enough dose to kill the cancerous cells, but not so high that your healthy cells can't recover.       </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like some of these posters have said, part of the reason is the cycle of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial damage that doesn't kill cells outright causes them to perform poorly while they deal with crazy molecular debris</li>
<li>Once debris is cleared they return to normal functioning.</li>
<li>When it's time for those cells to be replaced later on, there are difficulties because the delicate network of signaling proteins that regulates this has been disrupted.</li>
<li>Those cells ramp up their functioning to try to compensate but ultimately begin to brake down.</li>
<li>Bad times.</li>
</ul>
<p>The human body is amazing at adapting to, and compensating for, some crazy shit. An example is Parkinson's disease, caused by loss of cells in the Substantia Nigra. You can lose up to 70% of those cells before symptoms manifest because the remaining ones can compensate for a lot of loss.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most cells in your body wear out and need to be replaced. To make this easy, the cells contain &quot;instructions&quot; (in the form of DNA) for building their own replacement. Two things happen during radiation poisoning: some cells &quot;break&quot;. This makes you feel sick, but your body has ways of cleaning up the broken bits of cells, so you start feeling better.  However, the radiation also scrambles the replacement instructions inside other still-working cells, so when those start wearing out, they can't get replaced correctly, so you get sick again.</p>
<p>Imagine that your teacher is making a new homework assignment, but spills some water on it. Initially, the paper might seem ruined: it's too wet to write on. She can &quot;fix&quot; it by drying it with a hairdryer or something, which makes it look more normal. However, the water also weakens the paper. Later, when she tries to copy it for each student, the paper is too weak and the original get shredded by the photocopier. Not being able to make copies of homework probably seems good to you, but it can be fatal if you need to make copies of the cells that make up your blood, help you digest your food, and things like that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
