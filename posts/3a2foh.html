<p>Since most of the historical evolution has been based on survival, why has the sex ratio in all mammals remained close? Why don't we see mammals where there are 100 females to 1 male? </p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks a lot for all the responses! I will be going through them and asking follow up questions as I get a chance :-)</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Wow this really blew up. Thanks for all the informative responses everyone, I think there seems to be a consensus that evolution happens at the individual level not at the specie level. And even if the there was a sex ratio discrepancy.. the social dynamics and other survival factors would bring the sex ratio to equal range over time. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The underlying reason for this conundrum was first outlined by Ronald Fisher and is still known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher's_principle" target="_blank">Fisher's Principle</a>.  It doesn't just hold true for mammals, but for most sexually reproducing organisms.</p>
<p>To explain why, first I have to clear up a bit of a misconception.  You say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, I was thinking.. optimally as a specie to survive, wouldn't it make more sense to have X females per male?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in truth natural selection favors things that help individuals, not species.  Something can be great for a species or terrible for a species, but that won't effect whether selection favors it.  Instead, it favors things that help individuals, even if those traits are less than optimum for the species as a whole.</p>
<p>So, why have equal numbers of males and females?  Well, basically, imagine a situation where 100 females were born for every male.  Now imagine some individual has a mutation that causes them to produce more male offspring, instead of just having 1 in 100.  All their male offspring will do <em>very</em> well.  They'll go on to impregnate dozens of females and produce lots of offspring.  The gene for having more males will spread.  The gene for having more females will not keep up, because individuals with that gene will only produce females, and those will only produce a few offspring.  Eventually, though, there will be lots of males.  At that point, it will be the <em>males</em> who have trouble finding mates, while all females are guaranteed a chance to get lucky.  And so production to produce more females will be favored.  This all evens out to favor a nearly 50-50 sex ratio at birth.  Basically, selection favors having offspring that have the most opportunity to reproduce, and this means having offspring of the less common sex.  This is known as negative density dependent selection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Now, imagine you are one of those females about to have a baby.  You want to get an advantage and have more grandchildren than the other females.  What do you do?</p>
<p>Have a MALE baby.  Because he will have like hundreds of offspring.</p>
<p>There is a metastable relationship between how the GROUP can reproduce faster (more females) and how an INDIVIDUAL within the group can reproduce faster (more males, up to a certain point).</p>
<p>So you will see some species with 1 - 1 pairing, and some with harems of females, but basically never have harems of males.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The first thing is that evolution doesn't really care about the species very often. There are very few systems where selection above the individual level has any strong effect.        </p>
<p>Any individual offspring has a parent from each sex, therefore, each sex has an equal fitness on average. If there were more males in a population than females then the average fitness of females would be higher, because each female would have more offspring on average. Since females have a higher fitness, genes for daughters would be favored. That would select for more female offspring, which would drive the sex ratio back to around 50%. The same is true if there were more females, the sex ratio would be evened out by selection for more male offspring.     </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since most of the historical evolution has been based on survival   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't as true as you might think. There are mechanisms of evolution besides just natural selection and one important mechanism is sexual selection. Sexual selection is an increase in fitness because of sexual attractiveness. In systems where sexual selection is important, the female is often choosy and the male usually has to compete with other males for mates. In these systems the female that chooses the highest quality male, will have &quot;sexy sons&quot;, meaning that her male offspring will be attractive to the females, so they will have higher fitness. This increases the female's inclusive fitness, which includes the fitness effects her offspring have on her own fitness. So there are situations where it is advantageous for females to produce male offspring.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tldr: If there are more females than males, genes that tend to produce more male offspring have an advantage and vice-versa. So they do, until the balance reverses and those genes are disadvantaged. What you end up with is a sex ration that hovers around 1:1, and tends to self-correct if it gets away from that ratio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
