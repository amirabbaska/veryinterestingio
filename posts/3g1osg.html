		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Steam turbines tend to be pretty heavy for the power they generate, don't respond to quickly changing loads well, and aren't efficient at the small size needed for roadgoing vehicles.</p>
<p>Power plants used for electrical generation or moving large boats don't suffer from any of those problems. Electrical base load generation is a steady output load that doesn't change. Electrical plants are stationary, so the mass isn't constrained the way it is for a car; even on boats the mass won't be such a big deal.</p>
<p>If you are wondering why use steam? The heat source doesn't matter: you can burn coal, natural gas, bunker oil, or use a nuclear reactor and that heat will drive a steam turbine. Steam can carry a great deal of power with little loss from the heat source to the turbine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting note... There has been some experimentation in using steam in modern cars. The idea is to add two additional strokes to the engine. After the exhaust stroke, you would inject water into the cylinder, which would then vaporize into steam. The steam would undergo an additional exhaust stroke, and then back to the intake stroke.</p>
<p>Such an approach avoids the need to have a separate boiler for the steam. The heat instead comes from the previous combustion in the engine. Such a system would be self-cooling, and wouldn't need a radiator. It would also make efficient use of waste heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In most automotive applications (not only cars, but trains, ships, planes and so on) you want to convert the energy of an energy storage into kinetic energy (usually rotational energy). You also need a storage with a very high energy density. Gas has one of the highest energy densities (far higher than lithium ion batteries, for example). You need a lightweight energy storage, which energy can be converted into kinetic energy with devices that also have to be as light and compact as possible. Internal combustion engines (and turbo jet engines in extension) are fairly light, compact and have acceptable efficiencies (But suffer from waste heat losses).  </p>
<p>So important factors in automotive:  </p>
<ul>
<li>very high energy density storage  </li>
<li>easy, lightweight and compact conversion into kinetic energy  </li>
<li>acceptable efficiency  </li>
</ul>
<p>In power plants, you want to convert stored energy into electric energy. Since you are stationary, the energy density of the storage doesn't matter as much and the weight of the conversion devices doesn't really matter either. What matters most is the efficiency. Unfortunately we don't have a way to convert the stored energy into electric energy directly. So we have to do other conversions as intermediate steps. Converting the stored energy into heat, using the heat to vaporize water (converting it into internal energy), using the pressure of the steam to drive a gas turbine (converting internal energy into kinetic energy) and driving an electric generator with the turbine (converting kinetic energy into electric energy) is far more efficient, even though each conversion has some losses. Because you can minimize waste heat losses, the total efficiency is still higher than the one of internal combustion engines. As a bonus, you can use gas turbines with every energy storage that can generate heat, whether it is burning coal, gas or oil, using geothermal energy or nuclear fission. This decreases development costs.  </p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I forgot to mention, for steam turbines you also need large amounts of water additional to your energy source. Imagine a car, train or aircraft carrying around tons of water. That's even less practical.</p>
<p>Important factors in power plants:  </p>
<ul>
<li>most efficient conversion into electric energy  </li>
<li>weight and space constrains don't really matter  </li>
</ul>
<p>Those are very different applications.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have some real world experience to add to what everyone else has said. I am an engineer that works aboard cargo ships, including steam ships. When the ship has been in port for awhile and we have to fire up the boilers again to leave, it can take over 8 hours to get up to pressure and temperature. All the pipes and turbines have to be drained and warmed up properly. Now imagine if you had to do that every time you wanted to drive to the grocery store. It would be ridiculous! Plus, the chemistry of the water has to be monitored precisely and most people don't even check their oil regularly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maintenance and labor. Consider the &quot;classic&quot; reciprocating steam locomotive, for example. To understand why a steam locomotive was so labor intensive, let's consider how one worked. Steam was generated by burning fuel in big firebox at one end of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire-tube_boiler" target="_blank">firetube boiler</a>, and heating water. This steam was in turn, fed into the cylinders, and then exhausted up the chimney. The vacuum created by the exhaust would tend to suck the hot gases through the fire tubes, increasing heat circulation through the boiler and air flow, and thus combustion, through the firebox. The harder the engine was working, the more pronounced this effect. So a steam locomotive was in a way, a very elegant feedback loop. The harder the engine worked, the more suction, or draft, on the fire, and the more steam the boiler would produce, until you reached the maximum capacity of the machine. The engineer could adjust the engine's power output to the load by shortening the cutoff of steam admission to the cylinders. At start, the cutoff would be close to maximum, letting steam into the cylinder for almost the entire piston stroke. As the engine gathered speed, the engineer would adjust this setting through a lever or wheel so that steam was only admitted for part of the stroke, allowing power to be generated by the expansion of steam in the cylinder. </p>
<p>The classic steam locomotive is a pretty labor intensive machine.  Coal and water take up a lot of space, and the type of oil steam locomotives usually burned was difficult to handle, as it was the consistency of thick tar unless heated. Water was a constant issue, especially in the southwest where water is scarce. These railroads dieselized quickly.  Even where water is readily available, it needs to be treated to prevent nasty things from happening inside a 300 PSI boiler. Railroads generally placed water towers every 20-40 miles for locomotives to replenish their supply, although it wasn't always necessary for them to stop that frequently. Fuel supplies were usually placed about every 100 miles.</p>
<p>The boiler required a second operator to control the water and fuel supply into the boiler, and in older locomotives, this person had to hand feed fuel into the fire. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHo860Q66Gw" target="_blank">Here's a British Rails training video on firing a steam engine</a>. Firing 6 14lb shovels full of coal every two minutes for an entire working day would have been exhausting. That's over a ton of coal per hour! In addition, the fireman had to adjust the flow of water into the boiler, and time it well. If the water level got too low, the metal separating the firebox from the boiler could weaken, eventually allowing steam to escape catastrophically in an explosion. This kills the locomotive crew. If too much water was added when it wasn't needed, steam production could drop, or the water level could raise to the point where it got into the steam piping and caused havoc in the rest of the engine. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjsNbzg1UaI" target="_blank">The catastrophe with the locomotive &quot;Blue Peter&quot; in the UK is a prime example</a>. In this case, water carried over into the engine's throttle when the engineer failed to stop the engine from slipping. The throttle jammed open and broke the engineers arm, and the engine's wheels spun out of control until the cylinder heads blew off. This is pretty extreme, but it shows just how dangerous these machines can be if not properly handled.</p>
<p>Related to that, there's the training. Every steam locomotive required slightly different handling. One engine might steam pretty well no matter how you maintained the fire, another might require very careful firing to get good performance. Some engines steamed best with a fire that was thick at the back and tapered to a thin firebed at the front, others steamed better with a fire that was uniformly thin. On some steam locomotives, the driver could yank the throttle wide open and walk away with his train, others, especially fairly modern steam locos with high power to weight ratios, would spin their wheels uselessly unless the throttle was opened slowly and gently. A cutoff and throttle setting that gave easy, efficient running for a certain load and speed on one engine would be either inadequate or wasteful on another type of engine in the same situation. So an engineer or fireman that was experienced with handling one type of locomotive would still have to experiment a little bit to get the best work out of an engine they weren't used to. This also meant that engine performance wasn't as consistent as it could be. </p>
<p>Then there's maintenance. The moving parts of the engine had to be lubricated by hand, usually every 100 miles or so. Even if the locomotive had an automatic stoker, the fire still had to be cleaned regularly of ash and clinker, which is a slag like substance formed by the melting of noncombustible particles in the coal. Failure to do so restricted air flow through the fire and decreased the engines efficiency and power output. Similarly, oil burning engines had to have the boiler tubes cleaned frequently. This was done by feeding sand into the firebox door while the engine was working, so the draft from the exhaust would pull it through the boiler tubes, dragging any contaminants along with it. Those problems are avoided in power plants by the use of turbines, and by feeding finely pulverized coal into the boilers. This was unsuitable for locomotives because the speed of airflow through a locomotive firebox would tend to just blast the fine particles of coal out of the smokestack without burning.</p>
<p>Because of these issues, even though a single steam locomotive tended to be more powerful than a single diesel, they were gradually phased out in the US after World War II. The speed with which railroads phased them out depended on the strengths of their steam fleet, and the availability of good fuel and water. Railroads that operated in the dry states of the southwest US tended to dieselize very quickly due to the difficulty of providing water. The last railroads in the US to dieselize were coal hauling railroads, due to the availability of cheap fuel.</p>
<p>Power plants and the propulsion systems of large ships <em>generally</em> don't operate under variable loads, so there's less trial and error in optimizing them for efficiency. You spin up the turbine to the speed you want and leave it. There's far fewer moving parts to lubricate, and fuel and water are much easier to supply in stationary applications. Modern power plants and ships use very high pressure boilers and pulverize the coal for greater efficiency. Both of these were tried several times on steam locomotives with little success. They seem to tolerate the abuse of a mobile environment less than fire tube boilers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
