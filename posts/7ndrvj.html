		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's very difficult to group living, evolving organisms into discrete categories.</p>
<p>Polar bears diverged from the rest of the <em>Ursus</em> genus very recently, therefore they are still genetically similar enough to other bears to produce fertile offspring.</p>
<p>Taxonomy is also based on physical appearance. Since polar bears are  quite distinct from other species of bears in terms of their physical appearance and geographical habitat, the decision was made to consider them a separate species.</p>
<p>Doves and pigeons are another example. There are 310 species of birds within the <em>Columbiformes</em> order (which encompasses all pigeon and dove families), many of which are capable of breeding with other species and producing fertile offspring. Their classification as separate species lies mainly in their physical differences.</p>
<p>The long and the short of it is that taxonomy is a human construct, and not everything fits nice and neatly between the lines all of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Tl;dr:</strong> while this typically isn't the case, there is no hard, taxonomic rule stating that members of different species cannot produce fertile offspring. A better way of thinking about it would be: &quot;if two populations are unable to interbreed, they cannot be considered the same species&quot;. This doesn't necessarily preclude two species from being able to interbreed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The differentiation between species is more of an art than a science.  In the botanical world, massive flame wars between adherents to various authorities break out frequently, because having the only specimen of a particular species in cultivation can net you tend of hundreds of thousands more than just having a particular variation of a more common genus/species combo.  Itâ€™s way more of a grey area than simple interbreeding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a common misunderstanding. While you are right that species are defined in terms of those that can interbreed, this distinction is made on the POPULATION level, not the individual level. </p>
<p>While individual polar bears may be able to successfully mate with individual grizzlies, the two groups mate at different times and places. That's enough to keep the count of known wild hybrids to... </p>
<p>3... </p>
<p>That's right, just 3 wild examples known. Ever. As such, they are different enough that they are reproductively isolated despite having overlapping territories. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Brainscoop YouTube channel does a really great video on the topic. The tl;dr is that we did our best to make groups that made sense at the time they were made... but we're working on incomplete, inaccurate, sparse datasets. Also life, uh, finds a way.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Be cause they look and act differently enough. The seperation between species is pretty grey for a long time. If kept apart for long enough they will no longer be able to cross breed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
