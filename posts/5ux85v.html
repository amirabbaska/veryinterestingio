<p>Other non-metals either don't make enough bonds (oxygen makes 2, nitrogen 3, hydrogen 1), or the bonds aren't strong enough to form long chains that are reasonably stable (silicon, phosphorus, etc.). Metals usually don't make covalent bonds at all, so they can't form chains (inter-metallic bonds are far too weak).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Carbon can serve as the &quot;backbone&quot; for constructing an effectively infinite variety of complex chemically active molecules. And because of that variety it presents the possibility for a nearly infinite variety of carbon based molecules with different chemical properties.</p>
<p>To take some examples from biology: you can have sugars which are basically cyclo-esters (a carbon chain that is connected back to itself but with an oxygen atom in the chain) with hydroxyl groups attached to every carbon atom in the chain (a sort of &quot;super&quot; alcohol). Sugars are polar molecules, they dissolve easily in water. They're remarkably good for storing energy because you can basically just split it in half into two pyruvate molecules and get free energy. But if you link a bunch of sugars together you can produce cellulose, which has very different properties from sugar. If you modify the sugars slightly by adding an amide group and form those into a polymer you can create chitin (the material of the exoskeletons of crustaceans, insects, etc.) which has very different properties compared to both glucose and wood, though it is closely chemically related.</p>
<p>Alkanes are long chains of carbon atoms each linked to two other carbon atoms and (usually) two hydrogen atoms. Fats are made out of long alkane chains bonded to a carboxyllic acid group and then sometimes attached to something else (like glycerin or a phosphate group in the case of phospholipids). An ordinary fat is extremely non-polar, so it doesn't dissolve in water, phospholipids have a polar end and a non-polar tail so they form into bilayers serving as cell membranes, for example. Proteins are made out of strings of carbon based molecules that start out as amino-acids (a carboxyl group with an amine group on the next carbon over) which enables the formation of amide bonds. The backbone of a protein's peptide chain is a series of [NH] [CH-R] [CO] [NH] [CH-R] [CO] (and so on), with different R groups corresponding to different amino-acids. Without the N or O atoms the peptide chain wouldn't be feasible, but without carbon it would not work at all, and the R groups are also carbon based. That basic structure makes it possible to create a huge array of micro-polymers (proteins) that can have an enormous array of different physical and chemical properties ranging from something as &quot;simple&quot; as a structural protein of hair to something as complex as a component of an electron transport chain designed to serve as a component in the machinery of photosynthesis.</p>
<p>In short, the variety of molecules that can be created with carbon based chemistry and the enormous span of different properties those molecules can have is what makes that chemistry so deep and interesting. It's particularly suited to use in the field of nanoscopic molecular machinery, which serves as the foundation for all life as we know it, but even that is only a fraction of what's possible with organic chemistry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of stuff!</p>
<p>Most people mentioned the 4 bonds, and at least one mentioned that its the smallest element that can make 4. But consider that it's also the smallest element to make more than 2 bonds, and its also the smallest element to make more than 1 covalent bond.</p>
<p>Why is &quot;multiple bonds&quot; an important concept? </p>
<p>Because we exist and move about in 3 geometric dimensions! Imagine you have one atom of Hydrogen, what relative space does it occupy? A point. Now that Hydrogen covalently bonds to satisfy its outer shell requirements and makes a Hydrogen molecule. What relative space does it occupy? A line. Oxygen will bond with two hydrogens, the angle provided by these bonds will allow for a plane (2 dimensions). But, A single molecule containing Carbon can make enough bonds to occupy all three dimensions in space.</p>
<p>Why is being the smallest element important?</p>
<p>Because everything that is; has resulted from an initial state of free floating protons, electrons, and neutrons (shortly after the big bang). </p>
<p>The easiest element and Isotope to synthesize is Hydrogen: A free proton needs to capture a free electron to create an electron shell orbital. This is highly likely due to the attractive force of different charges in electromagnetism. After that the next easiest isotope to create is deuterium. A Hydrogen nucleus (proton) absorbs a neutron (which is not affected by electromagnetism). After that its Tritium: Deuterium absorbs a Neutron. </p>
<p>Then the next most likely thing to happen is that Tritium absorbs another neutron. When that happens, one of the neutrons changes its &quot;spin&quot; and becomes a Proton. A Beta particle is emitted (with negative charge) and a charged helium atom is produced (This method of Helium synthesis is far more likely to happen than a Proton nucleus absorbing another proton due to electromagnetism repulsion factors). The charged helium will then rapidly acquire another electron to form a neutral Helium atom.</p>
<p>This method of synthesis will continue on down the line, making the smaller elements much more likely to be synthesized than their larger counterparts. That means..... There is way more Carbon than say Silicon which makes it more LIKELY to be used in a system.</p>
<p>Carbon also has an equal number of &quot;extra&quot; electrons from the next lower electron shell (S1) as it does &quot;missing&quot; electrons from its next higher full electron shell (S2, P2). This means that not only is it incredibly electroneutral, but it can be altered equally to the left and right by bonding it with a more electronegative (which will steal electron density) or electropositive (which will donate electron density) functional group.</p>
<p>This means carbons can function as neutral, partially positive, AND partially negative. That means it can make LOTS of different bonds with lots of different types of elements and functional groups. It ALSO means that it can bond well to itself while still leaving room for other bonds to be made. For instance an N2 gas bond will have a triple bond, but won't readily bond again (or react which is why it is considered largely inert). That makes it not so great in creating longer chains. O2 gas, and F2 gas are much the same in this respect. But carbon will use it's partially positive nature to form a third or 4th bond with a partially negative atom (like a nitrogen, oxygen, or hydrogen).</p>
<p>Those Carbon-Nitrogen, Carbon-Oxygen, and Carbon-Hydrogen Bonds are literally what make nitrogenous bases, monosaccharides, and amino acids possible. Further, they facilitate those monomer units to polymerize into more &quot;living units&quot; (DNA, Proteins, Polysaccharides, ect.).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carbon is the smallest element that makes four bonds. </p>
<p>Larger elements hold onto their electrons less because of their size, and this makes them more metallic. Once you start acting metally you  get kinda pigeonholed into making quite metal-like bonds which are far less vared and far less able to be fine tuned and specialised than covalent bonding networks like non-metals can do. If you can covalently bond you can form a variety of patterns in the bonding network that make different substances - different types of lipids, inorganic crap, sugars and stuff if you throw oxygen in... you know. Variety. Different properties.</p>
<p>But metallic bonding is so blurry and non-speciifc you lose that ability to differentiate materials a bit. They're all pretty samey the more metallic you get. So carbon being the least metallic and most common is the best one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An important detail that hasn't been mentioned yet is that it is carbon's orbitals that offer much of it's stability and compatibility with other non-metals. </p>
<p>Carbon, in its native state, has six electrons that are contained in 2 orbital types: s and p. The s orbital is closest to the nucleus and has two electrons that the atom really likes to hold on to. The p orbital, or more specifically orbitals, can exist in three different orientations along perpendicular axis. The electrons in these orbitals aren't held as tightly as those in the s orbital and are able to more freely bond with other atoms that have available electrons in the correct orbital orientation. It is also the p orbitals that are responsible for double and triple bonds in alkenes and alkynes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
