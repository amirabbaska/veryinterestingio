		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since others in the thread have provided excellent responses on the nature of motivation versus method, as it pertains to your question, I just wanted to chip in an example I think will be relevant.</p>
<p>Back in January 2011, a car exploded in close proximity to a number of defense department facilities (including the Pentagon). SWAT and bomb squads responded, and it was initially investigated as a possible attack. Turns out, it was a construction worker who had left an oxyacetylene torch in his trunk, which detonated (possibly due to temperature/pressure fluctuations caused by the cold). Within a couple hours, it was established what had occurred, and things backed down from &quot;terrorist attack&quot; to &quot;accident,&quot; but in those initial minutes of response, nobody had any way to know. <a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2011/01/11/breaking-news-car-explodes-in-penrose/" target="_blank">Here's a news article with updates and images</a>.</p>
<p>Other things can also cause explosions, such as natural gas pipelines. For example, three 5-story buildings <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_East_Village_gas_explosion" target="_blank">were destroyed in NYC in 2015</a>  due to a gas pipeline problem, and another couple buildings there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_East_Harlem_gas_explosion" target="_blank">blown up in 2014</a>. Big explosions, but not bombs, and it took time to establish that. Until there is certainty of the cause, they will treat things as potentially the worst, so that they don't miss signs or put the public in greater danger by treating something less seriously than they should.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, terrorism refers to violence with <em>ideological</em> motivations: political, religious, etc. Although bomb attacks usually are ideological in nature, they don't by definition have to be. Someone can commit a bombing for non-ideological reasons (maybe the bomb is an attempt to murder someone with whom the perpetrator has a personal dispute with.) </p>
<p>Terrorism is not defined by tactics. If a man stabs ten people in a mall because he's a dickweed, that's not terrorism. If a man stabs ten people in a mall because he thinks it contribute to the overthrow of the government, then that is terrorism. </p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that the word <em>terrorism</em> doesn't really define what terrorists do. The term implies that creating fear is terrorists' primary motivation, but this is generally not the case. Terrorists' goals vary depending on their motivations, but causing widespread terror in the minds of populations is generally more of a desirable additional effect than the main goal. The generally accepted modern definition of terrorism is violence or the threat of violence by non-state actors driven by ideological motivations.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it is easy to step down an investigation, but much harder to ramp one up. Treating an explosion of undetermined, but suspicious, origin as a terrorist bombing means that any possible evidence recovered will be handled and logged in accordance with evidentiary procedure. Explosives experts will be among the first people combing through the debris, looking for any of the components of the explosive device.</p>
<p>If it is treated like an accident or something other than a criminal act, then it is entirely possible that valuable evidence may be lost or overlooked. Evidence might be handled or recovered in ways that make it useless for testing or inadmissible in a trial.</p>
<p>If you follow the most stringent investigative procedures, you know you're good. Worst case scenario is that you were too careful and exacting.</p>
<p>These are the same reasons suspicious fires are investigated as possible arson, and deaths of unknown origin are treated as possible murder. Until your investigation shows that the worst case scenario isn't true, you want to be certain that you aren't underdoing it.</p>
<p>EDIT TO ADD:  The reason it is treated as a terrorist bombing specifically, rather than any other type of criminal bombing, is because that gets the intelligence community involved.  That's the critical difference between the investigation of a possible terrorist act and a 'regular' criminal investigation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>In case it was not a deliberate bomb.  Without knowing the full details yet, it could have been something else, like a pyrotechnics accident.</p>
</li>
<li>If it was a bomb, there are other possible reasons besides terrorism, including suicide, homicide targeting a deliberate person or people, or other reason for destruction.  The Dortmund (fixed, thanks /u/taversham) bus bomb was supposed to look like terrorism, but turned out to be someone trying to commit financial fraud.</li>
</ol>
<p>It probably was a terrorist bomb, but the police want to be positive before officially calling it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>No.  Terrorism is using fear as a tool to try to force some sort of political or social change.</p>
<p>If the point of a bomb is to try to cause a group of people to comply with some sort of demand because they're terrified of being blown up if they don't, that's terrorism.  But if someone is setting off a bomb just because they're crazy and want to kill people, that's not terrorism.</p>
<p>In short, whether or not something is terrorism is a matter of intent (much like whether or not something is first degree murder is a matter of intent).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
