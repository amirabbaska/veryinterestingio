		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is effect differently by alcohol due to age, weight, genetics, etc. With chronic alcohol abuse, parts of the nervous system adapt to functioning in the presence of alcohol (aka. tolerance). When the nerves are highly adapted to alcohol, removing it can drastically alter the function of that system, leading so side effects depending on what nerves adapted and how much they adapted. </p>
<p>The damage that quick alcohol withdrawal varies a lot and can be permanent, for example parts of the brain can die due to a sudden increase in intracellular calcium (not ELI5 but I think its an interesting mechanism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how a new sliding window slides really well for (x) amount of time? Then maybe it starts to get a little stuck, so you spray some WD 40 or whatever, and now your window slides easily, and you're like &quot;sweet, I didn't have to deal with the real problem of putting in new windows, because these are good as new!&quot; Then after a few months, that window is sticking again so you throw some more WD 40 on it and it works again, and you're like &quot;great! Well hopefully this doesnt become a more frequent thing I have to continuously do in order for my window to function correctly!&quot; And then the next month you have to WD 40 it again, then in two weeks, then a week, few days, etc.
The window is now reliant on the WD 40 to perform the simple task of opening, but now it even sticks sometimes even after using a whole can. Let's say it was a wood window... the reason it worked pre-WD 40 is because it was treated. After introducing the WD 40 to the wood, the wood started to dry out- what have you - even more/faster. Or we could say that the WD 40 reacted to whatever the window was treated with, so the window now no longer functions the way it did in the beginning, and it is not physically possible for it to complete the task of opening.
However, if we take these broken windows, and sand them down/re-seal them, the WD 40 is no longer needed, and contingent on daily maintenance, the windows will never need it again.
That was a really stupid analogy, but it breaks down to how alcohol and your brain work. This coming from an alcoholic who kept such an astronomically high BAC that when I tried to go in to my third residential treatment sober, at 16 hours without a drink or drug, was withdrawling to the point of hallucination and severe DT's, only to find out I was still at a .33 BAC... four times the legal limit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Your liver cell’s smooth endoplasmic reticulum grows to handle more and more alcohol, which makes the liver “harden”.</p>
<p>Im not sure enough about this information to draw any conclusions, so do with it what you want.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different degrees of alcoholism.</p>
<p>You have functional alcoholics, who can control their drinking enough to live a normal-ish, if unhappy life.  They are taking a lot of risks, losing their job, their family, getting a DUI, but they haven't completely fallen apart.  They can usually go without and not suffer serious withdrawal.</p>
<p>Then you have people who just want to be wasted all the time.  They wake up and drink as much as they can until they run out.  They can develop very high tolerances and can still be coherent at levels of intoxication that would render normal people unconscious.  these are the kind of people who can die from withdrawal symptoms.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
