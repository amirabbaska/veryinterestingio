		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a rule of thumb there are three relevant limits which tells you that Newtonian physics is no longer applicable.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the ratio v/c (where v is the characteristic speed of your system and c is the speed of light) is no longer close to zero, you need special relativity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the ratio 2GM/c^(2)R (where M is the mass, G the gravitational constant and R the distance) is no longer close to zero, you need general relativity.</p>
</li>
<li>If the ratio h/pR (where p is the momentum, h the Planck constant and R the distance) is no longer close to zero, you need quantum mechanics.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now what constitutes &quot;no longer close to zero&quot; depends on how accurate your measurement tools are. For example in the 19th century is was found that Mercury's precession was not correctly given by Newtonian mechanics. Using the mass of the Sun and distance from Mercury to the Sun gives a ratio of about 10^(-8) as being noticeable.</p>
<p>Edit: It's worth pointing out that from these more advanced theories, Newton's laws do &quot;pop back out&quot; when the appropriate limits are taken where we expect Newtonian physics to work. In that way, you can say that Newton isn't <em>wrong</em>, but more so incomplete.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Einstein's physics holds in all places that Newtonian physics does, but not the other way around. That is to say: when speeds are slow, Einstein's physics simplifies to Newton's. At larger speeds though, Einstein's physics is capped by the speed of light, whereas Newtonian physics makes no such prediction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the question understandably misunderstands the relationship between these two physics. It's easy to fall into the idea that Newtonian physics is the normal physics and Einsteinian physics kicks in when things are travelling at around the speed of light. </p>
<p>A better way to think of this is as Einsteinian physics having replaced Netwonian physics. Einstein's equations work like a spectrum- at the zero speed etc they work exactly like classical physics (to the point you can derive the classical laws of motion from Einstein's with the correct conditions). These conditions can never be met in reailty so Newton's laws are actually an idealised situation, a bit like a assuming a &quot;spherical cow&quot;. As the body speeds up, the relativistic properties become ever more significant (in reality they are always there). At the speeds humans normally deal with the relativistic effects are so small you can't normally see them, which is why Newton's laws appear to work.</p>
<p>TL:DR; they are unified, but Newtonian physics is a special case within Einsteinian physics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Relativity is always correct.  Newtonian mechanics are an approximation that usually works well enough at low speed and gravity.  Think of it like how <code>f(x) = sin(x)</code> is approximated by <code>g(x) = x</code> when x is near 0.</p>
<p>Whether or not you can get away with the error just depends on how accurate you need to be, and how far from 0 speed and gravity you are.  Newtonian mechanics was good enough to land men on the moon, but we need relativity for GPS satellites to be accurate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are unified, in the sense that when the velocity is slow enough, both of them give the same answer (you can express this formally for example through the use of Taylor series). They only start to diverge when velocities approach the speed of light and Newtonian physics is no longer an accurate description of nature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
