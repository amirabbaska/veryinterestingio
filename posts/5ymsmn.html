<p>When something has enough mass, the gravity from the center will pull equally in all directions.  This will make a sphere.  In the case of planets &quot;mostly spherical.&quot;  Something like an asteroid doesn't have enough mass to &quot;crush&quot; itself into a sphere, so they can take many shapes.</p>
<p>One of the requirements of being called a planet is that it is spherical (to a certain degree).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you had a non-spherical object the size of the earth (let's say, it's a Cube instead)</p>
<p>Well, in that case, certain parts of the cube (the corners) would be farther away from the center of mass than other parts (the center of the faces). Because the corners are farther away, they have more potential energy (the same way a brick on top of a building has more potential energy than the same brick resting on the ground).</p>
<p>Now Gravity is trying to crush everything into the center (it's just what Gravity does, attracts mass towards other mass), the areas with higher potential energy have a higher likelihood of 'Falling' from their elevated position to a lower 'Rest State'.</p>
<p>As this 'Falling' action occurs (over vast periods of time), your Cubic-Planet would crush itself into a Spherical-Planet, where all points on the surface experience the same gravitational force.</p>
<p>(Sidenote: other's have already pointed out planets aren't spheres, they're spheroids. This is because the rotational energy counteracts gravity more at the equator than at the poles)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well they're not really spherical, they're kind of compressed spheres. </p>
<p>Essentially what happens is that in a sphere, everything is as close to the gravitational center of the planet as possible.  If you had, say, a cube, then the corners would stick out, and tend to be pulled back toward the center of the planet over time.</p>
<p>Essentially the same force that makes a mound of sand unstable and likely to spill down makes planets roughly spherical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First look <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQ7qGilqZE" target="_blank">at this video</a> of water in space. The lack of gravity makes the water spherical because the forces inside the water itself are enough to keep them together and nature always choose the less energy shape to keep something that is in equilibrium that, in that case, is a sphere.</p>
<p>Because the planets are rotating, they are not really a perfect sphere.  Earth for example is larger at equator because the speed is bigger there and trends to make the whole thing expand a little bit. In fact, earth's south half is larger than the north one. So earth is like a pear but the differences between all parts are minimum, just detectable thru instruments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
