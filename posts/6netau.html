		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this question, there is some fascinating work in the brain going on here.</p>
<p>Alcohol is a &quot;depressant&quot;. This means that it slows down the brain. When we are intoxicated with alcohol our eye tracking slows down (along with a lot of other brain processes).
Eye tracking is what makes both of our eyes look at the same thing. As it is slowed down by alcohol this causes the eyes not to sync up correctly and both eyes are looking at slightly different points. </p>
<p>Our brain interprets sight by comparing both eyes. So it effectively takes two images and blends them into one. Because the images are now not tracked we get a double vision effect.</p>
<p>Closing one eye removes one of the two images and therefore alleviates this problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You see double because your eyes are not coordinating, this is not related to communication between hemispheres.
Simply put, just like any other motor muscle in your body, the eye muscles are clumsier when you drink, so they can't align your eyes properly. Just like you would stumble trying to walk a straight line, your eyes &quot;stumble&quot; trying to both look at the same point and you see double as your eyes are each aligned on a different point in space.
If you experience double vision without drinking, or the need to close one eye to concentrate, I suggest you consult your optometrist. We can give you exercises to strengthen your eye muscles or prescribe special glasses for your condition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>people that need prism in their glasses experience that every time they take off their glasses. some worse than others. me for example, have horizontal prism, and when i take off my glasses and look at a stop sign from about 100 yards away, there are 2 stops about 4 inches apart. it sucks, but you learn to work around it. closing one eye like you said, is what I usually do, but when you do that, you have a lack of depth perception, so its a double edged sword.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody mentioned this yet. Each hemisphere doesn't get one eye, no, that would be too simple. Each hemisphere gets <em>one half of each eye</em>. That's why when testing people with their corpus cut, they have to make sure half of each eye can't see the thing they are testing if they can see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Double vision was the first symptom I had that ultimately led to a brain cancer diagnosis. The Timor is pressing on my optic nerve causing the double vision. I essentially have a &quot;wonky&quot; eye although you can't tell by looking at it. If it weren't for my special prescription glasses I'd see double 24/7. Maybe you could go see a neuro-ophthalmologist?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
