		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The numbers represent the frequency, in megahertz (MHz) at which the radio station transmits. The reason that they're always odd (88.9, 89.1, 89.3, etc.) is because each station is allocated a 200 kilohertz (KHz) bandwidth. So those stations actually have a range of 88.8-89.0, 89.0-89.2 and so on. You're tuning the radio the center frequency. </p>
<p>These frequencies are the result of science and regulations. Those frequencies allow the signal to travel far enough to be useful but not so far as to interfere with neighboring cities' stations on the same frequency. FM radio goes about 50-ish miles (AM goes much further in the right atmospheric conditions. </p>
<p>At the same time, the FCC in the United States controls the radio frequency spectrum to prevent interference. TV, satellite, cell phones, air traffic control, CB, Wi-Fi, anything that transmits wirelessly takes up a spot on the spectrum and shit goes wrong when those interfere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the early days of radio, it was the wild west, anyone could broadcast anything on any frequency.  This was a real problem, especially when it came to government communication, like keeping touch with ships at sea.  By 1930, most developed countries decided the government &quot;owed&quot; the broadcast spectrum, and started to regulate it.</p>
<p>In the US the FM band originally was 42 MHz to 50 Mhz  These stations were affected by tropospheric skip that allowed the signal to bounce off the atmosphere and allegedly interfere with other distant stations.  RCA, heavily invested in AM, championed the move to disrupt the rival FM band, so it is unclear to what extent this was a problem.  In the late 1940s, the band was moved to 88 MHz through 108 MHz, a range less prone to skipping, where it remains today.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The low end of the FM spectrum butts up against the old analog VHF spectrum for TV. All the major stations have gone digital but low power stations were granted an exemption for analog.</p>
<p>What does this mean? In some places you used to be able to pick up TV audio on the lowest couple frequencies of the FM band. To this day, there's a low power station in Chicago, WRME that is legally a low power analog TV station but they market themselves as a radio station. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
