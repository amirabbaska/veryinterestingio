		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kayakers, rowers and canoists have been experimenting with this idea for about 30 years now. The conclusion they came to was that it didn't sufficiently improve performance over the standard gel coat on a composite boat. What apparently does improve performance is a slime that slowly dissolves in the water and reduces the water's viscosity for a minute or so, or applying directional riblet films such as these: </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of active research here in the PacNW regarding fluid dynamics (Boeing, lots of major shipbuilders here, etc.). And for the most part, the general consensus is that purely hydrophobic coatings don't do much, if anything, to help with increasing speed. </p>
<p>Primarily, the main reason is because it's the <em>laminar flow</em> of the water over the surface that provides a thin layer of water that is carried along with the boat, and so the primary friction layer is water-water, not water-boat surface. </p>
<p>Similarly, back in the 80s or 90s, there were a few boats that used a stippled tape made by 3M to help improve their friction surface, and this actually DID measurably improve their speed and reduce friction. It was quickly outlawed by FISA, and the reason today that FISA boat manufacturing rules specifically dictate that no extraneous coatings or coverings that serve to reduce friction aside from the natural surface of the shell are permitted was because of this early experimentation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Guys were spraying McLube (which is a deck hardware lubricant) all over their hulls and polishing them up. But it's awful for whatever body of water you're in so the company made a product just for what you're talking about called Hullkote. <a href="http://www.mclubemarine.com/hullkote/" target="_blank">http://www.mclubemarine.com/hullkote/</a></p>
<p>In sailing 1/2 a knot can mean a lot in a race so people will do whatever they can to gain an advantage. The argument though is that a pure hydrophobic surface actually increases drag due to eliminating a boundary layer. So really sanding the surface down to an insanely high grit would be better than spraying your hull. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow I never thought my actual PhD research would come up on reddit but here I am, color me surprised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically the short answer is yes, my lab has proven many times that using micro/nano structures surfaces and hydrophobic surfaces can reduce skin friction drag on a surface moving through the water. Basically all it does is create a layer of air (called a plastron) between the skin of the ship and the water, and since the friction coefficient of water over air is much lower than water over a surface, the friction is reduced. This is very similar to why a golf ball has dimples. We have shown that you can reduce the skin friction drag of a ship hull by close to 90%, but this is only the friction, this does not account for form drag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real challenges right now are two fold, manufacturing ability and durability. I’ll start with the manufacturing because that is easier. A lot of the coatings we have developed are completely in-feasible for a ship because it either requires super precise etching (like you see in a microchip processing laboratory) or it requires harsh chemicals and you can’t really dip an entire ship in a giant vat of chemicals. So what we are working on right now is a simple coating that could be painted or sprayed on that would induce similar results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we have been successful in making one that can be sprayed, but this brings with it, it’s own challenges. First is the durability, many hydrophobic coatings are not durable on a metal surface and would end up just rubbing off after a short amount of time, we have created one that is pretty durable and is very promising so far in testing. The next challenge we are encountering is the durability of the plastron (the air layer between the hull and the water). This has been shown to break down over time, most likely from the air diffusing into the water, but it hasn’t been shown yet. But if you keep the plastron connected to the atmosphere (ie the air layer extends all the way to above the water line) then it appears this can be mitigated because your air layer is/can always be ‘refreshed’ with more air. What I am currently researching is how to we make a surface that is completely submerged (like a submarine) maintain a stable air layer with no connection to the atmosphere. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind of a long answer to your question but it is a huge field of interest right now and has a lot of money/potential in it!</p>
<p>TL;DR yes it would, but it also isn’t really relevant on sailboat racing because it is banned by the RRS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: I also just want to clarify for people that not ALL coatings shear off at speed. One of the coatings I am testing with has shown numerous days of durability at about 20 m/s flow and absolutely no affect of the structure. The key is preventing wetting. If the coating wets, then yes, it will not last long because water is so much more ‘abrasive’ but if you maintain that air layer, it will last a long long time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
