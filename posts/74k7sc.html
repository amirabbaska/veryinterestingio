		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The danish astronomer Romer was the first to suggest this, when observing the moons of Jupiter their orbits he noticed that they deviated from what Newtonian motion predicted. However they did not deviate randomly when the earth was close to Jupiter they were more precise, but became increasing divergent when earth was on the opposite side of its orbit.</p>
<p>Either Newtonian motion was flawed, or there was another factor at play namely that light was not instantaneous.</p>
<p>Working from the distance between the earth and Jupiter and the size of the divergence Romer calculated the speed of light.</p>
<p>Edit: I looked up Romers calculation and he was 30% off modern calculations for c</p>

<p>Also that link makes the point that Galileo did experiments (on earth) to try and calculate c, but was for obvious reasons unsuccessful. And that the initial assumption that light was instantaneous came from the Greeks like so much other bunk. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do we already see everything omitting/reflecting light in our observable universe? If we can just catch a glimpse of a star dying (being bright and then going dark) can we also theoretically just catch a glimpse of a new star being formed? Like...if a star 20 light years away was born 20 years ago and we were looking in the right spot would we be able to see the light basically switch on? Can someone explain this scenario to me like I'm 5 please?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
