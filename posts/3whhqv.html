		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some good answers here! To add to them as best I can, consciousness is more of a spectrum not a simple awake/asleep state. This is most commonly measured by the Glasgow Coma Scale - which gives points for;
-Eye reactions and movements
-Verbal interaction
-Body and limb movements</p>
<p>There is of course being fully in a coma or 'knocked out' which the person does not respond even with reflex eye reactions on all three parts of the scale. As they wake they may recover all three at the same time or one side more than the other.</p>
<p>This can give the appearance of being 'unconscious' for longer than they actually are.</p>
<p>As an example I was recently a first responder at a motorbike accident. The person was in a helmet but was completely unconscious for all of 30 seconds before he was starting to move about and make incomprehensible sounds for about 5 minutes. Moved to opening his eyes, talking to himself for 15 minutes and finally sitting up and talking to me another 5 mins later. So he was in that grey area for 20 mins.</p>
<p>This is where the first answer comes in that:
'It depends on what parts are injured'.</p>
<p>So those systems that have had a physical shock in the brain are slowly return to functioning or are limited by swelling and/or bleeding. </p>
<p>And memory is a compex system which is altered with mild and severe injuries, which also recovers on a spectrum. Which shows with the answers on this thread of people losing hours, days even weeks.</p>
<p>This is where the theory and current research is going into - what happens to the electric impulses? Do neurons get temporarily disconnected in low grade concussions vs the full traumatic brain injury where there is widespread damage to conducting fibres (Diffuse axonal damage)?</p>
<p>For the ELI am a neuroscientist there is some evidence and theory out there but the better answer to those questions is that we dont know yet :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The blow to your head shakes your brain and most importantly it shakes/bruises an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_activating_system" target="_blank">area in your brain stem responsible for your wakeful state- called Reticular Activating System</a> . Duration of &quot;being knocked out&quot; depends on the amount and duration of neurological disruption <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Concussion/Pages/Causes.aspx" target="_blank">in that part of the brain</a>.  People who &quot;pass out&quot; but wake up as soon as they're horizontal - typical just fainted. People who got knocked out, came out of it and then went out again are in trouble as there's a good chance they are bleeding inside their skull. Anyone who within 24hrs after a head injury becomes a DIC head, (disoriented, irritable combative) needs to go to EMERGENCY right away as their brain is swelling or bleeding and can kill or damage their brain if left unchecked.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If by &quot;knocked unconscious&quot; you're implying due to a physical blow, often, the blackout only lasts a moment, and is caused due to a strong shock to the brain, temporarily disabling cognitive functions. If knocked unconscious for a long period of time, this is considered a coma, and can certainly be deadly if not carefully treated. In all instances, a coma will result from brain damage in some form, ranging from minor to major, and even critical. </p>
<p>To answer your question, what <em>decides</em> when you wake up is often when your brain has recovered from the shock and can function properly again. In most instances, this is near instantaneous, so there's no need to worry. During a coma, it can take much longer, and without proper support, might result in death. Even with support, it can! There are many factors that affect it but the most highly attributed factor is to regain cognitive functions.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br />
For those commenting that this is a non-answer, please keep in mind that <em>no one</em> is really sure why we wake up, or what decides it. All we know now is that we do. I've explained it the best I can without any misinformation, I apologize if it is not to your liking. I'm trying to answer any questions you have in replies to this thread, so keep them coming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Definitely depends on what part of your brain needs to recover. I worked in an ER and our &quot;go to move&quot; was to take our knuckles and rub them vigorously across the sternum of a patients chest. (The bone between your breast) the pain wakes you REAL fast.</p>
<p>Comes in handy for less serious events like your buddy is black out drunk or gets knocked out at a bar. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The actual part of the body that wakes people up is the Reticular Activating System. </p>
<p>This part of the brain integrates other centers and is integral in the sleep wake cycle in humans. When in a Coma or trance like state, inclusive of sleep, it is the reticular formation that sends excitation signals to the brain that activate a cascade that allows multiple centers to excite leading to arousal (the brain type). </p>
<p>The determining factor is how much excitation the reticular formation experiences, and hormonal mechanisms that may stimulate the cascade of excitation that occurs in the brain.</p>
<p>When: When the RAS receives enough stimulation to send any type of signal leading to minor or major excitation of brain centers...... the level or arousal can widely vary.</p>
<p>How: Cascades of excitation signals from the RAS across the brain to different lobes, with or without hormonal interaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
