		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, because we are only aware of our own stimuli. If I step out of my office to grab lunch, I might walk in the sun and feel a little sweaty, I might get caught in the wind and feel a little mussed, I might eat a big greasy lunch and then feel gross about it. Because I FEEL windswept and uncomfortably full, if I look in the mirror, that will be reflected. I'll think I'm fatter, I'll be frustrated that my hair isn't cooperating, or embarrassed that I'm hot and sweaty. But the truth is, no one else in my office knows that I was in the wind or I ate too many fries. As far as they're concerned, I walked out and then walked back in a little later, as people do in offices. They didn't experience any of the external factors that are currently making me feel different than I did an hour ago. </p>
<p>The woman who sits at the desk across from me just cam back from the bathroom. She might have started her period and be totally uncomfortable and in pain. She might have read an email while sitting there and gotten some great news. She might have suddenly realized she wore different shoes than she meant to and her outfit is way off. Her entire state of mind could have totally shifted while she was gone, but I'd have no fucking idea. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are very familiar with your own features and tend to focus on things that stick out to you.  With other people you tend to just see the &quot;big picture&quot; and not the little things.  This is why it's so easy to become insecure about odd features that you have, while other people don't question them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The comments here are facinating to me. This is awesome stuff! I've always wondered how people saw themselves but was too awkward to ask.</p>
<p>I see myself in the mirror but have never gotten an 'impression' that that image is 'me'. I've never been good at explaining this, not even to my wife who I have talked about this with a few times. I can't make 'me' out in the mirror. Like I'll see a picture of myself, I'll be able to tell it's me because of the clothes and that I remember taking the picture, but that person looks kind of like a ... I don't know, like a place-holder? I don't know how to explain that feeling. It's not an imposter image, or even that I'm 'face-blind' to myself. I just don't put the eyes, ears, nose into a familiar group, like I would with other faces (I'm guessing here)</p>
<p>So when I read the comments and hear people talking about how they see themselves as 'tired', 'full', or 'glowing' I'm fascinated. I know what i feels like to feel tired, full, or glow..but I've never seen it in the 'me' in the mirror or a picture. I can put those impressions on others that I see but my own image seems greasy or frictionless, nothing sticks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is probably a generalization of The Illusion of Asymmetric Insight. We view ourselves as complex persons with unique inner turmoil and motivations, but think of others as simple creatures with broad-stroke opinions and motives.</p>
<p>The same things probably apply to our physical view of others. We look deeply at our own face but gloss over the mere presences of others most of the time.</p>
<p>Then we have Dunbar's Number, the genetically dictated limit on the mamalian brain as to how many peers the brain can handle as &quot;real individuals&quot;. Dunbar's Number for humans is about 150. When you meet someone new, when they transition from &quot;some guy in accounting&quot; to &quot;Bob, who helps me with the department budget&quot; they bump someone else out of the cache of real humans in your brain. When Bob becomes Bob, someone who used to be Terry becomes &quot;one of the guys I went to school with&quot;.</p>
<p>The meat in your head has practical limits, and there are more people on earth than there are slots in your brain.</p>
<p>Largely because you couldn't function if you had to give full and nuanced attention to every person you encountered day and night. Nobody's got time or emotional capacity for that.</p>
<p>So particularly when dealing with hundreds or thousands of people, we just use a mosaic of hair color, eye color, nose-size, sexual availability, and like/dislike metrics.</p>
<p>This modeling is the real, true, and correct definition of Stereotype.</p>
<p>Now don't trigger on that word, every non-proper noun is, itself, a stereotype, and society wouldn't function without stereotypes. Teacher, Cop, Waiter, Good Teacher, Bad Cop, Crappy Waiter, &quot;guy&quot;, &quot;girl&quot;, &quot;child&quot;, Pizza Guy, Cashier, Sargent... literally every title, role, and word that isn't a specific name for an individual is a stereotype.</p>
<p>This ability to stereotype is factually what allows civilization to function. We don't have to know every shop-keep in order to go shopping.</p>
<p>In other species where stereotypes have not yet evolved the troupe, tribe, pride, or pod must split when there are more individuals than the Dunbar's Number for the species brain because the individuals just aren't comfortable in a sea of strangers.</p>
<p>But we can live in cities of millions by being able to categorize strangers.</p>
<p>So all these forces are positive adaptations that let you see people in sets of expectations instead of just friend or foe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can't give a scientifically accurate answer but I know that our brains will pick up on the smallest changes of our own face and exaggerate them. So even if <em>you</em> look the same, <em>you</em> look different to yourself. </p>
<p>Same reason some of us tend to feel self conscious about certain facial features. If their proportions are perceived as off to you, for what ever reasons, they'll be exaggerated in your mind. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
