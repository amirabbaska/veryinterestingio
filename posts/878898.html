		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a link to an article covering the idea. NASA proposed that placing a surprisingly small magnet at the L1 Lagrange point between Mars and the Sun could shield the planet from solar radiation. This could bea first step toward terraforming. The magnet would only need to be 1 or 2 Tesla (the unit, not the car) which is no bigger than the magnet in a common MRI machine. [EDIT] A subsequent post states that this idea is based on old science, and possibly would not be as effective as once thought. Read on below. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not mentioned here, but critics of this idea have said this does nothing to block gamma rays which come from every direction unlike the sun.  While this is true the fact is this would solve immediate problems that make Mars uninhabitable.<br />
It's also been suggested that once a large colony is established on Mars one of the first industries could be manufacturing a large quantity of these magnetic dipole shields (or something similar) and creating a global shield to reduce gamma rays.  </p>
<p>But the main reason that criticism isn't compelling is that once the atmosphere grows and becomes denser it will also act as a barrier to reduce gamma rays.  </p>
<p>We have the technological ability today to see Mars's atmosphere grow in our lifetime.  That's very cool.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Mars core and mantle hasn't differentiated enough to have a strong magnetic core.  Mars just didn't have enough mass to sustain the long period of heat to concentrate the ferromagnetic material in its core.  One of the reasons that Mars is red is from all the iron-oxide on the surface.  </p>
<p>For Mars to regain its magnetic field, the core and the outer layers need to be the same temp it was 4.2 billion years ago.  Due to the crust being so shallow from the heat, life would be precarious at best  from all the volcanoes and earthquakes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The genesis of this question is a common misconception.  Mars' atmosphere was not ionized off by solar radiation (at least not significantly).   It was lost due to the lower gravity of Mars which reduces the escape velocity of atmospheric gases we commonly find on Earth. </p>
<p><a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-12-mars-atmosphere-solar.html" target="_blank">Mars atmosphere already well protected from the solar wind.</a></p>
<p>If you were to release sufficient gasses on Mars today, it's estimated that the atmosphere would remain for several million years (at least).   ...so the only barrier to terraforming is getting sufficient N2 O2, CO2 and H2O gas to Mars.  Which is not at all simple.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Magnetic fields of planets are caused bymagnetic fluids rotating inside the core.</p>
<p>Earth has molten iron while gas giants like jupiter probably has metallic hydrogren.</p>
<p>Either case. If the fluids in the core doesnt turn. Theres probably nothing we can do about it. Nuking the core like that hollywood movie is just dumb and wont even make a dent. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
