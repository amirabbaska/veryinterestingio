		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why were taxes so high?  World War II. </p>
<p>All the military equipment, all the soldiers' pay, all the medical expenses, all the expenses had to be paid, somehow.  </p>
<p>That somehow was with debt. Debt that had to be paid off by the government over the next 20-30 years.  </p>
<p>So, during WWII, the British government (and ALL governments, actually), sold massive amounts of debt (war bonds) to everybody and anybody.  </p>
<p>Years later, that debt had to be paid off. With interest.  To raise the amount of money needed to pay off that debt, the tax rates had to be ridiculously high, especially on high earners.  </p>
<p>Remember, England was VERY hard hit by the war.  Rationing did not end until the mid 1950's.  </p>
<p>Even the US had tax rates around 90% on top earners, in order to pay off the US war debt, pay for the rebuilding of Europe, and maintain the military at war footing for the first couple decades of the Cold War.  </p>
<p>And, during that time, the US (and the UK) paid DOWN their massive deficits to more sustainable levels.  </p>
<p>So, the whole debt crisis thing we keep talking about today, we KNOW how to reduce the debt.  </p>
<p>We just don't wanna.  </p>
<p>Were taxes that high sustainable?  Short term,yes. Long term, there wasn't a NEED to maintain the tax rates that high, once the hump of paying down the War Debt was gone.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people have dealt with questions of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6h2o0u/what_should_be_free_but_isnt/divvgx5/" target="_blank">tax brackets and flat taxes</a>, but I'm going to turn to the second part of your question: was it sustainable? The short answer is, yes. Probably. The history of taxes (especially in the US) is a fraught one, but it really can be divided into two eras: pre-Reagan, and post-Reagan. It's not a case of Democrat or Republican, no matter who might tell you otherwise. Tax rates reached their peak under Eisenhower, and they were lower under Clinton and Obama than they were for six out of Reagan's eight years in office.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, it's important to note that current top tax rates are <strong>not normal</strong>. Between the start of WWII and the Reagan Administration, <a href="http://federal-tax-rates.insidegov.com/" target="_blank">the top tax bracket never dropped below 70%</a>; since 1987, it's never risen above 40%. Why? Well, it mostly boils down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics" target="_blank">trickle-down economics</a> -- the belief (for better or for worse) that cutting taxes on the top earners will allow them to invest their money more freely, thus providing jobs down the line. As an economic theory, it's pretty flawed, not least because it assumes that the rich <em>will</em> reinvest their money, rather than squirrelling it away, as is often the case; if you want money put back into an economic system, it works better to give it to the poor, because they pretty much <em>have</em> to spend it. (Sidenote: 'trickle-down economics' is a branding nightmare to begin with, but it was originally known as 'horse and sparrow' economics -- the theory being that, 'if you feed the horse enough oats, some will pass through to the road for the sparrows'. It's got its detractors, is what I'm saying.)</p>
<p>Recent Presidents haven't been too keen to be seen to raise the tax rates (even though a more progressive tax structure actually benefits the majority of people), because a lot of people have a fundamental misunderstanding of how the tax bracket system works. They hear that number go up, and they immediately assume they'll be worse off, when in most cases they wouldn't be. (Take Reagan's tax shift in 1988. Under Reagan's plan, someone earning the median individual income in 1988 (<a href="http://www.davemanuel.com/median-household-income.php" target="_blank">$25,872</a>) would have paid about 19% in tax. Someone earning the same amount just two years earlier would have paid just 13.8% of his income in taxes. Compare that to someone earning $250,000, on the other hand: he would have paid about 27.7% in 1988, but 41.9% two years earlier. The top tax rate lowered from 50% in 1986 to 28% in 1988, but poorer people <em>actually paid more</em>.)</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Similar systems worked for decades. It might have needed a little tweaking, but generally yes, it would have been sustainable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its important to note that not all the income of a top earner was taxed at 95%. Income taxes usually work by brackets. Example with made up figures: Your first $18,000 is taxed at 10%, then $18,001 to $75,000 is taxed at 15%, etc. </p>
<p>In the U.S., the highest bracket currently is ~39% starting at ~$418k, so only income above 418k actually gets taxed at the highest rate. </p>
<p>I assume it works/worked like that in the U.K. too, where only income above a certain amount was taxed at 95%. </p>
<p>I wanted to point out tax brackets because I've run into so many people who don't realize that they're a thing. </p>
<p>As far as if it was sustainable...¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>
<p>I have a feeling political ideology will drive the answers in here because economics is hard and confusing and usually doesn't give clear cut answers. </p>
<p>edit: fixed some typos. Rushed this answer then jumped in the shower so I didn't do any proofreading.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right, so as an actual British person who has studied modern British history, I can give you an actual answer that isn't from Americans talking about America and WW2. </p>
<p>Following WW2, the two main parties, Labour and the Conservatives, agreed on major policies in a consensus known as Butskellism, named after the Conservative Rab Butler and the Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell. </p>
<p>This consensus basically followed the economic theory of Keynesianism which is that idea that the aim of the state should be to keep unemployment as low as possible and the best way to run the economy was to borrow to invest. Part of this theory was substantial high taxes on the wealthy which also helped pay for Britain's extensive welfare state and the sluggish economic situation at the time. </p>
<p>This consensus lasted until 1979 when Margaret Thatcher came to power and established a new consensus following monetarist policies. This is similar to &quot;Reaganomics&quot; in America. She, and Reagan, believed that individuals spent their money better than the government and so reduced taxes. She reduced the top rate of tax from around 83% to 40% in her first term and it's been like that ever since. </p>
<p>As to your question of &quot;was it sustainable?&quot;, well yes,  taxation like that lasted for 30 years and probably would've gone on for longer of Thatcher's economic policies hadn't become dominant in the UK</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something I think a lot of people are missing here, at least in America, is that while yes ww2 was a cause, another big reason for high tax rates was a response to the depression. Income inequality was at record high, the working class was suffering, unemployment was at 25% and there were huge outcries for action. There was a huge movement to &quot;soak the rich&quot; by sticking it to them with high tax rates. So they made the top bracket for rich people 90%+ and used it to find new deal programs. Of course no one actually paid said rates because they implemented loopholes to allow rich people to invest in businesses and jobs. This caused businesses to expand in order to avoid being taxed. This not only created jobs, but well paying jobs that led to the the post war economic boom with the middle class being as rich as it was. </p>
<p>I'd argue one of the reasons income inequality is rising again is because we lowered these rates. So the rich hoard the wealth to themselves, and the incomes of the bottom 80% stagnate or decline. </p>
<p>To be fair I'm not sure the same justifications of the 95% policy apply to the uk, but that is one way of looking at it in the us. It was used as an incentive for the rich to invest their money into companies and grow the economy rather than increasing their own paychecks. No one actually paid 95% in practice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
