<p>Edit: Wow! Thanks everyone for your concern and comments. My mom has now been cancer free for almost ten years to the day. It's also worth noting that a year before a doctor had said her lump wasn't an issue, and a year later it was problematic. Always get a second opinion if you feel like something isn't right. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Breasts are like a bowl of oatmeal. It's a little lumpy but it's a very consistent lumpy. This is perfectly naturally and nothing to worry about it.</p>
<p>Now imagine a pea in that bowl of oatmeal. It's larger and firmer than the oatmeal lumps and it's obvious and sticks out. And if you're familiar with the oatmeal lumps, you know that pea lump was not there before. THAT'S the kind of lumps you should be looking for.</p>
<p>EDIT: Holy crap! Thanks guys! For the record, I am not a doctor or medical professional, just a random person who read this analogy elsewhere amd would credit them if I kbew where. Sadly, I don't know if this applies to male breasts or testicles or other body parts. Ask your doctor folks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I presume you’re checking your breast for lumps to check for breast cancer.</p>
<p>Also know there’s a rare and very aggressive breast cancer that doesn’t have a lump called inflammatory breast cancer. Instead your breast will have a very sudden change in size because of swelling. My breast went from a healthy C cup to double D in 11 days. This cancer blocks the lymph glands on the skin and the breast quickly swells.</p>
<p>Other symptoms are</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>red or splotchy skin on the breast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one breast just feels heavier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the nipple becomes flattened or even inverted because of swelling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the breast is warm to the touch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The breast hurts. In my case I had sharp shooting pains, though other women complain of a dull, constant ache.</p>
</li>
<li>And this is the tell-tale sign... the skin in your breast takes on the appearance of an orange. It becomes  dimpled and ridged just like an orange and is called peau d’orange.</li>
</ol>
<p>If these symptoms appear, get yourself to a doctor. If you’re lucky, the doctor will recognize what you have and treatment begins immediately. If not, you may be prescribed a course of antibiotics to rule out mastitis. If the symptoms haven’t decreased by day 5, insist on an <strong>incisional</strong> biopsy.</p>
<p>This cancer grows in chains rather than a lump. I had six biopsies over five months that were either fine needle aspirations or core needle biopsies and still nothing. I had mammograms and nothing. I had several ultrasounds and it showed what looked like a cyst. Finally they decided to do an incisional biopsy after 5 months and discovered the cancer. </p>
<p>This five month delay in diagnosis and treatment is very common. It’s a fairly rare cancer and women aren’t taught to look for it and doctors don’t recognize it either. In my case the delay allowed cancer to spread to my skin, brain, bone, right breast, lymph nodes galore and the pleural cavity around my lungs. Stage IV at 31. The cancer showed up when I was 30, but not diagnosed until I was 31. </p>
<p>This cancer is rare, but extraordinarily aggressive. If you have these symptoms, you must seek and insist on treatment.</p>
<p>I am extremely lucky to still be alive almost 21 years later. I’m so lucky I’m actually part of a study to discover why I’m one if the very few stage IV cancer patients to survive long-term.  </p>
<p>We’re making progress, but we still have a very high mortality rate. </p>
<p>If you are or have a woman in your life, know these symptoms because your doctor may not. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s best to check either in the shower with your arm up or laying down with your arm extended behind you . You have to extend the arm on the same side as your boob and use your opposite hand to gently squeeze around. Mostly on the sides and bottom is worrisome. On top may most likely come and go and be there due to your period, the area right around the nipple is always gonna feel that way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much feeling for lumps, but feeling for changes.<br />
This is why doing checks regularly is important.<br />
So it feels all lumpy.  Keep a mental map.  This part was harder.  This part was softer.<br />
Check again later.  Wait, this soft lumpy place now had a hard point!<br />
You are checking for changes.<br />
This goes for men too!<br />
Check your testicles!  It doesn't take much.  Just give them a slight probing squeeze.<br />
Do they feel different?  Is it suddenly painful?  (this may sound silly but also completely true and relevant) If you shine a light through your scrotum does it shine and glow or is it blackened/obscured?  If you notice a change, see your doctor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
