		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tian Tian, the female panda at Edinburgh Zoo, was artificially inseminated on the 13th of April 2014 after natural conception failed to occur. The panda displayed all the signs of pregnancy up until mid-September, at which point hormone levels returned to normal. The zoo reckons that re-absorption of the foetus took place.</p>
<p>The director of giant pandas at Edinburgh Zoo said: &quot;Panda reproduction and biology is complex; all data gathered since conception took place pointed to a pregnant panda likely to carry to full term, sadly this did not happen. There is no evidence she has had a miscarriage, so late reabsorption of the foetus could have occurred.&quot;</p>
<p>This is the second time Tian Tian had been artificially inseminated at Edinburgh Zoo, the same thing happened last year (appeared to be pregnant, foetus reabsorbed). </p>
<p>Therefore, to answer your question, artificial insemination of pandas does occur but is not necessarily successful.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Giant panda biologist (currently and very actively working on their ecology, behavior, and reintroduction in Sichuan, China) here. As some people have pointed out, we do use AI, often in conjunction with natural breeding, and it works very well. We continually modify the procedure, and also do a lot of research on when, where, and how best to get them to reproduce. Pandas are very specialized and uniquely evolved bears and very little known about them in the wild, which is why it took so long (~40+ years) to get the high captive breeding success rate we currently see.
Going further, because there is a lot of misinformation about panda conservation out there, there are several strong reasons why we focus so much effort on conserving pandas in the wild. First, &quot;Why do we focus so much on preservation of a species that just... doesn't want to live anymore?&quot; is not a legitimate question in any way. That is a horribly anthropomorphized and ill-informed view, which I hear/see too often. The underlying assumption is that because it is difficult to breed pandas in captivity they must not want to continue their species. The panda lineage split off from the rest of the bears over 20 million years ago and continued to diverge. They, as much as any other animal, are a product of their evolution. This is like asking why a human woman can't just have two or three menstrual cycles a month. It simply isn't how we evolved. Does this mean that we (the species who absolutely caused them to slide so close to extinction) should simply call it a loss because it is difficult and costs too much money? I personally don't think so.<br />
One of the main reasons we focus so much attention on giant panda conservation stems from the fact that, in general, humans don't care about saving the majority of biodiversity. Try to raise money, public, private, and governmental support to protect a huge expanse of land for an endangered species of worm. How well do you see that going? The track record isn't very good for such endeavors. Giant pandas are easily the most recognized symbol of conservation that exists. Because of giant pandas there are over 50 protected national reserves in their  range in China, a number that has more than tripled in the past couple decades, and will continue to grow. Within these reserves there are a large number of species, endangered or otherwise, which now benefit from the protection afforded by measures primarily focussed on protecting pandas. This is critical in modern China, with the huge rate of development and natural resource extraction.
Another consideration, which has been discussed below a bit, is the potential ecological ramifications of their extinction. I will say again, we know very, very little about pandas in the wild. They are extremely difficult to study because of their elusive nature and the terrain. It would be highly presumptive to think we could accurately estimate the net effects of their loss to the ecosystems in which they live. Various scientists are working on that now, but it may be  a while until we get a generalized answer. It is not hard to imagine that an animal that can eat, process, and defecate 40-60 lbs of bamboo might considerably impact some aspects of its local habitat (flora, fauna, soil chemistry, etc.).
I could go on about why we focus on them for a while, but I would like to finish by noting that there is a huge misconception about how conservation dollars are spent. The majority of money being spent on the conservation of giant pandas is coming from within China. Regardless of the various motivating factors that might exist for those decision makers who allocate this money towards pandas (political, economic, environmental concern, etc.), its not as if it was taken from a big pot, and would have otherwise been spent on white rhinos, mountain gorillas, or panamanian golden frogs. Most of that money would probably just sit in government coffers. People love pandas. They are charismatic megafauna, who have a kind of asian mystique about them. While in a perfect world I would love if we could better allocate conservation dollars in a more scientifically based method, this simply isn't realistic. I also don't know how much this would change the amount we do focus on pandas. We have to do the best with what we have, and with pandas we can protect a ton of land for a lot of animals, and hopefully prove to the world that conservation efforts can work if enough time, effort, and money is spent on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's also not as easy as just injecting sperm willy-nilly in captive populations of endangered species, as nice as that sounds. Because numbers of giant pandas are low, a lot of care has to be taken to reduce the effects of inbreeding depression. This requires careful consideration of which individuals are providing the sperm and usually means bringing in sperm from wild populations or from different institutions. See: </p>
