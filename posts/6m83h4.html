		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen it explained this way: the immune system has two major branches.  One mostly fights bacterial invaders, and the other fights parasites, like worms. </p>
<p>Humans co-evolved with worms.  We have been in an arms race with the annelids since before there were humans at all.  Basically every human, everywhere, carried a worm burden.  It wasn't a question of &quot;if&quot;, it was &quot;how many&quot;.   The last hundred years or so are the first time, in all of human history, that we haven't all been loaded down with the little jerks. </p>
<p>One current hypothesis right now (edging into theory, perhaps, but I believe it's still a hypothesis at the moment), is that in the absence of anything to attack, the anti-parasite branch of the immune system goes after other, random stuff.   It wildly overreacts to the wrong proteins, because it's never seen the <em>right</em> proteins.  In addition, worms that routinely infect humans also secrete chemicals that moderate the immune response, so between the two things (lack of moderating chemicals, and lack of invaders to fight), we end up with pollen allergies. </p>
<p>There's pretty good evidence that dosing yourself with worms will reduce or even eliminate allergies and some auto-immune disorders.  Pig whipworms are a common treatment; you drink a glass with some eggs in it, and they set up shop in your intestine.  They can live in us, lasting about a year, but they can't successfully reproduce, so you get the benefit of worms in your system without being infectious.  </p>
<p>This is a real treatment, administered by real doctors.  It's called &quot;helminthic therapy&quot;.  I haven't tried it, but overall reports seem pretty positive.  It doesn't work for everyone, but it works often enough to be very interesting for those with immune-system issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>To give some further background on the immune system:</em><br />
Allergies are caused by your immune system reacting to specific molecules.    </p>
<p>Your immune system has several varieties of <strong>antibody</strong> (the parts that detect pathogens and cause immune reactions).<br />
Five in fact:  </p>
<ul>
<li>IgA  </li>
<li>IgD  </li>
<li>IgE  </li>
<li>IgG  </li>
<li>IgM  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IgE</strong> is the antibody which is associated with allergies (an overreaction by this antibody).    </p>
<p>Interestingly; IgE is only found in mammals - making it 'young' (on the evolutionary timeline) compared to those found in fish, reptiles, and insects.      </p>
<p>Part of the theory behind allergies considers that IgE is 'new', its cutting edge, and could be considered an work-in-progress (in evolutionary terms).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The immune system relies on encountering pathogens during the early stages of life in order to properly develop. This means that it needs to encounter all kinds of things, harmful or not, in order to figure out which ones are worth fighting and which ones are harmless.</p>
<p>There is a theory that we have achieved such a level of cleanness in our homes that sometimes the immune system cannot develop properly, and becomes prone to false positives, such as pollen or many other things. People who grow up in a more dirty environment usually don't tend to develop allergies as much as those who grew up in clean environments. If the theory is true, then it makes sense that this condition is fairly recent in human history, so evolution would not have had time to &quot;figure it out&quot; yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're living in unnatural conditions. Our immune system is evolved to be suitable for life in an environment full of dirt and animals, insect bites and the associated foreign fluids, and with our bodies containing numerous parasitic infections e.g. tapeworms, lice. People who live in similar conditions today don't get allergies.</p>
<p>For some people - like you - when the immune system can't detect any shit, dirt or parasites, then it &quot;decides&quot; that the problem must be that it's not looking hard enough (because from the evolutionary perspective, there always <em>was</em> dirt, shit and parasites to be found), it tries harder and attacks the most suspicious thing it <em>can</em> detect, which often is pollen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
