		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are libraries of information on this topic! So interesting!</p>
<p>This is my favorite topic in psychology, but I'm not at home, or I would end up taking two days to reply!</p>
<p>This is a subject that actually predates psychology. Darwin says that facial expressions are universal (he tested this by having missionaries conduct surveys all over the world). All cultures share a core group of expressions.
Some psychologists say there are six universals: Ekman/Friesen/Shaver, some say three-Field; Plutchik says eight, Izard says ten, Feleky says 86 universal emotional expressions!</p>
<p>Darwin also said that emotional expressions fulfill an evolutionary purpose. When you smell something disgusting, you open your mouth and stick your tongue out in a wide manner--like a spout. Even though you are smelling something gross--you automatically react physically like you are spitting out something gross. As we get older, we can control it better by not sticking our tongue out or opening our mouths--but we still flare our nostrils--like we're preparing to make that face.</p>
<p>Blind children do these expressions, as well as isolated cultures--this indicates that facial expressions are native.</p>
<p>The trembling of the lip is associated with sadness or often pouting. Native children were studied by Darwin (his savages) and he found, that just like his own children, they protrude their bottom lip when they're sad--but as they grow up--stop doing this.</p>
<p>The evolutionary need, it has been speculated, is that the child is signaling the need for a breast to feed! So when our lip trembles, it may be a remnant of that response. </p>
<p>But of course--some believe the total opposite. Zajonc (and Waynbaum) believed that expression actually CAUSED the emotion by manipulating facial nerves and cranial blood flow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The acute stress reaction (sudden, extreme anger, frustration, grief or excitement) often leads to neurogenic tremors. It's not just your lip, but many other parts of your body start to quiver -- worsened when initiating movement. In this case, your mouth might quiver because you want to talk. In anger, you notice your hands might also start to quiver if you want to hit something. Often it's just involuntary and your legs may even give way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When you cry, there’s a momentary loss of composition of your face. It’s somewhat disturbing to experience. When we lose control of our usual symmetry and calm, that could be frightening. The muscles in your face tense up and cause the shaking shivering quivering, and naturally, you turn into this: <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eeda77b3b924c6cd9ac3ce46e1300ca4-c?convert_to_webp=true" target="_blank">https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eeda77b3b924c6cd9ac3ce46e1300ca4-c?convert_to_webp=true</a></p>
