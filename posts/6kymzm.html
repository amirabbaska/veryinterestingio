		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fiber. </p>
<p>The density and, er, stability of feces is a measure of water and fiber, at its most basic. </p>
<p>Consume a proper water and fiber for the 'best' feces. Other things like indigestible sugars also contribute (sugar alcohols like xylitol) by passing through largely intact.  </p>
<p>Long version:</p>
<p>Fecal make-up is based on health and diet. A diet rich in fiber will produce denser, drier (but not too dry, it should still be 'soft' but firm), and sturdier feces. The best wiping feces are the ones you don't have to push out, but come out as a semi solidish 'log' mostly on their own. </p>
<p>When you push, you're forcing fecal matter that may not be 'ready' through a small hole. Imagine pushing a banana through a rubber tube. If the tube and the banana are properly aligned, the banana will slide through easily. If the banana is too soft, you have to press it though, and that causes smearing. </p>
<p>Fiber firms up and gives structure to your feces. Proper water supply allows your colon to coat the feces in a mucus for passing. You need enough fiber to have sturdy feces and enough water for it to be slick. If it's off, then the feces can be too soft for the mucus to help, requiring you to push it out, which smears it like the banana. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fiber is good, but don't forget hair.  </p>
<p>The optimal ass-hair length is short but not bare, like facial hair after a week or two of not shaving. I shave once every couple of months and bear the itching for a day in order to get months without a dingle-berry as my reward. Wipes with a bald ass are the worst because your toilet paper tends to get stuck to your skin.  </p>
<p>if you want proof I'm right, take a gob of peanut butter and put it in your hair when it's ~1&quot; long, then try to wipe it out with toilet paper. It gets all in the hair and you can't get it out without a million wipes. If you have a buzz cut it will wipe out much easier.  </p>
<p>TL;DR - Give your ass a buzz cut</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fats in your diet - undigested fats make for a messy infinity wipe. Disease sometimes plays a role in this - if your digestive system is on the fritz, it can cause constipation, diarrhea, and really spectacularly disgusting poop due to undigested foods being present. Pale yellow/whitish poops that smear like peanut butter, float, are sometimes frothy, and smell like the devil have undigested fats in them. Time to get to a doctor if you are seeing this. Edit: I have celiac disease - an autoimmune disease of the guts. Poop issues were first clues! Seriously, poop needs to be mentioned more at the Dr's office. I would have been diagnosed years earlier if I had thought to mention greasy poop to the Dr. I thought it was normal, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
