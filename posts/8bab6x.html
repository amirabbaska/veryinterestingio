		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very little. There are all sorts of studies where people in sleep studies claim terrible or awesome sleep, yet their sleep data is very similar.</p>
<p>Much of how we understand our own sleep comes down to bias and perception. If you sleep through something, you don't remember it. You only remember the times you woke up, yet some people use that to &quot;prove&quot; that every little noise sets them off.</p>
<p>You normally cycle through four stages of sleep every night. At NREM 1, you are right in the fuzzy grey zone of awake and asleep. Your brain is still aware of a lot of external surroundings (sounds, sleeping next to someone who tosses and turns all night) and you are easy to wake up in that stage. When you hit NREM 3, you are pretty much dead to the world, scientifically speaking. It takes a lot to wake you up, your brain really wants to ignore everything, and if you do wake up in this stage, you will feel gross and kind of out of it. Since you hit these stages more than once a night, you will naturally be more awake or more asleep at various points in the night. That's normal and healthy. People naturally spend less time in NREM 3 and REM sleep as they get older.</p>
<p>People who experience hypervigilance (as in subclinical anxiety problems, anxiety disorders, or disorders related to trauma like PTSD) are &quot;scanners.&quot; This (a) has a <em>huge</em> impact on quality of sleep, and (b) makes them very sensitive to any sort of sleep disturbance, which makes the problem seem a lot bigger than it really is because it means interpreting normal sleep functions (hitting light sleep stages during the night) as a problem or threat.</p>
<p>That there are tons of sleep disorders, mental illnesses, physical illnesses, etc. out there that mess with normal sleep architecture, so for those people, they may spend more time in light sleep stages or otherwise find their sleep getting a bit messy and therefore be more likely to wake up. Some sleep medications (especially benzos and z-drugs like zopiclone) also mess up sleep architecture, ironically. Regular old alcohol and other drugs can have similar effects.</p>
<p>ETA: If you consistently have poor sleep, talk to your doctor!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a fair bit of evidence that adenosine metabolism is important for sleep regulation. There are reports of natural polymorphisms in adenosine deaminase that make you more likely to be a very deep sleeper or not, and maybe others in adenosine receptors. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/102/43/15676" target="_blank">http://www.pnas.org/content/102/43/15676</a></p>
<p>This makes a ton of sense, as the most famous keep-awake drug is caffeine, which structurally looks like adenosine and is thought to act on the adenosine sensing pathway to keep you awake.</p>
<p>It's hard to explain like you're five, but basically your brain makes something that builds up over time and makes you sleepy. Some people build up that thing slower or remove it faster, and that makes them sleep harder or lighter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure you've heard of the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response. This is known as the body's sympathetic nervous system. This system tells your body &quot;shut down unessential functions (like pooping), direct more resources to core functions like (increase heart rate, mental acuity).&quot; Most people think this is only activated in literal fight or flight scenarios, but in reality, your sympathetic system is activated under a huge range of stressful situations.</p>
<p>The opposite of this system is called the &quot;rest and digest&quot; (or the &quot;shit and sleep&quot;) system - the parasympathetic nervous system. This system tells your body &quot;you're in no danger. Feel free to do things like shit and sleep.&quot; </p>
<p>At any given point, your body has a certain ratio of sympathetic activation vs parasympathetic activation. This is known as autonomic tone. Everyone has their own baseline autonomic tone. Some people higher, some lower.</p>
<p>You've probably noticed that when you go to sleep in an agitated state  - anxiety about work, for example - you get subjectively worse sleep than normal. This is because you are experiencing elevated autonomic tone.</p>
<p>To generalize this across the population to light vs heavy sleepers, people with higher baseline autonomic tone tend to be lighter sleepers - their bodies are more prone to the fight or flight response, and they can't fall into as deep a sleep. Conversely, heavy sleepers tend to have lower baseline autonomic tone, letting them fall into deeper sleep.</p>
<p>This only accounts for part of the differences between light and heavy sleepers, and comes with a ton of caveats. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What if you wake up every few hours, but it doesn’t bother you? I can fall asleep in less than 5 minutes, so when I wake up, I look at the clock and go “Nice! I can sleep for 4 more hours” or whatever it is til my alarm goes off.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>is there such a thing as the best of both, or neither?</p>
<p>I'm a deep sleeper in that I can sleep; in under 5 mins of laying my head down, in the middle of a loud party, on a bus or train, with an infant sleeping on top of me, with an action movie blasting on the tv, in the middle of the day if I'm tired.</p>
<p>I'm a light sleeper in that I wake; immediately clear vs ever being groggy, to odd noises in the middle the night, alarm clocks on another floor, at a designated time without using an alarm clock (I actually hate alarm clocks and rather be the alarm for all members of my household), before my stop arrives when riding public transit.</p>
<p>I've always felt this was my genetic lottery win and both my children exhibit similar traits, though my eldest far more than his sibling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
