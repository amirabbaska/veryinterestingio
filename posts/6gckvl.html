<p><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" target="_blank">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks</a></p>
<p>&quot;The origins of this phenomenon are at least Older Than Print, and probably much older. The idea that words can grant power is a cross cultural phenomenon that shows up frequently in the earliest tales of swords and sorcery. Members of the Sinitic ethnolinguistic family in particular tend to ascribe special importance to the power of written characters, and the belief that special words can invoke control over supernatural power permeates their folklore (just ask your local Shinto, Buddhist, or Taoist practitioner if they've donated to a shrine or temple to have a talisman written lately). The magic power of spoken and written words was also a key concept in Ancient Egyptian religion and Ritual Magic.</p>
<p>In terms of realism, this has some ground as traditional and even some current practitioners of martial arts hold the belief that accompanying statements and/or vocal noises alongside execution build up their chi, thereby increasing the power and efficacy of their moves and techniques. Put less spiritually, saying a phrase at the right time during an attack ensures proper breathing. A call used for this reason is known as a kiai. The naming of attacks also served a more practical purpose as many martial arts schools, Chinese ones in particular, used to be secret societies. The passing down of techniques was done orally and giving them esoteric names often facilitated this transmission. In addition, kiai has the potential to startle the opponent and give you an opening.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nosebleed" target="_blank">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nosebleed</a></p>
<p>&quot;In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties. [...]</p>
<p>The nosebleed is a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>u/makinait said in comments: &quot;Re: nosebleeds, they haven't mentioned that visually it we as invented + popularised in the 70's by comedic pioneer Yasuji Tanioka. [source] (<a href="https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%B0%B7%E5%B2%A1%E3%83%A4%E3%82%B9%E3%82%B8" target="_blank">https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%B0%B7%E5%B2%A1%E3%83%A4%E3%82%B9%E3%82%B8</a>)&quot;
Here's a short note about [Yasuji Tanioka] (<a href="http://users.skynet.be/mangaguide/au1907.html" target="_blank">http://users.skynet.be/mangaguide/au1907.html</a>) in English. [This article] (<a href="http://users.skynet.be/mangaguide/au1907.html" target="_blank">http://users.skynet.be/mangaguide/au1907.html</a>) claims the nosebleed was first used in his 1970s manga Yasuji no Mettameta Gaki Dou Kouza. Other artists started using this idea because in some genres it's preferable to being explicit.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Naming attacks is a tradition dating back to giant robot shows in the 1970s, to encourage young children to shout the names of giant robot Mazinger Z's attacks as he performed them. Focus testing showed that this made the show more engaging, and other children's anime adopted this strategy. (There aren't many credible English-language sources for this, but whether or not it's the originator, Mazinger Z was definitely the show that introduced &quot;called attacks&quot; to the mainstream.)</p>
<p>Nosebleeds as a sign of arousal comes from the belief that people get nosebleeds when excited in general. I've also heard some Japanese people claim that there's an old wives' tale that nosebleeds are specifically a symptom of arousal or sexual attraction, but I haven't seen definite evidence that this predates the existence of the animated trope. Whatever the origin, it was popularized by the anime Urusei Yatsura in the 1980s and became widespread among romantic comedy anime in the 1990s.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They had a virgin guy suddenly be confronted with a topless girl to see if a nosebleed happens. Interesting watch.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, most of them come from superstition or folklore. My knowledge is limited on the topic, but there is one trope I can speak to.</p>
<p>Sometimes in an anime, you might notice that when a character is being spoken about by other characters, they will do a jump cut to that character sneezing. Or they'll have a conversation play out about a character who's in the next scene, and that scene will start with the sneeze.</p>
<p>This trope is because of a Japanese superstition that when you sneeze, it means somebody's talking about you behind your back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
