I was wondering if perhaps it had to do with how the chocolate was tempered or the particle sizes and grain in the ingredients, or something else. I also noticed this happens much less in milk chocolate, which would make sense since it is less brittle. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Materials engineer and here, so I'll weigh in.  The answer stating it's an amorphous material is part of the answer.  It's not a complete answer since the milk chocolate is also an amorphous material and doesn't exhibit the failure mode to the same level.  Plus, both are not 100% amorphous since there is some recrystallization during cooling, I'm sure.  The other key here is the dark chocolate is harder, and more brittle.  This means when breaking the material, more energy is required (input to the equation) which leads to a brittle and catastrophic failure (more energy out in a shorter period of time), thus less controlled and more random.  It's also why you'll see more sharp fragments in the break vs. softer/weaker materials such as the milk chocolate.</p>
<p>The other note here is regarding the squares in the bar formed by the mold, and why the break doesn't always follow the pattern.  This has to do with the sharpness at the bottom of the valley of the pattern as well as the break direction.  A stress riser is formed (on the tension side) in the valley that is proportional to 1 / square of the radius of the groove.  The sharper the groove, the higher the stress.  Many of these squares have large radius grooves in them, for looks, but they don't concentrate the force very well to drive the cracking to happen at the groove; especially if you hold the bar with the grooves towards you and push away - the tensile force is now on the surface without grooves.  Break the other way to have a higher chance of perfect squares.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If glass looked like a chocolate bar and you tried to break off a chunk in the corner (with your hands at variable stress applications) it would probably not break as expected.

<p>1/2 the thickness in an amorphous solid tightly interwoven and sporadic is not nearly as weak as a warped grain boundary that happens to separate the two pieces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is my input from a stress analysis and material property point of view. Of a student, studying this for 5 years. </p>
<p>Milk chocolate is admittedly more ductile (less brittle) than dark chocolate. Maybe this has to do with the milk, I do not know. This is important, because we need to know about stress-strain curves. Essentially the more stress you impart onto a material, the more it elongates and changes shape. Ductile materials can absorb a lot of energy and change shape (called plastic deformation) but brittle materials will fail before they become plastic (they remain within the elastic region). </p>
<p>I.e you can “bend” a paper clip and it will flex (elastic deformation) or you can really bend and tweak it and it will never bend back to normal on its own (plastic deformation). A paper clip is ductile (aluminum) but if it were made of glass per se, any flexural stress would cause it to shatter. Not that glass is a perfectly brittle substance (glass is weird) but you get the idea.</p>
<p>So you have a bar of milk chocolate, uniform for all intents and purposes. And now you press some grooves into it. What is does, amongst other things, is create an area of stress concentration within the bar shape. So if you apply a bending moment, for example, the stress will propagate through the material but “collect” at these points of stress concentration. to relate it to a thermal map, the grooves are red hot areas in terms of stress. </p>
<p>But dark chocolate is brittle. Do grooves create stress concentrations, but the bar is already only able to carry a little bit of stress due to brittleness. So relating to a thermal map, this whole bar is a little bit red. And when you impart a bending moment to break it, the stress from your fingers is very high at that point. And the bar, unable to effectively transfer all of that bending stress, will snap unpredictably. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
