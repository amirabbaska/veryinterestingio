In practice you will be limited by either the capacity of your centrifuge (&gt;4 liters is tough to spin on most centrifuges) or the DNA isolation column (which could probably be made larger, but are designed generally for &lt;10 mL).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>thanks to PCR, or the Polymerase Chain Reaction, we can make copies of DNA from a single cell/molecule - since there are about 500 million cells in a drop of blood, you could dilute to the point where when you pull out a single microliter to do the PCR reaction and get a single cell or (the right) piece of DNA, you would be able to amplify it...and you only need to PCR amplify and sequence a small portion to determine what species it came from (DNA Barcoding). There is also WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) using RCAT (Rolling Circle Amplification Technology) which lets you make more copies of all the DNA in your very dilute samples.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a lot of calculations in here so I'll give it a try. When you ask &quot;determine the DNA of the blood sample?&quot; I'm going to assume using PCR to detect a single gene. If you mean whole genome sequencing, that's going to require a whole lot more sample.</p>
<p>Volume in a drop of blood: 5 µL</p>
<p>Total mass of DNA in a drop of blood: ~75 ng</p>
<p>Mass of whole human genome: ~5 pg</p>
<p>Assuming we use a very sensitive digital droplet thermal cycler, we can detect as low as 4 copies of a specific gene. Therefore, using a sample volume of 5 µL, we could dilute the drop of blood in 15,000 drops of water and still detect a specific target by PCR.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the other posters have said, theoretically an infinite amount. However, I would add that adding blood cells to just water would cause them to swell and burst, releasing the contents of the cell, including the DNA. This would then be degraded by the endo and exonucleases naturally present in the cell, into a bunch of useless nucleotides. So, in practice, probably the amount of water that would cause the cells to burst or the amount that would fit into lab equipment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there's about 10000 white blood cells per ml so if your &quot;drop&quot; is say 50 microliters it contains about 10000/20 = 500 white blood cells. You need at least 1 cell to detect the DNA so you could dilute your &quot;drop&quot; with 499 &quot;drops&quot; of water and theoretically still be able to detect the DNA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
