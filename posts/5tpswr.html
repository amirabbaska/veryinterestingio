		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Driving well under the speed limit can be just as dangerous as speeding, and impeding traffic is against the law in most jurisdictions. Cyclists are generally required to obey the same traffic laws as drivers, but their slow speed often results in dangerous situations on roads where there are no bike lanes. Usually you can easily pass a cyclist on the side of the road, but often times you can't, like on one lane roads with lots of oncoming traffic. It seems like cyclists are held to different standards than drivers in these circumstances. Why is this?</p></div></div>

You must stop at stop signs and yield right of way, they must signal properly and they must stay as far right as possible in the appropriate lane.  </p>
<p>They're held to a slightly different standard because they are more vulnerable to injury or death, not having a reinforced metal chassis around them.  But they are by no means exempt from traffic laws.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cyclists are held to the same standards. Here are some things that cyclists are prohibited from doing:</p>
<p>-Riding the wrong way down a one way street.</p>
<p>-Running stop signs</p>
<p>-Running red lights</p>
<p>In the U.S., 0.9% of all trips made by vehicle are done by cyclists. Few cyclists on the road means few opportunities for traffic enforcement. In my city, there are areas where 15% of the traffic is bicycles. More cyclists get ticketed there than anywhere else in the city. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cyclists usually bike in cities or suburbs where minimum speed limits are rare (at least in cities where I've lived). Speed minimums typically exist on freeways, where bicycles are usually forbidden anyway. </p>
<p>And, as you said, it's usually very easy to pass a bicycle. Even on a one lane road there is often a shoulder which gives enough room for the bicycle to move over, allowing the vehicle to pass. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
