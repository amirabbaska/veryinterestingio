		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most common form of colorblindness is <a href="http://14635-presscdn-0-96.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/colorblindcompare2.jpg" target="_blank">to see red and green as the same color</a>. </p>
<p>Sometimes it's because the red or green cone cells are missing, but usually it's because <a href="http://www.colour.org.uk/fig3.gif" target="_blank">they respond to almost the same color light</a> (vs <a href="http://www.colour.org.uk/fig1.gif" target="_blank">normal vision</a>)</p>
<p>How the glasses work is by blocking <a href="http://enchroma.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/enchromacx.png.pagespeed.ce.9wjKP4OmOd.png" target="_blank">colors between red and green where there is the most overlap</a> it allows the faulty red and green cones to see enough difference to distinguish red from green.</p>
<p>Now if you wanted to change how you see colors with glasses you'd never be able to create exactly what a colorblind person sees (that would require &quot;creating&quot; light), but if you wore glasses that were strongly tinted green then technically you would be seeing in monochrome (black and green of course, not black and white). Same goes for red or blue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What happens if &quot;normal&quot; people wearing them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My understanding is that Enchroma glasses work by utilizing a notch filter design. The glasses contain rare-earth metals that block out specific wavelength regions that strongly overlap in people who are red-green colorblind. As a result, red and green become easier to distinguish. A person with normal color vision would see a more salient difference between red and green. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrEyOkNRzGI" target="_blank">Youtube video</a> explains it fairly well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do they see B&amp;W?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could the glasses be modified to do so?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><del>Yes, it should be possible with appropriate filters in place.</del> Edit: As someone pointed out, it would be difficult to modify them for black-and-white vision. However, some filters could be used that would severely limit the range of color vision (e.g., giving everything a greenish tint).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you might thing colourblind people see in black and white, but they usually don't. Normally they see in colour but have difficulty telling colours apart because red and green look more similar to one another. Here are some examples: <a href="http://www.improveeyesighthq.com/images/xcolorblind-view.jpg.pagespeed.ic.OGwZRSW79O.jpg" target="_blank">1</a> <a href="http://wearecolorblind.com/wp-content/uploads/general-example-2-types2.jpg" target="_blank">2</a> <a href="http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sgrais/images/ColorBlind/112-1259_IMG.jpg" target="_blank">3</a>.</p>
<p>This kind of colourblindness, &quot;red-green colourblindness&quot; is sometimes called colour deficiency to make it clearer that people still see colours.</p>
<p>There is a condition called achromatopsia which means you see in black and white, but the Enchroma glasses that you're referring to don't work for those people.</p>
<p>So anyway, normal colourblindness that can be corrected by glasses occurs because the sensitivity of a colourblind person's colour-sensitive cells is wrong, and the red and green cells both respond most strongly to very similar-coloured light. This means that, for a protanomalous person, something that looks vibrant green to you will look more like orange to them, and something that looks strongly red to you will still look red, but much darker and might be confused with brown or black.</p>
<p>The glasses work, as other people have explained, by filtering out the wavelengths of light that lie in the strongly-overlapping portion between red and green. So if something is vibrant green, the reddish-green wavelengths that it reflects won't hit your eyes, only the green wavelengths. The red cells will still be stimulated, but less, so you see it as greener.</p>
<p>If a normal person wears them, well of course those wavelengths are still filtered out but it doesn't have much of an impact because they weren't that confusing to begin with. However, a normal person will still see the colours as a bit more vibrant (according to a colleague who has them and who is not colourblind).</p>
<p>Short of mysterious quantum technology or glasses that are really cameras and screens like VR headsets, there are strict limits on what glasses can do with colour. They can basically only reduce the amount of a certain colour that gets passed by a certain fraction. They can't add more colour - i.e. light - because that would require them to consume energy. They also can't reduce the amount of a colour according to how much of <em>another</em> colour there is, because that's not how optical filters work.</p>
<p>Hence there's no way to design ordinary glasses which make a person see in black and white, because this would require all colours to be equally strong or weak after passing through the filter; that requires their strengths to change relative to one another which a filter cannot do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have these glasses and am red-green colour blind. When I put them on, I can see orange, red, pink, purple, green, and tell them apart from other colours. They're distinct.</p>
<p>When someone without colour blindness puts them on, they say that it really brings out the red and greens, And everything else looks mildly more vibrant.</p>
<p>To me, they were the gift of a life time, And I'm lucky to have received it so young. I've got a lot of colour to look forward to. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
