		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I want you to hold both thumbs out in front of you, holding your hands apart. Look at one thumb, then look at the other. Chances are your eyes snapped from one to the other quickly.
Eyes in general don't focus well when an image is moving too much, so tend to try to keep things stable by &quot;snapping&quot; from image to image. Even when you're trying to read or looks slowly across something your eyes are really making lots of small jumps instead of truly moving smoothly most of the time (the only exception is really when your eye is tracking something in motion)
Birds don't have muscles to move their eyes around, so their whole head snaps around to do the same job as our eye muscles do. They don't always do this, birds will sometimes move their heads slowly, but just like with our eyes and watching something that's moving, they'll move their whole head to follow a moving object they're tracking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Birds have a single occipital condyle. This means they have one less bone in their neck so it’s easier for them to swivel back  to almost 180 degrees. It’s like sticking a toothpick into a ball. If you hold it between your fingers you can swivel it back and forth with relative ease. Humans have a dual occipital condyle meaning we have two bones. Like two toothpicks in the ball, the movement is much more limited which is why we can’t swivel our necks to the same degree as birds. (Idk if the toothpick example makes sense but this is the best way i can explain it) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good rule of thumb is that predators usually have forward facing eyes, and grazing/gatherers have eyes spread further to give them a wider angle of what is going on around them.</p>
<p>With that physical difference in eye placement, sometimes it's necessary to whip the ole noggin' around to to get a better bead on things...with tiny, beady little eyes.</p>
<p>*Note: Some predators, like dolphins, don't have forward facing eyes. Instead, they developed their brains (by staying in school...or pods...let's stick with school...stay in school, kids!). Little known dolphin fact: When they sleep, they shut off half their brain and literally sleep &quot;<a href="https://www.livescience.com/44822-how-do-dolphins-sleep.html" target="_blank">with one eye open</a>&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think (maybe someone can confirm) that it is a method of creating depth perception. Since their eyes are on either side of the head, they can’t perceive depth. By quickly moving their head, and therefore the position of their eye, whilst looking at the same thing, they manually create the depth that our eyes (humans) do naturally by virtue of being both on the front on our heads. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
