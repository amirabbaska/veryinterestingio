		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Science fiction seems to state either you will explode, or nothing will happen and you suffocate.  Neither of these is correct.</p>
<p>The first noticeable effect you would observe on someone ejected into space would be flushing of the skin.  It would quickly turn red as the blood vessels get closer to the surface.  Eventually the larger blood vessels with bulge out.  Some may rupture leading to bruising.  This is not comfortable.  Folks on youtube occasionally stick their arms into vacuum chambers, they claim this is very painful.  This may cause the victim to shout, exhaling early.</p>
<p>Further the victim could hold their breath.  The vacuum of space is not so strong as to rip the air from their lungs, but holding their breath would be uncomfortable as well due to the negative pressure.  this would provide a brief extension to their consciousness, but they would eventually exhale and begin to suffocate.</p>
<p>during suffocation the victim may indeed move their mouths open and shut, clutch at their throat, or tug at the collar of their shirt, and look <em>VERY</em> distressed.  They would eventually fall unconscious in likely under a minute (varies)</p>
<p>When they fall unconscious they would enter the fetal pose (knees slightly bent, arms loose, head down, as this is the natural position of the body without gravity or conscious interference.  They may spasm once more before death, otherwise they will not move again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Nothing much happens she just breathes out, looks scared/uncomfortable and dies. I'm led to believe this is pretty accurate.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the air would rush out of your lungs, and your ears would be very painful, if your Eustachian tubes were blocked at the time your eardrums would very likely burst.</p>
<p>Your digestive tract would begin to swell up due to trapped gases, and some gasses would begin to leak out of your esophageal sphincter and anus.</p>
<p>Any moisture on the surface of your lungs and other mucous membranes would start to boil off.  This would feel chilly, but not cold.  EDIT: I was inspired by a comment to do some math, over a minute or two it wouldn't matter much but over a longer period of time you'd get pretty cold. But you be dead so.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of air your lungs would start working backwards and oxygen would start coming out of your blood.</p>
<p>Your body would swell as small gas bubbles started forming in soft tissues, some small capillaries near the surface might burst.</p>
<p>Previously dissolved gasses  would begin to form bubbles in your blood vessels, but your blood would not boil because your blood pressure is high enough to keep the boiling point above your body temperature.</p>
<p>After 15 sec enough oxygen would have diffused out of your blood into your lungs that you would pass out.</p>
<p>Your body would continue to swell to somewhere in the region of 2 times your typical volume, at which point your skin would have pulled taut enough to halt further gas formation.</p>
<p>You now have the worst sunburn of your life on whichever side of you has spent the past minute in the radioactive hellhole that is unfiltered sunlight.</p>
<p>At 1min 30sec brain damage starts to occur.  Repressurization anytime prior to this results in full recovery with proper medical intervention.</p>
<p>At approximately 2min brain damage is extensive enough to be incompatible with life, beyond this point no amount of medical intervention can save you.</p>
<p>EDIT 1: No don't hold your breath, your lungs will burst and you will be extra mega boned.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Water boils at a lower temperature in space, your body happens to be higher than space boiling.</p>
<p>EDIT 3: We know this cause some poor sap (Jim LeBlanc) mega fucked up by managing to dislodge the air hose on his suit while in a vacuum chamber.  For his bravery he earned 87 seconds of vacuum and a bad earache but was otherwise ok.  Also some fucked up dudes thought that trying it out on some dogs would be an OK thing to do (another comment further down has the link).</p>
<p>EDIT 4: Omg I get it Total Recall has a scene like this.</p>
<p>EDIT 5: After some questions about the dog tests I have poached the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/survival-in-space-unprotected-possible/" target="_blank">link</a> from u/clocks212 bellow, go show him some love!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They've done these tests on dogs in vacuum chambers. They blew up like balloons, but if I remember right if pressure was restored within 90 seconds there were no lasting effects. Longer than that and they died. </p>
<p>/edit why the downvotes? They weren't my dogs.  Source <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/survival-in-space-unprotected-possible/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/survival-in-space-unprotected-possible/</a></p>
<p>&quot;But death is not instantaneous. For example, one 1965 study by researchers at the Brooks Air Force Base in Texas showed that dogs exposed to near vacuum—one three-hundred-eightieth of atmospheric pressure at sea level—for up to 90 seconds always survived. During their exposure, they were unconscious and paralyzed. Gas expelled from their bowels and stomachs caused simultaneous defecation, projectile vomiting and urination. They suffered massive seizures. Their tongues were often coated in ice and the dogs swelled to resemble &quot;an inflated goatskin bag,&quot; the authors wrote. But after slight repressurization the dogs shrank back down, began to breathe, and after 10 to 15 minutes at sea level pressure, they managed to walk, though it took a few more minutes for their apparent blindness to wear off.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You would suffocate because there is no air to breathe.</p>
<p>However, even if you're rescued slightly before dying, you are still really messed up.</p>
<p>If you don't close your eyes, the water in your eyes will start to boil due to the difference in pressure so your eyes will dry out. Same thing for the saliva in your mouth.</p>
<p>You will need freeze instantly, but steadily lose warmth.</p>
<p>You will get hard sunburn. On Earth, our atmosphere protectes us from a lot of sunlight. In space, you are not protected and will get dangerous burns.</p>
<p>After two minutes you will be dead due to a lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>However, if you are rescued after a few seconds, you would survive relatively unharmed.</p>
<p>The closest we ever got to this was in 1966, when NASA technician Jim LeBlanc's space suit had a leak in a vacuum chamber. He lost consciousness after 14 seconds and claims the last thing he remembers before passing out was how the saliva on his tongue started to form bubbles from boiling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
