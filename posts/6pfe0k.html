		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was at an aeronautics conference recently and there was a lot of talk about helium airships. The question of helium came up, and nobody seemed worried. Even if helium airships become the norm, we have enough helium in readily available states worldwide to last until at least 2100. </p>
<p>Helium is a by product of mining natural gas, but because we have so much of it right now it's not worth storing. When we start running out (which, again, is a long time from now), we will begin mining it again. Yes, there's a limited supply on earth, but that limit is far far away. We'll be exploring space by the time we run out of helium, and there's plenty of helium in space.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Just to be clear, the 2100 estimate is for our <em>current</em> supply. That is, assuming we cease all extraction efforts. There is still way more helium in the earth than we have ever touched in the history of mankind. There are also many more deposits. <strong>We are not going to run out in 2100.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>^(2): Some articles.<br />
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/06/18/were-really-not-about-to-run-out-of-helium-no-please-stop-it-were-not/2/#145067c062bb" target="_blank">Forbes, 2015</a> &quot;We're as likely to run out of helium as we all are to starve to death because we've eaten the bacon in the refrigerator, meaning that we cannot ever have breakfast again.&quot; This article also debunks the claims that we'll run out in 25-30 years (which is what most articles pick up on). The current market prices will rise in 25-30 years; there's still a lot of helium.<br />
<a href="https://www.chem.info/blog/2015/07/world-running-out-helium-or-it" target="_blank">Chem.info, 2015</a> &quot;So while it’s true that the U.S. supply of helium may be dwindling, that doesn’t mean we’re in any immediate danger of losing this precious element.&quot;<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The quality / purity of the helium gas used in balloons is extremely different than that used by MRI machines,so it's not really an overlap. The reason for the recent shortage is governments  stopped supporting the sequestering of helium which is extremely expensive.
So now if a company wants to sequester helium and purify it to be a usable grade in machines  such as an MRI it takes a lot and I mean a lot more money. So currently there are just not enough companies willing to produce high quality helium. It's not like MRIs and balloons are competing for the same thing.  </p>
<p>Edit: MRI machines and other medical/important devices get first dibs on the helium as well so the shortage really affects chemist who need it for spectroscopy plus a bunch of other experiments
and apparently scuba divers </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Helium is actually a byproduct of radioactive decays that are still going on in earth crust. Helium atoms are actually alpha particles which acquire electrons after coming out (or, alpha particles are actually helium nuclei, atoms without electrons). More than one helium atom will be produced as an uranium atom decays in multiple steps down to a lead atom. With that kind of production -albeit slowly, in billion years- going on, we should not be afraid of 'wasting' helium even for Donald Duck karaoke parties.</p>
<p>As other answers indicate, we get helium from oil or natural gas extraction sites, but that's only because those are the places where we find it profitable to drill into earth's crust and they are natural pockets where alpha particles will gather as helium atoms. If we run out of oil or gas, we should still be able to extract helium (maybe in much smaller quantities) from any drilling site, but then the helium buyers may have to pay for the drilling costs. only then we may regret the helium &quot;wasted&quot; for frivilous purposes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shortage of helium is <strong>vastly</strong> over hyped. We use about 8 billion cubic feet of the gas every year on Earth, for all of our various purposes. The US Department of Interior estimates that there is about  1,200 billion cubic feet of the gas left unharnessed on the planet, enough for another 120 years or so. And that's only if we don't ever find any new source of helium, which is very unlikely. I mean, we just found another source in Tanzania that's purer than any we've ever found (about 10% helium) in the early part of this decade.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
