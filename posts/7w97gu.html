		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert, but at some point I was reading about contacts on Wikipedia, and it seems to come down to the material used.</p>
<p>Your cornea (the clear part of your eye covering your Iris and pupil) needs to be exposed to oxygen in the air, because normally it doesn't have blood vessels to carry oxygen to it. Normally your tears get oxygen from the air, then the cornea gets it's oxygen from your tears, however contact lenses can stop the oxygen from reaching your cornea. (During the night your eyelids supply oxygen).</p>
<p>When you deprive the cornea of oxygen (i.e stopping oxygen rich air from reaching it), you can cause serious problems. For example blood vessels can start to grow into your cornea (so that blood can make up for the lack of oxygen), which can cause problems in your vision (because you'd have veins covering the front of your eye where the light comes in). You could also get ulcers.</p>
<p>This is where the material used becomes important. Different materials allow different amount of oxygen to pass through. Traditional hard lenses, while being much tougher, don't let much oxygen through, therefore you need to take them out every night to reduce the risk of starving your cornea of oxygen, and causing these problems.
Modern soft lenses are made of a special Silicone Hydrogel material which allows a very large amount of oxygen to pass through (Silicone is better at carrying oxygen than water/your tears). Because that material allows lots of oxygen through, it is safe to leave them on for a longer period of time without getting any problems (because your cornea will be getting enough oxygen to stop these problems from happening).</p>
<p>Tl;dr: Contact lenses can stop oxygen from reaching the clear part of your eye where light comes in. When this part doesn't get enough oxygen, bad things happen (which could make you go blind). Contact lenses can be made of different materials, some don't let enough oxygen through so you need to take them off so your eye can recover. Others let through enough oxygen so you can wear them for a long time without hurting/suffocating your eyes.</p>
<p>Please make sure you don't leave your lenses in too long!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Optometrist here: As previous comments have stated, it is to do with the durability of different synthetic polymers that make up the lens, their coating and subsequent matrix pores  (which vary per brand). Lenses are approved for various lengths of wear because of their differences in ability to provide sufficient oxygen permeability and wettability whilst maintaining the correct shape to fit your eyeball so to keep the prescription of the eye steady. If the contact lens is worn past recommended length of time, then you are exposing yourself to increased risk of eye infection and possible blindness (higher risks if you WEAR THEM IN WATER or sleep in them). </p>
<p>Each brand utilises their own lens material (mostly copyrighted), coating, diameter &amp;/or multiple base curves (and prescription increments) that cause the lens to sit differently on each personâ€™s eyeball. Therefore it is definitely not one size fits all.</p>
<p>To all contact lens wearers: Please have your contact lenses professionally fitted before you make the decision to shop for them online, and make sure you return for regular eye exams. We only get 2 eyeballs in one lifetime and we obviously need them dearly, so take care of them! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly that is their rated life. Dailies tend to degrade quicker, and can bend and deform after repeated use and are more susceptible to taring. Biweeklies are a bit stronger and monthlies even stronger. Technically the lens could damage your eye after this period, but it kind of comes down to luck and how well you take care of your lenses.</p>
<p>Reasons why people go for lesser durability usually comes down to if the user needs to wear contacts that often, how comfortable they want their lenses to feel, and oxygen permeability of the lens.</p>
<p>Also, by no means should you sleep with contacts in that are not meant to be slept in and you should care for your lenses with the proper storage and fluid. These are your eyes, you use them to see, and you don't get more of them (usually). Please take care of them. </p>
<p>Personally, I have accidentally missed tossing my lenses out and grabbing a fresh pair a few times. But I've also sometimes noticed as they can tend to be less comfortable, blur my vision a little, and even cause excess eye strain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
