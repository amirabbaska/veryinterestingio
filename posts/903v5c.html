I know that today they use ion thrusters or they shoot fuel out the back to accelerate in space but I don’t get how that’s possible. From what I understand, space tries to “suck” everything from the spacecraft so if that space craft ejects fuel, wouldn’t the fuel be “sucked” from every direction once it exits the tail, therefore not providing an efficient thrust? The videos that explain this show that the fuel travels In a straight line directly opposite from the direction the spacecraft is going. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vacuum doesn't really suck stuff up. It's more than in areas of high pressure the gas molecules bump into each other and disperse until they can't really collide much anymore. </p>
<p>That said you are right. Since the stuff ejected is at higher pressure than the near perfect vacuum of space the rocket plume tend to expend quite a bit. This is what you see on <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1712/SpaceXLaunch_Bobchin_960.jpg" target="_blank">that picture</a>, as the rocket rises and the pressure decrease the jet gets wider and wider, and this is a source of lost energy.</p>
<p>Usually for propulsion system you try to have the pressure at the exit of the thruster as close as possible as the pressure outside to have a max efficiency. Another way of looking at it is that instead of having the gas molecules going in all directions and bumping into each other you want them to all go in the same direction. This is what the nozzle (bell shaped thing) of a rocket engine does. It lower the pressure of the plume and redirect it in the right direction. On <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Nozzle_de_Laval_diagram.svg/250px-Nozzle_de_Laval_diagram.svg.png" target="_blank">this schematic</a> you can see the pressure P and the temperature T decreasing as the gas goes through the nozzle and as a result the velocity V increases. The larger ratio between the wide part of the nozzle and the narrow part of the nozzle (what we call the throat) the lower the pressure will be and the more efficient the thruster will be in vacuum. The issue is that at some point the engine bell gets impractically large. So in practice you always have some energy lost to the residual pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you suck on a straw, it isn't the suction pulling the milk shake up.  It's the weight of the column of air above the milkshake, extending into space pushing down on top of the milk shake as air pressure.  All you did by sucking was remove the weight of air on top of the milkshake straw that was holding it down.</p>
<p>Rockets use a concept called momentum conservation.  The best way to explain it is to get in something that can roll very easily, like a chair on coasters or a skateboard or on ice skates, and throw something heavy in one direction.  You should move in the opposite direction.  Usually we don't notice this while throwing because our feet have enough traction with the ground to push the other way.</p>
<p>Since momentum is conserved, if you push mass in one direction, your body should move in the opposite direction.  So all Rockets are doing is taking fuel and oxidizer, burning it, and using that energy to push it out the bottom as fast as possible, which makes the rocket go in the other direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vacuum affects the efficiency with which a rocket engine works, but doesn't stop it from working altogether.</p>
<p>Something people tend to forget is that after the propellant leaves the rocket, it doesn't contribute to propulsion.  At a middle school science level, remember when they were telling you about Newton's &quot;Every action has an equal and opposite reaction&quot;?  The examples they likely gave were propelling a rowboat using a paddle and propelling it by throwing bricks as hard as you can in the opposite direction.  Rockets are more like the brick throwing example, and the amount of air resistance the brick gets <em>after leaving your hand</em> doesn't affect how much the throw propels the boat.</p>
<p>Now, imagine the bricks are molecules of superexcited gas leaving a rocket.  The last time a molecule interacts with the rocket is the last time it affects the rocket.*  So whether those gas molecules run into air molecules after exiting the rocket or not isn't a factor.</p>
<p>* Actually, the last time a molecule affects the rocket is the last time it interacts with <em>another molecule</em> that subsequently interacts with the rocket, which is why atmosphere affects efficiency, but these interactions are small compared to the amount of molecules being expelled.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The same way they do in the atmosphere. Rocket engines are even a bit more efficient in space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know that today they use ion thrusters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For some tasks, but not for all. They have the same basic principle as chemical rockets: Shoot something out at high speed.</p>
<p>Rocket engines have nozzles that guide the hot exhaust so it can leave in one direction only. Vacuum doesn't suck, pressure pushes. But the exhaust doesn't have such a large pressure, it mainly has a high speed in one specific direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you just burned fuel and oxygen by spraying them at each other, that is the effect you would get. This is why rocket engines have a confined combustion chamber and a nozzle (usually a bell nozzle), to direct the exhaust in a specific direction. <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/p237.htm" target="_blank">here</a> is a diagram of a rocket engine. Once the exhaust leaves the combustion chamber, the bell nozzle directs it mostly in the correct direction. Notice the two different lines denoting potential exhaust plumes, at low altitude, it is more narrow, this is due to air pressure further containing it after it leaves the bell, and at high altitude, it is able to spread out more.</p>
<p>[here](is a comparison between atmosphere optimized merlin engines, and vacuum optimized). The most striking difference is the size of the engine bell, the vacuum optimized bells are huge, which lets them direct the exhaust more effectively in a vacuum, which leads to better fuel efficiency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
