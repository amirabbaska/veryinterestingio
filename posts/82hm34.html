My dentist suggested I start using an electric toothbrush and I’ve been thinking a lot about it. But I don’t understand how a vibrating brush is any better than scrubbing my teeth myself. I feel like presence of technology is always better than its absence because tech is awesome but I find it hard to understand why in this case. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a bit clearer if you look at it from the perspective of WHY you brush your teeth: to break up plaque. The objective is not so much to get PERFECTLY clean as it is to disturb plaque from forming hard masses that help lead to infection and caries. </p>
<p>Let's compare it to washing a car to see the difference. </p>
<p>Think of how you use a soapy cloth to get your ride ready for a formal event. The car's a mix of smooth areas and detailed areas. The smooth parts like the hood are easy to clean - long, gentle strokes with your soapy cleaning cloth or sponge, and the dirt comes right off. But the hardest parts to get clean are like the grill, where there are seams and crevices... so you fold the cloth or squish down the sponge, and wad bits of it up into points to make it smaller so it can fit in those spots, and then you scrub it back and forth in that area a bit more. The objective is to make your cleaning tool smaller and use shorter cleaning movements so it hits those seams. [EDIT - see <em>italics</em> because I missed something - you also move your cloth in more and different directions too.]</p>
<p>Well, with toothbrushes, the shape of the brush bristles can help some with the getting-into-smaller-bits part... but most people don't pair that up the little tiny <em>multi-directional</em> regional strokes that penetrate in-between the teeth to disturb the plaque there. They just use the same big scrubbing motions that they use on the rest of the &quot;car&quot;.</p>
<p>Electric toothbrushes vibrate or spin, though. And because these actions create smaller brushstrokes <em>in more different directions</em> than most people with manual brushes would use, they allow for a better chance to get in between teeth and around the gumline... and disturb that plaque before bad stuff happens. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It makes you think about getting all your teeth (and gum lines!) brushed.
Before I got an electric I doubt that I spent more than a minute brushing my teeth.
My dental hygienist could tell I switched....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dentist here. The main reason is ease of use. An electric toothbrush is easier to use. That is the main reason. </p>
<p>Studies have shown the best toothbrush is the one that gets used, and an electric one is easy to use.</p>
<p>Now for the long answer.</p>
<p>There have been studies done as to how many times you have to shown someone how to brush the teeth in order for them to go it properly on dental hygienist students. (Do obviously people who care about brushing) and it take 5 or 6 times and months to do it correctly with a manual brush. An electric brush only takes once, and they don't even need to be shown.</p>
<p>In addition to that you are supposed to brush for 2 full minutes. When using a manual brush you only brush for about 15-30 seconds. If your trying to go for 2 full minutes (like actually thinking about it) you normally only brush for 45 seconds.  An electric toothbrush has a timer in the handle so it's really easy to go for 2 minutes.  A sonicare for example will automatically turn off after 2 minutes. (That is literally the only reason I use them personally)</p>
<p>As far as which of the electric brushes are better, most dentists and hygienists will recommend Oral B, but will personally use sonicare. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As it turns out, the attribute of an electric toothbrush that is most correlated with good dental hygiene is whether or not the toothbrush has a timer.</p>
<p>Because it turns out that, on average, people brush for about 75-90 seconds when they just brush for the amount of time that feels right, and don't evenly distribute that time across the various surfaces -- but a brush that measures out 4x30-second quarters produces a longer, more even amount of brushing.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it doesn't make much difference, among people who have sufficient dexterity to brush effectively.  </p>
<p>There is <em>some</em> evidence that the sonic brushes are somewhat effective at disrupting plaque from areas <em>not directly in contact with the bristles</em> -- but to get this effect, you need the area between the bristles and the plaque-covered tooth surface to be covered in liquid, and the area in question needs to spend about 5 seconds in proximate contact with the bristles -- and it isn't clear just how often these conditions are encountered outside the laboratory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
