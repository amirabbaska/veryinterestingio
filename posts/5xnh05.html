		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello! I'm coming from Finland, not even studying in America nor ever visited there yet!</p>
<p><a href="http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/a/aa/Convert-a-Percentage-into-a-4.0-Grade-Point-Average-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid593033-728px-Convert-a-Percentage-into-a-4.0-Grade-Point-Average-Step-4-Version-2.jpg" target="_blank">I found this picture</a> presenting American grades system, right? If I read it correctly it means <strong>BOTTOM</strong> 60% get <strong>F</strong> as a score. And top 7% get <strong>A</strong></p>
<p>We in Finnish high schools have end grades like this(from best to worst):</p>
<p>L 5 %</p>
<p>E 15 %</p>
<p>M 20 %</p>
<p>C 24 %</p>
<p>B 20 %</p>
<p>A 11 %</p>
<p>I 5 %</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Ok I did it all wrong.... American system means TEST(small tests,homework,other little things) score, not final score. Then we have almost the same system.</p>
<p>Finnish system explained fast: </p>
<p>We have the same pretty much, but when we are finishing HS we have to take 4 or more national tests which every student in the subject takes, and the letters above tell our ranking <strong>based on other students, not score(well score, but other people's score and your ranking compared to everyone else)</strong> and after taking these, the gpa gets deleted and only thing we have is our grade compared to other students. </p>
<p><strong>Edit2</strong>: I just wanted to thank everyone who kindly answered, you are the MVP!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the USA we use a weighted index based on percentages.  There are 6 possible grades from best to worst: A, B, C, D, F.  Letter grades correspond to the percentage of points earned out of the maximum possible for the entire class including homework, quizzes, projects, papers, tests, and final exams.</p>
<p>A: 90-100%
B: 80-89%
C: 70-80%
D: 60-69%
F: 0-59%</p>
<p>GPA assigns a number corresponding to each letter grade earned for each class and then is averaged across all courses taken.</p>
<p>A: 4
B: 3
C: 2
D: 1
F: 0</p>
<p>So for instance, assume I took 4 classes this semester.  I got 2 A's, 1 B, and 1 C for my final total grades.  To calculate my GPA:</p>
<p>GPA = (2(4) + 3 + 2) / 4 = 3.25</p>
<p>So my GPA is 3.25</p>
<p>For a 4.0 GPA, that means I have earned an A in every single class I took, which means I earned scores of 90% or higher on every test I took.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>no not the bottom 60% of the class get F.   if the student scores 60% or less correct answers on a test, they get an F.</p>
<p>if students score 70% correct on tests,  they get C's, which is a barely passing grade.  which counts as a GPA score of 2.0.    in order to get a 4.0 GPA, you need to have 93 or more correct on all tests in all of your classes.   </p>
<p>according to wiki, the finnish test system:
As a rule of thumb, passing an examination requires obtaining 50% of the maximum points in the examination.   </p>
<p>which means on the same test, an american barely passing grade of 70% would be a reasonable high test score in Finland.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a ton of different ways to calculate GPAs, and they're generally not directly comparable because of these differences.</p>
<p>First of all, it's become extremely unpopular to have grade quotas, where the top x% gets the top grade, etc.  Nowadays, almost universally, each student is compared against a standard instead of to each other.  Everyone in the class could get an A if they all mastered the material, or they could all fail.</p>
<p>The oldest system was just A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0, and then you averaged your grades.  But this has a granularity problem: the kids that are getting perfect 100% have the same GPA as kids that are just barely making As.  Competitiveness kicked in, and more tiers were created.  This is what you have a picture of.</p>
<p>But also, what about different difficulties of classes?  If I take calculus and bust my ass for a B, why is that scored worse than some slacker who takes remedial arithmetic and gets an A?  So in many high schools, AP (college level) and pre-AP classes are given a 1-point bonus.</p>
<p>My high school actually gave you a specific GPA score for each class down to the tenth of a point.  The baseline was 5.0, with AP classes out of 6.0 and remedial/repeat classes (meaning you failed it the first time) out of 4.0.  So if I got a final grade of 91.7% in AP calculus, that was a 5.917 to be factored into GPA.  So if I tell you that my high school GPA was 5.04 (I don't remember exactly, but it was something like that), you can see how this is completely incomparable to a more traditional 4.0-based system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The grading system is not based on how many people are getting those grades. It is the average of all of your grades together. If your average grade is a 91%, you get an A, which translates to a 4.0</p>
<p>It's subjective to how difficult each professor / teacher's is. </p>
<p>If you get less than 60% on an assignment then you have failed it (F). Generally, a C is the lowest composite / average score you can get and still pass the class </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
