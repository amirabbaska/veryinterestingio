If it's been 10 years since you've been to the coffee shop or the city, it might take you a LONG time to find. It also might take long to find if you've been to other, similar coffee shops in the area. </p>
<p>Now, imagine that your city is constantly undergoing construction, demolition, and changing of street signs. That is your brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the feeling you're getting at is when you <em>know</em> you know something, but you can't quite get it when you want to. </p>
<p>This is a problem with a step in process of remembering and using information called &quot;recall&quot;. </p>
<p>The important thing here is that to the extent that memories have a physical medium, it's the connection between neurons in our brains. Some of these connections are really strong, which means it's easy to remember a thing, and some are weaker, meaning it might be harder to remember that thing. </p>
<p>Basically, once you get something into your long term memory, it's there for...well, not necessarily for good, but for a while. But if you don't <em>use</em> it, the connections between neurons in your brain related to that thing aren't strong enough to pass the signals needed for you to &quot;remember&quot; the thing, as in, be able to say it out loud, for example. </p>
<p>So the connections are there, but aren't firing well enough to pass the signal. One way to help is to try to remember a related thing. When you associate memories, the connections work together to boost each other. So if you can recall, say, a smell associated with a fact, or actually smell the smell, that might help you remember the fact. </p>
<p>Brains are weird. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s also “tip of the tongue,” which is when you’re trying to think of a word or name but can’t seem to get it out. </p>
<p>From what I understand, it’s caused by the brain trying to hard to eliminate similar words it can’t be, accidentally also blocking out the word your thinking of.</p>
<p>The best solution is to think about something else for a second, then suddenly you’ll get the urge and ability to say the word. It seemingly pops into mind and off the tongue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So here is an wierd offshoot of this question. About 10 years ago I quit opiates. I was a complete and utter addict. While I was going through withdrawal I was bombarded with very vivid memories that had happened 5 or 6 years prior. Some of those memories I had totally and completely forgotten had come back like they had happened yesterday. Anyone know what was going on?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Best recommendation is watch the movie called Limitless.</p>
<p>Simply put: our brain is very selective in memorizing things in particular order of survival, i.e. anyone hardly cares or remembers what they ate a week ago for breakfast, HOWEVER, if that person was diagnosed with any serious sickness, they would remember even for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Conclusion: it all depends how much priority signal we give our brains for it to remember.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
