		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Companies provide variety to distinguish themselves. Imagine and Oral B and Crest both just sell toothbrushes. One day, you go to buy a toothbrush, and you see the normal Crest brushes. But today, Oral B has soft and hard brushes. You think, &quot;It sort of hurts when I brush my teeth, so I'll try the soft brush.&quot; But somebody else thinks, &quot;I never quite feel like my toothbrush gets all the grime out, so I'll buy the hard brush.&quot; Suddenly, Oral B is selling more toothbrushes.</p>
<p>Crest responds by making their own line of soft, medium, and hard brushes. This gives three choices, and for the same reason, now Crest is selling more brushes. Oral B responds by expanding their line. As time goes on, they change their options (not just hardness, but colors, lengths, adding electronic toothbrushes). With more options, they hope to beat out the other brand.</p>
<p>So even though dentists only recommend soft brushes, both companies are now in a position where if they reduce their variety of options, they stand to lose money. So they offer a range of options, hoping that people will buy their preference, even if it's not the &quot;best&quot; option as recommended by dentists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dentists don't make toothbrushes</p>
<p>Factories do. </p>
<p>The factory listens to buyers. </p>
<p>If half the buyers say &quot;I want Firm&quot; then the factory makes Firm.</p>
<p>If it doesn't make Firm, half the people won't buy anything and <em>the factory loses money</em></p>
<p>People think they're smarter than the dentist for whatever reason. A common one is &quot;well yeah, <em>most</em> people need soft. But my teeth are Stronger than usual, so they need a Stronger brush&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
