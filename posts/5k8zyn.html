		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>6th year PhD student in the interstellar medium here. The situation is more complicated than other commenters here have said. There are 4 phases of the ISM that are in pressure equilibrium with each other: molecular,  cold neutral medium, warm neutral medium, and the warm ionized medium. As the names suggest, the biggest difference is the typical state of hydrogen atoms in that phase, going from bonded in H2 molecules to neutral atoms to isolated protons. Because they are in pressure equilibrium, hotter regions are less dense and vice versa. Stars form in the coldest, densest regions, but as soon as they turn on they start heating their surroundings and will blow away the molecular cloud they formed from. They biggest, hottest stars will emit a significant fraction of their light with energies high enough to ionize hydrogen (&gt; 13.6 eV) so hot young stars will blow these ionized bubbles within colder surroundings. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The areas close to stars have significantly more particles per unit volume than in interstellar space.</p>
<p>Interstellar space within a galaxy has much higher density than intergalactic space as well.</p>
<p>The average density of interstellar space is around 10^6 particles per m^3</p>
<p>Intergalactic space is estimated to have just a few particles per cubic meter.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's been a decent amount of confusion so I thought I'd help bring together ideas having done work on the interstellar medium. In general the answer should be it is denser.</p>
<p>Around new stars, /u/pecamesh gave a great <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5k8zyn/if_the_vacuum_of_space_is_really_a_very_thin/dbmi6zp/" target="_blank">answer</a> about what happens between different phases of the interstellar medium. However, a more useful picture of the phases of the ISM might be one that looks more like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium#Interstellar_matter" target="_blank">this</a>. HII regions (ionized hydrogen, not molecular hydrogen H2) where stars are ionizing material are typically denser than the ambient cold or warm neutral phase media, partially because they are in between the cold molecular cloud level of density and the ambient medium level of density. So the ionized bubbles are definitely less dense than molecular cloud but you shouldn't think of them as making a hole in the ISM with a much lower density than everywhere else, just lower than the molecular clouds.</p>
<p>Around main sequence and significantly-evolved stars, /u/Das_Mime gave a great <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5k8zyn/if_the_vacuum_of_space_is_really_a_very_thin/dbmo6cf/?context=1" target="_blank">answer</a> about the solar wind and the equivalent winds around other stars. The density for the Sun is still larger than the typical neutral phase medium (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_medium#Composition_and_physical_characteristics" target="_blank">wiki</a>).</p>
<p>Around &quot;other gravity wells&quot; the question becomes a lot more complex because it's not just a matter of gravity as a number of people have wrongfully brought up. Gravity is a major component for the formation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk" target="_blank">accretion disks</a>, which are going to be much more dense than the neutral ISM (otherwise you don't have much of a disk). However, accretion disks need not form. For example, the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole is not accreting much though has undergone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*#Discovery_of_G2_gas_cloud_on_an_accretion_course" target="_blank">accretion events</a>. The first gravitational wave events from stellar mass black hole mergers are thought to have very little gas around them otherwise we might have seen an electromagnetic counterpart; this &quot;lack&quot; could simply be an observational difficulty though. Pulsars can show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar_wind_nebula" target="_blank">pulsar wind nebulae</a> surrounding them but again like normal stars, that's not a matter of an increase in local gravity. The take away point is that you will typically get more dense gas/dust regions around objects of interest because there are a lot of dynamic processes going on around those objects and not simply an increase in gravity.</p>
<p>EDIT: One note on the intergalactic medium; it is thought to be less dense than the interstellar medium and really the ISM within individual galaxies but we don't know too much about it. That's much more of a consequence of gravity but really the gravity of an entire galaxy holding the reservoir of stars and gas and all of those other dynamical processes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The opposite. Stars are hot balls of plasma, so they expel matter constantly due to basically &quot;evaporation&quot; plus being plasma they tend to have magnetic fields which create strong forces pushing out ionized matter. Stars tend to be surrounded by bubbles of their own plasma (magnetospheres).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
