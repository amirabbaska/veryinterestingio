		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's use a 1-pound chocolate bar. </p>
<p>Multiplication: if you have a 4 count of 1-pound chocolate bars, you have 4 pounds of chocolate. If you have no 1-pound chocolate bars, you have 0 pounds of chocolate. Makes perfect sense. </p>
<p>Division: If you cut the chocolate bar into 4 equal parts, each part is 4 ounces (1/4 of a pound). But try cutting a chocolate  bar into zero equal parts... conceptually that makes no sense. If you say that this means removing or destroying the chocolate bar, that would actually be subtraction. In effect, you want to collapse the chocolate bar into fewer than one piece but still expect all 16 ounces of chocolate to still be present in this space where there is no chocolate bar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let us look at the number 10</p>
<pre><code>10 / 2 = 5</code></pre>
<p>Dividing by 2 gives us half</p>
<pre><code>10 / 1 = 10</code></pre>
<p>Dividing by 1 gives us the same number</p>
<pre><code>10 / 0.5 = 20</code></pre>
<p>Dividing by a half doubles the number</p>
<pre><code>10 / 0.25 = 40</code></pre>
<p>Dividing by a quarter quadruples the number.</p>
<p>So, the smaller the number we divide by, the bigger the result. This suggest that dividing by 0 should give us infinite.</p>
<p>However, let us look at it from the other end of the number line:</p>
<pre><code>10 / -2 = -5</code></pre>
<p>Dividing by -2 gives us minus a half</p>
<pre><code>10 / -1 = 10</code></pre>
<p>Dividing by -1 gives us the same number, only negative</p>
<pre><code>10 / -0.5 = -20</code></pre>
<p>Dividing by a half doubles the number, only negative</p>
<pre><code>10 / -0.25 = -40</code></pre>
<p>Dividing by a quarter quadruples the number, only negative.</p>
<p>So the closer we move to zero from the negative direction, the closer the result moves towards minus infinite.</p>
<p>This suggest that dividing by 0 should result in minus infinite.</p>
<p>I don't think 2 results can be further away from each other than infinite and minus infinite.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>5 year old explanation:
Imagine you have a room with 5 people in it. A pizza is on the table in the room. If the pizza has 20 slices each person gets 4 slices.</p>
<p>Now what if you have the same situation with a 20 slice pizza but there are 0 people in the room. Now how many slices does each person recieve...</p>
<p>If there are no people to divide up the slices than there is no conceivable answer to this problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>0/0 is undefined precisely <em>because</em> x * 0 = 0 for any x. So, think about the relationship between multiplication and division. It is similar to the relationship between addition and subtraction, they undo one another, if you will. In other words, we would like it to be the case that</p>
<p>a * x / x = a</p>
<p>for any a and any x. This is just fine as long as x isn't 0. But look at what happens when x = 0.</p>
<p>1 * 0 = 0</p>
<p>So, if I want my above undo rule to hold, since 0 = 1 * 0, it must be the case that</p>
<p>0 / 0 = (1 * 0) / 0 = 1</p>
<p>Okay, great! So 0 / 0 is 1, right? But...</p>
<p>2 * 0 = 0</p>
<p>So, if I still insist that the undo rule holds, and I also know that 0 = 2 * 0, then...</p>
<p>0 / 0 = (2 * 0) / 0 = 2</p>
<p>So, 1 = 0 / 0 = 2. Oh no. That's no good. Clearly 1 isn't equal to 2.</p>
<p>So, how do we remedy this problem? Well, where is the problem? The problem is that we decided that division by 0 <em>could</em> mean something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try for an intuitive approach.</p>
<p>Let's have a*b=c</p>
<p>Let's define division as a slight reordering of this into
a=c/b</p>
<p>So 0/0 is not undefined but indeterminate. This distinction is important because the number itself IS defined, but cannot be determined as it has an infinite number of valid solutions.</p>
<p>To see this, let's try plugging in 0 for c and b (to give us our 0/0) and rearrange it into our first equation
a*0=0</p>
<p>Well shoot, that's true no matter what value we put in for a. This is why it's indeterminate.</p>
<p>Now let's try division by zero where the numerator isn't 0. Let's try c=1 and b=0
a*0=1</p>
<p>Well as we can see, we run into a problem. What value of a can possibly make this true?</p>
<p>None of them can. There is no value of a that can ever be multiplied by zero to give us an answer of anything BUT zero.</p>
<p>Using <em>this specific definition of division</em>, it's easy to see why division by zero is undefined. There IS a way to give division by zero a definition but that starts going into beginnings of calculus :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
