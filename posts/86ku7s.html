		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A dielectric is a substance that transmits electrical <em>force</em> but not electrical <em>current</em>: i.e., an insulator. The stuff between the plates of a capacitor is a dielectric.<br />
Unfortunately there are no <em>perfect</em> dielectrics: they all permit a <em>small</em> amount of current to flow. That current is flowing through a high resistance, and since power = I^2 R, it dissipates a measurable amount of energy. That rate of energy dissipation is dielectric loss.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every point in the universe, regardless of whether or not there is matter present, has two properties, which we have defined to be inversely proportional to the speed of light squared:  c = 1/sqrt(µε).  Permeability, µ, is a measure of how easily we can make a magnetic field in a region, while permittivity, ε, is a measure of how easily an electric field can be set up in the region.</p>
<p>A dielectric material has a <em>relative</em> permittivity greater than one; this means that the permittivity in a dielectric medium is bigger than it is in empty space, and one consequence of this is that electromagnetic radiation, which moves at the speed of light, actually slows down in this region.  Electromagnetic waves are formed from both magnetic and electric fields, which <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Electromagneticwave3D.gif" target="_blank">oscillate against one another as the wave moves along</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the wave loses energy as it travels through such a material.  One way this occurs is by dielectric loss.  We normally characterize this through an equation that has real and imaginary parts, and that might be a bit too much for an ELI5, but we can think about it in terms of a (possibly) familiar circuit element:  the capacitor.  Because the capacitor works by setting up an electric field in the dielectric material used, there is bound to be some loss in setting said field up.  In an AC circuit, this happens every time the current (and/or voltage) switches directions.  Manufacturers report this property as an &quot;Equivalent Series Resistance&quot; or ESR.  So if you know the current in the capacitor (i = C dv/dt), then you can approximate the loss in the capacitor due to the dielectric by p = I^2 ESR, where the capital I represents the root-mean-square (RMS) current.  This current is the equivalent DC current that would transfer the same energy per cycle (read:  per time period of oscillation) as the actual AC current.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Read some Richard Marsh as in Amplifier. ELI5: Polarizability of materials is what makes capacitance. When measuring the quality of a capacitor you determine the losses. There are losses due to wire insulation, wire connections and the dielectric medium or plates. The loss that is calculated in the plates is affected by higher frequency and current the the first losses. A larger capacitance value will have a disproportionately higher losses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
