		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bracing usally places long bones ( arms , legs) and other large support structures ( pevlis, spine) in line to take the full force of the impact. This usally ends up causing multiple fractures. This causes massive internal bleeding, and if enough of that happens  for too long you die.
Think of it as being at the beach by the ocean, a waves are coming. If you try and stand there braced you can stand up to the smaller ones but at a certain point a big enough wave will knock you over. However if you lay back relax and float the waves will travel through and around you and a big wave that would have knocked you over does very little to you. Of course there will eventually be a big enough wave, or you will be in the wrong spot during a wave, that you will still get knocked around no matter what.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it's mostly a myth. studies have shown repeatedly that those who brace for impact fair better in nearly every situation. </p>
<p>drunk drivers tend to survive more than their victims because they tend to have advanced warning, and the dynamics of certain collisions favor the offender. for instance, a drunk steering into oncoming traffic will tend to be hit slightly at an angle, putting more car in between them and the collision. </p>
<p>the notable exception is a fall from a very particular height, where your natural instinct is to brace with your legs, but that results in them breaking, compared to roll or uncoordinated flop, which will distribute the damage over a larger area, mitigating severe damage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's just a stupid myth. If you're about to crash, for the love of all that is holy brace for impact and try to protect your head.</p>
<p>If you're falling from a good height, brace for the fall, curl up and try to protect your head and other fragile organs.</p>
<p>Going limb is not usually going to give you a better outcome.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a purely mechanical standpoint, it's pretty true that the highest loads take the &quot;stiffest&quot; stiffest paths.   So if you have a group of  pillars, half made of steel, and the other half made of marshmallows, the load will go almost entirely down the steel pillars, because the marshmallow will deflect rather than take load.  So if you brace with your long bones, they are likely to take the load and deform until they break.</p>
<p>Of course, without bracing, and without safety restraints, what's likely to happen is that you will get flung out of the car as you keep going in the direction you were going while the car stops until you hit something like a windshield or tree or whatever.</p>
<p>Proper safety restraints like seat belts and airbags are designed to allow some movement to lower acceleration forces but also some restraint.  They are also designed that the load paths that do take the acceleration loads do less damage than the worst case load paths.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A boxer or other sport fighter is generally taught to go with incoming blows if they can't block them for a similar reason. If you go in the direction of an incoming force you'll absorb less of it.</p>
<p>In cases of falling where you're moving at a pretty consistent speed and hitting a consistent target(the ground) you still have to transfer force through your whole body. The human body is designed to bend at certain points and is fairly squishy. We aren't really built to take hard impacts. Under ideal circumstances the force from your whole body will travel through the squishy bits that can heal and scar over rather than the hard bony bits that'll break and snap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
