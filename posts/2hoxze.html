	<title>During a tsunami, does the energy of the wave in the deeper ocean cause any damage before it surfaces? Basically, does the energy jostle/push fish, whales, etc... or does it harmlessly pass through them?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energy of a tsunami starts out as volume of water displacing a very small amount vertically. This is different from a normal wave which is a surface phenomenon. In a surface wave the water that goes up in one place is compensated for by water that goes down right next to it. But in a tsunami most or all of the water from the floor to the surface is displaced a small amount as the wave travels. But this can be a very small amount in the open ocean and probably doesn't cause any damage. </p>
<p>As the wave approaches shallower water the energy of the displaced water has less water to displace and so ends up displacing the water by a larger distance to make up for the smaller vertical volume of water available. By the time you see the wave from the shore the water is moving quite a bit, causing a lot of damage to the floor. </p>
<p>If you ever see video of a tsunami hitting the shore, one thing you notice is that unlike a regular wave that sort of hits and slides back, the tsunami just keeps coming and coming and the water just moves on up the shore. That is because a regular wave is water on the surface moving up and down until there isn't any water to move, which causes the last little bit to essentially fall over, washing up to the shore, but with a tsunami there is actually a large volume of extra water in a bump on the surface. This water hits the shore and all of the energy dissipates and the water behind it keeps pushing it further and further up the shore. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is a nice image of how a the wave forces propagate over depth.
<a href="http://fcit.usf.edu/florida/teacher/science/mod2/images/waves/Slide4.png" target="_blank">http://fcit.usf.edu/florida/teacher/science/mod2/images/waves/Slide4.png</a></p>
<p>Don't forget that waves are static, they don't move anything horizontally but rather it is a vertical propagation, the energy released in the horizontal axis (eg you on the beach) is not expressed until the wave reaches the very shallow waters and &quot;breaks&quot;. Sometimes also waves break in the middle of the ocean when their energy gradually decreases. But a tsunami will most likely break the moment it runs out of water as it is sucking the entire beach water level, and there is no more water to &quot;suck&quot;. </p>
<p>To answer your question, nothing in the open sea will be harmed, most likely they will just be given a nice lift off if they are on the surface or a spin if they are deeper (With the spin power to be decreasing as we increase in depth as the image above) for a few seconds. Hence no harm.</p>

<p>The video above is the japan tsunami. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In deep ocean the energy is spread out over a vast area and has little effect on ocean animals.  The problem is from the continental shelf to the shoreline.  In shallow areas the water before the first wave draws out so fast that alot of fish are left stranded.  Alot of deaths in the 04? Tsunami were people running out into the shallows picking up fish on the ground.  As the wave hits the continental shelf (if tsunami started in deep ocean) or begins hitting shallower water you get a build up of the wave.  The front of the wave begins to slow down and as it does the mass of water behind it rises above it.  The tsunami in japan 2011 was 3 meters (10 feet) at sea which could be managed by nearly any boat, but as it neared shore the front of the wave slowed, the back began moving ON TOP of the first part of the wave until you had waves over 10 meters (32.8 feet).  With that kind of water movement, anything in the water would be powerless.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
