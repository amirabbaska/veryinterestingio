<p>That's not quite right.  You have 14.7 psi pressing on <em>all</em> surfaces -- the top of your head, the bottom of your feet, your stomach back and sides -- at the same time.  It's not a directional &quot;from the top&quot; pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air pressure does not press down.  It presses in.</p>
<p>When you're standing up the top of your head has 14.7 PSI pushing down on it, while the front of your body has 14.7 PSI pushing you back and the back of your body has 14.7 PSI pushing you forward.  Some air even gets under your shoes, so you have 14.7 PSI pushing you up (if you prevented air from being under your shoes then you could remove this force; that's what a suction cup attempts to do).</p>
<p>When you sum up all of those forces you wind up with essentially zero net force on your body.  If you throw a pile of calculus at the problem you come up with the fact that it doesn't matter what shape an object is:  if it's facing the same pressure on all surfaces then the net force will be zero.</p>
<p>In fact, you can take things a step further and consider what happens if the pressure changes with height.  In this case the force on your back nicely cancels with the force on your front, but the force on your head is less than the force pushing up on your feet.  If you throw a similarly sized pile of calculus at this problem you come up with Archimedes' principle:  the net force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air pressure--and pressure in fluids generally--is equal in <em>every</em> direction. It doesn't just push down. Up, down, and to the sides too. </p>
<p>Think about it: if it only pushed <em>down</em>, then how could you possibly keep yourself off the ground? If you were lying on the ground, that's one thing, but what if you just stick your arm straight out from your body? That's almost 15psi, right? <em>Hundreds</em> of pounds of force. No way you could possibly support that weight if it was all pushing in one direction.</p>
<p>But, fortunately for us, it pushes <em>up</em> just as much as it pushes down. The air under your arms acts to counteract the air above your arms. So you don't feel that weight at all. And if you're touching the ground, sitting on a chair, etc., you've got the pressure of that solid surface to counteract air pressure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something called hydrostatic pressure. Air is a fluid that surrounds the earth. Gravity causes higher pressure at ground level than higher altitudes. The pressurized air presses evenly on everything because it is a fluid that goes everywhere. When you pull air out of something (create a vacuum) it gets crushed from all sides evenly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
