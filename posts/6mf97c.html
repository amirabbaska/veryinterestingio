		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for lack of technical terms here, but this is what I know from working in AR/VR space where we had to take into account the science of the eye for calibration and ergonomics.</p>
<p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;hurt&quot;.  When you look around, two aspects of your eye are moving: the muscles that control direction, and the muscles that control focus.  The focus muscles are mostly indirect control, but you can learn you control them directly.  When your eyes are looking straight ahead (perfectly parallel) then your eyes believe you want to focus on infinity, so they move the lens to try to focus on infinity.  When you look at something 1 meter away, your directional muscles pull the eyes inward, and the focus muscles move the lens to focus on 1 meter away.  When you cross your eyes, your directional muscles pull your eyes all the way inward, and your focus muscles TRY to focus on 0 meters away, which they cannot do.  Those focus muscles are straining, and that is where the pain comes from.  When you look far to the left or right, your focus muscles are not straining, because you are probably looking at some object a few meters away.  You can feel the same strain if you look far to the left or right AND at an object right next to your face.</p>
<p>Also, you can learn to control the focus / directional muscles independently. Those &quot;magic eye&quot; images require it. Your directional muscles look &quot;through&quot; the page, but then your focus muscles must focus on the distance of the page.  Since these two muscles are conflicting, it can cause eye strain over time.</p>
<p>This is also another reason why AR/VR displays can cause strain / headaches.  Those AR/VR worlds display objects at different distances, but with the same focus (there is only one focal length of the lenses in the displays).  Manufacturers will set the focal distance to around 2 meters, since that seems to work well enough for most situations without causing much pain.  So when you look at a VR object that is only perceived to be 0.5 meters away, your directional muscles are looking at 0.5 meters, but your focus muscles are looking at 2 meters, causing strain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you cross your eyes, you're going against the normal movement, so the muscle that needs to relax to achieve the movement is still somewhat tense, causing strain and pain.  If you practiced enough, you could learn to relax entirely and not have pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two systems exist for moving eyes. Conjugate movements are saccades and pursuits, fast and delicate. Convergence movements are slower and multipurpose, because the brainstem center that stimulates convergence also stimulates accommodation, focusing effort. This coordination of effort keeps the image single and focused at the same time. </p>
<p>Humans use convergence effort to help focus the eyes, so convergence developed to the degree you could stretch the tendons to a level of pain.</p>
<p>There was never a need to develop &quot;excess&quot; saccade ability, because extra-strength saccades would overshoot, for example.</p>
<p>So &quot;eyestrain&quot; usually results from an imbalance in the amount of effort needed to focus the eyes and converge them to the same distance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eye convergence (crossing your eye) is directly related to eye focus. When you focus you change the shape of the lens in your eye to clear things up close. That takes effort which is why we get eye strain when a lot of computer or phone use. </p>
<p>When you cross your eyes you are pulling the converging muscles and focusing at the same time. Without something to focus we tend to over do it and it can get very uncomfortable. But if you take a finger and slowly bring it towards your nose, crossing your eyes tend to be a little bit easier (up until you get too close).</p>
<p>Last thing: it gets more difficult as we age.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
