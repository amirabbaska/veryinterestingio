		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two main factors. Most antennas people notice are for xm radio that works at 2.3 ghz instead of 100 mhz that standard fm radio operates. The wavelength is directly related to the antenna size and the wavelength of 100mhz is roughly 10 feet were 2.3ghz is 5inches.</p>
<p>Secondly electromagnetic modelling software has made amazing jumps in the ability to model complex structures, like HFSS and Feko. So designers can embed antennas in places they never could before, like most cars have the fm antenna in the wind screen. </p>
<p>There has been a lot of talk about impedance matching, although helpful not really that important in this case. Just because I can impedance match a beer can to 50 ohms doesn't mean it propagates worth a damn.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The length of the old antennas approximately matched the wave length of the band and were placed on the fender to get a good ground plane. Newer digital circuitry in the radio actively matches the impedance so the length or placement of the antenna is less crucial. The antenna can be incorporated into stripes printed on the windows. <a href="https://www.engr.sjsu.edu/rkwok/Engr297/Val_Impedance%20Matching%20and%20Matching%20Networks.pdf" target="_blank">A more technical explanation here.</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Profit is the answer you're looking for. In 2000 I designed the rear backlight (rear window) of the Bentley Continental GT.
It had 26 (near invisible) antennas built into the laminated glass and obscuration band.</p>
<p>Those 26 antennas captured all radio (analogue and digital), TV, Satellite, WiMAX etc signals for every overseas continent. All options.</p>
<p>The cost to Bentley was Â£450 ($600) per window, back then. So the technology was available (and had been for some time) back in 2000, it just didn't come cheap.</p>
<p>I hope that helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Antennas resonate with radio wavelength. They can resonate on different ratios of wavelength, those ratios are 1/4, 1/2, 1 and maybe 3/2.</p>
<p>Electrical length and physical length of antenna arent the same, even thought they are closely related.</p>
<p>There are techniques to increase or decrease electrical length of antenna. These techniques take capacitor or inductor added to antenna.</p>
<p>So you pick 1/4 wavelength antenna, you can add inductor to its base which will increase its electrical length, so the physical length can be shorter.</p>
<p>With radio frequency of 100MHz wavelength is 3m. 1/4 is 75cm, which can be shortened further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
