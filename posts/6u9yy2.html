Because of this, would it be biologically viable/possible for fruits to exist before mammals had evolved to the point where they could eat them?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first angiosperms (flowering plants that all fruit trees are a subset of) evolved about 160 million years ago with their ancestors going back to 250 million years or so. Mammals first appear about 225 million years ago. Fruit trees and mammals evolved hand in hand to arrive at the mechanism you are describing of dispersal.</p>
<p>Fruit does not require a mammal to eat it and disperse the seed however. That is just one mechanism for dispersal. Fruits can be dispersed by water (coconut), wind (maple), clinging to fur or feathers, being defecated not just spit out, or buried as part of hoarding behavior (nuts and squirrels). So yes there could be fruit trees in an environment lacking mammals. The Pacific islands are a good example, the only native mammals on many are bats but there are plenty of fruiting trees of different types; like coconuts that don't rely on the bats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mammals and other animals. </p>
<p>For example, some plants prefer birds to disperse their seeds because they can fly long distances and disperse seeds more effectively. Birds can't taste &quot;spiciness&quot; so many plants evolved to be spicy so that only birds would disperse their seeds, and not other animals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My favorite example of animals doing seed dispersal is the African acacia tree. The acacia has big seed pods. The pods are nutritious, and different animals eat them. The seeds pass right through the animal.</p>
<p>Here's the interesting part: the pods are frequently infested by beetles. When the antelope (or whatever) digests the pods, the beetles die, and more of the seeds survive, compared to seeds which were not eaten.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants didn't develop fruits so that animals would eat them; fruits would have started as a random mutation. The fruits that were most appealing would be eaten, the seeds would be spread, and the plant with the most appealing fruit would spread and continue to reproduce. As this process continues, the plants with the best fruits are continually spread while those with less or unappealing fruits to not, and only the best fruits remain. But the process of natural fruit improvement had to start with some fruit in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. In fact chili peppers didn't evolve the high amounts of capsaicin (the hot chemical) they have nowadays untill after the evolution of mammals. Why? Birds don't have strong capsaicin taste receptors to detect the spicyness whereas mammals are very sensitive to it. A big theory was that plants wanted birds to eat their seeds because they could fly further to scatter them and didn't crunch up as many seeds as mammals while eating.  <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/07/21/hot-peppers-why-are-they-hot/" target="_blank">http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/07/21/hot-peppers-why-are-they-hot/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
