<p>Being hot sucks, but not nearly as badly as freezing to death.  Outside of modern times cold weather meant needing fuel to burn if you wanted to even attempt to stay warm.  You can't grow crops, wild game becomes less easily found and the animals themselves become small/less nutritious as they lose weight from not having as much food supply.  </p>
<p>Simply put it's a lot easier to survive and feel comfortable in hot weather than cold. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are descended from agricultural societies. Weather below freezing was a slow death to them, since you couldn't grow crops if the ground froze, if it was 100 degrees F it would be hot and a lot of crops would die if it was sustained, but it would still be a lot better than winter. And no one calls super-hot weather good. Good weather is somewhere between 60-90 degrees F.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a person who has lived in both Alaska and south Texas, I have strong feelings about this. First, if you were to divide population centers into binary groupings of &quot;people who live in mostly warm/hot weather&quot; and &quot;people who live in mostly cold weather&quot; (i.e. People who live in places like Alaska versus places like the American south) you'd find a huge disparity in numbers toward warm weather. Are there some people who prefer colder weather? Sure. But, worldwide, it's a drop in the bucket compared to people who prefer and live near a warmer climate and simply endure winter months. </p>
<p>Humans can survive quite handily in very hot climates. The body can acclimate to hot weather in a few weeks without ever being in danger of dying from heat alone as long as you have a source of water. Crops grow more efficiently, travel is easier and, from an anthropological perspective, there is generally a more robust sense of community since far more activities are held outdoors. </p>
<p>Humans are quite fragile when it comes to cold weather. Once the temp dips below what a body can regulate on its own, hypothermia will set in and then death in a relatively short period. Your body needs lots of help to combat the cold. Animal skins, high-fat diets, substantial insulated shelter, etc. </p>
<p>It's a lot of work (mitigated dramatically by modern technologies) to stay warm in the winter. You can survive in the heat with virtually nothing. That's the difference. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>I'm a colder weather person (grew up in the South), but where did you get the idea that &quot;just as many&quot; people in general like colder vs warmer? Almost everyone I have ever met in my life (and I'm a lot older than the average redditor. Like, parent-age older) has always preferred warmer weather.</p>
<p>Forget all that nonsense about agriculture and freezing to death on the Russian steppes in our collective pasts - we don't have genetic memories dictating our moods &amp; opinions now. From moment we go off to school, we are conditioned to associate <em>summer</em> (i.e. when all that hot weather usually happens. Or did before climate change) with good times because of <strong>summer recess.</strong> If you go to both kindergarten and college, that's <strong>17 very influential years</strong> reinforcing this. </p>
<p>Plus, even once you're an adult, you continue to associate summer with far more outdoor activities and vacations. The circle is complete once you start having children and you need to time family vacations with their summer recesses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
