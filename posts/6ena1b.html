		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an adult who was diagnosed with ADHD as a child (called ADD at the time). Thanks to the video that was on the front page a few days ago, I was recently introduced to the work of Dr. Russell Barkley. Much of what he said about ADHD being primarily an impairment of executive function sounded like it made a lot of sense, and it matched up very well with my own experience of my disability. Is this a well established theory of the cause and nature of ADHD? Is it well supported by the work of other researchers, or is Dr. Barkley on the fringe? If it goes against the consensus, then what is the consensus? Or what are competing theories?</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR1IZJXc6d8" target="_blank">video</a> that summarizes his ideas.</p>
<p>EDIT: Here are a few more videos that better describe Dr. Barkley's theory of ADHD, executive function, brain morphology, and genetics:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TLDR</strong>: <em>Executive function deficit is widely accepted as an effect of ADHD but not as a cause. It fails to explain the entire set of common ADHD symptoms.</em></p>
<p>The most commonly accepted explanation for ADHD symptoms relates to the the production and uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. Shortly, the idea is that failures to adequately utilize these neurotransmitters (associate with reward, alertness, and arousal) causes the people afflicted with ADHD to seek other easy sources of these. This means that high reward tasks are more attractive and novelty is more important.</p>
<p>It's also true that executive functions are impacted by this neurochemical deficiency. Executive functions require the ability to self regulate and the ability to essentially force reward temporarily in exchange for greater reward later. If one says, &quot;I must complete this homework so that I can play outside later&quot; part of the process is simply making the decision, but another equally important part is keeping the brain engaged and active during the 'low reward' part of that task. People with ADHD experience difficulty with that second part.</p>
<p>To answer your question directly; yes the executive model is widely accepted, but moreso as a partial model of the symptoms and as a note on the practical implications of non-pharmaceutical / behavioral therapy. The executive model is not a pathological model nor does it explain 100% of ADHD symptoms. The most accepted pathological model (see above) explains the executive deficits as well as other symptoms such as hyperactivity, fidgeting, and sleeping difficulties seen acutely in children. The neurochemical deficit model also points to the obvious and effective pharmacological treatment for most suffers; stimulants.</p>

<p>Edit: I'm afraid of my post getting deleted because I didn't include sources, so here's a random metanalysis (not that linking even 20 metaanalyses would prove concensus). In a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00439-009-0694-x" target="_blank">2009 meta-analysis of genetic causes of ADHD</a> plausible genetic components for ADHD were reviewed. The authors point to variations in DAT1 (dopamine transport), DRD4, DRD5 (dopamine receptors), 5HTT (serotonin transport) HTR1B (Hydroxytryptamine receptor), SNAP25 (a synapse transport protein), and DBH (enzyme for dopamine-&gt;norepinephrine conversion). I think the genetic components themselves go pretty far to support the most widely accepted cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
