		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you want to go to really, <em>really</em> low temperatures, you usually have to do it in multiple stages. To take an extreme example, the record for the lowest temperature achieved in a lab belongs to a group in Finland who <a href="http://ltl.tkk.fi/wiki/LTL/World_record_in_low_temperatures" target="_blank">cooled down a piece of rhodium metal to 100pK</a>. To realize how cold that is, that is 100*10^(-12)K or just 0.0000000001 degrees above the absolute zero!</p>
<p>For practical reasons you usually can't go from room temperature to extremely low temperatures in one step. Instead, you use a ladder of techniques to step your way down. In most cases, you will begin at early stages by simply pumping a cold gas (such as nitrogen or helium) to quickly cool the sample down (to 77K or 4K in this case). Next you use a second stage, which may be similar to your refrigerator at home, where you allow the expansion of a gas to such out the heat from a system. Finally the last stage is usually something fancier, including a variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_refrigeration" target="_blank">magnetic refrigeration techniques</a>. </p>
<p>For example, the Finns I mentioned above used something called &quot;nuclear demagnetization&quot; to achieve this effect. While that name sounds complicated, in reality the scheme looks <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Magnetocaloric_effect1_04a.svg/800px-Magnetocaloric_effect1_04a.svg.png" target="_blank">something like this</a>. The basic idea is that 1) you put a chunk of metal in a magnetic field, which makes the spins in the metal align, and which heats up the material. 2) You allow the heat to dissipate by transferring it to a coolant. 3) You separate the metal and coolant and the spins reshuffle again, absorbing the thermal energy in the process so you end up with something colder than what you started out with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you start with liquid helium (which will be at about 4K), you can pump on it, which will reduce the vapor pressure allowing some of the liquid to evaporate and take heat with it, lowering the temperature of the remaining liquid. The system I am familiar with has a base temperature of ~1.4K thanks to this method</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Is this correct?
You're close! The step you're missing is that the gas is compressed into a liquid, then it is forced through an orifice and goes through a phase change into a gas. The phase change requires energy, so the coolant pulls what energy it needs from the environment. This is a pretty useful concept (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump_and_refrigeration_cycle" target="_blank">vapor compression cycle</a>) which will come up again. </p>

<p>There's a variety of cryogenic systems researchers use, depending on the temperature they want to achieve. Cryogenics works in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin" target="_blank">Kelvin</a> instead of Celsius or Fahrenheit. 0K is absolute zero - molecular motion stops, and you can't get any colder. Ice freezes at 273K - this <a href="https://nationalmaglab.org/images/about/facts_figures/dictionary/superconductivity-temperature.jpg" target="_blank">picture</a> gives a good summary. I'm going to casually ignore everything above 4K, since you asked about extreme cold. </p>
<p>We can get to 4K with either a wet or dry system pretty easily. A wet system uses liquid cryogens for precooling and the thermal bath (at atmospheric pressure nitrogen is a liquid at 77K, and helium a liquid at 4K). A dry system uses a cold head like a Gifford-McMahon cooler or a pulse-tube cooler (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryocooler" target="_blank">cryocoolers</a> for other examples) below 4K. These systems rely on adiabatic expansion of gas to get to 4K - similar to a normal refrigerator, but without the phase change part. The gas isn't exotic (high-purity helium-4), but it isn't what you fill balloons with either. </p>
<p>Now we've got 4K, and we want to get colder. The next system we could use is a pumped helium-4 cryostat. This is pretty simple - get a liquid helium-4 bath and evacuate the vapor above the liquid from the reservoir (aka: pump it away with a fancy vacuum). Then the most energetic atoms from the liquid will jump from the liquid to the vapor - this phase change requires energy, and will suck some heat out of the liquid. Keep on pumping and pulling the most energetic atoms out. Commercial cryostats can get to about 1.4K, specially designed cryostats can get a little colder (about 0.8K is still &quot;easy&quot;). </p>
<p>If you want to get colder than 1.4K, you need to start using helium's sexy sister, helium-3. Using the same pumping method as with helium-4 to extract the most energetic atoms from a helium-3 liquid, you can get down to 0.3K with helium-3 liquid cryostat. Helium-3 is more rare and harder to produce, so more expensive. These cryostats get more complicated since you want to save a reuse the helium-3. </p>
<p>If 0.3K sounds too warm, you can get yourself a dilution refrigerator. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jT5rbE69ho" target="_blank">Watch Andrea Morello's super-interesting youtube video on this</a>. A dil fridge works with a mix of helium-3 and helium-4. If you liquify the mixture, do a shitload of engineering to get them to play nice, you can extract the helium-3 from the mix to get cooling (using a similar pumping method as the helium-4 cryostat). A dilution fridge can (in principle) get down to 0K - commercial systems can typically get below 10mK (0.01K). </p>
<p>If you want to get colder, then you can bolt a nuclear demagnetization fridge onto the bottom of a dil fridge (like u/crnaruka pointed out). </p>
<p>There are other methods which get colder (laser cooling, for example). They will cool something like a million atoms to crazy-cold temperatures. The methods I mention above can cool reasonable amounts of material to low temperatures. The standard book grad students read is <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540463566" target="_blank">Pobell's Matter and Methods at Low Temperatures</a>, for the interested reader. </p>
<p>TL:DR: Almost the same principle as a refrigerator, but use helium-3 and helium-4 instead. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jT5rbE69ho" target="_blank">Watch this</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a documentary on the history of cold that is quite interesting. Like how humans initially thought cold was some sort of mass that was added or taken away to change temperature. There was also a race between two labs to liquefy helium first, with one lab messing up and accidentally releasing their helium reserves. They couldn't get a resupply in time to compete. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know what temperature range you're talking about with 'extremely low' and like some redditors already mentioned the technique completely depends on how low you're gonna go. For starters, if you cool down a element usually (at room temperature) is in gas state will become a liquid - for Nitrogen this happens at 77K (-195°C) and Helium even 4K (-269°C). The reason I mention these 2 gases is that N_2 is like everywhere and therefore cheap, and He does the best cooling from any elements.</p>
<p>Now you can decide how far you're gonna cool down. Putting your sample in LN_2 (liquid Nitrogen) works the same as the ice cube in your glass of lemonade. With LHe it's the same but you can cool down to 4K.
After you got that covered, you can cool down to temperatures around 1K by generating a low-pressure environment, forcing the liquid to boil (imagine the low pressure 'sucking' the He atoms out of the liquid into the gas state; you may have heared of water on Mt Everest boiling already at 70°C due to low air pressure). For this process the liquid needs energy to change phases which it gains from its environment, in our case the sample. Compare it to sweating, where water evaporates, leaving your skin cooler than before - it's the same effect!</p>
<p>Now we're already at or below 1K and so far this was the procedure I'm working with. There are various other techniques as laser cooling, magnetic cooling and so on mentioned in other comments which I don't know very much about, you might rather read those for further information about that.
The only thing I know is that we're talking mostly about the He-4 isotope with the technique(s) above. There is another method using also the He-3 isotope:
If you've got a mixture of He-3/He-4 and cool that down, there are 2 liquid phases (like a glass with water and oil), one being He-3, the other He-4. Then there is a effect called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy_of_mixing" target="_blank">Enthalpy of mixing</a> which 'sucks' energy from the environment again by mixing the 2 liquid phases, cooling down to around 1mK (0.001K)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
