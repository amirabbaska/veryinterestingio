<p>When a lens focuses light into a smaller and smaller area, what happens to the light? If I took all the light from the sun and focused it to the same point in space, does the light collide, does it have density, is there a limit to how much light could be in that one spot?</p>
<p>If I encoded information as light and passed it through a lens, and on the other side of the focal point, received that information back out.. Is there a limit to how much information I could pass in? Is it lossy at all?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div></div>

<p>A lens can't focus light into a point hotter/brighter than the object generating the light.</p>
<p>There are a variety of interesting ways to prove that, but the one that makes the most intuitive sense IMO is that lenses aren't one-way magic, they work in <em>both</em> directions.  If you could focus the Sun (for example) in to a point hotter/brighter than the surface of the Sun, you would effectively be using your lens to heat up the Sun at that point instead of the other way around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's worth noting that there is a limit to this process.  Conservation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etendue" target="_blank">Ã©tendue</a> means that when an optical system concentrates light into a smaller area it must also spread out over a larger angle.  As a result, no optical system, no matter how large and complex, can use the sun to heat something to a temperature hotter than the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, there is some other limit: the diffraction limit. Even with an infinite size laser beam (source) and infinitely strong lens (see other comments), and even with a infinitely weak source such that the electron-position-processes are not a problem (see other comments), then still you can not focus light into a focus smaller than the wavelength of the light.</p>
<p>This is a very real limiting factor for computer chip producers. Computer chips are 'written' with light. To make the 20 nm chip structures in your processor (or however small they are now), you need light with a wavelength shorter than 20 nm, i.e., extreme ultraviolet (EUV). Producing and processing (focusing and such) this EUV is very difficult, and is an important limiting factor for reducing computer chips.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
