		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like a buzzkill for interrupting such poignant repartee, but if you'll permit my moment of informative discussion, I'd like to offer my personal experience as a blind American.</p>
<p>The National Federation of the Blind teaches a method of organising one's bills based on different folds.  A $1 is not folded, a $5 is folded one way, a $10 another, and so forth.  This, of course, only helps when searching through already-organised bills.  There are, however, apps for mobile devices which will identify images scanned with the device's camera and verbalise such things as bill denominations.  The other method, less technologically advanced but takes less time, is simply to ask the cashier to identify each bill as they hand it to you.  Most cashiers, when handing bills, will do this, anyway, counting out the change.  For example, &quot;There's $10, $15, $16, $17, and forty-five cents,&quot; and from this I can conclude I've been given a $10, a $5, and two $1's, largest bill on the bottom, smaller bills on top.  Making use of this method requires acute attention to detail and an excellent control of short-term memory, which can easily become habitual over time.</p>
<p>There may be other methods of which I am unaware, and I invite other blind individuals to share their methods.  I'm always looking for easier ways to do things.  I saw below someone mentioned that some blind customers requested change in all $1s; I've never done that, nor even thought of it before, so I learned something new today.  Thank you for sharing!</p>
<p>Any other questions I can answer for you about living on the dark side?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak for everyone, but there's story from the next town over of a blind businessman who owned a bar.  Bob was quite the character and learned to work around his disability.  They say one of the most impressive things was he could use the cash register himself and count the money based on the feel of the printing.  US paper money uses dry intaglio printing and the effect is the ink rises slightly from the surface of the paper.  While most folks wouldn't really be able to distinguish one bill from another, with some training you could probably very quickly feel the different raised patterns just by feeling the corner of a bill.</p>
<p>They say occasionally a tourist would try to pass Bob a one dollar bill and try to pass it off as something else.  Apparently Bob kept a couple of whiskey bottles filled with tinted water behind the bar and they'd find their next drink would be similarly shortchanged.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I delivered pizzas to a hotel one time, and there was some sort of blind persons' convention going on. One of the gentlemen (with the assistance of a seeing person I'm assuming) had used a needle to punch holes in the bills, essentially creating his own braille. He didn't have the bills folded in any particular way, or keep the bills separated, but he knew exactly how much he handed me. I got back to the car, wondering how he knew how much he had handed me, and that's when I noticed the patterns punched into the bills. I thought it was pretty brilliant (brailliant?)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My blind uncle has a small device that can identify different bills for him if he feeds them through it. He then folds the denominations differently so he can differentiate them when paying for purchases.  He usually takes the change and puts it with the corresponding receipt in a separate pocket after an exchange so he can check it for accuracy when he gets home. (He knows most of the people at the stores he frequents so he typically doesn't have to worry about getting short changed, unless he doesn't know the cashier).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
