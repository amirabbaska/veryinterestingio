		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kind of, but it's not very stable.</p>
<p>In this arrangement, the satellite is at the &quot;L1 Lagrange point&quot;. This is where the gravity from the planet, the gravity from the star, and the effective centrifugal force from movement of the planet and the moon all cancel out, and the moon is at an equilibrium point in-between the planet and the star.</p>
<p>However, this is not a <em>stable</em> equilibrium. Although all the forces add up to zero (in a rotating frame), if you give the moon a tiny push, then it will drift away further and further and faster and faster until it's not near the L1 point anymore.</p>
<p>This means that you don't get moons naturally hanging out at the L1 point. But you can put an artificial satellite there. You do need to constantly give little boosts to correct the orbit to keep it there, but they only need to be small boosts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the main question has been answered, note that the planet's <em>rotation</em> has nothing to do with it; you mean the planet's orbit. Matching the planet's rotation would matter if you wanted the eclipse to remain in the same position on the Earth's surface - but this is only possible if the Earth had zero axial tilt and if its day were equal to its year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While others described its pretty impossible for the whole planet to be in a perpetual eclipse this is not what would happen if the moons speed was the same as the planets rotation. </p>
<p>When the moons speed is the same as the rotation it called Tidal locking. The moon would appear stationary over a single point of the planet all the time, not be located at the L1 point. Assuming the moon and the sun are on the same plane the moon would eclipse the sun every day at noon for a few minutes. Its much more likely the moon and sun aren't on the same plane however and the eclipse happens only twice a year with potential lesser partial eclipses on the days just before and after the main one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former TV engineer speaking:</p>
<p>We have artificial communications satellites in geostationary orbit in what is called the &quot;Clarke belt&quot;.  Here and only here can one fling a satellite at a predetermined altitude and speed, and have it remain in the same part of the sky so we can point a fixed dish at it and (almost) always get a signal.</p>
<p>We get &quot;eclipses&quot; twice a year in what are called &quot;solar conjunctions&quot;.  They happen near to but not at the equinoxes.  The sun is behind the satellite and its EMF drastically outperforms the satellites own radio transmitters and causes signal failure for around 15 minutes.  If I were to go out to our receive dish during such an event the white fiberglass would reflect and focus the sun's light (and other energies) directly on the LNB antenna.</p>
<p><strong>HOWEVER</strong> the sun is at a different altitude over the horizon relative to the satellite most of the rest of the year.  Your theoretical planet could not have an inclined axis, that which gives Earth its seasons and variable lengths of daylight, unless the obscuring object were substantially larger than the planet.  (We are spoiled by a moon almost exactly the same relative size as our sun when making assumptions.)</p>
<p>And the question of the perpetual eclipse should include &quot;from what observation point&quot; as it would take more forces in alignment to perpetually hover over the same ground vs an eclipse being visible from space, on a planet that rotates faster or slower than its orbital rotation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is the neat thing about Lagrange Points.  Any two bodies have a set of 5 positions where gravity overcomes orbital dynamics, and small objects get trapped in these positions.  L1 is easiest to explain, whether Earth Moon L1 or Earth Sun L1 it is the same effect where the pull of the larger bodies gravity and the pull of the smaller bodies gravity are equal holding it in that position. there are small asteroids that get trapped in these positions while passing.  L2 is behind the smaller object, L3 is behind the larger object in the smaller objects orbit, L4 is sixty degrees ahead of the smaller object in its orbit, and L5 is sixty degrees behind the smaller object in its orbit.  The rotation rate of either object is completely irrelevant.  These Lagrange points apply to any two objects where one is orbiting the other, Earth-Sun, Earth-Moon, Mars-Phobos, Jupiter-Ganymede, and so on.  This is also why Science Fiction puts a large satellites in Earth-Moon L1 so that satellite is tidally locked in between the Earth and the Moon.  In answer to the OP's question yes you could place an object in Earth-Sun L1, BUT!!! in order to accomplish a constant eclipse it would have to have a giant diameter significantly larger than the Moon to have the effect OP appears to be asking for.  </p>
