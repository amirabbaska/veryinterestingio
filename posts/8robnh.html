		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is a false dichotomy. Frozen frogs have no measurable brain activity, no breathing, no heartbeat, no movement. They'd neither be conscious nor asleep. The closest state we humans have would be death. That is the experience we had before we were conceived (none at all). The only difference between their frozen state and actual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-theoretic_death" target="_blank">information-theoretic death</a> is that the frog's bodies start working again once thaw comes around with their identity preserved. Although some people hope that humans can attain this state too (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics" target="_blank">see here</a>) there is no proof that this is currently technically possible, Sebastian Seung <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11346470-connectome" target="_blank">shows that it is unlikely that doing so is even remotely possible</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Estivation is similar to hibernation. It is a dormant state an animal assumes in response to adverse environmental conditions, in this case, the prolonged dry season of certain tropical regions. Several species of frog are known to estivate. Two of the better-known species are the ornate horned frog (Ceratophrys ornata) from South America and the African bullfrog (Pyxicephalus adspersus).</p>
<p>From an article in <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-frogs-survive-wint/" target="_blank">Scientific American</a>. What frogs do seems to be very similar to the state of torpor that other animals go into during hibernation. Or what hummingbirds do every night to sleep. The article goes into further detail on differences between wet and dry land frogs and how they hibernate too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As much as any ice cube. Neh. Since life requires free water, drying or freezing an organism suspends all life processes. Most organisms can't recover from that state, in other words, they are dead. Some can, owing to synthesizing protective solutes that permeate all their watery spaces. In the case of these extremophile frogs, it is glycoproteins if I recall correctly. It can be an exotic sugar such as trehalose or a glasslike glycoprotein that protects water bears (tardigrades) from dessication death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Frogs donâ€™t  freeze. They maintain temp. Just above the freezing point by producing anti-freezing substances in advance and releasing them to the blood, slowing their metabolism down...  but they stay alive and almost as conscious as frogs can be. The process is controlled by hormones, temperature, oxygen </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
