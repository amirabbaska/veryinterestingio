		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(Edit: I clarified my answer after many pointed out that it is misleading to say that the placebo effect <em>proves</em> wishful cures. Please also see other answers.)</p>
<p>There are a ton of reasons why a placebo might work:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is a mind-body connection and psychosomatic therapies are valid</li>
<li>people pretend or believe themselves to be sick when they are not</li>
<li>people misreport disease symptoms and therapy effects</li>
<li>diseases can cure themselves given time</li>
<li>diet and environment cure diseases</li>
<li>statistical data and double-blind tests are the only valid medical evidence and drug development method</li>
</ul>
<p>New-age and alternative medicine play up the possibility of mind-body connection and that positive thinking, prayer, energy etc. cure diseases. This approach is unprovable and not scientific.</p>
<p>In addition to the various circumstantial and accidental factors, there is the pragmatic statistical approach that indirectly takes all factors and hypothesis into consideration. Thus, modern medicine focuses on validating (rather than explaining) drugs and therapies via placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, that's a hypothesis you are making based on the observation of the placebo effect. The placebo effect only proves that our expectations or beliefs can impact our body in some way or another. Transforming this into your hypothesis requires additional assumptions such as what is power and what means being able to utilize, and proving this hypothesis would require additional testing which I'm not aware of being done before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has less to do with our minds being able to cure our ills, and more to do with changing our perception. Imagine a light is blinking steadily one second on, one second off. Now imagine that you are told every 3rd blink is slightly longer than the rest. You might then perceive this as so even though the light is blinking at a steady rate. What matters is that your perception of the event is altered. It is very difficult for us to make purely objective observations of things without measuring devices like a watch or instruments to measure things we want to observe. </p>
<p>Since we don't have instruments like this that tell you how much pain you are in, or how healthy you are, or how stressed you are, it is much more subjective to your perception and other factors can easily influence your experience. </p>
<p>Your body actually has 3 brains so to speak. There is your brain, your involuntary nervous system, and the enteric nervous system in your gut. Each has nerve communication with the other, but also each can operate independent of the others. So for instance if you feel threatened, you can force yourself to be calm, but you can't force your body not to produce adrenaline and prep you for fight or flight. That is an involuntary reaction you are powerless to control. </p>
<p>However you can practice breathing techniques to try to control your heart rate which can affect body temperature and relaxation. That is a far cry from the mind healing wounds or telling your liver to metabolize alcohol faster etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of misconceptions about the placebo effect. The placebo effect is only refers to any effect outside of the intended ones and is mostly a tool to analyze data during scientific research. This could include this mystical mind over body effect but it is mostly a mix of biases, from the patient and the scientist and external effects. For example, if I would conduct a research about a new pill for pain reduction and some of my patients take aspirin but don't report it, it will show up in my data set as positive even in my control group. It serves as a way to remove these factors if we assume they will effect all groups the same way. An example of researcher bias could be two doctors having slightly different idea of, let say, a cured tumor. Two different research on the same treatment will show different results but factoring the placebo effect with a control group should show the same results. This is also why, if you look at the control group of similar researches on the same treatment you will often see different effect, because they do not have the same way of looking at data. Then there is the problem of reported effect vs real effect. A patient can report positive effect of a placebo because, while they do not experience any physiological effect, they feel they must report it as working because, &quot;hey this must work right?&quot;. You will thus see very strange results if you compare reported data of let say, asthma attacks with a bio metric measurement, here, lung strength. The placebo affect is a great tool of analysis because most medical experiments is done on humans by humans in an open environment and we need a way factor for all the implicit biases and uncontrollable factor that are not cause by what we are observing but it is not a therapeutic method and was never meant to be. There might be an influence of the body in healing, but we should not jump at this conclusion before considering all the others, more plausible influences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI(Actually)5:</p>
<p>Let's use our imaginations and pretend that you and your best friend are playing outside on a sunny day, and you both fall down and get an owie (scientifically referred to as a boo-boo) in the exact same way. </p>
<p>Your mommy is outside watering the lawn and she sees you when you start to cry. She comes over and kisses your boo-boo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile your friend's mommy is in her house drinking Rosé and thinking about what a mistake it was to get married so young, so your best friend's has to settle for his weird aunt Placebo (you know she's weird because her name is Placebo and she has a weird mole on her face) kissing his boo-boo.</p>
<p>Now you obviously feel better because mommy kisses are a very effective scientifically proven cure for boo-boos. But everyone knows weird aunt kisses don't actually do a thing to help fix a boo-boo, and your friend has also stopped crying! So what happened? Why does Aunt Placebo have such a noticeable effect?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maybe both of your boo-boos would have felt better anyway after a few minutes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe the act of kissing the boo-boo, even from a weird aunt, somehow distracts your friend and makes him think his boo-boo is better even if the underlying boo-boo is still there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe your friend stops crying because his aunt is a grown-up and he knows that grown-ups like to think that they helped (the word &quot;Placebo&quot; comes from a Latin word that means &quot;I shall please&quot;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe in the process of your friend's aunt kissing his boo-boo, he (accidentally or on purpose) rubbed some dirt on it (another scientifically proven pain reliever almost as good as mommy kisses) and you didn't notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe your friend's brain has an (as-yet unidentified by science) secret magic store of mommy kisses that it releases after getting a kiss from someone other than his mommy.</p>
</li>
<li>Maybe more than one of these could be happening at the same time!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you had to put these possibilities in order from the highest to lowest chance of being right, where would you put the magic brain one? Is it more likely that the brain has a secret magic power that science hasn't found yet? Or that something else caused your friend's boo-boo to feel better? Probably the &quot;something else&quot; right?</p>
<p>It turns out that it's really hard to study boo-boo cures while getting rid of the things that are higher on the list, so there is a very good chance that something else besides the magic secret store of mommy kisses is going on. We should probably just assume that the Aunt Placebo effect is from one or more of those, before we jump to the conclusion that Aunt Placebo gives your brain magic powers.</p>
<p>Now let's get a band-aid on that boo-boo and get you back outside, eh sport?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
