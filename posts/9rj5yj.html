		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cartooning is very labor intensive work. These days it varies a little but when you film with a camera, you record 24 frames per second. That means one second of film consists of 24 images.</p>
<p>If you're making a cartoon, that means you need 24 drawings for every second of motion picture you want. That is a huge amount of work, which is why cartoonists like to cheat.</p>
<p>Most old school animation was animated on 2's. That means that every drawing is displayed on screen for 2 consecutive frames. Now you only need to draw 12 images to fill a second of motion picture at 24 frames per second.</p>
<p>What makes modern animation look worse than 1940's animation is that animators tend to 'cheat' a lot more than they used to.</p>
<p>In the golden age of animation, the entire character was animated. Full body animations with lots of bounce, stretch and squash effects to exaggerate body motions and such. Characters also tended to be very energetic with lots of slapstick physical humour.</p>
<p>Most modern cartoon characters are animated in a way that minimises motion. There's lots of shots and scenes for instance where almost the entire character is static and only the character's mouth and eyes are animated as it speaks.</p>
<p>Think of scenes that are full of dialogue with the view just switching back and forth between characters that are mostly static.</p>
<p>Or anime type scenes where the action is either so fast that motions only take a few frames of animation or the character is simply 'powering up' with lots of flashy background animations but no real body animation.</p>
<p>Most modern animation shows are also a lot skimpier on the frames. Where looney toons might animate on two's (each frame is displayed twice in a row), many modern animations are animated on fours or even fives and sixes, so less frames have to be drawn.</p>
<p>There's a ton of examples of how you can cheat in animation to speed up production but the short of it is that the old school way of doing it basically meant putting in a ton of labour. And we mostly don't want to do that anymore because it's too expensive and slow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to everything already mentioned, there's also the fact that poor quality things are forgotten over time.  The reason why the older television shows, movies, and cartoon are so good is that only the best of the best still get watched decades later.  For every work of art remembered decades or centuries later, hundred are forgotten, so the further back you go, you tend to end up with an even more select group of the best of the best.  All the common, ordinary, lower quality cartoons have simply been forgotten over the years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the biggest difference is that the original &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry&quot; cartoons weren't TV episodes; they were short films produced for the cinema. They made 6 or 8 films per year instead of two dozen episodes like The Simpsons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dude, old cartoons were works of art! Carefully crafted by hand and intended to be seen on movie screens, not tiny TV sets.</p>
<p>And there were poor quality animated cartoons back then, mostly the banal, mass appeal stuff that was meant to be quickly produced and put of TV. Just look at the Flintstones or the Jetsons (for as long as you can before your eyes melt).</p>
<p>AND there are still highly crafted animations still made today. Look at anything Studio Ghibli makes.</p>
<p>Like most things, a lot of care and effort makes something good, while slapping something together quickly for a quick buck looks bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was more money in making them back then. Before TVs people main form of visual entertainment was the cinema, going multiple times a week. </p>
<p>Cinemas would bundle several types of film together to provide a whole nights entertainment - starting off with a newsreel, and then before the main feature they would have a cartoon, which created demand for quality animation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
