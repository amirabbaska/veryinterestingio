<p>For one thing, mass is what lets a big ball of gas hang together. So a very massive ball of rock would also have a hydrogen/helium atmosphere and look much like Jupiter. There's no shortage of rocky material added in there, it's just that so much of the universe is hydrogen or helium, so ultimately, if you can hang on to it, it's going to to take up most of the space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It could never form, because there's just not enough rock in realistic planetary disks to form Jupiter- or solar mass planets. Rocky materials form less than 0.2% of the ordinary matter of the universe, and the total mass of a protoplanetary disk is typically 10% of a solar mass or less. So even if you combined all of the rocky material in the solar system into  one planet it would have a mass of 0.02% of that of the Sun, around Saturn's mass (100 Earths). </p>
<p>More realistically, you might see a rocky planet form with a mass similar to that of Neptune (around 10 earth masses). If it formed very close to its star, it might be unable to grab any gas (too hot) and it would remain rocky. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're asking for a planet </p>
<blockquote>
<p>you could conceivably stand on</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that's actually enough to calculate the average density your planet would have. If you don't wanna be killed by that planets gravity you should have a surface gravity (at most) simular to earths, so about G=10m/s^2. Assuming with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the size of Jupiter</p>
</blockquote>
<p>you mean with the same radius: you want a radius of about r=70Mm
Using Newtonian Gravity we get: G = gamma <em> M/r^2 (gamma = 6.67</em>10^-11 m^3 / (kg <em> s^2) and M the mass of you planet) with M = V </em> rho = (4/3) <em> pi </em> r^3 <em> rho (rho is the density) and some rearranging: I end up with rho = 3 </em> G/(4 <em> pi </em> r * gamma). For the values above the density is about 500 kg/m^3 so your planet couldn't be a solid rock. Just for comparison, the density of lithium is about 534 kg/m^3. Even if you assume that your gonna train really hard and only stay for a short time you might be able to survive a surface gravity G of 20m/s^2 than you can have a planet with about 1000 kg/m^3 and your planet could be a Jupiter sized water world. But if you wont a planet the same density as earth you would probably die very quickly because the associated surface gravity is about 100m/s^2 or 10 times the level you experience on earth. If you happen to be a well trained military fighter pilot wearing a well designed suit you might not die instantly but you couldn't stay for long.
Don't even think about the Sun. rho(r=1.4e9m, 10m/s^2) ~= 24kg/m^2 so your sun sized planet couldn't really be made from any solid material I am aware off.</p>
<p>Note: I am assuming constant densities here. Something like a very light core and a thin  rocky surface might still exist although I doubt such a thing could form...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is yes. There are in fact very large rocky earth like planets that are not composed mostly of hydrogen and helium like Jupiter. </p>
<p>We have in fact discovered Jupiters sized rocky planets orbiting other stars. </p>
<p>Astronomers theorize that these planets started off as gas giants but migrated closer to their stars where the coronal mass ejection from their stars blew off the hydrogen and helium gas. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The observed exoplanets Gliese 876d at 0.0208 AU with a mass of about 0.033
Jupiter masses and 55 Cnc e at 0.045 AU with a mass of about 0.038 Jupiter masses
could be strongly eroded gas giants, while HD69830b, at 0.078 AU, HD160691d at
0.09 AU and HD69830c at 0.18 AU belonged most likely since their origin to the
Neptune-mass domain.</p>

<p>The largest earth like planet composed mostly of solid rock is Kepler 10-c which is approximatley the size of Neptune. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kepler-10c has a mass of 15–19 Earth masses. With a radius only 2.35 (2.31 to 2.44) times that of Earth (and so a volume 12–15 times that of Earth), and a density higher than Earth's (6–8 g cm−3), it is unlikely to contain significant amounts of hydrogen and helium gas. Outgassed or accreted hydrogen-rich atmospheres would have been lost over the 10.6 billion-year lifetime of the Kepler-10 system. Instead, the composition is likely to be mainly rocky, with a water fraction of 5–20% by mass. The bulk of this water is likely to be in the form of high-pressure &quot;hot ice&quot; phases</p>
