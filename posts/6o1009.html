		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Bored&quot; is a human term, and it's associated with a set of negative behaviors.  The &quot;cure for boredom&quot; in humans is additional interaction.  </p>
<p>When an octopus is in a closed area, after a while they start to take on some of these same behaviors, and they stop when they have more interaction.  Thus the term &quot;bored&quot; gets applied by the humans observing them.</p>
<p>In nature, they probably just go a little farther to explore an area beyond their normal area.  Just like humans who decide to explore frontiers.  We're applying human emotional state labels to their observed state because it makes good predictions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>afaik, the octopusses get bored and the dolphins have sex for fun are behavioural studies, which means a species in an environment is observed and a knowledge about the general mannerisms is gained.
then, this knowledge can be compared to other animals of the same species and their mannerisms and so on.</p>
<p>the 'getting bored' is more like an educated guess, because what does 'getting boredean in nature?
for humans, its a really diverse, but for animals its almost anything besides their natural instincts.</p>
<p>it is theorised that our apelike ancestors had time to think (getting bored?) beause they didnt have to spend 6-8 hrs eating due to eating meat and cooking food</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Birds, for instance, will <a href="http://www.african-grey-parrot.com/content/img/African-Grey-Feather-Plucking.jpg" target="_blank">pluck their feathers</a>.  Animals can also get abnormally aggressive, especially social animals that should normally get along well.</p>
<p>Octopi are no exception.  They get aggressive, they look obviously agitated, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
