		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Larger mammals (or even animals) in general don't subsist on insects. There are some exceptions like aardvarks but most things over a certain size tend to shift diets in order to help feed them. </p>
<p>Our ancestors as well as close relatives are no different. They largely subsist on fruits (and sometimes meat), they do eat some insects like ants and grubs but as a more opportunistic form of protein. </p>
<p>And humans are not so different. There are plenty of humans (often tribal) that will eat insects and grubs but not as primary sustenance though. </p>
<p>As for why it's not that common in more developed human society that can be due to lots of factors. First as i mentioned bugs were not a large part of our diet (meats fruits veggies were) and some humans would live in areas where bugs wouldn't be that abundant anyway. As such we don't have that much of a natural taste for them (not to mention some would likely be outright nasty like stinkbugs) </p>
<p>Moving on past the agricultural revolution people were working on plants and for protein domesticating animals. I imagine it's much easier to keep a few ungulates around in varied conditions and terrain than trying to farm insects in a hole or a hide sack, also there would be other benefits to animals like milk, eggs, leather, feathers, bone, labor, etc none of which the insects would provide.  So we never really had a history of trying to farm them, and if we aren't farming it likely we aren't eating it. </p>
<p>the final piece is disgust. Even early on grubs and other maggot type creatures would be associated with rot, bad grain etc. Insects like locust associated with plague or godly wrath. Further up the timeline just filth in general (like cockroaches and trash).  Sure farm animals are dirty but a pig in mud is a different dirty than the association of filth and insects. So over time we develop a cultural disgust for the creatures and that certainly inhibits our appetite for them.  as Jules would say, &quot;Hey, sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know 'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans do consume insects/ bugs. </p>
<p>In South Korea, its common to buy cups of mealy worms in a spicy sauce.  They even come in cans so you can eat them at home.</p>
<p>My wife loves them. I'm not opposed to eating them as long as they are spiced up.</p>
<p>Western cultures are more averse to the idea of eating bugs for protein. This probably has a lot to do with the massive meat industries in a lot of western cultures. </p>
<p>In the US, pork, chicken, and beef are cheap and plentiful. So, it would seem very odd to eat bugs for protein when other meats are so plentiful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've had a few different types of insects. Dry roasted and salted meal worms are acceptable to a western palate and a good place to start out. It's somewhere in between roasted peanuts and regular salted potato chips in taste. It's a safe route for a positive first experience eating insects. Chocolate covered ants are pretty safe too but a bit of a cop out because it's much more so chocolate than ant. I've read arguments that insects are a much more sustainable source of animal protein than traditional live stock. The amount of input cost and space required to produce a kilo of insects is dramatically lower than the costs of producing a kilo of large mammal flesh. It's my understanding that the protein content per kilogram is also higher in the insects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
