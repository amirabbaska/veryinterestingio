		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of roughness means there's more highs &amp; lows in the towel fibers. That increased surface area allows more area for absorption and therefore allows for better drying.</p>
<p>You could try to make a towel soft by increasing the density of fibers/yarns but then if you increase it too much you just approach a solid surface meaning there's less surface area for absorption again. I'd say in reality there's a balance in the type of fibers/cloth a towel has which determines its softness/absorption capabilities and your actual fiber/yarn count. There are very soft towels (supima cotton) which can be <a href="http://thesweethome.com/reviews/best-bath-towel/" target="_blank">extremely good at drying</a>. You don't necessarily need to sand your skin to get a good towel. I personally use the Pottery Barn towels that Sweet Home recommended a few years ago, and they've spoiled me. I end up hating most towels at hotels unless I stay at a nice place. Even the JW I stayed at a few months ago had towels that felt like sandpaper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fabric softeners coat the towel fibres with a film that isn't very water absorbent, which makes the towel feel softer, but it won't absorb (dry you) as well. Generally, towels should be washed with just detergent at a relatively high temperature (60 degrees celsius+), and tumble dried to fluff up the fibres/threads to ensure maximum surface area. The drying in a machine is important, as towels which are air dried will tend to have the threads clump together which creates that rough feeling too.</p>
<p>Lots of hotel towels that feel rough are just using dense cotton designed to last longer, or they are overly worn and the threads are short.</p>
<p>Like with bed sheets, towels are one item where it's worth investing a few extra bucks to ensure good quality and they will last way longer than a cheaper product using poor materials. Egyptian cotton is considered one of the best. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
