<p>See <a href="https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/204303718-Submitting-Your-Game-To-Humble-Bundle" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/202742080-Humble-Store-FAQ-For-Developers" target="_blank">here</a> for where I got this info.</p>
<p>Profits on their bundles are made through the &quot;Humble Tip&quot; system, which is a slider that configures how much they are paid compared to the developers and charities. By default, (I used the current bundles to check this) the developers are paid 65%, charities 15%, and Humble 20%.</p>
<p>On Store sales, Humble says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After deductions for payment processor fees (typically around 5%) the net revenue is split 3 ways: 75% to developers, 10% to charity and 15% to Humble Bundle to cover costs associated with hosting the content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Humble Widgets are slightly different, as they are solely managed by the developer to distribute content using Humble's infrastructure. The revenue is split <a href="https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/202742190-Widget-Developer-FAQ" target="_blank">95% to devs and 5% to Humble</a> as a fee for using their infrastructure. <a href="https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/214918618-Humble-Self-Service-Tools" target="_blank">Here's</a> Humble's guide to devs for how to manage their widget sales.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the site and how legit they are.
For example Green Man Gaming is an Valve authorized seller, that sources its keys in legit ways and they are themselves directly involved in the sourcing of keys. Straight up getting keys from devs themselves is a common way of getting a batch of &quot;discount&quot; keys. </p>
<p>Humble sources its keys usually from developers themselves. Usually it is the developers who send these keys to Humble and get a piece of the bundle price, depending on the percentage set by buyers (you can choose the percentages of which go to humble and to devs and to charities) and how big a part of the overall bundle their game(s) were. Humble store sells games usually at normal retail prices with sales from time to time. Humble monthly works simiarly to the Humble Bundles</p>
<p>Then there is the Clusterfuck McShitface the third, aka. G2A aka. Kinguin aka. countless other shell names/companies they are known as. </p>
<p>They are a platform that anyone and everyone can register as a key reseller.
They also have extremely lax rules about sourcing their keys. These sites are favoured by shady key resellers, scammers and straight up thieves. </p>
<p>One way G2A resellers may source their keys is by buying them in bulk with stolen credit cards. Or using credit cards to buy keys and then Chargeback them and leaving the developers to pay up for the chargeback fees and that actually incur costs to developers.</p>
<p>From developers perspective, its actually better you to pirate a game than buy it from these shady sellers, since usually Devs don't see a dime, or even incur costs from you buying here. </p>
<p>Also there is a risk that the keys you buy may be revoked for them being sourced illegaly.
This is where G2A and its ilk starts to make a killing with protection money racket bussiness: selling insurances against revoked keys. If you don't buy in to the racket and your key gets revoked for any reason, you are screwed; you lose the money, you lose the game. And this on top of the commission they skim off the sales made on their platform.</p>
<p>Most of the shady sellers here may get their game just as physical copies from cheaper countries, like Russia for example, and when you buy a game, all you get is a picture of the game code from the physical box.
There is a reason the cesspool of G2A is despised by many. Me included.</p>
<p>TL;DR: The games are usually sourced wholesale straight from developer or publishers if the site is legit. If Shady, from anything from hacking to credit card fraud to russian store games.</p>
<p>EDIT: BTW the way I mean it Developer can be substituted by Publisher, since if a developer has a publisher for its game, Publisher handles all the sales and distribution of keys.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Also, While steam has its own prices. It is the publishers that decide the price, not Valve. Thus if publisher wants to have a sale only on GMG it can do so. They just request a list of Keys from Valve for game X and set that List of keys for sale on GMG. Valve usually does get a small cut from each key they provide, since it does incur costs for Valve as all the network traffic is directed at Valve in the Steam client.</p>
<p>Edit3, Disclaimer edition: Some seem to think I'm a developer. Nope I ain't. I drive trucks for a living. Those noodles you ate? I may have had my hand on getting it to you, altough probably not though being a european and all. However, I've been screwed over by these companies in the past before I knew better of them.</p>
<p>Also, thanks for the gold, I guess?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been part of some of these conversations on the Developer side.  It's all boring, but here is the gist of it.  </p>
<p>So, Developers on Steam can create a large number of keys to sell on other retail sites.  Valve doesn't care about this, and they will happily provide a developer with thousands of keys through a really easy to use web interface in their partner back end.  Steam does <strong>NOT</strong> take a cut from these sales.  They are fine with that.  If a developer abuses it, they'll cut 'em off or remove them from their platform entirely (see <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/26/16368178/steam-shovelware-removed-asset-flipping" target="_blank">Silicon Echos</a>, who as part of their asset flipping scheme abused this system).</p>
<p>Sites like Humble and Green Man Gaming will buy large keyfiles from developers for an agreed upon price.  Lets say GMG wants to sell a game for $50, they'll buy the keys for $35 a copy (or whatever 30% is usually, same as Valve's cut).   Humble store is similar.  You'll provide them with a keyfile with something like 10,000 keys, and they'll cut you a check for 10k * bulk key price.  If they get low, they'll do another big buy.  </p>
<p>Humble Bundle is a bit different.  Humble Bundle does tiers, and the games at different tiers fetch different prices per copy.  This is usually at a sale price per-key, something like $2-3 a copy for games well past their prime, up to $15 a copy for games that are newer and on Humble Bundle.  The higher the price for the tier, the more minimum purchase level they user has to buy at to get the game.  Humble Bundle usually takes a loss at really low dollar amount sales, but enough people buy at or above the combined cost of the bundled games to make it profitable.  Also, since Humble donates some money to charities, they are able to write off chunks of each sale and not pay taxes on that revenue.  It ends up working out for them.  </p>
<p>G2A is a piece of shit website and you should never buy from them.  Really, any &quot;marketplace&quot; where you don't buy from the devs themselves is pretty shitty.  You don't know where those keys come from, and it's very likely they were purchased with a stolen credit card off of Steam (or humble or whatever).  Usually the owner of said stolen credit card will issue a chargeback, causing the key to become disabled (it's all automated on steam's back end, the developer doesn't even see it happening) and you lose access to your game.  You have no warning, and in some cases can even get your steam account banned.  Avoid it.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Developer here.</p>
<p>Not sure about Green Man Gaming, but Humble Bundle (and some other bundle sites) directly contact developers of games they wish to feature in their bundle. They request x number of steam keys (or other keys) and give an estimate of how much the developer would earn. Additional information like games already locked into the bundle, release dates, bundle duration, how previous bundles sold and average game cuts are shared as well.</p>
<p>Steam doesn't get any cut; they only get their cut when a game is purchased through their site. Developers can request x number of keys from Steam, and it takes a day or two to get approval (or disapproval). Developers hand a massive list of keys over to Humble Bundle and receive payments from the result of the bundle not too long after it's all done. With Humble Bundle, there's a default amount that goes to charity and to each game developer. However, customers can pretty much change how much of their money goes where if they wish.</p>
<p>Humble basically get the keys for free, part of the proceeds go to charity the other to the developers and Humble Bundle.</p>
<p>EDIT: Additionally, unsold keys are sent back to the developers for deactivation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humble does NOT get their key from cheaper regions.</p>
<p>They most likely get them from the developpers themselves, as part of their bundles, or on the humble store.</p>
<p>Steam takes a pretty hefty tax on games, so if Humble or other websites can just take a lower tax, it's good for the devs, since they get more people to see their game, and more people to buy it since the price can be cheaper elsewhere.</p>
<p>Websites that get their games in Russia or other cheaper places are websites like G2A or Kinguin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
