		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called a hypnic jerk, and I only know of a theory, as it is poorly understood. So, you're lying down, feeling sleepy, you've had a rough day, your body tries to rush you into sleeping, instead of going through all sleep phases, it skips them and goes directly to REM sleep (rapid eye movement - this is when you usually start dreaming). When your brain does that, it didn't give your systems enough time to cool off, so instead of a gradual lowering of temperature(T) , heart beat(HR) and respiration rate(RR) , there's a sudden low T, HR, &amp; RR, your brain then thinks yours systems are failing, and sends a signal, a twitch throughout your body to jump start them again.
Again, this is one of the suggested theories as it's still a poorly understood phenomenon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many years ago I read a book, I think it was Dragons of Eden by Carl Sagan.  In the book was the theory that it was a reaction based on our evolution from apes. We used to sleep in trees and if we were to slip while asleep our bodies would jerk us awake to prevent our fall.  I could be wrong. I often am.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During Stage 1 NREM, the body is trying to transition from awake states to deep sleep. During that period, the body starts to block some sensations and slow down bodily processes. The reason you feel like you are falling is because your body has desensitized the sensation of pressure from the bed, so you panic and reach out to grab something, which brings you back awake to realize you were just in your bed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
