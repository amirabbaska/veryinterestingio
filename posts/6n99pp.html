		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Women's sizes basically mean nothing anymore.  They were suppose to be a ratio of bust, waist, and hip and were meant to show a smaller number because it made women feel better about their body.  Smaller number is just more appealing than something like inches.  They don't seem to be standard at all anymore.  Women just wing it at the store, I think.  I guess it kind of forces women to look around more to find the size that fits them in each brand too... probably helps sell more clothes.</p>
<p>Men's size is supposed to be waist and inseam.  Unfortunately it's not even accurate anymore.  I have bought 4 pair of pants recently.  All Jeans, all the same manufacturer, all the same cut, all different colors.  All 34x32.  Two pair are exact 34x32.  Two are 32x31.  There is no reason...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I have three pairs of 34&quot; waist pants, and they measure from 33&quot; to 37&quot;! Even the same brand can have drastically different measurements. I once bought the same pair of pants I already owned (favorite jeans were getting a bit destroyed), and the replacement pair were almost 2&quot; smaller!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Women's sizes, at one point, were inches minus twenty. So if you had a 28 inch waist, you were a size 8. It's a much bigger mess these days  and varies wildly from brand to brand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wanted to know about this too. I found that some women's pant sizes correspond to the waist measurement in inches minus 10 or 20. So a size 14 could actually be 34 inches around the waist and a size 8 might be 28 inches. I figured this out by directly comparing a size 14 women's jeans with a men's size 34 and also some other sizes. This doesn't explain all the different standards for different pieces of clothing but I know for at least some pants this works.</p>
