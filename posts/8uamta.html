		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets say you work for a company and you feel like you deserve a raise.  You walk into your boss's office and you say, &quot;Pay me more or I  quit&quot;.  Your boss can let you quit - it is easy to replace a single worker after all.</p>
<p>Now, lets say that you get <em>everyone</em> in the company to walk into your boss's office and say, &quot;Pay us more or we quit&quot;.  Your boss isn't so quick to let that happen - if everyone quits, then the company can't do any of its business.  They are going be much more likely to listen to why you all deserve that raise.</p>
<p>That is the ultimate benefit of unions - a single worker has virtually no power to ask a company for anything and is easy to deny, but a <em>group</em> of workers has much more value to the company and, as a collective, will be taken much more seriously.</p>
<p>Now, naturally, your boss knows all of this and doesn't want you to have this kind of power.  They are going to do everything in their power to keep this from happening because unions don't benefit the company, only the worker.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I work for Southwest Airlines going on 16 years now, I can say without a doubt that our raises, vacation time, and better work conditions are a direct result of having good union representation during negotiations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything everyone is saying can be summed up by the term &quot;collective bargaining.&quot; That is the main benefit of the union. In many companies, even a rumor of unionization can get you fired. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Companies would rather negotiate with their employees one-on-one, because that places them in a position of power and leverage.  They can use that position to exploit their employees.</p>
<p>When a group of people unionize, the employer must deal with them as a collective rather than individually.  They are no longer able to exploit their position to the same degree and they are forced to accept a more equitable deal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
