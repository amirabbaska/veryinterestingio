		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus-X#ISS_centrifuge_demonstration" target="_blank">proposed ISS module</a> that would have simulated partial gravity in this module, e.g. for astronauts sleeping there. Didn't make it unfortunately.</p>
<p>The ISS is designed to explore the effects of microgravity as primary goal. Spinning the whole station would ruin its purpose. Same for all previous space stations.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the effects of cosmic radiation on astronauts are worse than the effects of microgravity over time.  If we created a space station that simulated gravity, it would reduce the longterm effects of microgravity and make longterm habitation possible, but staying on board such a station for as few as five years might be a death sentence.</p>
<p>Until we figure out effective radiation shielding for long term stays in space, spinning a space station isn't a high priority.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more of an economic hurdle. As i heard it once, &quot;We could build cities that are unharmed by earthquakes, if we had unlimited funds.&quot;
As you noted, the expense would be huge to do what? Add a few tenths of a G, how much benefit is there compared to the cost? We understand pretty well the effects of inertia and centripedal force on simulating gravity, so there's not even a scientific benefit to get from the effort.
Essentially my point is, we could work miracles if money were no object, but it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well there's lots of good answers here, but you actually don't need a ring at all. Just pod/capsule, a counter weight, and a tether connecting them. Spin gravity works just as well without the ring and you can spin at longer distances easier by using a long tether to avoid the disorientation effects of small rings. Also, lots of great info in this Isaac Arthur video.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that a rotating space station creating artificial gravity would need to be massive in order to reduce the difference in speed and artificial gravity experienced between the outermost and innermost parts of the ring. </p>
<p>The closer to the center rotation point something is, the less distance it needs to travel to make a full rotation so the slower it travels and the less artificial gravity it produces. Anyone with their feet on the outermost edge would have their heads closer to the center so they'd be experiencing different amounts of speed and artificial gravity over their body. If the difference is too great then it would be extremely disorienting with the sensation that their feet are moving faster than their heads like if they were constantly falling over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
