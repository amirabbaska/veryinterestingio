		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, a bit if history. Avogadro had made the idea of a mole as you described (12 grams of carbon in carbon 12), but he didn't actually create the constant of 6.02x10^23. What's important is that moles have been around.</p>
<p>Michael Faraday worked in the 1830s on electrolysis, and he had been able to calculate the electric charge per mole of electron. The number of elections was still not known, though.</p>
<p>In 1910, Robert Millikan was able to measure the charge of an election. Taking something like hydrogen, for example, he had to get a mole of hydrogen which was a mass he already knew, calculate the charge, and divide that by the charge of one electron. That formula gave him the number of electrons, and the constant we use today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not directly related to the question but tangentially relevant: there has been a movement in the sciences to &quot;shelf&quot; the representational artifacts of SI units (things like the platinum? ingot that represented 1 kilogram) and replace them with values based on observational data (like one meter being the distance covered in ~1/3.0x10^8  seconds by light in a vacuum. This also applies to Avogadro's number - there are a series of experiments being done to define it as a distinctly measurable value.</p>
<p>Other examples include a team trying to create a polished sphere of silicon atoms that equals exactly &quot;one kilogram&quot; thereby defining the unit as an equivalent of a fundamental measurement (number of atoms).</p>
<p>So the answer to your question is that these values can be based on theoretical values that are verified experimentally, or by experiments that correlate to a fundamental measurement. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
