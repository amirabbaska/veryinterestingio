		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Context, Not my question. I'm just absolutely terrible at explaining to other people.</p>
<p>I recently got into filmmaking and am purchasing some starter lights. One of them happens to be a rather sizable LED panel for about 200$, I figured it's a relatively nice choice. An associate of mine questioned why i am doing that when a portable (Portable meaning 4&quot; x 5&quot;) LED panel does the same exact thing? Or why I'd look at eventually moving up to a 500$ LED light when that panel still does the same thing? </p>
<p>I have trouble explaining, but I essentially broke it down as the components in said gear, as with almost any gear you'd look at, are tested to perform in conditions that you'd want to put it through. They're built to last, they offer performance features that a tiny panel may not offer, and that skimping on the price wouldn't be worth a super shitty lighting condition if it can be avoided on a shoot that I am being paid for. </p>
<p>Help me explain to someone, Please.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The issue is color temperature - and, specifically, Color Rendition - how color shows up on camera, and how well they illuminate colored objects.</p>
<p>A true tungsten light is just a very hot piece of metal. It outputs every color of light, in a smooth gradient, with more oranges and reds in ordinary ones, and more blue in hotter halogen globes.</p>
<p>Other light sources only imitate this.</p>
<p>Cheap 'white' LEDS could do this with a bright blue LED and a simple yellow phosphor that absorbs some of that blue light and output some yellow. While this looks white to our eyes, it is really just some yellow and blue light. If you put something red under such a light, it will appear black, as there is no red light there. Same thing with a green object. But a yellow or blue object will be overbright, as there is too much yellow and blue there. We say this LED has a poor 'color rendering index', or CRI.</p>
<p>LEDs improve the CRI by making that yellow phosphor a mix of different phosphors, that produce many different colors of light - from deep reds through to cyan. This mix of light is a better substitute for that smooth mixture of all the colors of a tungsten light. But there are still gaps in the light curve, because an individual phosphor emits a very narrow band of color. It will also have a gap  just below blue, will have too much of the light made by the blue LED, and none of the violets.</p>
<p>The more of this you do, the less efficient your LED is. Turning blue into deep red throws away lots of your LEDs energy, so a normal LED doesn't have any deep red phophors. Making cyans also wastes power, so normal ones just let the excess of blue take care of it. But this means there are some colors that don't show up well, but that's OK for house lighting.</p>
<p>But this is no good for camera work. For that you need LEDs made with lots of phosphors, phosphors that absorb most of that blue light. Or even LEDs that use a near-ultraviolet LED, and produce all of the visible light with phosphors. This gives great color rendition, but is less efficient.</p>
<p>LEDS with really good color rendition are not made in the same huge numbers as normal white LEDs, so they are much more expensive. So lights made with them are going to be a lot more expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another thing beyond capabilities that the cheaper lights may not have is that the expensive lights offer reliability and support on another level. Suppose for example you are shooting on a RED Weapon camera kitted out with all the bells and whistles that comes to around a quarter of a million dollars. You are on location and burning in excess of a million dollars a day. Every minute counts; what lighting panel do you want? The one which is $400 and is extensively tested to work with your camera and equipment, where if you have a problem you can call directly to an expert engineer and also can next-day ship a replacement anywhere in the world? Or do you want the $40 panel which is &quot;pretty good&quot;?</p>
<p>The high end panels aren't really for the average Joe but they have their place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former magazine/fashion photographer/camera equipment reviewer/current hobbyist here: I would recommend just buying the cheap one if you don’t even know what the expensive ones do. I’m not trying to be snarky but it’s the ONLY way you’re going to learn exactly why you need to spend so much for a light.</p>
<p>Lights for photography are expensive because they <em>do</em> things that other lights do not. I would gladly pay 5 times the price for my several thousand dollar lights because they saved me at least that much in the specific things I do. </p>
<p>You don’t do anything, so you do not need a light that does anything. Asking why a $500 light is better than a $20 light is like asking why a $50 crow bar costs more than a $5 steel rod even if they do the exact same thing. Then asking if a $200 table saw would be better than the $50 crow bar. You buy a light to solve a problem not to spend money. If you’re just spending money you are already buying the wrong thing. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Nobody can tell you what tool you need to buy or which would be best at the hardware store if they don’t know exactly what <em>project</em> you’re using it for. Once you buy the junk, use it to make content, and look at a <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?ci=12260&amp;fct=fct_accessory-type_2804%7cbalance-card&amp;N=4077634549" target="_blank">color chart</a> of it’s results you’ll have your starting point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A likely difference between panels made for photography is the ability
to change the color temperature of the light. It might also be hard to know the temperature the cheep light will have and it might not be the same for different panel.</p>
<p>Another difference might be how the light is distributed  if it is even.</p>
<p>So if you might be able to find cheap one that works find but a question is how hard it is to find and test them. The construction quality is likely different a product designed for fixed installation will not survive being handled the same way as one that is designed to be moved. The mounting options that exist on one for photography is likely not the same as the one for installation.</p>
<p>Light rating on cheep LED product from non name brands are often quite misleading. I would not trust the listing of some cheep panel you might find online.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
