		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whoa nelly, there is a lot of crazy semi-science going on here, I'll try to get at the heart of the problem:</p>
<p>Capillary action in this case is due to the high porosity of cellulose based materials (like napkins). Water has very favorable interactions with cellulose due to hydrogen bonding and wants to adhere to it. Upon contact, a concentration gradient is established, and water is drawn up into the napkin until it reaches an equilibrium state where the napkin has no more free &quot;spots&quot; for water to interact. The reason water goes against gravity is that the favorable interactions between water and cellulose WAY overcome gravity.</p>
<p>Now where does the energy for this come from. The answer is (as always) derived from gibbs free energy i.e. entropy and enthalpy. The act of water swelling cellulose is actually <em>exothermic</em>(gives off heat), as are most spontaneous processes, so this system doesn't need heat input to work. So water swelling cellulose is favorable because it gives a negative gibbs free energy value. <del>As the reaction is occurring, our trade off is that we lose entropy due to the organization that occurs when water is interacting with cellulose. The lost entropy is accounted for by giving off heat. When we combine our enthalpy of reaction and entropy value, we get a negative number, which in our universe denotes a favorable process.</del></p>
<p><del>At the nanoscale here is what is happening: A water molecule with some amount of kinetic energy (which is really the same as temperature) enters a cellulose pore and forms part of a solvent cage around a single cellulose monomer. Since it is interacting with a cellulose monomer, it is no longer as free to move around, and must shed energy, which probably happens by slamming into another molecule. This happens 10^(really big number times), and the net effect is that the temperature of the non-interacting water molecules increases.</del></p>
<p>Edit: I feel obliged to correct my explanation of the thermodynamics of this system. The energy for the napkin to be wetted is derived from the favorable interaction of cellulose with water, as opposed to less favorable interaction of cellulose with air. This actually ends up increasing the entropy of the system, since the surface of cellulose now has many more states it can sample as water molecules interact with it. Entropy can increase without heat input. The heat emitted is due to to the fact that we are breaking water-water interactions and replacing them with less favorable water-cellulose interactions. The difference in energy between the two interactions is released as heat. This replacement is driven by the fact that increasing entropy is always favorable in a system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK people, per someone else's request, I am pasting an answer I already gave, if you are worried about &quot;Karma whoring&quot; then just down vote my other comment.  You can find it <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2irvlk/when_a_napkin_is_dipped_in_water_where_does_the/cl4z5ok" target="_blank">here</a>...</p>
<p>Regarding where the <strong>energy</strong> comes from..</p>
<p>From this water's perspective, we can consider this a free energy process, so that we need to think about ethalpic and entropic contributions to the free energy.</p>
<p>From the outside perspective, we need to account for the change in gravitational potential energy.</p>
<p>At equilibrium, the free energy for further capillary action must be zero (by definition).</p>
<p>So, where does the energy come from, from the water's perspective? We can try to reason this out.
We know that water structure at interfaces is greater than in solution. Thus, it cannot be entropic. Indeed, we are going to pay an entropic price for the capillary action.</p>
<p>Thus, we know that the origin must be enthalpic in nature -- and we must only consider this sort of explanation.</p>
<p>From an enthalpic perspective, what is happening is that the water has a stronger interaction with the &quot;walls&quot; of the pores within the napkin. That is, the attractive force between the water and the cellulose in the napkin is greater than between the water and itself.</p>
<p>On a water-by-water molecule basis, each water molecule would &quot;prefer&quot; to be close to the cellulose than close to another water.
Why?</p>
<p>It comes down to electrostatics (again, note we are dealing with enthalpic considerations, which is our clue here). The electrostatic interaction between the walls of the napkin and water is greater than the interaction between water molecules.</p>
<p>From an energy perspective, then, we know as the molecules of water move closer to the cellulose, it will give off energy, in the form of enthalpy.</p>
<p>This is where the energy comes from -- decreasing the distance that separates two opposite charges. In this case, it is actually dipoles, but the end result is the same. We wish to decrease the distance between the heads and tails of two dipoles -- doing so will decrease the energy of the system.</p>
<p>Now, the way this is done is to maximize the area that the water &quot;sees&quot; of the napkin, and the only way this can be done is by &quot;spreading out&quot; over the napkin.</p>
<p>In the example provided by OP, this will happen by going &quot;up&quot; the napkin, to the point where the increase in column height of the water is equal to the free energy change that was experienced by the column of water, with respect to the interaction between water and cellulose.</p>
<p>That is the energy perspective.</p>
<p>Edit: Obligatory thank you to the random stranger who was kind enough to buy me gold.  You are a gentleman (or lady) and a scholar (since you read this?)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was in 6th grade, I was shown capillary action.  I immediately tried building a closed-loop system that would use capillary action to bring water up and drip it down again, but I couldn't get my hands on the right combination of rubber stoppers and glass tubing to make it work. I was convinced I would become a billionaire if I could make a perpetual dripping machine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It happens through capillary action, and the energy for it comes from inherent attraction of water for some materials.  At the water's surface, the tense &quot;film&quot; is a sign that the charged water molecules are in a special arrangement, due to their higher attraction for each other rather than the air; this called cohesion.  Another property of water molecules is that they are attracted to surfaces containing charged and/or polar molecules, which are thus known as hydrophillic (uncharged and nonpolar surfaces tend to repel water and are called hydrophobic).  Hydrophillic surfaces include glass and cellulose, of which wood and paper are made.
The &quot;stickiness&quot; of water molecules for hydrophillic surfaces causes water to naturally want to spread out over them, and when this is coupled with water molecules' cohesion, especially in the surface film, it results in a whole lot of water molecules wanting to follow each other and spread out over that surface.<br />
If the space that the surface encloses is small enough (like among the microscopic fibers of a piece of paper, or the vasculature of a plant), the attraction of the cohesive water molecules for the surrounding surface will be sufficient to overcome it's own weight under gravity, and thus rise up into the paper fibers, or the plant stem, or the sponge chambers.  In the absence of gravity, it makes for cute demonstrations by astronauts of water &quot;walking&quot; out of a container.  That is capillary action at work, and is the reason that water wicks up into absorbent hydrophillic materials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
