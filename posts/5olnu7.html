		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brown noise helps you focus by removing auditory distractions.  Its the same idea as closing your eyes to help you hear or smell better.</p>
<p>Brown noise works better than simply blocking out sound with earplugs because our hearing become more sensitive when it's quiet.  In a completely silent room where you can &quot;hear a pin drop&quot;, the faintest of sounds (e.g. the aforementioned pin) will stick out.  Your brain needs to assess all of these faint sounds to ensure they aren't important (a threat, your name being called, etc.).  If you are listening to brown noise, you can't hear anything other than the brown noise, so there are no other sounds for your brain to assess.  Furthermore, your brain determined the brown noise was unimportant and could be ignored within a few seconds of turning it on, so with no new sounds to interpret, you've done the auditory equivalent of closing your eyes.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a bit more science, we can talk about brain regions.  Although there are specialized areas for different types of sensory processing (occipital lobe for visual stimuli, the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe for auditory stimuli), this information still travels to the frontal cortex to be consciously assessed.  Brown noise allows the primary auditory cortex to stop bugging your frontal cortex with dumb messages like &quot;HEY! A DOOR JUST OPENED!  DO WE CARE?&quot; and lets it focus on important things, like the exam I should be studying for right now.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR listening to brown noise is the auditory equivalent of closing your eyes to focus</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Your brain is especially attuned to detect changes in your surroundings. If there's a low level of background information...when it's silent almost any sound can alert your brain and you can't help but to pay attention...like a dripping tap or a snoring partner...white, pink and BROWN noise playing across all frequencies are like a muffling blanket of sound....they mask other sounds by making them less significant when compared to the background&quot; </p>
<p>...I didn't explain it like you are five, [its from this SciShow] (<a href="https://youtu.be/9T978ES0LdQ" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/9T978ES0LdQ</a>)</p>
<p>Essentially brown noise isn't distracting, its a nice blend of sounds balanced for the human ear so that the highs aren't too high. This helps minimize outside interference allowing you more brain power to focus on the task at hand rather than wasting it interpreting random noises, a trait which may at some point in human evolution permitted you to survive and extended your gene pool's fitness but now, in the age of information, prevents you from studying.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brown noise or white noise helps you focus because the brain processes it as silence. In a quiet room and even in complete silence, slight noises like the beating of your heart or blood flow through your ear are still present. Brown noise covers these sounds up and replaces it with a more complete&quot;silence.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you are looking for is most likely the phenomenon of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_resonance" target="_blank">stochastic resonance</a>.
Simply explained, it works like this:</p>
<p>To successfully send and receive a signal, your nerves/neurons need to get their electrical signal over a certain threshold so that it counts. </p>
<p>If you add random but constant noise to the situation, it adds to the strengths of all signals, making them more likely to cross the threshold and being effective. </p>
<p>The German wiki-article has a good picture too explain it: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/6/6f/Stoch_reson_example1.png" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/6/6f/Stoch_reson_example1.png</a></p>
<p>So now more of the signals have effect, which is similar to having better concentration/&quot;stronger brain signals&quot;.</p>
<p>The isolation from distractions is also very useful, but complete silence without distractions would have less of an effect than white noise.</p>
<p>A related example would be one of the main factors of ADHD:
Due to a lower dopamine level, control-signals in the frontal lobe are less likely to have an effect and an ADHD brain needs more effort to reach the same level of concentration/control. If you correct the dopamine level through certain drugs (which would put other people in TOO-MUCH-DOPAMINE-EVERYTHING-IS-INTERESTING-MODE aka &quot;being stimmed&quot;), concentration returns to normal level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
