		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure, it does, but 'the water cycle' doesn't just revolve around Bob's Cattle farm. The fact that Bob's water eventually makes its way back to the sea doesn't mean Bob's neighbor is going to get an equivalent amount of rain, or that the people downstream from Bob are going to drink cattle pee. </p>
<p>We may not be reducing the amount of water <em>on the entire earth</em> but you can still exhaust local supply of potable water, and there's not necessarily a 1 to 1 replacement 'strategy' in place by nature. </p>
<p>Local drinkable water may rely on expensive technologies to create (desalination) or exhaustible local sources (aquifers) and the like. You can definitely exhaust these without removing all the water from the water cycle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

So, as shorthand, whenever you hear someone talking about wasting water, don't think of it as &quot;wasting some of the water on planet earth,&quot; which is basically unchanging. Think of it as &quot;wasting some of the limited fresh water presently available to be accessed by human beings.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the Earth's supply is recycled, it's distribution can become a factor. When one place is flooding, another place is in a drought.</p>
<p>Also, water costs money, so the farmer has to be able to make enough profit to cover their water bill. </p>
<p>If they get water from a well, they may still have to pay someone to ship a truck of water and dump it in the well, during dry periods. </p>
<p>The cost of water is not necessarily non-renewable, however, someone has to pump, filter, or ship water, maintain pipes, water plants, and infrastructure, etc. All of his is to make sure that each home, farm, and office building has clean water all year round, regardless of climate or weather condition. All these people have to be paid.</p>
<p>It also costs money for them to take your waste water and everything that goes down your drain, so they can treat it, clean it, filter it, and either reuse it, dump it, or contain it.</p>
<p>Its not free.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. However, water used for human consumption and industrial use doesn't really return immediately as stored groundwater that we can extract as soon as we need to. Groundwater underneath rock formations generally moves at a very slow pace. Even at shallow depths (&lt;20 meters below ground level) groundwater usually flows a few centimeters per day, impermeable rock formations may further impede flow to just centimeters per month. Even more so with groundwater found at depths of &lt;200 meters, where much of the world tap their water supply from; water flows at a rate of meters per thousands of years.</p>
<p>That's why groundwater depletion and recharge is a hot topic this decade. It may take just hours to return water as rainfall but groundwater recharge and movement will take hundreds if not thousands of years in many places around the world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
