		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several have mentioned erythropoietin and increased production of red blood cells in bone marrow, but that isn't the whole picture. We also need to increase the actual blood volume to compensate for the bleeding. </p>
<p>The kidney has a ton of different functions. One of them is regulating your blood pressure. When you lose blood, your kidney will notice a fall in blood pressure as the blood flow through the organ decreases. To compensate, the kidney will start reabsorbing more water from urine (or rather, primary urine), which will increase the blood volume. (It does this by increasing its secretion of an enzyme called renin, which will cause the production of a hormone called angiotensin. Angiotensin increases the reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidney, which will cause water reabsorption by osmosis.) </p>
<p>In addition, there are receptors in some of your larger arteries (particularly the carotid bifurcation) that can also sense a fall in blood pressure. These are called baroreceptors. They will signal to the brain and tell it to release a hormone called ADH, which also makes the kidney absorb more water. </p>
<p>So to answer your question: Your body has several ways of measuring blood pressure and will retain water if blood pressure falls (i.e. your blood volume decreases as a result of bleeding). When enough water has been retained, your blood pressure will normalise. When this happens, the kidney will stop reabsorbing extra water and therefore stop increasing the blood volume.</p>
<p>I hope this helped! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Special cells in the kidneys, called peritubular cells, sense that the level of oxygen in the blood has decreased (due to the loss of red cells) and start secreting a protein called erythropoietin. This passes through the bloodstream until it reaches the bone marrow (the soft fatty tissue inside the bone cavities).</p>
<p>The bone marrow produces stem cells, the building blocks that the body uses to make the different blood cells â€“ red cells, white cells and platelets. The erythropoietin sends a message to the stem cells telling more of them to develop into red blood cells, rather than white cells or platelets.</p>
<p>Your body makes about 2 million new red cells every second, so it doesn't take long to build up stores of them again.</p>
<p>What about your white cells and platelets? A number of other messenger proteins also stimulate the production of these cells in the bone marrow, and over the next few days levels return to normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In your kidneys there are special cells called peritubular cells. They sense that oxygen level is low (because there are less blood cells). So they secrete a protein called erythropoietin. This floats in the blood stream until it gets to your bone marrow, which is in the center of your long bones.</p>
<p>Bone marrow makes red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The erythropoietin signals that your bone marrow should make more red blood cells. Then when you make enough blood cells, the oxygen level will go back up to normal and your peritubular cells will stop releasing erythropoietin. </p>
