		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is the low-down.  Spiders' prey is often much more mobile than the spider is.  Flying insects, jumping insects, and other quick moving prey only need a second to escape a few feet out of the spider's grasp.  Even if the venom kills the prey after it escapes, it doesn't get the spider a meal and is thus ineffective.  This situation means there is a large evolutionary incentive for the spider's venom to be EXTREMELY fast acting, which means the venom is extremely potent.  When it bites a horse, it doesn't kill the horse immediately, but the potent venom still has enough oomph to kill it slowly.</p>
<p>For a similar example in the marine environment, see the cone snail and its gnasty cocktail of toxins!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I've understood from countless hours in front of the Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, and the likes, it goes something like this. Itsy bitsy spider is hungry, and wants a snack. All snacks have either wings, legs to run or jump with, or some other kind of defensive strategy. In order for the snack to become a snack, the itsy bitsy spider has to kill it REALLY fast. When a tarantula spots a small bird, and goes in for the kill, the poison has to act fast enough for the bird to drop almost instantly. Same goes for other insects that move quick as hell, or rodents.</p>
<p>In the sea the same principle occurs, only stronger. Sea snakes are among the most venomous creatures on Earth (in the sense of fast-acting) because there it's even more important that your dinner snack don't escape (them fishies move fast, man).</p>
<p>So, it's about speed. Speedy kills prevent snack from getting away. If it drops dead two minutes after a bite, it would be hard for a visually challenged spider to find it. It's not like a komodo dragon that can bite a deer, then stalk it for hours (cuz it got good sense of smell, with the tongue) until it dies from BACTERIA infection. I mean, Jesus... That's just cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Essentially, millions of years of evolution in a given environment has increased their natural toxic levels to combat their natural predators. Predators develop better immunities to a given toxin or die off, and this process continues on until one of the species either dies off or changes its dietary habits. It results in species that are able to withstand larger doses of a toxin, and a species with a very powerful toxin. </p>

<p>Bryson.  And this doesn't apply to spiders, but there are cases of co-evolution running away with things like this -- For instance, some newts contain enough poison to kill bunches of humans.  The reason is because they only have one type predator, and they're in an arms race... Newt gets poisonous, snake gets more resistant, repeat.  </p>

<p>Similar things have happened with cheetahs and antelopes -- the only thing fast enough to catch antelopes are cheetahs, and cheetahs mostly only eat antelopes.  So they continually select for faster cheetahs and faster antelopes.  At this point, cheetahs are so fast they have to use their tails as rudders</p>

<p>It's called an evolutionary arms race, and there's even a wikipedia page on it.</p>
