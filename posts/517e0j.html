		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The exact quote is a bit of a <a href="http://www.amnh.org/learn/pd/sharks_rays/rfl_myth/myth_page5.html" target="_blank">myth</a>. Sharks can detect a blood at levels as low as one part per million. Say you have a two containers of 1m^3 of water (1,000 litres or 220 gallons), and with 20^* drops (1ml) of blood added to one of them -- then shark would be able to tell the difference. </p>
<p>Not the same as being able to detect blood from 2 miles away, but still impressive.</p>
<p>^* edit: turns out a drop is a defined unit. It's defined as 0.05ml (0.01 of a teaspoon).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But they can detect very low concentrations of particles, so it doesn't take much for them to notice it, and then they can locate the source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each drop of blood contains roughly 5 million blood cells.  Depending on the sensitivity of the predator's olfactory senses, only a few would be needed to trigger the &quot;smell&quot; of blood.</p>
<p>Things get even wilder if we consider single molecules contained in the drop of blood.  If we limit ourselves to hemoglobin, then a single blood cell has around 300 million molecules that could theoretically trigger a smell response. </p>
<p>So that drop of blood contains 5 million x 300 million potential triggers.  Written out, that's 1,500,000,000,000,000 molecules.  That's a lot of particles.</p>
<p>Of course, as this drop spreads out, it gets diluted.  The reason that sharks can still sense the presence of blood after several miles is that they are just that sensitive.</p>
<p>And as others have pointed out: this does not happen instantaneously.  In fact, if water were perfectly still, it would take a <em>long</em> <em>long</em> <strong>long</strong> time for the blood to actually reach a shark 2 miles away. (just a quarter mile would take millions of years).</p>
<p>But this is obviously not happening.  The reason is that currents pick up the blood and transport it much further, much faster.</p>
<p>I would also hazard a guess that the currents also prevent the blood from diluting quite as much as you would expect, while also ensuring that only certain directions are good for hunting.  </p>
<p><strong>Edit: Oh my, how we can get carried away.  It's 300 <em>million</em> hemoglobin molecules per cell.  I have changed the numbers appropriately.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key is to realize that for blood in the water to travel two miles does not require that the blood spread out in a 2 mile radius. Simplest example is a wounded seal is swimming along leaving a blood trail, which you can see might persist for a while, and might be two miles long. Another example is something sitting still on the surface (or moving with the wind in a different direction than the water current) and bleeding, with blood being carried along by a current below the surface. This is how a chum line works; the boat stops, and you begin to meter blood and pulverized fish into the water. It is carried in a line away from the boat. The fish you are seeking crosses the line and based on which way the water is moving follows the line to the boat. </p>
<p>TLDR: the line of blood in the water may be miles long, but as a line is not as huge in area as you might think so the blood is less diluted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
