Is there something fundamental about an inverse square law, or is this all just purely coincidental?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the fact that our universe has three spatial dimensions*. When you have a field whose intensity is spread evenly over a surface (e.g. a gravitational field is the same everywhere at a fixed distance from a central mass), and the surface area of a sphere grows with the square of its radius, the field to remain evenly spread out must decrease with the square of distance.</p>
<p>*Trigger warning for string theorists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is due to geometery. In simple terms, all of the things you have mentioned are calculations of intensity (in layman's terms).</p>
<p>As you move away from the source of any of those forces or effects that radiate outwards - the total area of all points that distance away does not increase linearly, but quadratically.</p>
<p>Imagine a ball anda sphere around that ball with all points exactly 1m away (i.e. a 1m radius).</p>
<p>Now imagine a sphere with all points 2m from the ball (radius 2m).</p>
<p>The surface area of the 2nd sphere is not double the first but proportional to the square (4Ï€r^2 to be precise for the surface area - and you are increasing r).</p>
<p>As such, any force or effect in 3 dimensional space, assuming it radiates evenly will decrease in magnitude by the inverse square as you move away from it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drop a stone into a pond.  The energy the stone imparts on the water makes a ripple that travels outward.  As the circular ripple grows in diameter, that energy remains the same, but it's spread out over the circumference of the wave.  The length of the wave grows linearly because the circumference, in this case the length, is pi * diameter.  The energy at any point is just the total energy, divided by the total length, because it's evenly spread out.  So in this case the energy is inverse (not squared).  So 1/distance.</p>
<p>Now extend that concept to three dimensional fields.  Now instead of having a circular ripple travelling outwards, you have a spherical surface travelling outwards.  The sphere has an surface area (i.e. distance squared), instead of just a length.  So it's exactly the same as the stone in the pond, but instead of an ever increase one dimensional length, it's an ever increasing three dimensional bubble.  </p>
<p>It's not that hard when you think about it that way.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These are some great responses. For any photographers out there inverse square law is one of the most important things to understand in relation to lighting. </p>
<p>Pulled from Google, &quot;The law itself, in photography, applies to lighting. It applies to any sort of lighting really but its most relevant application is with off camera lighting. In a nutshell, the inverse-square law teaches us how light works over distance and why the distance between your light source and your subject is so important.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of a video projector projecting solid red rectangle on a white wall.  If you double the distance from projector to wall, the image size doubles along both the X and Y dimension so that the red area quadruples.  However, the amount of light energy is fixed and the image appears dimmer.  How much dimmer?  If you measure the light energy in the original X by Y rectangle, you'll find it's reduced to a fourth the brightness because the other 3 fourths are busy making the rectangle 4x bigger.  Hence the inverse square law.  It's basically due to energy spreading out along a 2D front into 3D space.  If you want to capture all the energy, you need quadruple the surface area each time you double the distance, but if your capture area is fixed, you get 75% less energy each time you double the distance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
