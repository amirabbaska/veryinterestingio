		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Minor quibble, for clarification only: the Fed doesn't produce coinage or currency. The US Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing, respectively, do that. But the Fed is the only entity that can place orders for either, so really, the question is still well-put.</p>
<p>To answer, the Fed estimates the need for new coinage/currency the same way a business estimates the demand for its products: it generates forecasts for <em>this</em> year based on actual figures from <em>previous</em> years. Throw in a few tweaks, here and there, for specific, identifiable events that are likely to throw things off a bit (e.g., the introduction of a new bill, etc.), and Bob's your uncle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Federal Reserve Bank runs a program called FedCash.  They accept sorted currency and fulfill orders.  It's relatively standard supply-chain management.  They know how much was ordered each month in the past, the lead time to get more from the BEP, and how much they have on hand.  While they occasionally make mistakes and run low, it's not normally a problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am going to assume you don't know what you were actually asking (most people don't) and answer the question I think you asked.</p>
<p>How does the Federal Reserve figure out how much Quantitative Easing and other tools to control the interest rate to use each year?</p>
<p>People who criticize the Fed's policies are generally talking about this and pejoratively call it money printing. Also the question now has several ELI5 embedded into it.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is Quantitative Easing? QE is a program where the fed would buy loans from banks in exchange for increasing the amount of reserves the seller had at the Fed (basically let the banks loan more).</li>
<li>What other tools does the Fed have? The main tool is actually buying and selling Federal debt, already purchased by others, in exchange for reserves.</li>
<li>What is the interest rate the Fed controls and why is it important? The Fed controls something called the Fed Funds rate which is important for determining the rate at which banks will loan each other money overnight so they can be legally operated. Banks are required to have at least a certain percentage of their deposits in cash (10%) so these loan make sure they are always above that limit.</li>
<li>How does the Fed know how much of these tools to use? They want to maintain full employment and stable prices (low inflation) they look to see if unemployment is rising too fast or just generally very high. If it is they will lower rates. If inflation is too high they will raise rates to get it under control.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP, can you clarify whether you mean the physical printing/minting of currency or the creation of money itself? They are different things. Currency is not the same as money. The answers you are getting are making an assumption one way or another, but they are not going to flesh out the true answer unless they know what you are asking.</p>
<p>Currency is a method of transferring wealth, money is a method of quantifying it. Some money is currency but not all currency is money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to actual, physical currency - Bills and Coins - whatever member banks of the Federal Reserve ask for, the Fed will essentially give them. In a modern economy, from a broad monetary perspective, physical currency is basically meaningless. The overwhelming majority of the money supply exists purely in electronic form. So when the Fed is &quot;printing money,&quot; really what they're doing is buying assets (usually bonds, but in extreme circumstances other assets) from banks, and giving them electronic currency in exchange.</p>
<p>This buying and selling of bonds is called Open Market Operations, and it's the primary way in which the Fed controls inflation. In order to determine how many bonds to buy (or sell) the Fed targets an interest rate. If the Fed sells a lot of bonds, the supply of bonds will increase, and the price of them will drop. This means that in order for the Federal government to issue new bonds, they have to have a higher return.</p>
<p>By raising the rate of return on new Bonds, the Fed also raises the interest rate on most other savings instruments as well. US treasury bonds are considered to be risk free (or as risk free as an investment can get), so in order to compete with the increased return, other savings and investments need to promise a higher return as well. This slows down consumption (as savings becomes more attractive by comparison), this drives down employment, which then drives down inflation. </p>
<p>So to answer your question, the Fed figures out how much money to &quot;print&quot; each year by looking at unemployment and inflation. It then performs open market operations in order to effect interest rates in order to hit it's unemployment and inflation targets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
