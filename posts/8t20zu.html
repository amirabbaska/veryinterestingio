<li>1) Prions can arise spontaneously (very rare, but over the course of billion years doesn't matter, will happen).</li>
<li>2) Prions are more difficult than regular proteins to denature.</li>
<li>3) If they're in a living system, AFAIK impossible to eradicate without destroying that organism.</li>
<li>4) Can be passed down to progeny.</li>
<li>5) Can be passed via predator/scavenger -&gt; prey relationships, basically any non-sapient ecological consumption/recycling system.</li>
<li>6) Can even be passed via blood exposure/touch, and other non-consumption means (rare).</li>
<li>7) They can lie latent for upwards of 50 years*.</li>
<li>8) Determining a set of organisms has the disease is hard, and the only way to eradicate it is to eliminate all of the carriers (not something a non-intelligent, non-herding species can do?).</li>
<li>9)  1 in 100 trillion chance of spontaneously happening means it happened within the first couple 100 years of multi-cellular life?</li>
</ul>
<p>Given all of that, why didn't a prion spontaneously occur in the past once we had multi-cellular organisms (or sexually reproducing organisms), infect a living system, and become prevalent everywhere?  </p>
<p>I've seen some disease modeling, and given the above constraints, it implies that there must be some mechanism holding back prions' spread.  What would such a mechanism have to look like - mathematically speaking?</p>
<pre><code>. * A large number of British (1 in 2,000) have unexpressed prions currently, due to Mad Cow outbreak</code></pre></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Prions don't have many of the tools that we, as living things, take for granted. Specifically, they can't reproduce on their own and they can't move. They can't even orient themselves. They're just protein chains. </p>
<p>Imagine a bunch of keys and locks floating in water. The keys are totally inert unless they go inside a lock. The keys can't swim, or move, or change which way they are facing. Their only hope of doing something is if the water just so happens to carry them in just the right way that they just so happen to land just right inside a lock. </p>
<p>That's what it's like to be a prion in your body. It's just floating around bumping into stuff without any control over what's happening. Most of the things it bumps into aren't even locks. The poor thing could spend a decade just bumbling around in your foot with nothing to attach to. </p>
<p>If you stir the water long enough, it's going to eventually happen. Eventually a key will land in a lock just the right way. Adding more keys and more locks will make it happen more often, but it'll still take a really long time for it to happen enough to matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The thing is we only notice the ones which are really bad. The limiting factor for such really bad prions is that they kill their host. If the host dies too quickly then the prion would see a decrease in its ability to spread. It's similar to the thin line which most parasites need to tread... Be bad enough to survive off the host but not bad enough to aleffect too adversely the host's chances of survival.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am away from my house and my biology notes, but here's my shitty non-specific pre-morning-coffee explaination. </p>
<p>The human body, as well as other organisms, has enzymes and all sorts of stuff that take care, reshape, or dissolve misfolded protiens (prions). We're not super sure if prions are a result of the protiens actually being &quot;contagious&quot; or somehow the disease is a result of the body's natural defenses in dealing with these misfolded protiens.</p>
<p>It is very contagious when exposed directly to infected remains. Prions are extensively (but not always) located within the central nervous system. Unless you're cracking into the skull or spine, the risk is lowered. It is still there, but lowered. It then depends on the type of exposure. Any sort of direct contact with infected tissue, or by proxy via medical equiptment (I.E. a scalpel used from one surgery without proper sterilazation, very hard to do for prions) is the most garunteed form of infection. Then consumption of infected material (I.E. the whole shebang with how bad eating cattle with mad cow disease) is more likely to happen but less likely to be contagious. The closer the species are genetically the more likely the contamination is. For example, cannibalism of other infected humans, specifically the brains, would be the highest risk for us.</p>
<p>Spontaneous generation of prions is SUPER RARE, like, they've tracked it down to like, a handful of family lines through out the world. Mostly fatal familial insomnia, I know at least a few members of these families are refusing to have children because of the risk.</p>
<p>Tl;dr prions are still not super understood, I'm just an idiot with a hyperfixation on them, they're weird and harder to contract than you'd think.</p>
<p>Edit for clarification:</p>
<p>I honestly thought I was on r/morbidquestions which is a bit more fast and loose with it's tolerance for kinda wonky/not totally precise answers to questions</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because prion's aren't an organism or infectious agent or anything else like that. You seem to be thinking of Prion's overly like they are a virus or bacteria, when realistically they are more accurately described as... manufacturing errors. They can wreak all sorts of havok for sure but the key thing is that they do so <strong>entirely inadvertently</strong> without any function or purpose aimed at such as they have no actual functionality designed to cause their disruptions or spread. That's how people can have latent prions, not because the prions specifically go dormant, but because for a prion to interact with the right cells in the right way to cause a disease is entirely random.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
