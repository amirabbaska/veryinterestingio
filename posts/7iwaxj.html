		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As usual, there is a relevant XKCD...</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/927/" target="_blank">https://xkcd.com/927/</a></p>
<p>Automod appeasement edit:</p>
<p>At one point, there was only one type of screw. I'm no screwolologist, but it seems fair that the straight slot would've been that one type.</p>
<p>Its ups were that it was easy to manufacture and it was easy to make a tool for it, but anybody who's used a straight-head knows it's a terrible, terrible screw head.</p>
<p>So somebody set out to make a better one. I've no idea if I'm right, but I'm gonna guess it was a guy named Phillips. So he said, if one slot was ok, then two slots should be better! But anybody who's used a Phillips screw knows that they come with an appallingly low torque limit before you now have a conical-head screw that's impossible to do anything with.</p>
<p>So somebody said straight heads suck, and phillips heads aren't much better, so I'll make one with some more meat in the tool and straight sides so rounding off and breaking tips wasn't such a concern. Thus, the Allen head was born. Except that allen/hex heads, below a certain size, are even easier to round out than Phillips heads were, and it's fucking impossible to get the hex key in there straight/to full depth in the fastener.</p>
<p>So somebody said, that Allen guy was on the right track, but he didn't go far enough. So the Torx bit got invented.</p>
<p>But then, people said that Torx was too complicated and it's impossible to tell the difference between a T25 and a T27 and oh my god why are there so many choices? So we went back to basics and saw if we couldn't improve on the Phillips design, which beyond its propensity to snap tips and round off fastener heads wasn't a <em>bad</em> design. So we got stuff like JIS, which is virtually identical to Phillips but designed to destroy your phillips bits, and Posidriv, which is the bane of my personal existence because they're designed to never, never strip while tightening (which they don't), but to always always strip immediately when removing (which they do).</p>
<p>So that shit got real complicated and somebody said, guys, guys, you're making this too complicated, eh? What if we took an Allen, which is ok but has too small a load-bearing shoulder and too-great leverage angles, and simplified it, eh? And the Robertson (us Yanks call it a square bit) drive was born. And it was good.</p>
<p>But somebody saw that the construction industry was using a messy hodgepodge of phillips and robertson screws and said, what if we combine them so construction people don't have to buy so many different bits? So now there's a combined R1/#2 phillips bit and screw. I guess that guy never got told about Torx bits, but hey, whatever. So now the construction industry is using an even messier hodgepodge of phillips, robertson, torx, and combi-drive bits.</p>
<p>And then, electronics came along, and at some point electronics manufacturers decided that we lowly consumers couldn't be trusted/were too dumb to open their electronics, so anti-tamper bits had to be made, because everybody had tools to open the bits that were already around, for the most part. So they made those, starting with the Torx bits with the little posts in the middle, but it turns out those are pretty expensive to manufacture so they started making tri-wing screws, and those dove-tail head screws and the two-post screws and etc. etc. etc. because all the same shit that happened in the 10 paragraphs above happened in the anti-tamper-bit world all over again.</p>
<p>Over time each industry sort of settled on certain screw type heads for certain applications, because as there was no &quot;perfect&quot; screw head each type had its strengths and weaknesses, and everybody is firmly entrenched in their own screw head system, and there is <em>very</em> little hope of ever unifying everybody, because there's a lot of money in it now. That doesn't stop people from trying, though - but since they don't understand the market dynamics and why there will never be such a thing as the one true screw head, all they do is just add yet another type to the mix, confusing everybody just that much more.</p>
<p>Edit 2: well now my inbox is screwed, and it seems somebody has put an idea for a new screw head next to my name.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Flathead screwdrivers suck, but they were something you could make with a hammer and anvil and forge. Philips (the real ones) were designed before power drivers with torque control were invented.</p>
<p>There are a zillion modern designs to provide greater torque limits with reduced material (weight/space/size) that view standardization as an accomplice to theft. They are designed to be difficult to unscrew without the exactly correct driver, to deter theft.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some things that determine the type of a screw head:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to Skatingraccoon's answer, many companies develop their own screws or other methods of attachment for their products to make it harder for the consumer to repair the item on their own. A proprietary screw needs a proprietary screwdriver, and if the company that makes the screw doesn't sell the driver, then it means people have to go to the company for repairs, which allows the company to charge them more than it actually costs to fix the product. </p>
<p>Nowadays, smartphones are growing more and more proprietary, and the reason is so that it is more difficult to fix a damaged phone. With some of Apple's earlier iPhones you can see the unique shape of the screw: (<a href="https://goo.gl/images/sTQqgN" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/images/sTQqgN</a>)</p>
<p>Although apple did not create the 5-point screw, when they made the iPhone 4s they recognized that it was a very uncommon fastener, so they have used it to make their iPhones ever since.</p>
<p>As the industry is racing towards thinner phones with larger screens and smaller bezels, some manufacturers have removed external screws altogether. The Google Pixel for example, has no screws on the outside. The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is another phone without visible screws. This is achieved by using an adhesive to fasten the screen to the frame, which saves space, and makes self-repairs much harder than before.</p>
<p>That's just the relation to smartphones though, in construction and industry there are many other applications for unique screws. A little-known fact about screws is that screws with more vertices and angles in the bit design grip the driver better. For example, if you had a screw that had a bit shaped like an octopus, that would give the drill bit 9 points to transfer energy into the screw (8 legs and the head). If you had a screw with a bit shaped like a snowflake, it would be even better. The problem with forcing a lot of vertices into the design of the screw/bit is that it becomes easier to break the screw/bit, and the time/cost of production increases. That's why there are so many kinds of screws, so that consumers can choose the right one based on what they're doing and what their budget is.</p>
<p>Hope this helped!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another angle people are not really covering.  </p>
<p>The world wasn’t always as it is today. Transportation of products was far more difficult and expensive. </p>
<p>Things like screws, bolts, and fasteners are fairly cheap to make. People making more complex items would either make these fasteners themselves, or get them from someone local. </p>
<p>Now expand that idea across the entire world.  </p>
<p>With information and products being shared more everyday, there is less variation. However habit is a strong motivator. If my manufacturing process is working smoothly, why change?</p>
<p>In all honestly is surprising there are not more variations. </p>
<p>On a side note, this expands to many things.  Recently I took a truck driving job.  I found it really odd how many different warehouses, even by the same company, have totally different procedures in the way they do logistics. Unless I’ve been to that exact warehouse before, I have no idea what policy’s and procedures they will have. </p>
<p>What makes things even more complicated is that everyone assumes that things are done the same everywhere, so there’s an assumption I should know what to do.  </p>
<p>You’d think there’s one best way to do things, right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
