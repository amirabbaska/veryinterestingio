		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have spent about a half hour trying to google this, and I always get the same page often titled &quot;How is black body radiation produced?&quot; that keeps on telling me what black body radiation does after it's radiated.</p>
<p>I learned long ago about the basic equations used to describe the phenomenon or how to calculate the spectral lines, and I'm very familiar with how a spectrum with a graph on it looks. None of these answer my question.</p>
<p>So Reddit please save me. <em>HOW</em> is black body radiation actually produced on the quantum level? What mechanism takes place to generate the actual photon and what parts of the atom are involved, what are the specific quantum interactions, and which specific Fermions and Bosons are doing what in what way? What energies are involved?</p>
<p>I realize this will have at least 3 different answers depending on the phase of the material, and that there is quite a bit of cross over with thermal radiation.</p>
<p>Bonus: How do monatomic gases emit black body radiation in rare cases?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For any object above absolute zero temperature, the component particles will have an energy distribution in which at least some of the particles are sitting above their lowest possible energy state (i.e. the Bose-Einstein distribution for bosons, and the Fermi-Dirac distribution for fermions). This means that some particles always have a possibility of transferring to a lower energy state, releasing a photon at a specific wavelength corresponding to the energy transition. At the same rate, other particles are thermally excited into higher energy states maintaining a constant energy distribution if the object is in thermal equilibrium. The resulting spectrum of emitted photons is dependent on the energy distribution which is a function of temperature and gives us <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law" target="_blank">Plank's Law</a> and black body radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a variety of mechanisms both intramolecular and intermolecular (or atomic). For example, the transition of electrons between different energy states in atomic or molecular orbitals. The energy states of different vibrational and rotational motions of molecules (these tend to be in the IR range) as well as the motion of atoms and ions relative to each other (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonon" target="_blank">phonons</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremsstrahlung" target="_blank">Bremsstrahlung emission</a>) are how radiation is emitted.</p>
<p>All of those together create a background set of processes at different energy levels that couple together and result in black body radiation along with thermal equilibrium. Depending on the temperature different mechanisms will dominate (nuclear, electronic, atomic, molecular, etc.) Because there are a lot of different possible energy states, there's enough to fill in the black body spectrum. When you have a huge collection of atoms you have a lot of complicated energy states that basically involve the motion of every atom relative to every other atom, which is why macroscopic objects can have such &quot;smooth&quot; black body spectra.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Maybe you could come up with a toy model, where everything is calculable and see if you can get the black-body spectrum to come out.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
