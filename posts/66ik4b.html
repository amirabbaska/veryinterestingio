<p>edit: thanks for the all the replies, I think I was coming from the idea of what would happen if someone had to be audited or have their taxes looked more closely. Would it affect them at a federal level for working at a dispensarie. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>5 year dispensary manager here. To answer your question, we handle it normally. I filled out a w2, and taxes are taken out of my check every time. I get an income tax check every year like normal.  We have an account with ADP and have to just keep money in our account with them. One time the owner forgot to deposit funds, and ADP was nice enough to pay us anyway. Obviously he made the deposit, but super courteous of them regardless. </p>
<p>Countless times I've had to run to the local grocery store for money orders to pay rent, electricity, ect... since everything is cash based. Our taxes are even paid in cash too. We have had 8 banks close accounts that the owners have opened in their names. Chase was one of them. We had an account with them for years. All of the employees knew us and what we were doing. Then one day out of nowhere they closed our account.  They even marked my boss as using the account in an illegal way, so his personal account with Charles Schwab got closed because they were notified. He had 7 days to find a place for $1.5mil (personal, not dispensary related).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They report that their employer paid them to operate a retail shop.  The IRS wants to know what you got paid, not what the shop sells.  OK, there are some banking issues, so your boss had to pay you in cash.  From the IRS perspective, also not a problem, they want to know how much you got paid, not how it was paid to you.</p>
<p>Of the many legal snarls surrounding pot, employee income taxes isn't one of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>THe IRS uses business activity codes that you would put on your return.  WHile somewhat specific, they don't get so specific as to what items you sell.  FOr instance Marijuana sales could be retail trade: food and beverage stores  among others.  So as long as your business name on the tax return is not something like &quot;Bob's House of  Weed, Edibles and Illegal Activities&quot; you would be good.  The other way they could know is that banks file reporting of interest income to the IRS.  So if your business bank name is incriminatory that would come up.  FOrtunately, or unfortunately there is not much in the way of banking services for this industry.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am probably wrong, but it was explained to me years ago that tax returns are not valid evidence in court. Under the 5th amendment you cannot be compelled to self incriminate but tax code compels you to report income. So if you sell guns illegally, or drugs, you still need to file that as income, possibly just as misc sales but as income. </p>
<p>Mr calpone was finally brought down by the IRS, and I'm sure a tax lawyer can help more than internet people. but still it's an interesting topic</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
