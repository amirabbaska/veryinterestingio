<p>Actually no. All our brain can do is trace the light rays back to their <em>apparent</em> source, it doesn't really matter whether there was a mirror involved. Take a look at <a href="http://www.nightlase.com.au/education/optics/Images/planemi.gif" target="_blank">this diagram</a>. The light gets traced back &quot;through&quot; the mirror to where it appears to be originating from, and that's what creates the image in our brain. If there was no mirror in the way, and instead the real object was placed in the position of the &quot;image&quot; object in the diagram, the light rays on the left hand side would be exactly the same geometrically, and so our brains will see the same thing either way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That would work with a video screen, like on your phone, but not a mirror. With a mirror, you aren't focusing the lenses of your eye on the mirror's surface. If you did, it would be the dust and finger prints on the mirror itself that would be in focus. Instead, you're focusing on the object, that really is that far away: the light is traveling the same distance, it's just reflected.</p>
<p>With the camera screen, the camera has a lens that is focusing on the object the way your eye would, and creating the image on the screen, so you focus on the screen, not the object.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can prove that the mirror is not a 2d Image by moving your head to the left or right. The image changes. Similarly if you close your left eye or right eye you will see different images (and be able to perceive 3D) as a result.</p>
<p>This is because the rays are reflected at same angle it came in at. As such you still need to focus for the total distance traveled by the rays (Distance from your eyes to the mirror + distance from the mirror to the object)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A mirror does not act as a 2D image. A sort of analogy is that mirrors &quot;flip&quot; space along the axis pointing into the mirror. Up, down, left, and right stay the same, but +X becomes -X. It's like a window that flips stuff. Windows don't act like 2D images, why should a mirror? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The important thing to consider is that any corrective lens is making sure that light hits a certain spot consistently on your retina. Your entire field of vision had light coming in, forming something of a funnel shape. Ideally, that funnel has it's point on the back of your eye ball called the fovea. If light isn't focused on that, you can't get enough information for small details. If you get something closer though in your visual field, the natural mechanisms in your eye may be strong enough to adjust something into focus. </p>
<p>A mirror won't help you because the light source is still too far away for your eyes to get that fine focus. It's blurry because the angle difference between those different light sources are incredibly small and without a lense to focus them, just blend together as one general stimulus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
