		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(I know there's a Kepler 452b mega-thread, but this isn't specifically about Kepler 452b, this is about SETI and the search for life, and using Kepler 452b as an intro to the question.)</p>
<p>People (including me) have asked, if Kepler 452b had Earth-equivalent technology, and were transmitting television and radio and whatever else, would we be able to detect it. Most answers I've seen dodged the question by pointing out that Kepler 452b is 1600 light years away, so if they were equal to us now, then, we wouldn't get anything because their transmissions wouldn't arrive here until 1600 years from now.</p>
<p>Which is missing the point. The real question is, if they had <em>at least</em> our technology from roughly 1600 years ago, and we pointed out absolute best receivers at it, could we <em>then</em> &quot;hear&quot; anything?</p>
<p>Someone seemed to have answered this in a roundabout way by saying that the New Horizons is barely out of our solar system and we can hardly hear it, and it's designed to transmit to us, so, no, we probably couldn't receive any incidental transmissions from somewhere 1600 light years away.</p>
<p>So, if that's true, then what is the deal with SETI? Does it assume there are civilizations out there doing stuff on a huge scale, way, way bigger than us that we could recieve it from thousands of light years away? Is it assuming that they are transmitting something directly at us?</p>
<p>What is SETI doing if it's near impossible for us to overhear anything from planets like ours that we know about?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thank you everyone for the thought provoking responses. I'm sorry it's a little hard to respond to all of them.</p>
<p>Where I am now after considering all the replies, is that /u/rwired (currently most upvoted response) pointed out that SETI can detect signals from transmission-capable planets up to 1000ly away. This means that it's not the case that SETI can't confirm life on planets that Kepler finds, it's just that Kepler has a bigger range.</p>
<p>I also understand, as another poster mentioned, that Kepler wasn't necessarily meant to find life supporting planets, just to find planets, and finding life supporting planets is just a bonus.</p>
<p>Still... it seems to me that, unless there's a technical limitation I don't yet get, that it would have been the best of all possible results for Kepler to first look for planets within SETI range before moving beyond. That way, we could have SETI perform a much more targeted search.</p>
<p>Is there no way SETI and Kepler can join forces, in a sense?</p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER EDIT:</strong> It seems this post made top page? And yet my karma doesn't change at all. I don't understand Reddit karma. <strong>AND YET MORE EDITING:</strong> Thanks to all who explained the karma issue. I was vaguely aware that &quot;self posts&quot; don't get karma, but did not understand why. Now it has been explained to me that self posts don't earn karma so as to prevent &quot;circle jerking&quot;. If I'm being honest, I'm still a little bummed that there's absolutely no Reddit credibility earned from a post that generates this much discussion (only because there are one or two places I'd like to post that require karma), but, at least I can see there's a rationale for the current system.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SETI claims to be able to detect roughly earth-like signals up to a distance of about 1000ly (<a href="http://www.setileague.org/askdr/howfar.htm" target="_blank">here</a>). Of course the actual distance depends on the power of the transmitted signal, and for sure when it arrives at earth it will be very weak compared to other naturally occurring radio sources in the universe, which is one of the reasons the SETI project is hard. </p>
<p>There are 511 stars within 100ly, ~280,000 within 500ly, and &gt;2Mil within 1000ly, so there's still a lot of work for SETI to do. All-sky surveys have difficulty detecting weaker signals, but targeted surveys of millions of star systems takes <em>lots</em> of telescope time.</p>
<p>The nearby stars are the low hanging fruit. It would be idiotic of us to not check them for the obvious signs of intelligent life first, even if it turns up nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The point of SETI has never been to look for accidentally broadcast signals, the point has always been to primarily look for intentional signals. Those signals would be very much stronger than ordinary leakage, and potentially detectable from enormous (galactic-sized) distances. Given the comparative low cost of SETI and the enormous impact of a successful detection the cost/benefit probably makes it worthwhile.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's worth realizing what the Kepler mission was about. The idea wasn't to find a single possible Earth that we could do much with, but rather to look at a large number of stars, find a large number of planets, and from that figure out what the planet probabilities are, down to earth-sized planets. To do so, it looked at 150,000 stars and has found a few thousand planets (I ~think~ last number I saw was around 4000).</p>
<p>If we wanted to focus on a single planet, those wouldn't be the ones to focus on. We'd want something closer and easier to study. That's the goal of TESS, a new mission whose goal is to find earth-sized planets around relatively bright (and relatively close) stars so that follow-up observations are much more likely.</p>
<p>The other point to keep in mind is that New Horizons is pretty limited for power. Terrestrial signals, like radio waves from powerful broadcasters on earth, can travel further with great strength. New Horizons is, in total, 228 watts. Radio stations broadcast with thousands to tens of thousands of watts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the frustration about SETI is that there's just so much we don't know. And it's true, if we were just receiving the background noise from a level of technology close to our own right now, we wouldn't be able to detect it unless it were coming from the very closest stars. But there are several possibilities that would allow for the receipt of a signal through SETI:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ETI could be aware of habitable planets in our galaxy, much as we are now starting to discover them, and direct signals in the direction of those planets. Earth could be one of those planets.</li>
<li>If there are any ETIs in our galaxy, the odds are very strong that they are much older than our own civilization. It is possible that an older civilization would have ways of harnessing much greater energy than what we have, which would make broadcasting a wide signal with enough power to be detected at great distances much more feasible for them than for us.</li>
<li>We could just be lucky, or intelligence in the universe is common, and there could be a civilization much closer to us than 1400 light-years. <a href="http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/questions/question/1575/" target="_blank">One astronomer estimates</a> that there are 3000-5000 stars within about 100 light-years of us. We're still nailing down how likely it is for a star to have a habitable planet, but what we've found so far indicates that planets in habitable zones could be <a href="http://www.space.com/24894-exoplanets-habitable-zone-red-dwarfs.html" target="_blank">quite common indeed</a>. What's far more difficult to answer is how many of those planets will have life, and how many of the life-bearing planets will have intelligent, technological life. Which is not to say that they are common or uncommon; we just don't know. If one out of every million habitable planets have life, and one out of every million life-bearing planets have technological civilizations, then looking at nearby stars for incidental signals would be fruitless. But if one out of every 10 habitable planets have life, and one out of every 10 of those have technological civilizations, that leaves dozens of potential &quot;hits&quot; in our own backyard. </li>

<p>It's  assumed  that there may  very well be,  and  if  so then  we might be able  to detect them. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>No.  Just that we'd  be  able to detect the  large  amounts of  energy that they'd  be  producing,  even  though  it's  <em>not</em>  transmitted directly at us. </p>
