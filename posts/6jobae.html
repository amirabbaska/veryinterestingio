		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, there is a difference between alcoholism and heavy drinking.  Alcoholism is a psychological dependency on alcohol, where the individual cannot or will not stop drinking despite whatever bad effects it is having on his life, health, job, and family.  Alcoholism and heavy drinking typically go hand in hand, in that most alcoholics are heavy drinkers, but not all heavy drinkers are alcoholics.  In my medical practice I have encountered plenty of people who drank a lot, but as soon as they were told that it was harming their health they just stopped.  Many of us have known (or in some cases been) the heavy college partier who consumed completely unhealthy amounts while in school but gave it up as soon as they hit the &quot;real world&quot;.  There is at least some genetic component to becoming alcoholic.</p>
<p>The average adult can handle about two drinks per day/14 per week without any major long term problem.  Any more than that, and there is increasing risk of liver damage.  The liver is a remarkable organ with a high capacity to regenerate itself.  Most people who shows sings of alcoholic liver damage are able to reverse it if they quit drinking.</p>
<p>The healing potential of the liver does have a breaking point however, and severe long term damage may be permanent, usually called cirrhosis of the liver.  Enough liver damage can ultimately be fatal.</p>
<p>Note that the above is for the average person.  Some people can consume more without a problem.  Some (including some particular ethnic groups) will do damage with less.  A blood test can usually spot early signs of liver damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three to five drinks a week would likely do nothing unless you have a preexisting condition, or are predisposed to liver cancer or cirrhosis. Heavy drinking will damage the liver over time. The liver can regenerate, so it is a pretty slow process, but over time, more and more of the liver will basically die, until that persons liver fails completely, at which point they have to be hooked up to a machine until they can get a new one, or die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll explain this from a simple physiology perspective of the liver.</p>
<p>With a few drinks a week, your liver successfully detoxifies your body because it makes extra metabolizing (detoxifying) enzymes to compensate for the alcohol. Because you have additional enzymes, you actually have a higher metabolism than you otherwise would, benefiting your health. This is of course assuming that your liver AND body has everything under control and completely balanced. If you binge drink or consume too many calories from alcohol, your liver/body will not be able to keep up and you'll get things like beer bellies.</p>
<p>Also because your liver is technically in 'overdrive' as a casual drinker, you might gain weight if you stop drinking because those additional enzymes are no long produced. This is the same reason (one of the reasons) why people trying to quit smoking often gain weight (the other being food tastes better.)</p>
<p>As for heavy drinking, the liver's enzymes cannot keep up and will be damaged in the long run. The reason is that alcohol (ethanol) metabolizes into acetaldehyde, which is toxic is large quantities. The liver can recover for the most part however after if you give it rest.</p>
<p>Like most have mentioned, alcoholism is a psychological issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recovering alcoholic here.  Alcoholism is a disease so how much or how often you drink is certainly going to impact your health but not the entire story of whether you are an alcoholic.<br />
Alcohol is essentially a poison, albeit one that will only kill you with a pretty large dose.  It is pretty darn difficult to drink enough to kill you without your body rejecting the booze in some way.  The damage done though is pretty significant.  Obesity, and the associated issues with that such as heart disease, and liver damage are probably the two most obvious.  The mental heath ramifications will be all over the place.  I self medicated to overcome social anxiety and it worked for a bit but because of my alcoholism eventually turned on me.  Some people get aggressive, others lose inhibitions to the point of engaging in risky behavior, while others will never have any issue and might even a better life because of alcohol.  It is a roll of the dice.
I would say the real kicker is that an alcoholic really struggle to maintain as your proposed casual drinker.  Hard to really say as many people stay casual for years until some event changes their usage pattern or triggers something.  You would also want to look at family history since genetics appear to play a key role.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we're interested in the long-term effects on the brain, it entirely matters what the pattern of drinking is. 5 drinks in one night, by most criteria, would be classified as an extreme pattern of binge drinking. Binge drinking has been shown to be the most damaging pattern of drinking to the brain. Having one drink five days a week would be classifiable as moderate drinking, which has been shown by many studies to confer health benefits both to the brain and the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>It's intuitive that overall volume and duration of drinking would correlate best with the extent of injury to the brain. However, this proposition was tested and it turned out that when alcoholics were studied, <strong>how long</strong> <em>they had been alcoholics correlated relatively poorly with the extent of alcohol-related brain injury</em>. <em>The factor that best correlated with alcohol-related brain injury was</em> <strong>how many alcohol withdrawals were had</strong>. </p>
<p>This is because alcohol withdrawal induces state of toxicity to which the brain is very sensitive. This toxic state is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitotoxicity" target="_blank">excitotoxicity</a> and it's a result of how the brain compensates for the inhibitory effects of alcohol.</p>
<p>Alcohol makes neurons less likely to fire an impulse to neighboring neurons. This is inhibition. The brain responds  by modifying neurons so that they are more likely to fire. This is excitation. The brain also responds to the presence of alcohol by increasing the levels of the main brain chemical (neurotransmitter) which tells neurons to fire, glutamate (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_(neurotransmitter" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_(neurotransmitter</a>)). </p>
<p>When the alcohol-adapted brain becomes unexposed to alcohol, neurons become too excitable. Neurons are extremely sensitive to excitotoxicity caused by excessive glutamate and, interestingly, this is the underlying mechanisms behind most types of brain injury. This excitotoxicity is why alcohol withdrawal can be fatal.</p>
<p>Although some recent evidence suggests otherwise, one theory behind the cognitive impairment associated with binge drinking is that it induces a state of acute alcohol tolerance.</p>
<p>TLDR; It entirely depends what the pattern is. 5 drinks a week is probably bad for you brain, one drink five days a week might be good for you brain and cardiovascular system. Alcoholism injures the brain in great part be inducing a state of tolerance where the brain can no longer handle the absence of alcohol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
