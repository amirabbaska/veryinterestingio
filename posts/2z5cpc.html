<p>EDIT: Thank you for all the information! I realize now how vague life expectancy is...The article I read was clearly skewing statistics in favor of their agenda. Although, the whole idea of hospitals in the U.S. Individually supplying themselves with equipment versus the country mass buying equipment seemed pretty significant as far as what could cause U.S. Healthcare to be so much more expensive. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We're great at arguing about paying for healthcare; we're just terrible at reducing the costs. Our healthcare costs are huge for many reasons, which relate to each other and other factors in a very complex way. We have a poor level of preventative care, often the only options available to those least able to pay are the most expensive options (like waiting for a problem to get terrible and use an emergency room instead of using much cheaper preventative methods), we allow hospitals to MASSIVELY overcharge for many products and services, etc. I highly recommend this video: www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSjGouBmo0M</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that in countries like Canada where it's $3500 per head or so, that includes covering everybody. The United States spends $8000+ and fails to cover tens of millions of people. Additionally, in the US over one million people a year file bankruptcy due to medical bills. It would be challenging to find a single part of the system that is efficient or effective when compared to systems in other similarly wealthy countries.</p>
<p>So, here are the specific reasons for the difference:</p>
<ul>
<li>America is the only industrialized nation of any size without a single payer health care system</li>
<li>Adding the dead weight of management, duplication of resources, and marketing for an inelastic need does not make it less expensive</li>
<li>Allowing companies to market expensive drugs and treatments directly to consumers creates false demand</li>
<li>The FDA is an underfunded joke and the market is full of ineffective and dangerous products</li>
<li>Since America is run by a government fully corrupted by industry, there is no incentive to stop some of the more ridiculous examples of market inefficiencies or straight fraud. (see above)</li>
</ul>
<p>The net effect of the policy is what you would expect when the point is to create profits instead of efficiently care for the health of a population. As just one example, any one of us means nothing to pharmaceutical companies. In the stats the sales staff are provided, they get good marks for starting prescriptions and bad marks when prescriptions stop, even if the reason the prescription has stopped is that the consumer is cured of their condition. If you died, your prescription stops and this is just one more bad mark on a weekly summary that cannot tell the difference between an effective drug and a dead consumer. This failure was still a success in the eyes of the health care industry: a profit was made, and a consumer consumed, and even if they died as a result, the penalty of a successful lawsuit will be less than the aggregate profit.</p>
<p>Carry this mentality to the top of corporations making billions and you'll understand why they are still trying to squeeze profits out of people dying in the third world. Doing something like Jonas Salk did and curing horrible diseases for as little as possible -- sort of what one would expect at the center of a sane health care policy -- is a bad business model in a for-profit healthcare world.</p>
<p>Now gently mix this greed with millions of dollars in campaign contributions from companies who spend their time buying members of the government, and presto: the United States health care system. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>
<p>Lack of negotiating power.</p>
<p>In countries with universal tax-funded healthcare, the government is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopsony" target="_blank">monpsony</a> (the buyer equivalent of a monopoly). This gives them tremendous negotiating power. No entity in the USA has that negotiating power. The buyer side of the market is fragmented into hundreds of insurance companies, government programs, and charity organizations as well as thousands of individual cash patients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billing costs.</p>
<p>In most countries with modern healthcare systems, it's relatively simple for doctors to get paid for their services. There's one standardized system that processes all of their claims. Reimbursements may be lower, but they're virtually guaranteed. A physician with a small rural private practice might do his or her own billing; large clinics might only need a couple of staff members to handle all the administrative work including billing. On the payment end, the system is mostly automated, with only a relative few people checking on suspicious billing patterns and handling disputes.</p>
<p>In the USA, it's ridiculously difficult. Every insurance company or government program has different rules for filing claims and different rates of reimbursement. A small paperwork error might lead to a denial. Uninsured patients and those whose insurance refuses to pay require direct collection efforts. Doctors generally have to contract out to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_billing" target="_blank">medical billing</a> services; there's a whole enormously-profitable medical billing industry here with its own <a href="http://www.hbma.org/news/public-news/n_the-medical-billing-industry-is-changing-are-you" target="_blank">lobbying organizations</a>. This adds cost on the provider end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurance company profits and overhead.</p>
<p>Americans have a charmingly naive faith in the power of markets. They believe that no matter what the problem, the private sector can come up with a solution that costs less and works better than anything the government can do while collecting a tidy profit in the process.</p>
<p>Now, this works well for things like, say, making cars. Nobody wants government in the automobile business (ask people in eastern Germany about the Trabi). Government is a decent incubator for certain types of innovation, but for consumer products, the profit motive helps shape a design that people will actually like.</p>
<p>It does not, however, work well for the service of &quot;sending money to doctors for services performed.&quot; There's really not much innovation to be done there beyond the basic &quot;automate it&quot; and &quot;audit for fraud.&quot; The US government is really good at automated money-sending and at auditing - those are two of its top skills - so it's extremely unrealistic to expect the private sector to improve on them. <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/news/2013/february/setting-the-record-straight-on-medicare%E2%80%99s-overhead-costs" target="_blank">And it doesn't.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perverse incentives.</p>
<p>Each payer in the American health insurance industry is motivated to reduce its own costs - <em>not</em> the overall cost of the system. Now, in most markets, those are effectively the same thing: if every payer tries to reduce their own costs, the overall costs will come down. But in health care it's often the opposite. For both patients and insurance companies, the motivation to reduce costs translates to a perverse incentive to avoid or delay care until you can foist the cost off on someone else. Delayed care increases the cost of the system.</p>
<p>Providers have very little investment in cost-effectiveness; they are primarily motivated to increase their own net revenue. This means pushing unnecessary but profitable procedures on patients who can pay, doing unnecessary tests to avoid lawsuits, and avoiding caring for patients who may not be able to pay. All of these increase costs as well.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are the big four. There are other related issues - malpractice lawsuits, overreliance on specialists, low reimbursement rates for preventive care, and futile and inhumane end-of-life interventions, and non-compliance with doctors' instructions due to the cost of drugs and supplies.</p>
<p>Now, it should be made clear that American healthcare is very, very good for people who can access it. The problems are (a) lots of people can't access care in a timely fashion and (b) it costs far more than it needs to, partly because of (a).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because we're the only industrialized nation that doesn't have any price controls on our healthcare. We're treating an inelastic market as an elastic market and it allows hospitals and pharmaceutical companies to charge insane amounts for treatments because your option is often &quot;get this treatment or die.&quot; This is made even worse by the fact that doctors and hospitals don't have to be transparent with how much their services cost (or even what services they will charge you for) keeping what little competition their could be from actually happening. This is even further exacerbated by the fact that insurance companies no longer have any real incentive to keep prices down because everyone now has to have health insurance and insurance companies can only make a fixed percentage as profit. This could be fixed with a single payer system or even a public option for health insurance but a certain political party will stop at nothing to keep that from happening, and that's how we end up getting charged $800 for a bag of salt water that costs about $8 to administer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The life expectancy argument is a red herring. In fact the US has one of the best overall &quot;outcomes&quot; for medical care delivered in the world, if not the best overall. The US certainly has issues with access but the overall quality of care is superb. </p>
<p>When you factor out things like violence and accidents the American life expectancy actually normalizes and surpasses all other countries.</p>
