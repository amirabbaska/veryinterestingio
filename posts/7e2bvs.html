		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Editing DNA with CRISPR is absolutely possible. But it kinda depends on what he means by &quot;modifying his DNA.&quot; Sure, you can change it in a test tube, or even in a living cell. But changing the DNA in every cell in the human body is still an impossibly tall order.</p>
<p>That day will come. But we're years, if not decades, away from it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Might it be possible to use CRISPR to modify human muscles to downregulate myostatin and thus increase muscle mass? Yes. All of the individual steps in the chain seem to be possible. Myostatin double mutants have high muscle mass, CRISPR can be used to modify adult somatic cells with an adenoviral vector. There's a therapy which has been recently approved which involves using an adenoviral vector to transfect retinal cells and correct a double recessive mutation. The eyes are immune privileged however, and adenovirus tends to be recognized by the immune system. </p>
<p>Will it work? That's a question you won't know until it's been tried in a controlled way. What this guy is doing-- injecting himself on stage at a conference seems more like a publicity stunt than a controlled trial. </p>
<p>There are a lot of questions you need to know answers too before you could do this reliably. Dose, safety, efficacy, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>He probably affected a few genes in a minority of cells in a local area. I personally find it pretty cool, but the practical application (in humans) of this tech, at the moment, is in stem/zygote cells so that your introduced modification is then spread through regular replication. I've personally been part of using it to modify bacteria and make them much more efficient in producing a certain compound that my company sells. It's amazing and can save humanity tons of resources via efficiency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not real at all. It's like saying I'm going to dig a hole to China in my backyard using a shovel. </p>
<p>Does CRISPR be used to edit DNA? Yes. Do shovels dig holes? Yes. Can I just inject CRISPR into my blood to deliver gene therapy or dig a hole to China with just a shovel? Absolutely not. It's ridiculous.</p>
<p>There are so many labs working on gene therapy delivery. You just can't deliver DNA to all the cells in your body by injecting DNA into your blood. We would have so many cures today if it was that easy. Your cells need a way to get the DNA to penetrate their membrane. They also need to integrate the DNA or express the gene on the DNA.</p>
<p>What are real scientists doing to learn how to deliver gene therapy to cells in vivo? Viral DNA delivery or gold nanoparticles to name just a couple. This guy is a fraud.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Buzzfeed as a trustworthy news source aside, modifying DNA with CRISPR works in small scale. This persons vision of performing this augmentation on a widely public scale is far fetched. CRISPR is touted as some miraculous cellular laser. Choose a strand and poof, swap it out! While it is useful, and effective, CRISPR can and has made errors, and Im willing to bet, we don't yet have significant data to represent its effectiveness in delivering permanent changes. The possibility of this biotechnology becoming as ubiquitous as an over the counter antacid is out of touch. And, whats to say that combining multiple designer strands of DNA doesn't produce unexpected results? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
