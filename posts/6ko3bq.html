		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where I live, health inspection is something of a racket.  Some restaurants never get inspected, and some get some kind of warning before the inspectors are coming, and some get inspected often.  The ones that have several inspections a year are the restaurants that are doing well and the owners clearly have money.  They get failed for something stupid (at my restaurant they like to fail us for leaving dry rags in the kitchen. Clean rags for cleaning.  They need to be in a bucket of water to pass health inspection.) then they pay a fine, and get inspected again a couple days later.  Thus the health department makes money from the fines, and the restaurants get unlimited &quot;second chances&quot; to stay open. If they closed them down they wouldn't make money from the multiple inspections and fines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in a medium-small sized city in Ohio, and here health inspections are surprisingly rigorous. Restaurants and businesses are not given notice, and the results are published in the newspaper so if they violate health standards, they are warned to fix it and put in the newspaper. If they do not fix it, they are fined or shut down for repeated offenses. I think the fact that I live in a community where most people know most people, it really helps to be published in the newspaper because the ramifications of failing health inspections is huge when everybody knows you are running that particular joint. I'm sure it varies by state/city/county as well. In Florida I worked in a nutrition store and was inspected rigorously as well, and given no heads up, but not to the extent as here in Ohio. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is television of course, so I'm sure things are made to look a certain way for effect, however this is in fact a pretty common occurrence across the country. </p>
<p>Many health departments lack resources to manage potentially hundreds of establishments in their jurisdiction. Others are completely incompetent, some are on the take, some are friends with certain owners and give a long heads up before inspection. </p>
<p>It's a combination of things, but food can rot fast and sludge and grossness builds up fast in restaurants, so even a couple months of neglect since the last inspection can be a horrific scene, some places go a year or more without ever seeing an inspector. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think health inspections can be jokes at times. For example our local guy gave all the food trucks in town the go ahead even though it's clear they are dirty and unsafe. My wife worked at a small diner at the time and asked him about the food trucks and he said &quot;if you're dumb enough to eat tacos out of one of those trucks you deserve to get sick.&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
