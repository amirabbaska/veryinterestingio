		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am a molecular biochemist. Was a spider-butt scientist for years. Materials scientists and engineers please feel free to correct me.</p>
<p>Spider silks, like silk worm silk, are made of mostly protein. Spiders can produce many different kinds of silk proteins, which are mixed and matched into different kinds of silk that they use for different purposes, such as egg sacs to protect their eggs (tubularform silk), prey capture (acinoform silk), web capture spiral (flaggeliform silk), and structural silk (dragline/major ampullate silk). Due to the specialized mixture of protein in each of these types of silks, they display very unique properties.</p>
<p>The most well known/studied silk type is the dragline silk, which is used by the spider for many purposes, such as the structural struts of their web (not the spiral on the web) and the silk they put down when they walk around in case they fall, hence the term &quot;dragline&quot; (sometimes also called lifeline silk).</p>
<p>Dragline silk is for the most part composed of two kinds of proteins, MaSp1 (major ampullate spidroin 1) and MaSp2. The specific ratio of these two proteins vary widely from species to species, and even within an individual based on health/diet. As mentioned earlier, the different proteins contribute to the overall silk's properties.</p>
<p>At this time, there is something that needs to be clarified. The term &quot;strength&quot; is often just used as an umbrella term. The term &quot;strength&quot; technically refers to the amount of force required before the material &quot;fails&quot;, or breaks. The term &quot;extensibility&quot; <del>or &quot;yield&quot;</del> or &quot;strain&quot; refers to the material's ability to stretch before failing. If you plot these two properties on a graph, the area under the curve is the &quot;toughness&quot;, which roughly equates the amount of energy the material can overall dissipate before failing.</p>
<p>A &quot;strong but stiff&quot; material is something like kevlar. It can withstand a lot of force before it breaks, but it doesn't stretch very well. A &quot;weak but stretchy&quot; material would be something like rubber, which is the opposite. However, if you look at the toughness of these materials, they cannot absorb much energy before breaking relative to a material that is both &quot;strong and extensible&quot;. The unfortunate thing here is that most materials, due to our understanding, cannot be both strong and extensible. Spider (dragline) silk is unique in that it has a relatively high strength (still much weaker than kevlar), and relatively high extensibility (but not as stretchy as say a rubber band). This results in a much higher overall toughness that is rarely observed.</p>
<p>Back to your original question. Spider silk is mostly protein. These proteins self-assemble (with help from the spider) into fibers. On a molecular scale, these proteins assemble into two types of structures: unstructured &quot;amorphous&quot; domains and structured &quot;crystalline&quot; domains. The amorphous domains - imagine very tangled strands of headphone wires. If you pull on it, the overall fiber stretches to a certain point. This is thought to contribute to the extensibility of the fiber. The crystalline domains - imagine layers of double sided velcro. It is very hard to pull out a single layer of velcro from this stack. These highly structured domains are thought to contribute to the strength of the overall fiber. It is the finely tuned interplay of these domains that result in the unique balance of strength and extensibility - resulting in high toughness.</p>
<p>It is very hard to reproduce these material properties synthetically. We have gotten very good at engineering the extremes. Very molecularly structured materials end up very strong, but stiff (think kevlar or carbon fiber). This is due to high &quot;bond density&quot; - there are a lot of molecular forces packed together holding the molecules together. These bonds are so well organized that when it fails, all the bonds let go at the same time. Very molecularly unstructured materials are stretchy but weak. This is because there are less bonds per volume  (or weaker bonds) that hold the material together, but these materials tend to be able to rearrange their bonds as the material is stressed, thus not instantly failing when deformed.</p>
<p>We are actually able to make many materials that are pretty strong, and also pretty stretchy. Plastics are a great example of this. However, we are just not able to control the molecular organization of plastics to get both high strength and extensibility. edit: As /u/PhaedrusBE points out, steel is a great comparison as well.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> - Spider silks are made of proteins which assemble into domains that contribute strength and extensibility. It is the unique ratio of these two properties that grant spider silk it's high &quot;toughness&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: ELI5?</strong> -  Spider silks are made of long entangled strings. Some parts of the strings are stiff and strong, some parts of the strings are stretchy. The combination of the two properties allow the silks to absorb a lot of energy and not break easily when you pull on them.</p>
<p>PS. The next time you meet a shady merchant, you should never buy spider silk armor. That stuff ain't gonna protect you much even if it doesn't break if it deforms up to 30% into your body. Buy kevlar if you can't afford mithril.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seamstress here: From a fabric standpoint, natural fabrics are made of almost exclusively spun fibers. The act of spinning gathers up small bits of fiber, and the longer the fiber bit (or staple), the stronger it is. However, since they're small bits of entwined fiber, there are natural weaknesses, especially compared to a protein fiber like silk. Wool is a protein fiber, but again, it's made up of small strands of wool, rather than a continuous strand of considerable length. While spider silk specifically is almost ridiculously difficult to make fabric out of, it's not because of its strength; rather it's because of scarcity. It's easier and more commercially viable to raise and farm silkworms than it is spiders who produce enough silk. It has been done, most famously in recent memory with over a million female Golden Orb Spiders. The fabric produced is naturally golden in color, and is breathtakingly lovely. There have also been historical pieces of fabric recovered and studied made of spider silk, but again, the scarcity and complexity make them almost priceless.</p>
<p>Commercially available silk is made by farming silkworms of a specific genus (Bombyx mori), and feeding them a diet that is almost exclusively comprised of the white mulberry. Their diet produces fine, strong silk, though they can eat other types of plants. The traditional method is to allow the caterpillars to spin a cocoon, and then pluck them, boil them, and unspool the silk from the dead caterpillar. This silk reaches the highest prices since it's in fantastic shape. The silk can be over a mile long of unbroken protein strand. If the caterpillar is allowed to emerge as a moth, it releases a chemical that allows it to burrow through the cocoon, which damages the unbroken fibers. That silk is used for stuffing, poorer-quality fabrics, etc.</p>
<p>Commercially available silk in fabric comes in a lot of varieties, but the kind with noticeable lines and tufts is called dupioni. It's made up of &quot;raw&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; silk. That basically means it's the crappy silk from old, damaged, wild, or leftover silk after the process to spool off the fine, unbroken silk from the cocoons. The fine, almost completely flat shiny silk is typically called crepe or taffeta (though taffeta is a specific type of woven silk that color shifts because of the dye job). It's made up of the finest, most unbroken strands of silk that have been twined into long, strong, thin yarns. Since there's almost no break of the silk staple, there's an incredible amount of strength it can withstand. Combined with 3 or more other strands into a multi-ply yarn to be woven with other like yarns, you get a pretty strong piece of fabric that can withstand snagging, cuts, etc. Silk thread for sewing is made up of a combination of the poorer, shorter strands, and some of the longer that might have broken in processing. It's spun much the same as a traditional yarn, which adds strength.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Read Mechsheep's full post on the details, but essentially spider silk, while not as strong as some materials, nor as flexible as some materials, is impressive in its combination of being strong and flexible.</p>
<p>Consider how strong glass is, for instance, but it's incredibly brittle and won't strain much before fracturing.  Rubber bands likewise are incredibly stretchy, but can't handle much stress before snapping.  Something that both requires a lot of energy to stretch, <em>and</em> can stretch a significant amount before yielding, is labeled as 'tough'.</p>
<p>So then the question comes to: <em>&quot;Why is Spider-Silk given so much praise?  How can it be considered tough when compared against the materials born from modern science?  If it's better, then why can a spider's butt still outperform us?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Spider-silk is a biological protein.  Protein structures can have a lot of desirable properties difficult, or even impossible for us to currently replicate in synthetic products.</p>
<p>The reason is that proteins have very specific molecular structures.  We're talking about refined structure on the molecular level.  For us to produce this sort of thing, we need to rely on spontaneous assembly of one form or another.  While the sophistication is great, it basically boils down to throwing all of the ingredients in a blender under good conditions, and hoping they all combine in the patterns we want them to.</p>
<p>When this happens, we'll get <em>some</em> proteins that are perfect, and a lot of proteins that are close to perfect, and a lot more that are really imperfect.  And the more imperfections there are, the more compromised the desired properties can be.  </p>
<p>So if we tried to replicate spider silk in a test tube and get all the proteins to bond together into a string, it might have some good properties, but it likely wouldn't hold a candle to the real thing.  Why's this? Because the string is made of both perfect and imperfect proteins; proteins of  non-uniform quality.  And a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.</p>
<p>Unlike our synthesizing methods that rely in one form or another on spontaneous organization, however, the <em>real</em> proteins are <em>built</em> piece by piece more or less perfectly by cells.  Cells are little molecular factories, and the variance on the bell-curve when producing proteins is incredibly narrow, if not non-existent.</p>
<p>Material science over the last few hundred years has culminated in wondrous things like Stainless Steel, tungsten-carbide, or anodized aluminum. Impressive materials whose properties for strength, hardness, corrosion resistance, magnetism, etc we can tune by adjusting the balance of alloying metals contained within, or by changing the smelting temperature or cooling rate, or by giving it a surface coating.  Incredibly impressive, but still dealing with largely bulk properties and surface properties, and leaving the molecular structure to general manipulation on the macro level.  The manufacturing is different, but the gist remains pretty much the same for dealing with things like plastics and ceramics.  Bulk and surface properties by material composition, surface treatment, and macro-manipulation.</p>
<p>With the electronics and tools developed over the last few decades, <em>modern</em> material science - nano-materials, meta-materials, etc - is concerning itself more and more with designing and manipulating the <em>exact</em> molecular structure of materials.  The molecular organization of carbon alone gives us everything from graphite to diamond - and now carbon nanotubes and graphene.  </p>
<p>What we're just starting to do, biology has been doing all along.  So it shouldn't be surprising that some biological materials will still command unique properties beyond our current capabilities, because they build their materials [perfectly] from the ground up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A simple answer is it is just a set of compounds woven together tightly into proteins. These compounds are generated biologically rather than in a factory. They are mostly composed of Alanine and Glycine which are major amino acids. This is called Fibron. Creating this on a large scale would be major expensive and not practical. Most other materials are produced in mass quantities by large animals (like wool on a sheep) rather than in tiny amounts in tiny arachnids.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to all the explanations here, the best simple explanation I have ever heard was this, the chemicals essentially behave like legos, <a href="http://p.motionelements.com/stock-video/industry/me1191189-lego-wall-italy-hd-a0191.jpg" target="_blank">similar to this</a>. Imagine trying to pull this thing apart at the sides, not at the top and bottom, but at the sides. This is how spider web is chemically, the chemicals are interlocked like this, giving it a very strong structure.</p>
