<p>And it worked, it wasn't just confirmation bias or something, it worked every time.</p>
<p>I'm asking because my surround sound system has started to need just one solid tap to work correctly, shows it's on but not all the lights and no sound comes out until I bang on it. Just like that old TV from the 90s, makes it work every single time.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>But why? Why does this work?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a used 10 megabyte (Yup, an upgrade over the original twin floppies DOS 2.1) hard drive in my oldest computer, it needed a slap upside the head to get it started. One whack and you could hear it spin up.</p>
<p>Later, when I was running a room full of very inexpensive computers that had to be moved around frequently, many became flakey after the move. So I had to open them up, unseat all the cards and reinstall them. Sometimes I even had to swap slots for them to work.</p>
<p>Just poor electrical connections on some of the pins. coupled with a pretty flexible chassis, so the cards could work around in their slots and disconnect.</p>
<p>Back in the day the manual on trouble shooting and repairing sea going machinery started with &quot;First, tap it with a large spanner.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's generally a result of cracked solder connections. I work on audio electronics and we see this all the time. Many of the components used in amplifiers dissipate a good amount of heat, and solder and the actual Printed circuit board expand and contract at different rates, so over time the stress from all those heating and cooling cycles (on off) causes cracks to form. When exposed to oxygen the solder oxidizes so you get a thin layer of oxide blocking your connection inside these cracks. Tapping it can cause stuff to poke through this oxide layer and re-establish a connection. Also sometimes the vibration from being near speakers and the like can loosen the connections between the various boards. On a side note re-flowing your solder connections is easy (though a bit time consuming) and could very well fix your problem, though depending on the receiver disassembling it can be a decent amount of work. If you are fairly handy and had an interest in trying to fix it yourself feel free to PM me, I'd be happy to walk you through it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Loose parts, though now that everything has been considerably more miniaturized on circuit boards this doesn't work well anymore nor was it really a good idea. It was a really common &quot;fix&quot; for mechanical stuff since they had a lot of moving parts and something was stuck. Though it's not really a good idea. </p>
<p>As many have said the connections get loose due to solder on older electronic stuff. A lot of it was soldered by hand, or if my a machine it's still added on and not integrated into the circuit board like it is nowadays. When electricity it warms it up and when you stop using it it cools down and this heating/cooling causes it to dry up and start cracking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move components with bad/cracked solder joints</li>
<li>Break solder whiskers (dendrites) that have formed, crearing bad power paths. These metal whiskers can grow particularly where lead free solder is used.</li>
<li>Help re-seat loose connectors</li>
<li>Move batteries where contacts have oxidized</li>
<li>Move apart components that are short circuiting</li>
</ul>
<p>In all of these cases it's a poor fix, and you're better off doing some real maintenance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
