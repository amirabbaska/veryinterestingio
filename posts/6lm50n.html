<p>Brushing too hard, or with a hard bristle toothbrush, won't damage enamel (the outer, protective layer of the teeth).  It's simply too hard of a material.  It CAN however, damage the gum tissues and/or the cementum (a much softer layer that covers the root surface) of a tooth.</p>
<p>Brush too hard =&gt; damaged gums =&gt; recession =&gt; exposed cementum =&gt; damage or removal of cementum =&gt; sensitivity, root surface cavities (BAD!!)</p>
<p>For healthy individuals during a cleaning, yes the hygienist or dentist is carefully removing calculus/tartar  (not scraping off enamel as op suggested) from the teeth.  Even with these instruments, it is very difficult to damage the enamel.  </p>
<p>For individuals with periodontal or gum disease, they often already have recession and exposed cementum (from the bone loss, recession associated with periodontal disease) and yes, we can do damage.  In these situations, we will use an ultrasonic scaler to remove the calculus rather than scraping the teeth to avoid damaging these tissues.  </p>
<p>TL: DR - just use a soft-bristle toothbrush, or even better, use an electric toothbrush that tells you if you are brushing too hard</p>
<p>EDIT: calculus = tartar </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of misinformation here</p>
<p>As many have said, the key factor here is frequency. If you had your teeth scraped with the metal instrument (periodontal scaler) twice a day every day, you would see damage. Dentists and hygienists are trained to scrape your teeth to remove calculus or tartar from your teeth but minimise damage to the tooth structure as well. </p>
<p>Now where people seem to be getting confused: the damage that hard toothbrushing can cause. Hard traumatic toothbrushing can cause damage in two ways: to the gums and to the teeth. Hard toothbrushing can risk damaging the gums and cause recession (shrinkage of the gum away from the tooth). Bleeding from the gum is very rarely a sign of excessive toothbrushing and more likely a sign of gum inflammation (gingivitis or periodontitis). If you have persistent bleeding from your gums, you should have them checked by a dentist to assess for the cause. It's worth noting that aggressive toothbrushing can damage the gum, but not cleaning the gum margin risks gum problems as well. Remember, what you are trying to remove (plaque) is actually soft and so doesn't need to be scrubbed off. </p>
<p>Now unlike what many people are saying here, hard toothbrushing can cause damage to the tooth structure as well. The most common area to see this is around the necks of the teeth (where the tooth meets the gum). This is because the enamel (the hardest structure in the body) ends around this point and so is less resistant to wear. This is called toothbrush abrasion. Look it up if you want to get an idea what it looks like. Enamel is much less likely to be worn away with a toothbrush but if the enamel is softened with acid either from the diet (fizzy drinks or citrus drinks) or from the stomach (reflux) then a toothbrush can wear the enamel away too. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gum erosion is what you are trying to avoid with a soft brush and moderate pressure. The tooth under the gums doesn't have the same protective coating and is super sensitive.</p>
<p>The enamel is super hard, actually harder than the metal equipment. The dentist / hygienist is carefully scraping around the gum line to ensure they don't damage the gums.</p>
<p>Source: I suffer from gum erosion, my cousins are dentists, they explained a lot of this to me in detail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
