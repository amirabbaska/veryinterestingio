		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A rare example of a mineral that's basically completely depleted is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryolite" target="_blank">cryolite</a>.  Cryolite is used in aluminum smelting, but it can be manufactured from other minerals.  Prior to that, it was mined.  The only large deposit of cryolite was found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivittuut" target="_blank">Ivittuut, Greenland</a>, which was mined out by the 1980s.  Small amounts of cryolite are found elsewhere, but not in large enough amounts to be commercially viable.</p>
<p>Anything made from an extinct species would count too, if you're including biological materials, foods, etc.  One example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silphium" target="_blank">silphium</a>, used as a spice in the ancient Mediterranean.  While there's some dispute over its exact identity, it's thought that the silphium plant went extinct during Roman times.  Another material that's not completely gone, but can no longer be produced in large amounts is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignum_vitae" target="_blank">lignum vitae</a>.  It's an extremely hard wood produced from two endangered trees that grow very slowly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silphium" target="_blank">Silphium</a> was an ancient plant produced in Northern Africa and used primarily in the Roman Empire in antiquity. It was used as a kind of panacea. Ranging from mild pain reliever to contraceptive/abortifacients. Said to be “Worth it’s weight in denarii (silver coins),” it was methodically harvested to extinction. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One example that comes close is technetium. No isotope of technetium has a half life of more than a couple million years, so if there was any present when the earth was formed it's all gone now. It was only discovered in the 1930s after being created by irradiating molybdenum in a cyclotron. There are small quantities in the earth that are a fission byproduct of natural uranium, but these are not a significant source and natural technetium was only discovered after the element was synthesized. Technetium is a very important material in nuclear medicine so there is demand for it, and basically all of the technetium we use is artificially created in nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>Edit for more information: this is more relevant than some new, high-z element with a short half life because technetium is element 43. It's the lightest element with no stable isotopes, so before it was discovered there was a hole in the periodic table right in the middle of a bunch of common elements, some of which had been discovered centuries before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>To the point that when they built additions, they had to use a substitute pink marble or something. The difference is clear when you look at it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One example which comes to mind is Guano, a type of soil-like material which is highly enriched in phosphate and derived from the accumulation and maturation of sea-bird droppings.  It was used as fertiliser and concentrated on otherwise denudated and rocky islands, mostly in the Pacific, where it could form layers up to 10 meters thick. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_phosphorus#Exhaustion_of_guano_reserves" target="_blank">It is now pretty much mined out</a>, and current phosphate production depends on other types of deposits, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorite" target="_blank">phosphorites</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvinite" target="_blank">evaporitic sylvinite</a> or apatite from layered complexes.</p>
