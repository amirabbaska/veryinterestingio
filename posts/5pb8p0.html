		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is because muscle cells (also called muscle fibers) don't divide, and cancer is most common in cells that divide a lot. Dividing cells are primed for cancer because:
1) a lot of the machinery needed to divide rapidly is already present in the cell so not a lot extra is needed to make it grow uncontrollably into a tumor/cancer
2) the more a cell divides the more chances it has to make errors. DNA replication isn't perfect, and over time these errors can accumulate into dangerous mutations (this is also why cancer is more common in the elderly)
This is why we see a lot of cancer in tissues with a high &quot;cellular turnover&quot; rate - skin, liver, colon, etc. Cells that never divide (muscle fibers, neurons) almost never get cancer. Brain cancer is usually caused by a special type of brain cell that can divide (but not signal) call neuroglia, which forms the cancerous &quot;glioma.&quot;
Bonus biology fact - because muscle cells fibers don't divide, you have the same number your whole life. Arnold Schwarzenegger has the same number of muscle fibers now as he did as a baby, they're just more packed with the good stuff.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cancer is the abnormal and unstoppable cell growing. Some types of cancer are very common (like prostate cancer) because the cells of that organ are growing continuously.
The heart stop growing at a very young age compared to other organs, and the rarer the cells are regenerate, the rarer the type of cancer is. </p>
<p>That's because heart cancer is such a rare type of cancer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cancer is dependent upon cells that actually reproduce. </p>
<p>The more cells reproduce and replicate the more chances that antigen and genetic changes take place that actually produce cancer. Cancer isn't really a disease but a spectrum of diseases and changes that we call cancer. </p>
<p>The heart cells do not reproduce so cancer is rare. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>Cancer is a set of diseases where cell division goes wrong and the cells divide uncontrollably. </li>
<li>Your body is made up of many different cell types which have different rates of division.</li>
<li>Skin cells are replaced every 2 weeks, red blood cells every 4 weeks, muscle cells every 16 years.</li>
<li>The heart is made of muscle.</li>
<li>Heart cells therefore divide <em>very</em> slowly, making division errors uncommon and heart cancer rare.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heart doesnt change its number of cells much (no hyerplasia) or change cells much (metaplasia).  Places like your lungs amd GI change a lot because of their environment and purpose making them susceptible.  Like skeletal muscles though, the heart can become larger by the cells becoming larger (hypertrophy) from working harder such as in people with hypertension.</p>
<p>The grinch's heart didnt grow because of xmas, it grew because of severe hypertension.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
