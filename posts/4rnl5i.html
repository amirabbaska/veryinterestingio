		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In documentaries about cephalopods, sometimes footage is shown of octopuses and cuttlefish post-mating indicating that they die shortly afterwards. They usually look very disheveled, with their skin peeling off it looks as though they are literally disintegrating. What causes this, is it some sort of super fast aging process? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you have access to it, check out &quot;Hormonal Inhibition of Feeding and Death in Octopus: Control by Optic Gland Secretion&quot; by Jerome Wodinsky in Science. </p>
<p>It's not a huge topic of research, but it's hypothesised that maturity in cephalopods is controlled by hormonal responses to lengthening days. Their optic glands release a gonadotrophin which switches their metabolism from investing energy in growth and maintainance (somatic growth) to one where everything is dumped into the gonads (reproductive growth). I guess this change is a one way process and once the eggs have been laid there is no means to  revert back again. Wodinsky removed the optic glands from a bunch of female octopi (octopodes?!) post-spawning, and they began feeding again and lived a further 6-9 months. Interestingly, <em>Nautilus</em>, which are a pretty basal group that branched from the rest of the Cephalopoda in the late-Cambrian, lack optic glands, have a completely different reproductive strategy, and don't die after laying their eggs. </p>
<p>The implications of this for spawning in deepwater octopods are really interesting. This is just speculation, but might be the case that things like the giant squid can grow to such sizes because, due to their low exposure to light in deep waters, they aren't limited to a single spawning event.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The trait you're looking for is called semelparity. A classic example is a marsupial mouse, which basically fucks its way into the grave. As it enters the mating season it starts producing a huge amount of the stress hormones adrenaline (epinephrine) and cortisol. These make fat stores more available for energy, reduce hunger, reduce pain, reduce fatigue, and kill the immune system in order to maximise the number of times it can mate in this one season. </p>
<p>It will continue to have sex without eating, barely sleeping, until it is ridden with diseases (fur hanging off etc.), has no fat remaining and has been digesting its muscles for energy, and is completely exhausted. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about cuttlefish, but I know that some species of octopus will essentially starve themselves to death guarding and protecting their clutch of eggs. The skin peeling and disheveled look is most likely from lack of nutrition over such a long period of time, up to 53 months. Here's a link with some more info:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a cephalopod, but when salmon run (swim out of the ocean and upstream to mate and die) they go thru an irreversible change where their stomach shrinks and they basically use everything they have left to battle back to the spawning ground. They will eat opportunistically, which is why you can still catch them on a rod and reel, but it's not their main goal.</p>
<p>Edit: as stated below, it may be territorial or basal aggressive eating. Not really opportunistic feeding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact. In the fossil record we've got shelled cephalopods that grow up to 9 to 12 ft sometimes. The species they belong to rarely got above 3 feet. The 12 footers probably caught a parasite that destroyed the function of their gonads causing them to not go through the typical massive reproductive mortality event--and they just kept growing. We find them in Northwest Arkansas every few years. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
