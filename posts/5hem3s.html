		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can eat most meats raw so long as it's fresh. The truth is though, that even raw veggies aren't properly fully digested by our guts and we don't always get the full nutrition out of them just because our guts are so short compared to a true herbivore. Humans evolved into what we are because of cooking. It gave us smaller jaws and shorter guts and enabled us to eat a variety of new exciting things we couldn't appreciate before. Now that we needed less energy to consume and digest raw meat or plant matter it freed up some valuable real estate in the head area.</p>
<p>Huge jaws became smaller and more delicate where the brain and cranium became larger and more complex. Unfortunately our gut also became kind of wussy and now cooking our food is nearly a necessity. </p>
<p>You can eat raw meat if it's fresh but some animals carry stuff your stomach acid isn't strong enough to kill, and you can survive on nothing but raw veg but it's more work because you're gonna be pooping most of those nutrients out </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume you mean raw meat. After all, many people eat raw fruits and vegetables with absolutely no problem.</p>
<p>You can eat raw meat fine as well. The problem is that it's very easy for microorganisms to grow on raw meat. It needs to be cooked or prepared correctly to reduce that risk. </p>
<p>If I remember my biochemistry correctly, cooking meats also frees up some proteins/amino acids that our digestive systems wouldn't be able to process otherwise. This isn't enough to cause &quot;stomach problems,&quot; as most people use that term, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lions, as well as other carnivores, are often carrying parasites in the gut and the muscular tissue, and they probably do have varying levels of discomfort from it.  Parasites have been almost eradicated from the food supply in industrialized countries, and cooking helps assure those parasites that make it don't survive.  That's one of the benefits we get from doing our food differently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the parasite/decay problems mentioned elsewhere, our stomachs aren't acidic enough to eat large amounts of raw meat. We simply can't digest more than a few ounces of it before the acid and enzymes are spent, leading to nausea, vomiting, cramps, etc. from the undigested meat.</p>
<p>Cooking meat does a lot of the work for us by denaturing proteins, breaking down connective tissue, and killing any bacteria or parasites. I don't think that we've lost the ability to eat lots of meat once we learned to cook, just that cooking lets us eat lots more meat than we could without it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
