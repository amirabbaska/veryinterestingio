		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is absolutely correct. It's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem" target="_blank">Birthday Problem</a> and it's a well-known counter intuitive result. The reason it's counter intuitive is that since there's 365 days in the year, there's only a 1/365 chance that a random person has a birthday on a particular day; so, if you look pick a random person in the room there's only a 1/365 chance the other person has the same birthday as you.</p>
<p>But, the problem only says that <em>some</em> pair of people in the room share a birthday, and there are lots of pairs of people. In fact, it you take a room of only 23 people, there's a total of 253 possible pairs, and any of them have a chance of having the same birthday. When you work through the probability you find the the sheer number of possible pairing balances the improbability of any particular pair sharing a birthday, resulting in a 50% chance of one match in a room of 23.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, if there are 23 people, there is actually a 50.7% chance that 2 of them have the same birthday, assuming that the 365 possible birthdays (not counting February 29) are all equally likely. But 23 people are the minimum number of people required to have at least a 50% chance.</p>
<p>This is the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem" target="_blank">birthday problem</a>, and the Wikipedia article does a good job in explaining the details. <a href="http://www.chebfun.org/examples/fun/img/BirthdayOdds_02.png" target="_blank">This is a graph</a> of the probability of finding at least one pair of matching birthdays, as a function of the number of people in the party. Notice how quickly the function ramps up. Once you have 57 people, there is more than a 99% chance of their being a matching pair.</p>
<p>Your confusion most likely lies in interpreting the problem incorrectly. A common misinterpretation is the following: &quot;what is the probability that someone in this room shares my birthday?&quot; Well, that is easily answered. If there are 22 other people in the room, the probability that no one shares your birthday is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>q = (364/365)^(22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the probability that at least one person shares your birthday is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p = 1 - q = 5.9%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems to be reasonable. </p>
<p>But the birthday problem is not asking that question. The birthday problem is asking: &quot;what is the chance that among these 23 people there is some pair that has the same birthday?&quot; So just because no one has your birthday, that doesn't mean no other 2 people can't have the same birthday. Maybe everyone in the room was born on March 5, except you. The answer to the birthday problem then means that if there are 23 people in a room, there is a about a 50-50 shot that some pair has the same birthday. (If there are 57 people, there is more than a 99% chance.)</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>edit:</strong> Someone below asked how the problem changes if birthdays are not assumed to be uniformly distributed by date. First of all, birthdays do <em>not</em> have a uniform distribution. More birthdays tend to occur at the end of summer, for instance (August/September for northern hemisphere or February/March for southern hemisphere). So how would the answer to the birthday problem change if we did not assume a uniform probability? Let's rephrase the problem slightly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fix the number <em>N</em> (say, of people) and consider the probability p(N) such that there exists at least one pair of persons that have the same birthday, if all birthdays are drawn from some fixed distribution, not necessarily the uniform distribution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can then ask questions about how p(N) changes with the distribution. It turns out that p(N) is <em>minimized</em> precisely when the distribution is uniform. This means that non-uniform distributions tend to decrease the required number of people at a party to get a matching birthday. So the figure of 23 people is sufficient for a matching pair, no matter what the distribution is. In fact, if we had lumped February 29 into the normal year and assumed even that date to be equally likely (in other words, there are 366 equally like birthdays), the probability of a match at 23 people would be about 50.63%, still above 50%. Since the uniform distribution on the 366 probabilities maximizes the required number for a 50% match, we know 23 people suffices for all distributions, even those that include February 29 as a possible birthday.</p>
<p>(IMO, the simplest proof that the uniform distribution minimizes p(N) can be found in the paper <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.1977.10479214?queryID=%24%7BresultBean.queryID%7D" target="_blank">&quot;A note on the uniformity assumption in the birthday problem&quot;</a>. The actual paper (which occupies less than one page) is behind a pay wall, but you can access it if you are affiliated with an academic institution. The DOI is 10.1080/00031305.1977.10479214. However, if you have some math background, you can prove the statement for yourself using the method of Lagrange multipliers.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other explanations already posted do a good job of the maths involved, but if you're still struggling with the intuition I remember it seems like a less &quot;weird&quot; result if you imagine each person entering the room in turn, and picking a birthday at random - for there to be no shared birthdays, each person needs to have a birthday that's distinct from all the others that have already been picked.</p>
<p>Odds of success are 1/1 for the first guy (empty calendar, free pick of the dates), then 364/365 for the second, 363/365 for the third, and so on down. Then for the odds of <em>all of them</em> being distinct you need to multiply those fractions along as you go, for each and every person to have to come up with a distinct birthday one after the other.</p>
<p>Even though the odds are reasonably good for each one individually, you get an effect similar to compound interest where the small chance of a match multiplies up with each successive person.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
