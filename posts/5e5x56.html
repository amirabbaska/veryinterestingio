		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The quality on a video chat can only be as good as the &quot;weakest&quot; link.</p>
<p>The camera will set the upper bound for how good the quality can possibly be. If your camera has a thick layer of grease on it, nothing's going to look good.</p>
<p>After that, the controlling factors will be the resolution that the software chooses to record at (the pixel size, like 640 x 480, 1920 x 1080, etc.), the amount of network speed available or that the app chooses to use (&quot;bandwidth&quot;, measured in kilobits or megabits per second, for network and video applications), and which encoding format is being used.</p>
<p>Better encoding formats can get more visual quality with the same amount of bandwidth, but often being more difficult to encode and/or decode. &quot;h264&quot; is a lot higher quality than the old &quot;divx / xvid&quot; type of MPEG4, which in turn was better than the ones that came before those. Phones and tablets (and many digital cameras )now have the ability to encode and decode x264 video &quot;in hardware&quot; rather than requiring the main processor to do all the hard work.</p>
<p>Skype and Facetime are very likely using different amounts of bandwidth, or different video encoding techniques, which is why they don't look the same. It's not much different to a phone call on a regular landline (or a cell phone with great signal coverage) vs a cell phone call where one person is on a really bad network (low signal strength, heavily overloaded cell tower, roaming on a bad 2G-GSM network).</p>
<p>I haven't used Facetime so I don't know how it compares to Skype, but on Skype you can really tell if you don't have enough bandwidth if the call quality goes to crap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, but this won't be easy. I'll try my best.</p>
<p>Skype and FaceTime are both what are called &quot;video conferencing technologies,&quot; computers and programs that take a video from one phone and send it to another, while receiving the video from the other phone and displaying it for the user. You want to know why the video looks better on one app than the other, and the answer is very much about speed. Let's clear up a few things first.</p>
<p>We are talking about using the same phone, same camera, and same lighting conditions, but different apps and an internet connection that can be cellphone or WiFi. Now, to send a video from one place to another, the other place needs to show many images, slightly different from one another, and one after the other, so that it tricks the user on the other side into seeing a smoothly flowing picture. The human eye needs about 25 images every second to see this, and to do this, we would have to send 25 pictures every second to the other phone.</p>
<p>Because the internet used to be very (VERY, VERY, VERY!!!!) slow not too long ago, people came up with a way to solve this problem: send one picture, and then only the changes between pictures for a few seconds, and then another picture. This is why you sometimes see the picture show trails and deform weirdly. Doing this is called video compression, and the trails and deformities are called &quot;video compression artifacts&quot; and they are caused by the data not getting through.</p>
<p>But, because the internet was so slow, this wasn't even enough. We had to come up with a way to make even the full pictures much smaller. So the pictures that are sent between the difference information are also &quot;compressed.&quot; We do this by analyzing the image, and breaking it down into many rectangles of different colors. If you start with drawing many large rectangles and then draw smaller ones with different colors on top, and you keep doing this, you will be able to come up with a picture that is very close to the original picture, and close is good enough. Telling a computer how far down and how far over to start drawing a rectangle, and how far down, and how far over it should end, and what color it should be, takes up less memory than telling it the color for every pixel because you can tell it to cover many pixels with one rectangle. This is called &quot;image compression,&quot; and when you see an image that has a lot of squares or rectangles in your video, it's because of &quot;image compression artifacts.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, Skype was made sometime between the dinosaur extinction and the internet getting fast, but definitely before it got fast. Many people still connected to the internet with these crazy devices that screamed noises at each other over a telephone, instead of using the internet to make calls. So, to make things happen quickly enough, video calls were encoded with less advanced methods of &quot;video compression&quot; and &quot;audio compression.&quot; Even the methods I explained are just hints at how it really works, but let's say that the maths and science have evolved. FaceTime was made between when being cool stopped being cool, and when cellphone internet got really, really fast. At first, you couldn't even use FaceTime through cellphone internet without hacking it. It was WiFi only.</p>
<p>Because Skype was made in the long, long ago, it still uses an older version of &quot;image compression,&quot; and &quot;video compression.&quot; To give a good example, let's say that the new ways to do compression can also do circles for images, and can come up with the differences between images faster because they are made to do more than one image at once, or more than one change at once. One of the big steps forward in computers has been to do this compression, the action being called &quot;encoding,&quot; very fast, in hardware. The opposite of this, on the other side, putting it back together, on the screen, is called &quot;decoding.&quot; I hope this clears up a few things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order for a video to travel across the Internet it has to be carried and passed along by lots of different virtual &quot;people&quot;, just like in a relay race. High quality videos are much heavier than low quality videos.</p>
<p>Even though your camera on the phone can be a big strong virtual person, it still needs to hand the video off to the other people to take care of the delivery, all the way to the other side of the Internet (it can be a long way sometimes!), and some of those people may not be as strong. In a big city there are lots of strong people, but sometimes they are overworked and tired.</p>
<p>Out in the countryside, there may not be any strong people to deliver your message! Sometimes even further out, there are no delivery people at all!</p>
<p>There are also virtual people that live in your phone who are the first to people in this virtual relay race, and these people named &quot;Skype&quot; and &quot;Facetime&quot; have different strengths. Some may deliver faster, others may carry more weight but take their time. Also, some virtual people eat their vegetables and exercise, these virtual people can be both faster and carry more weight, having the best of both worlds (advances in technology).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, Facetime uses H.265 and a hardware enabled HEVC codec, and Skype does not.  That means that Facetime is using a newer, more bandwidth-efficient, better quality codec than Skype, and it's less constrained by CPU cycles, since Skype has to do more encoding in software.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
