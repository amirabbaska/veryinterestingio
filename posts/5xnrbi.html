		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salts form ionic bonds.  Basically, one atom has an extra electron and is negatively charge, while the other atom is missing an electron and thus is positively charged.  These charged particles are called ions.  In water, these are equally spread out, so the solution has no net charge in any one place.  Without a net charge they don't really stick to anything.  When it dries, they form crystals that also have equally spread ions, and again, they have a net neutral charge and don't stick to things.  </p>
<p>Sugar (and water) bond differently.  There are lots of oxygen and hydrogen atoms in sugar. Oxygen molecules like to have extra nearby electrons, but not so much that they steal them completely.  Hydrogen is pretty indifferent as to if it has too few electrons, but not so much that it wants to give it away completely.  So the hydrogen and oxygen share some electrons, but they're around the oxygen more.  This creates a partial negative charge on the oxygen and a partial positive charge on the hydrogen.</p>
<p>Now opposites attract .  The partial positive parts of some atoms stick to the partial negative charge on the other.  These are called hydrogen bonds.  These hydrogen bonds make sugar into solid crystals.  But when you add water, which also hydrogen bonds, water slips between these bonds and breaks up all the crystals.  Whats left is a whole mess of oxygen and hydrogen sticking together all over the place.  All of those hydrogen and oxygen will stick to just about whatever else has oxygen atoms (called hydrogen bond acceptors) and more so anything else that has hydrogen bonded to oxygen, which is...well, a lot of stuff. </p>
<p>So the question, why do the ions not stick to everything while the partially charged atoms do?  Simply, the ions like to stick to the opposite ion too much to stick to anything else, whereas hydrogen bonds aren't that picky.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Salt sticks to itself too well to stick to other stuff.  Sugar stick really well, but not so well that it only sticks to itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sugar will form hydrogen bonds with all sorts of compounds. This means it can be &quot;sticky&quot; and hold lightly to things while still being in solution. </p>
<p>Salt, however, will simply dry as a crystal and just be either in solution or out of solution, and can't interact very strongly with ions already in solution. Thus, it is not terribly sticky and will just make your hands a little salty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sugar and Salt behave very differently when dissolved.
Just remember that common salt is NaCl,wile common table sugar is C11H22O11(because it's formed by 1 glucose C6H12O6 and one fructose C5H10O5)So sugar will have WAAAAAAY more complex reaction and it'll create a lot of hydrogen bonds, thus changing in properties a lot, while salt will just hang in there until the water evaporates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its a good question. My take on it is that the sugar solution becomes thick as it gets concentrated, but the salt doesnt. That is because the sugar molecules tend to associate together (see others H-bonding explanations) when very concentrated almost forming long chains or aggregates. These long chains tend to entangle, thickening the solution. This thickness (viscoelasticity technically) we perceive as stickiness  </p>
<p>The salt ions dont associate (or if they do they form solid salt crystals which come our of solution) so the solution stays thin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
