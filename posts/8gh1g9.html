		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There haven't been any conclusive studies showing play in Arthropods but that doesn't mean they  don't.  According to Gordon Burghardt these are the requirements for play of non humans:</p>
<p>1.The performance of the behavior is not fully functional in the form or context in which it is expressed; that is, it includes elements, or is directed toward stimuli, that do not contribute to current survival.
2.The behavior is spontaneous, voluntary, intentional, pleasurable, rewarding, reinforcing, or autotelic (done for its own sake). This characteristic, more than the others, seems to require an inference about the animal’s inner mental state.
3.[The behavior] differs from strictly functional expressions of behavior structurally or temporally in at least one respect: incomplete (generally through inhibited or dropped final elements), exaggerated, awkward, precocious, or involves behavior patterns with modified form, sequencing, or targeting.
4.The behavior is performed repeatedly in a similar, but not rigidly stereotyped, form during at least a portion of the animal’s ontogeny.
5.The behavior is initiated when an animal is adequately fed, clothed, healthy, and not under stress (e.g., from physical danger, harsh weather, illness, social instability, family dysfunction), or intense competing systems (e.g., feeding, mating, competition, fear): In other words, the animal is in a ‘relaxed field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The closest thing perhaps is that bees have been trained to do things such as pull string or place tiny balls in receptacles in order to obtain a sugar-water reward. Moreover bees that watched other bees do this (or iirc, a small bee &quot;robot&quot; or puppet) do this learned by observation.</p>
<p>That implies to me that a bee might do something not directly related to food (although indirectly so) including observing other bees. I know this is not really play.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insects are some of the most highly evolved organisms due to the short generations, but due to their small size this has caused even their most complex behaviors to be stitched right into their genomes the point that they basically function as little robots.  Play is typically observed only in vertebrates (mammals in particular), and serves to train motor skills.  Insects have no need for this training, and due to the short life spans, they probably wouldn't even be able to play 'enough' to get much use from it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
