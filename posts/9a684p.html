Most dyes and pigments are based on organic compounds, if I remember they are mostly dinitrile amines (or that was a key ingredient, Iâ€™ve tried to block my organic chem class from my mind).</p>
<p>So basically its a long chain organic compound and the charged oxygen is really good at breaking it up (so is sunlight). When they break up they change color, usually they fade to out of the visible spectrum (so we see white).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen is one of the most destructive substances, despite us needing it to live. It's so destructive to organic substances that it is the main reason why foods go bad so we need to wrap them, why bodies decompose etc. It is so destructive it can even dissolve iron and turn it into rust.</p>
<p>(Not only that, it is, what irony!!, also the reason that we age respective show signs of aging, since oxygen also destroys cells in the body. It is, to make it short, a really, really bad substance for anything living, when seen  from a different perspective).</p>
<p>Since colour dyes and dust, dirt etc. are mostly organic, these things are also easily destroyed/dissolved by oxygen, resulting in things getting bleached.</p>
<p>EDIT: Correction. It's not that oxygen decomposes organic matter and spoils food. It's organisms like fungi and bacteria.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything that you see colored is colored because it reflects a specific wavelenght corresponding to a specific color.</p>
<p>An object is made out of molecules which are in turn made of atoms. What makes an object colored is a phenomenon called &quot;resonance&quot;. Resonance happens when the electrons that are within the bond between 2 atoms don't stay there and instead move around the entire molecule, in concert with other eletrons from other atomic bonds. Benzene is a prime example of resonance, altough it is not a &quot;colored&quot; molecule for reasons explained below.</p>
<p>A molecule capable of resonance, when receiving a <em>specific</em> energy wavelenght via light, will prefer to discharge this energy by emitting a longer wavelenght than it has received, instead of discharging the energy by the means of vibrating (generating heat) like most molecules do. This is called the absorbance peak; the physico-chemical properties of a molecule dictate which wavelenght it prefers to absorb.</p>
<p>Resonance is amplified by specific atomic subgroups like double electronic bonds. The more of these subgroups a molecule has, the more resonance you get, the longer the wavelenght absorbed gets and in turn, the longer the wavelenght reflected becomes.</p>
<p>Bleach, as well as oxygen peroxyde, oxydises these subgroups, causing a loss in resonance for the molecule and a shift in the wavelenght absorbed. If you get enough oxydation, you can completely overwhelm the resonance of the molecule. It will still be able to absorb a specific wavelenght, but that wavelenght will be in the UV spectrum, and the reflected, longer wavelenght will also be in the UV, thus becoming non visible to the naked eye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
