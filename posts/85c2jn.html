		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK, so a cube is a 3D shape where every face is a square. The short answer is that a tesseract is a 4D shape where every face is a cube. Take a regular cube and make each face -- currently a square -- into a cube, and boom! A tesseract. (It's important that that's not the same as just sticking a cube onto each flat face; that will still give you a 3D shape.) When you see the point on a cube, it has three angles going off it at ninety degrees: one up and down, one left and right, one forward and back. A tesseract would have four, the last one going into the fourth dimension, all at ninety degrees to each other.</p>
<p>I know. I know. It's an odd one, because we're not used to thinking in four dimensions, and it's difficult to visualise... but mathematically, it checks out. There's nothing stopping such a thing from being conceptualised. Mathematical rules apply to tesseracts (and beyond; you can have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube" target="_blank">hypercubes</a> in any number of dimensions) just as they apply to squares and cubes.</p>
<p>The problem is, you can't accurately show a tesseract in 3D. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Schlegel_wireframe_8-cell.png" target="_blank">Here's</a> an approximation, but it's not right. You see how every point has four lines coming off it? Well, those four lines -- in 4D space, at least -- are at exactly ninety degrees to each other, but we have no way of showing that in the constraints of 2D or 3D. The gaps that you'd think of as cubes aren't cube-shaped, in this representation. They're all wonky. That's what happens when you put a 4D shape into a 3D wire frame (or a 2D representation); they get all skewed. It's like when you look at <a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ce05fbae394e9b6dbd639e4352e261ba" target="_blank">a cube drawn in 2D</a>. I mean, look at those shapes. We understand them as representating squares... but they're not. The only way to perfectly represent a cube in 3D is to build it in 3D, and then you can see that all of the faces are perfect squares.</p>
<p>A tesseract has the same problem. Gaps between the outer 'cube' and the inner 'cube' should each be perfect cubes... but they're not, because we can't represent them that way in anything lower than four dimensions -- which, sadly, we don't have access to in any meaningful, useful sense for this particular problem.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a cube, but in 4 dimensions.</p>
<p>A 'dimension' is basically a direction you can go. For instance, if you're drawing lines on a sheet of paper, you can draw along the up/down direction or along the left/right direction, but not along the in/out direction. So the paper (in the sense of being a 'place' where you can draw lines) is effectively 2-dimensional. Out in the real world, you can go along the forwards/backwards direction, the left/right direction, <em>or</em> the up/down direction. So real life is 3-dimensional. A 1-dimensional space is just a line, where there is only one direction you can go in (for instance, left/right only). And a 0-dimensional space is just a single dot, with no directions to move in.</p>
<p>Now consider a shape defined the following way: Start with a single point in some location in space, and a 'distance' denoted N. Then construct the shape by extending the point by a distance N along one dimension (including all the points between the starting position and the ending position), then extending the <em>resulting</em> shape along the next dimension also by distance N, and so on for all the dimensions of that space.</p>
<p>In 0 dimensions, this procedure just gives you the original dot. There are no directions to extend the shape into. (This shape has a single 'corner', the original point.)</p>
<p>In 1 dimension, you start with a dot and extend it by a distance N, creating a line segment of length N. (This shape has 2 'corners' at its ends, and 1 'edge' between those corners, whose length is N.)</p>
<p>In 2 dimensions, you create the line segment as described above, and then extend it 'sideways' along the second dimension, also by distance N. The entire line sweeps out its own length across that distance, covering a <em>square</em> within that 2-dimensional space. So a square is the 2-dimensional version of this kind of shape. (This shape has 4 'corners' as well as 4 N-length 'edges' between those corners, and a single flat 'face' between those edges, whose area is N*N.)</p>
<p>In 3 dimensions, you create the square as described above, and then extend it 'sideways' along the third dimension, also by distance N. The entire square sweeps out its own area across that distance, covering a solid <em>cube</em> within that 3-dimensional space. So a cube is the 3-dimensional version of this kind of shape. (This shape has 8 'corners' as well as 12 N-length 'edges' between those corners, 6 flat 'faces' between those edges of area N*N each, and a single 'bulk' between those faces, whose volume is N*N*N.)</p>
<p>Now, upon hitting 4 dimensions it becomes difficult to visualize because our brains evolved for thinking and perceiving in just 3 dimensions. But the math works out just fine. In 4 dimensions, you create the cube as described above, and then extend it 'sideways' (in a direction that we can't point, being limited as we are to a 3-dimensional universe) along the fourth dimension, also by distance N. The entire cube sweeps out its own volume across that distance, covering a region of 4-dimensional space. The resulting shape is called a <strong>'tesseract'.</strong> It has 16 'corners', 32 'edges' between those corners, 24 flat 'faces' between those edges of area N*N each, 8 cubical 'cells' between those faces of volume N*N*N each, and a single 4-dimensional region between those cubes, whose interior size is N*N*N*N. (There's no official word for what to call this kind of size, but it's the 4-dimensional equivalent of length, area and volume; some people call it '4-volume'.)</p>
<p>You can keep doing this up to any number of dimensions. Notice the pattern of how the number of 'pieces' of the object goes up: An M-dimensional 'hypercube' has exactly 2^M 'corners'; it has exactly 1 M-dimensional interior region; and for each piece of dimensions strictly between 0 and M, it has twice the previous number of pieces of that dimension plus the previous number of pieces of the next dimension below that. In particular, in the case of M-1 the number of pieces is equal to exactly 2*M, because it always doubling 1 and then adding the previous number. Wikipedia gives a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypercube&amp;oldid=828153490#Elements" target="_blank">table</a> of these 'piece' counts for the first 10 hypercubes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Tesseract is a hypothetical 4 dimensional object.</p>
<p>Take a point and connect it to another, and that makes a line.</p>
<p>Take another line 90 degrees from that first line, the same length, and connect all the new points the same way, and you have a square.</p>
<p>Now make more squares, 90 degrees from the plane, and you get a cube.</p>
<p>If you had a 4th dimensional space, you could make more cubes, with each cube 90 degrees from the first, and you would have a Tesseract.</p>
<p>If you found yourself inside a Tesseract, you could travel outside of your home plane and into another by using shortcuts between the coordinates, allowing two disparate locations to appear, to you, to be right next to each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
