		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one knows for sure, but it helps to understand how your brain gets its sense of balance and equilibrium. Your inner ear has 3 tubes called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system" target="_blank">vestibular system</a>. Inside these tubes is a liquid, whose orientation is detected by tiny hairs, which your brain interprets to determine the orientation of your head. Think of these tubes as a little pair of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_level" target="_blank">spirit levels</a> (one for each ear) in your head. One possible cause of the sense of dizziness is that with sufficient alcohol consumption, the alcohol enters the vestibular tubes, and alters the physical properties of the fluid within, affecting your sense of balance. Another possibility is that your body's inflammatory response to alcohol and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetaldehyde" target="_blank">byproducts</a> of it being cleaned out by your liver changes the shape of the vestibular tubes, also altering how your brain perceives its orientation.</p>

<p>Let’s start with how you balance. Imagine a tube in your ear. The tube is filled with fluid and tough little hairs that have pebbles on top. The fluid and hair can support the pebbles, but when you stand up or move the pebbles move too, which bends the hairs. This sends signals to the brain. I like to think of it like a glow stick: it doesn’t do anything when it’s straight, but if you bend and crack it, it glows.</p>
<p>So what does alcohol do? Unlike other liquids, alcohol can get in the little tube! Alcohol changes the fluid so that the pebbles are more floaty. This means that they can move around more easily - and bend the hairs more easily, too! Now even when you stop moving, the pebbles are floating and keep bending that hair, which keeps telling your brain that you’re moving even when you aren’t. </p>
<p>That’s what makes you dizzy: your eyes are telling you you’re standing still and your brain is telling you you’re moving!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
