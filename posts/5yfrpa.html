		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The perception of time durations are crucially bound up with memory. It is essentially our memory of an event that allows us to form a perception of its duration. We subconsciously infer the duration of an event from our memory of how far in the past something occurred, of how long ago the beginning and end of the event occurred. </p>
<p>If an event or day is particularly novel, it will be encoded more strongly and be more present in the mind than an event or day where very few novel memories are formed (i.e. when you do the same things you always do repetitively), and so the perception of how long it took will be altered based on the extent and size of those novel memories.</p>
<p>This is true for remembering a day last week, or remembering just a few hours ago, or a few minutes.
All of that, including the feeling of slowness or fastness of time, is based on your awareness of the memories, and the attention you paid when you encoded them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something that I have noticed that might help to answer your question.  When you first drive to an unfamiliar location it always seems very long to get there but after driving the route for a while it feels shorter.  I believe it is your brain paying attention to everything the first time and storing that information which gets translated to your perception of time.  After driving it for a while your brain selects only the landmarks to pay attention to and so your perception of time becomes compressed.  While it does probably take less time after a while the difference is not as great as we perceive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It also has to do a lot with our neurobiology and the firing of neurons (or lack thereof) in the regions associated with the perception of time, such as the prefrontal cortex and its associated parts. Through fMRI we have been able to observe that when we are consumed in an activity, these areas begin to &quot;wink out&quot;. Not necessarily all turning off at once but certainly less active than usual. This plunges us in what some call &quot;the deep now&quot;. </p>
<p>I'm not well versed in this topic so I don't know every detail of this phenomenon. The Flow Genome Project has been working on this very thing and I suggest anyone interested in this to read up on the research the team has been conducting.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason that days get faster as you age is pretty interesting. the first day of your life was 100% of your life at the time. The second was  half. The third was a third, and so on. Each day is a smaller fraction of your life than the one before. The same goes for weeks, months and years. This is why life goes by faster as you age. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain can only focus on one thing at a time. When you multi-task you are technically switching back and forth between two things. So if your brain's attention is constantly stimulated it can't focus on time. When you have nothing to do, your focus is mainly on when the last thing happened until the next thing happens</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
