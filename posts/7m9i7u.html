The temperature down there is 0-3 °C (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_ocean_water" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_ocean_water</a>). Metabolism slows down at that temperature, but there are various micro- and macro-creatures there to break down the carcass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What didn't decompose is the shoes. When you see interior pictures of the Titanic on the ocean floor you will see lots of shoes. Every one of those pairs of shoes was likely attached to a body that went down with the ship</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I recall there are migrating colonies of ocean life that move across the bottom of the ocean to break down deceased creatures. More specifically with large aquatic life such as sharks and whales, they can provide an ecosystem to small aquatic life for months to years as their bodies are broken down, but I imagine on a smaller scale fish would be treated in similar fashion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was a marine biologist at Palmer station in Antarctica for a winter season. There are species of fish in the Antarctic circle that have antifreeze glycoproteins to help prevent their blood and muscles from freezing. The man who discovered this is named Art Devries. I forget his university affiliation. His wife, Chris Cheng, also works with the protein. </p>
<p>My research didn’t pertain to the protein, but you can look up a species name if you’re interested:  Chaenocephalus aceratus. </p>
<p>To help answer your question though, the carcasses will get eaten. Very strange creatures live at some incredible depths in the Southern Ocean (and other oceans for that matter). When fishing the Banana Trench, my research team and I actually caught a sea pig. There’s a great video on youtube called “True Facts about the Sea Pig” that you should watch to get a sense of the weirdness. Anyway, back on topic - other fish eat the carcasses, weird little sea critters will eat them, etc. Nothing goes to waste. </p>
<p>I saw a leopard seal right after eating a penguin when I was fishing in shallow waters in a zodiac. The remaining bits of the carcass was getting eaten by Skuas and other birds. If it weren’t eaten by the birds then I’m sure it would have sunk eventually and been eaten by the fish. </p>
<p>Hope that helps! Sorry my reply is a jumbled mess. I’m on my phone and just got back from another stint on the ice so my brain is still a little fried. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>No, life lives off of life and almost nothing in nature goes to waste. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_fall" target="_blank">Whale fall</a> is a good example and indicator of the bio process of nutrient transfer in the deep oceans. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
