		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This answers are all really looking at this from the wrong perspective, and assuming the US is using <em>exclusively</em> digital methods and network analysis. That's almost certainly not the case. </p>
<p>The US has observed Russian interference before. In eastern Europe, as well as the United States. They've become familiar with some of the tools which Russia has used. So when these tools appear in DNC/RNC networks, that's a telling sign. </p>
<p>The US, and it's NATO allies, also likely have HUMINT (Traditional Spies) in Russia's intelligence services. It's possible these sources reported details confirming Russia had intent to attack US assets. </p>
<p>It's possible (very likely) the US had hacked into Russia servers to gain access to the same info HUMINT might have gathered. </p>
<p>It's possible the US is constantly analyzing traffic which they believe to originate from Russia services. When they observed outgoing/in-going traffic from these sources to the DNC/RNC, that would confirm it. It's fairly common practice for them to knowingly let the attack continue for some time while they're monitoring it, either to identify tactics, or to intentionally feed false information. </p>
<p>It's possible the DNC/RNC hack involved not only Cyber, but HUMINT assets from Russia. The DNC reported to the FBI they believed their HQ was bugged. That would require a person physically entering the facility. If the FBI/CIA could identify this person, it's possible they could find evidence they communicated with Russia in some way. </p>
<hr />
<p>There's a lot of ways the US government might have reached this conclusion that a IP spoof wouldn't protect. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Not an expert</em></p>
<p>I have a buddy who works in this field and I'll explain to you the same way I was told, as a layman. </p>
<p>Regardless of what we think of IP, sometimes physical location can be determined, not to say that means it is a government, just a location.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The keyset (the actual keyboard and it's design) are sometimes unique to a country or language. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code written is often recycled by the same people or changes in other peoples code can be analyzed by professionals to determine they type of actor and level of skill the actor has who wrote/changed it. </p>
</li>
<li>Sources and methods, usually meaning human intelligence or signals intelligence gathered and interpreted. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there's this guy Russel, he has a lot of enemies. He hates Barry and all of Barry's friends, he's paranoid that his wife might be cheating on him, and he hates his neighbor who used to let him use his <del>crimean naval base</del> swimming pool all the time but won't let him anymore. </p>
<p>Barry gets a letter that looks like it comes from GoodLock, the company that provides the security system for his house telling him to reset his password and send them the new one. The return address looks like it is for GoodLock, but it's actually for a PO box with a very similar address (not a perfect analogy). After talking to his mailman Barry concludes the letter is legitimate and sends the mail with his new password to what he thinks is the real GoodLock.</p>
<p>A few weeks later Barry comes back to find that his house has been robbed! He doesn't know who did it, but he talks to the police and they figure out that since the thief knew the password it must have had something to do with the GoodLock mail. They check out the PO Box (Irl the bitly account) that was used to send the fake letter to Barry, and find that it was also used to send similar letters to Bary's friends, Russel's wife, and Russel's neighbor who he hates. Doing a thorough sweep of Barry's house and some of his friend's houses they find custom listening devices that have been left in the houses of other people Russel didn't like. </p>
<p>Now the police may or may not be able to directly link the PO box to Russel, and if they could it would be using methods that they can't tell Barry about. But they tell Barry that while it's theoretically possible that there is someone else out there who desperately wants to spy on Barry, Russel's wife, and Russel's neighbor, they are confident that it was Russel. </p>
<p>In Non ELI5: The publically available evidence is not able to link the hack to a specific place or set of individuals, but it is able to identify a set of methods and tools (malware, a bitly account, reused SSL certificates, and an IP address) that have consistently been used in alignment with Russia's strategic interests in the past, and show that those methods were used to hack the DNC. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So many people in this thread asserting it's simply impossible.</p>
<p>It would be impossible for your &quot;regular expert&quot; network technician having access to regular tools.</p>
<p>But you're talking about the NSA. This is an organization who hacked and listened into the phone calls of numerous world leaders.</p>
<p>If you think the NSA aren't counter-hacking the hackers to find out who they are and to watch what they are doing, then you're being a bit blind.</p>
<p>Using regular technology and tools, it's basically impossible to catch a random attacker. But saying it's impossible for the NSA to track down the hackers assumes the NSA isn't already monitoring them to some degree.</p>
<p>It's definitely not tin-foil hat theories to state that the NSA has compromised a lot of network infrastructure and you can bet your last dollar that they know who the best hackers are in Russia and are actively working to monitor what those people are doing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
