		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’re kinda looking at it the wrong way. </p>
<p>Bain caused TRU to take out a ton of debt because their investment strategy was to use leverage to maximize returns. </p>
<p>As an example, you might invest $100 in a company three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy a company for $100. (Zero leverage.)</li>
<li>Buy a company for $200, paying $100 of your own money and borrowing $100. (1x leverage.)</li>
<li>Buy a $1000 company, paying $100 of your own money and borrowing $900. (9x leverage.)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you run the company and it does well, and you turn around and sell that company for double what you paid for it, your profit is as follows under the three scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>$100 profit. </li>
<li>$200 profit. </li>
<li>$1,000 profit. </li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, leverage can be an incredibly profitable investment strategy. Of course, there’s a downside as well. If your investment doesn’t do so well, and declines 50% in value, your losses are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>$50 loss. </li>
<li>$100 loss. (You lost you entire investment.)</li>
<li>$500 loss. (You lost your investment, and still owe the lender $400.)</li>
</ol>
<p>So leverage cuts both ways: It can multiply your profits, but also multiply your losses. </p>
<p>But in the late 80’s, the “corporate raiders” of the finance world popularized a scheme trust allowed them to realize all of the upside of a leveraged investment, with almost none of the downside:  The leveraged buy-out (“LBO”).</p>
<p>In an LBO, the private equity firm doesn’t borrow the money to make the acquisition directly. Instead, it has the target company borrow the money used to pay out the sellers. (This seems kinda weird when you think about it, because it’s really a two-step transaction that happens simultaneously:  (1) Buyer agrees to pay seller X% of the purchase in cash, and the rest in the form of the right to receive money from a loan secured solely by the assets of the company, and (2) the loan is made, and the proceeds are paid to the seller.)</p>
<p>So, going back to the third scenario, using an LBO structure your potential results look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You sell the company for double, and you make $1,900 profit. </li>
<li>You sell the company for half, and you lose $100 and nothing more. </li>
</ul>
<p>Wow! The perfect crime, right?</p>
<p>Well, not exactly. </p>
<p>The banks aren’t stupid (usually).  So they’re going to do  two things to protect their investment:  (1) They’re going to charge more interest when you use more leverage to buy the company, because they understand the kind of stress that puts the company in and they want to be compensated for that risk. (2) They are going to make sure that the buyer invests enough of its own money that it has some skin in the game. They aren’t going to make a loan where the people buying and running the company have nothing to lose and everything to gain. They want to make sure that the buyers are going to lose a substantial amount of their own money if things go south.  </p>
<p>So that’s the basic set-up with this kind of deal.  Bain bought TRU and saddled it with debt because it wanted to use leverage to maximize gain on its investment while leaving most of the downside risk in the TRU business itself.  And as we discussed, Bain likely lost a significant amount of its own money in the investment. </p>
<p>But that brings us to another wrinkle:  What do we mean when we talk about Bain’s “own money?”</p>
<p>Well Bain is a private equity firm, which means it makes investments by buying, rehabilitating, and selling mature businesses. For the most part, Bain doesn’t invest its own money. Instead, it makes its investments using other people’s money.  So how does Bain actually make money?</p>
<ol>
<li>Bain will charge an annual management fee of ~1% of invested capital.  So if Bain runs a fund focusing on European tech companies, and that fund has made $1B of investments, it will charge the fund $10m per year for its management services.  While this sounds like a lot, this fee is meant to be “to keep the light on” and otherwise reimburse Bain for its expenses in exploring investment opportunities and doing planning and otherwise paying salaries. (This is the aspect that most people are talking about in this thread.)</li>
<li>The people who give Bain their money to invest are known as the limited partners, or “LPs.”  Bain is the general partner, or “GP.”  The LPs are guaranteed a certain return on their money, say 8%. So they have to receive an 8% annual return on their investment before anyone else gets money.  However, once they get that 8%, profits become split 80% to the LPs and 20% to the GP. </li>
<li>Because Bain is getting paid a management fee to cover its basic operating expenses, it seems like they’re in a WIN-win situation. If they make a good deal, they make a shit ton of money. If the deal goes south, the LPs lose their shirts but Bain still received money needed to pay its bills and people. So their might be a temptation for Bain to invest recklessly. So the LPs generally require the the GP contribute a certain amount of its own money as an LP interest.  So when a deal goes well, they make money from that investment.  </li>
</ol>
<p>So let’s put this all together:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Bain goes out and gets a bunch of people to give them $980m to invest, and charges them $9.8m per year to do so. </li>
<li>Bain puts in $20m of its own money. </li>
<li>Bain goes out and indemnified a good investment target that it thinks it can buy for $2B. </li>
<li>Bain finds a bank willing to finance half of the acquisition by loaning the target company $1B to pay to the current owners. </li>
<li>Bain pays $2B for the company, using the capital that it’s investing on behalf of its investors and the proceeds of the bank loan. </li>
<li>Three years later, Bain sells the company for $3B, distributed as such:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Bank gets paid off its $1B, plus $300m of accrued interest at 10% per year for three years. </li>
<li>the LPs (including Bain’s LP investment) get all of their $1B back, plus $240m of preferred return. The remaining $460m gets distributed 20% to Bain and 80% to the LPs. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, Bain invested $20m of its own money, and received a $4.8m return on its LP investment, and another $96m in carried interest.  </p>
<p>So, essentially, Bain leveraged the money of its investors and bank loans of the target company to increase the value of the company’s business by 50%, But in doing so took its own $20m investment and realized a $100m in profits. </p>
<p>Not bad work, if you can get it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two main types of bankruptcy, a liquidation (Chapter 7) and a restructuring (Chapter 11/13). Most businesses and business owners do a restructuring. What this does is allows you to keep your store assets but create one manageable payment.</p>
<p>True ELI5: Say you borrow money from both mom and dad to open a lemonade stand and you owe each of them $5/day. If you are making $9/day at the stand, you are going under. A bankruptcy would force mom and dad to accept $4/day each so you can at least have some money to reinvest in the company. The downside is mom and dad have to agree. Otherwise, mom and dad might force you to sell the stand and give the money to them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You have to pay people to do work. Companies which are in trouble are harder to run than those which are doing well, and having good talent in control can mean the difference between success or failure. The good talent also gets to pick where they work and if their pay is only based on success then why would they be willing to work on the really tough cases?</p>
<p>This is why it is common for high level executives to get something called a &quot;golden parachute&quot;. Basically they get an incentive to succeed but even if they fail they get well paid, because otherwise they would be working somewhere they are sure they would succeed and get bonuses.</p>
<p>Sometimes getting good talent makes the difference and the companies turn around. You don't really hear much about that. Sometimes the good talent cannot turn the company around, or maybe even the talent screws up in their efforts. Those you hear about and it is often difficult to tell which took place. It can be contrary to our general sense of justice that a CEO of a failing company can walk away with $30 million in pay but it is the same idea as if a minimum wage employee shows up to work and the store doesn't sell anything they still get their wages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like almost everyone here actually don’t really know about corporate bankruptcies. First of all, an executive doesn’t want the company to go bankrupt. Executives usually have stock compensation and stock ownership of their companies, and in a restructuring / bankruptcy, their equity is 90% of the time wiped out, not to mention they can easily get replaced / kicked out. </p>
<p>If a company were to emerge from bankruptcy, then it would come out with less debt, meaning less interest paymets to make, but often times the business is winding down or severely affected. They can still become successful and executives get Management Incentive Plan that allows for usually 10% of the stock ownership of the company, but that never is enough to warrant a bankruptcy. </p>
<p>No executive already a part of the company and has been running the company for a while would want a bankruptcy. That would be foolish. Now there are ways to profit off of a struggling company at the expense of the creditors and the company as an executive, but that doesn’t mean that the executives want bankruptcy. Also on a side note, in a bankruptcy, a lot of decisions have to go through the court and need the creditors’ consent. No executive wants them on their ass for 6+ months or however long the process lasts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
