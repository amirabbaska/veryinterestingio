		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a rule of thumb, if it bleeds, then it can heal to some degree. Also, tissues in the body generally heal using the same four steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hemostasis. It is bleeding and the body sends stuff to stop the bleeding.</li>
<li>Inflammation. The body is in alert mode and sends stuff to the injury that will stop infection, clean up junk in the injured area, and generally kickstart the healing process. Without this stage, healing doesn't happen, so in the short term inflammation is a good thing.</li>
<li>Proliferation. Basically the stage when the body lays down the raw materials for the injured area to heal. Lots of collagen gets layed down here. If you snip a rubber band partially and keep pulling on it, it will continue to tear. If you somehow connect the torn edges, the tearing stops because the force on the uninjured tissue is reduced. Similar to what is going on here. </li>
<li>Maturation. This is the fine tuning stage. Cells that don't need to be there anymore go away or die. The collagen gets stronger by getting aligned with the lines of tension. </li>
</ol>
<p>Bones heal as strong as they were before the injury because your body lays down new bone. However, it can take a long time for bones to get back to full strength because of the structure of the newly laid bone. Your body is always breaking down bone and building it up to some extent, so it takes time for it to remodel into the strongest structure. Remember though, if it doesn't bleed it usually doesn't heal well, so there are some commonly fractured bones that don't heal well and often require surgical intervention.</p>
<p>Ligaments usually don't have good blood supply, so they don't heal particularly well.</p>
<p>Muscle has very good blood supply, so it bleeds when injured (this is why you often see bruising after significant strains). However, your body doesn't lay down new muscle tissue where the injury occurred. Instead, it lays down collagen in a fairly unorganized way. So at first during healing, the healing tissue is still very weak. As time passes, the new collagen changes into a more organized structure that aligns better with the line of pull of the muscle. When it is aligned better, it is stronger. Previously injured muscle won't be as strong as uninjured muscle (all other factors being kept the same)</p>
<p>Tendon is similar to muscle, except a bit less blood supply. All of the same mechanisms of healing apply still. Injured tendon will also not be able to take as much load as uninjured tendon (all other factors being kept the same)</p>
<p>Skin follows the rules as well. Generally it won't be as strong as before either. </p>
<p>Now, when we talk about &quot;strength&quot; I'm not talking about how much weight it can move. I am talking about how much load it can take. Muscles, tendons, and ligaments generally are injured through high tensile loading (like pulling a rubber band apart). So when I say they aren't as strong as before I mean they can't be pulled on as hard as before or they will reinjure. It is still possible for someone with an injured muscle or tendon to physically be able to move more weight than before their injury because they can continue to train the healthy tissue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bones form callus which is thicker and stronger. Soft tissue heals with scar tissue which is weaker and less flexible. The answer above goes into detail and research has shown that 75% is about as good as it gets after soft tissue injury. So, for all of you who have been in a motor vehicle accident and didn't do therapy afterwards, the soft tissue strength can be as low as 50% of its original value. Once it's injured, it is far more likely to be reinjured in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>So there are two different principles at work here.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When you use a muscle or a bone you are using actin-myosin proteins which help with the strength of a muscle contraction. When you use them however you &quot;break them&quot; and your body recruits builds new ones. It will build them such that they won't &quot;break&quot; under the same amount of force the next time you use them. That's what is meant by &quot;tearing/breaking&quot; your muscles during usage. There is no actual tissue tearing.</p>
</li>
<li>When you have tissue damage in skeletal muscle and connective tissue there is actual tissue damage. Skeletal muscle are actually cells so I'll talk about them (since connective tissue isn't actually majorly comprised of cells). Skeletal muscle is known as a &quot;permanent&quot; tissue, so it can't regenerate, i.e the cells cant replacement themselves back to their normal levels. Instead your body &quot;repairs&quot; them by putting in new fibrous scar tissue. Which isn't as strong as the old muscle and doesn't have the same contraction ability.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope that helps, I know this is ELI5 and this is the best I could do without going into more detail. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we put this all into the context of pathological damage, muscle tearing (aka muscle strains), are actually detrimental to muscle function over time. Whereas bone breaks are repaired using the same materials they are originally made of (the organization of mineral deposits, calcium, phosphorus ect.), they get stronger due to the bone callus that forms over a typical fracture. When we injure muscle, tendon, or ligament, you are repairing that damaged tissue with a lesser material, scar tissue. Scar tissue is weaker than the tissues it is meant to repair, because of their different organization of tensile fibers. A muscle full of scar tissue has reduced function, whereas resistance training does not cause scar tissue accumulation, to a similar degree as muscle strains. Same rule applies to tendons and ligaments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
