When you use a sponge, they are wet and soft. After that first use however, they will dry out and harden. What exactly is happening with that? Are the sponges treated with something that keeps them soft before the first use?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main reason for the effect you see is that common synthetic sponges made of cellulose are often treated with softening agents during their manufacturing. For example, take a look at <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US3284229" target="_blank">this patent</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sponge is washed with water [...] <strong>then immersed for 10 minutes in an impregnating composititon containing softener</strong> and hydrogen peroxide at a temperature of 55 C. The impregnating composition, which is freshly made and substantially colorless, consists of 6.25 parts of hydroxypropyl sorbitol, 10.50 parts of diethylene glycol, 6.75 parts of urea, 0.25 part of dihydroabietyl amine, [...]</p>
<p>Substantially all of the water and residual hydrogen peroxide is removed from the sponge by passing it through a heat zone having an ambient temperature of C. The sponge is then cut into pieces of suitable dimensions for use by the householder or other consumer.  The sponge material produced in this example has a uniformly brilliant yellow color throughout its structure. It also has good softness and compressibility, and normal durability. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of this treatment step, the sponges tend to be quite soft and flexible as you take them out of the packaging. However, once you start using the sponge, the initial effect of the treatment can go away as the softening agents get flushed out. As a result, the next time the sponge dries up, it can be very rough just as you describe. </p>
<p>The explanation for the latter effect is that these sponges are made up of a messy forest of cellulose fibers, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Yp1qM24.jpg" target="_blank">as shown here</a>. When water gets into this cellulose network, it allows the fibers to rearrange in order to try to minimize their energy. These structural changes will continue as the water is evaporating. The net effect is that as the sponge dries up, its surface can be much rougher and coarser. This effect is similar to how paper can be very smooth soft when you take it out of the box, but if you drop water on it, it will become wrinkly and rougher as it dries up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a handful of technologies used in making sponges - the ones that get all crinkly after the first use are typically cellulose sponges.  Cellulose is an organic polymer that can only be found in plant-based materials and does not take well to being anything other than a plant, but after treating it with it some nasty chemicals like carbon disulfide and a crap ton of sodium hydroxide, you can depolymerize it to a certain degree and cause it to re-link with other chains forming viscose - which is the predecessor of things like rayon and the binder for cellulose sponges.  This viscose interacts with other cotton fibers (frequently the byproducts of other textile processes) and forms a cohesive mesh that you know as a kitchen sponge.</p>
<p>Now - to get more to your question - have you ever line-dried your clothes (in the open air)?  You'll notice that your clothes get all stiff and crusty, and may shink slightly while drying.  This is what's happening in a sponge.  The cotton fibers are losing their plasticity via dehydration because the polymers don't have the water molecules separating the fibers and keeping everything lubricated.</p>
<p>To prevent this, plasticizers are added during manufacturing - such as what /u/crnaruka mentioned.  Except the glycol solutions tend to be more common in sponges produced Europe and Asia.  Many US-made sponges are treated with magnesium compounds that actually gets absorbed into the cellulose and act as a humectant.  The glycol solutions act as the plasticizer directly.</p>
<p>Random note about magnesium plasticizers - you'll notice that some sponges advertise that you can microwave sponges to sterilize them, but only after rinsing them.  This is because the magnesium conducts microwaves and can ruin your microwave - similar to trying to microwave aluminum.</p>
<p>Credentials: I used to work at a manufacturing facility making sponges, so take that for it's worth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Apparently, it's only the cellulose sponges that dry out and shrink when left dry - which kind of makes sense, wood has similar properties when soaked vs dry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
