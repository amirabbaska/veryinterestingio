		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What tends to be the case for this sort of thing is that eventually someone will prove something in an way that makes sense for mathematicians at the time. Then as time goes on someone will discover an alternative proof for the same problem, but using new mathematical machinery, it's also often the case that this newer machinery is somewhat more abstract and wouldn't have been available or even make intuitive sense to the previous generation of mathematicians.  </p>
<p>My favorite example of this is the proof that there are infinite primes. Euclid proved this using geometric notions and it takes a good bit of effort to set up and justify the proof. However using more &quot;modern&quot; techniques, like the definition of factors and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, we can work out a proof without much problem, thus increasing the level of &quot;elegance&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a proof but related: Heisenberg's first mathematical description of quantum mechanics used matrix mechanics. Then Schroedinger was able to show equivalency with a wave based mathematical approach. One is not necessarily superior, but these days the wave approach is more widely taught and used.</p>
<p>It's actually more interesting than that though. The mathematical approaches also reflected different, more philosophical, views on the nature of quantum mechanics and of the math itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
