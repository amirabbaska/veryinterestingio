		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>How?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Musk talks about there being 2 layers to the human mind at the moment, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system#Function" target="_blank">limbic system</a> (dealing with emotions, spatial awareness, regulating bodily functions etc), and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex#Function" target="_blank">prefrontal cortex</a> (dealing with abstract thoughts and decision making).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He suggests a 3rd layer, plugged directly into your cortical neurons, to allow faster information transfer between your thoughts and the technology you use.</p>
</li>
<li>This doesn't necessarily require major brain surgery with your skull being sawed open. Musk suggests that, since neurons require a lot of blood flow, they are all connected to blood vessels which are in turn branching out from the blood vessels running through your neck. So in principle, a small procedure entering the jugular could open a highway to all your cortical neurons. There's not much detail beyond this in terms of how the link would actually be implemented.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Musk says we already have access to a huge amount of information and abilities via the internet, but we're limited on bandwidth, especially our output speed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can take in text/images/video with our eyes relatively quickly, but our ability to output data is severely limited to the speed at which we can type or click using our fingers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A 3rd technological layer above the cortex which can communicate directly with a computer would allow us to greatly increase the connection speed between our thoughts and technology.</p>
</li>
<li>Musk says this will greatly improve humans' ability to think and communicate, and allow us to keep up better with AI in the future. Without such a neural interface, we will inevitably become so inferior to AI that we'll be basically a &quot;pet&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrGPuUQsDjo" target="_blank">Here</a>'s a brief section of an interview where he talks about all these points.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, I'd say don't think about practical applications now, think about what the world might be like in 20 or 50 years, and what the practical applications will be like <em>then</em>.</p>
<p>With the <a href="http://www.definitionmining.com/2017/02/post-scarcity.html" target="_blank">inevitable march of technological progress</a> eventually almost everything a human can do that's 'productive' is going to be automated. Our machines will do these jobs faster and better than we can, and for a lot of people who have spent their entire lives thinking of their job as a key part of their identity, that can be very scary. So, there's two ways we can approach this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;jobs are important&quot; way - Humans interacting with technology through things like typing or talking is incredibly slow, if we want to be able to &quot;compete&quot; with AI we're going to have to be able to interact a lot faster than that. If we can there's even a chance that human intelligence and machine intelligence will compliment each other and we can work together.</li>
<li>The &quot;jobs aren't important&quot; way - Think of yourself not as your body, and not even as your brain (which uses a lot of capacity just to move your body around and keep it alive), <a href="http://www.definitionmining.com/2017/01/probable-facts-about-human-consciousness.html" target="_blank">but as your conscious mind</a>. The world that we've evolved in and built for ourselves is great for the bodies we have, but we're also building entirely digital worlds where our biological bodies don't really fit in, but our conscious selves might fit right in. We just need to make that connection be our &quot;true selves&quot; and this new world we're building without letting all the slow messy bits of our body get in the way.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>imagine how smart you could be if you never forgot anything you ever read, or could have the internet, in your head. </p>
<p>imagine direct interfaces with combat systems. no more complicated cockpits, allowing for better control over aircraft in combat. no more terrorists taking over planes, as only the captains can engage neuralink.</p>
<p>cars. surgery in hospitals. ranged neuralink for performing tasks at home with an interfaced robot while you are at work.</p>
<p>the possibility's are endless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>how, who knows.
why? because its worth it.
with a neural lace people could in theory become smarter and smarter people can solve more complex problems like global warming, healthcare/science issues, space exploration etc etc .</p>
<p>also solves the problem of what happens to us once the AI gets here, instead of conquering us, or going to war we just assimilate.assimilate.assimilate.assimilate.assimilate</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
