		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lobbying in its current state evolved from a more acceptable practice of simply getting advice from people knowledgable in a given field.</p>
<p>For example: If you are trying to enact reform on law enforcement, a congressman who has little interaction with the police would have a hard time drafting legislation to address any of the prevalent problems. Therefore lobbyists would come to the Congressman to give their perspective. </p>
<p>Activists from groups such as the NAACP or ACLU might give their opinion on the problems with how law enforcement currently affects people negatively, so he would know what problems need to be fixed. Representatives from the police union might give their opinion on the reasons officers act with the protocols they use. The congressman needs this kind of information to do their job effectively.</p>
<p>The reason lobbying in it's current form is often thought of as pseudo-corruption is that the theoretical lobbying described above requires access to politicians and open communication. This is also more or less a given due to constitutional freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is somewhat of a necessity to have an organized media campaign and infrastructure if you want to run for office on a large scale, such as when running for a congressional district that expands far beyond your own city. As a result, most politicians need to spend money to campaign, and the law thus allows people to donate to politicians.</p>
<p>While this may seem like it invites corruption, consider the alternative: The law cannot restrict an individual from spending their OWN money on a television ad to promote themself, due to freedom of speech. So if there was no mechanism for politicians to raise money, almost all large scale political campaigns would be inaccessible to anyone who was not privately wealthy or famous. Allowing fundraising makes it theoretically possible for anyone to run an effective campaign so long as they have supporters.</p>
<p>The result of these two things:  The open access of politicians to lobbyists as a necessity of the job, and the legality of fundraising as a necessity of campaigning, means that anyone can make their wishes known to politicians and can donate money to them if that politician ends up doing what they wish.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, there is a simple way to avoid corruption in the legally culpable sense: If you do not make an explicit or legally binding promise of payment as a result of a specific action on the politician's part, it is not a bribe. You are simply exercising your legal right to talk to your local government representative, and your legal right to donate money to that candidate.</p>
<p>The loophole comes from the fact that even if your candidate fulfils their promise, there is no guarantee that you will actually pay them, despite your informal promise. Or inversely, if you donate to a candidate there is no guarantee that they will take the actions you desire. Without such a direct provable cause/effect, you can't definitively prove corruption.</p>
<p>EDIT: To address the common responses in the comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I am not trying to advocate or condemn the current system. The question asked why lobbying isn't legally corruption, so I explained what the current system is and the reasoning for how it resulted, and did so in a neutral tone, but I don't make any claim as to whether this is a good or bad system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many bring up Publicly Funded Elections, where the government gives all candidates money to run. This already exists, to a degree. For example, any political party which achieves a certain threshold in a presidential election gets federal funding in the next cycle. The reason that this alone can't solve the problem is that the Constitution can't stop an individual from campaigning on their own money, so even with public funding a wealthy person is very advantages over a poor person.</p>
</li>
<li>As for WHY we can't block individual spending on a campaign, this was the interpretation of the supreme Court on the case of &quot;Buckley v Valeo&quot;. Due to the wording of our constitution, such a law would be invalid here, Despite it being legal in some other countries. Obviously the Constitution can potentially be amended, but that's a broader conversation than I am focusing on with this comment.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Why is lobbyism normal in the US?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, you need to ask, what is lobbying?</p>
<p>The 1st Amendment to the Constitution of the US says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and <strong>to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, we all have the right to go into our local politician's office and be heard. If I want to go to the office of my House Rep, he has to hear what I have to say. It's my right to <em>petition</em>. Same goes for my city councilmember, mayor, State Rep, Governor, Senator, and even the President. They all have to hear what US citizens have to say.</p>
<p>Now, as an example, let's say you want to see a Congressman. There are 435 Congressional Districts in the US, each representing populations of 711,000 people. Imagine the queue you'd have to make if everyone in the district wanted to <em>redress grievances</em> with their Congressman!</p>
<p>So, to make things more efficient, people created companies that, when hired, would petition your politicians for you. This is called lobbying. This is why lobbying is legal, and population (and geographical) sizes is why it's normal. It's very hard for an American in Hawaii to visit their Representative in Washington. And it's very hard for 711,000 people to be heard all at the same time. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's the difference between lobbying and corruption?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lobbying is associated with corruption because special interest groups would donate money to politicians who are open to their ideas. For example, let's say Congressman A is in favor of the oil industry, the oil industry lobbyists would be more willing to donate money to Congressman A's re-election campaign. In contrast, the solar industry lobby would not only abstain from donating to Congressman A's campaign, but they'd be more willing to donate to Congressman B's campaign, because Congressman B is a proponent of solar power as an alternative to oil!</p>
<p>This looks like corruption because it appears that money is being exchanged for votes. But, can we prove that's the case? Or is it the case that these Congressmen already agreed with a particular position, and lobbyists are simply endorsing these candidates because they agree?</p>
<p>The law makes a very clear distinction: if money is given in exchange for votes, then it's corruption. So, if you say to a candidate &quot;Vote for this bill and I'll give $500K&quot;, that's corruption; it's a bribe.</p>
<p>However, if the lobbyists says, &quot;Remember that bill we talked about the other day? I saw you voted the way we like. It is clear that your worldview and ours are compatible, and since we like you so much, here's $500 for your campaign&quot;, then that's not corruption. It is perfectly legal.</p>
<p>It's a fine line, to be sure, but the law has drawn the line there, and in that fashion. Right to petition is an important right for any free society to have. </p>
<p>In the United States, congressmen have been investigated and arrested for bribery. In other words, the US <em>does</em> prosecute outright bribery. So lobbyists and politicians need to be very careful to not cross the line. The good news is that the line exists. The bad news is that many people disagree about where the line is currently drawn, and believe it should be drawn elsewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that Lobbying is just talking to your representative, and you can be representing a group of people when you do it.  You're informing a politician of your group's wants and needs.  That's it.  There doesn't need to be money involved.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the US Supreme Court determined that restricting money = restricting speech (this is colloquially known as Citizens United if you want to see more info).</p>
<p>Now, you still can't put money directly into these politicians' hands.  But you can give it to a group that supports them (A Super PAC, which they can <em>almost</em> do whatever they want with the money.  It's very flimsy, as far as regulations go).</p>
<p>The practice of lobbying by itself isn't corrupt, but because money = speech in the eyes of the law, that allows for corruption to happen legally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What's so bizarre to me about most of the responses in this thread, is that 'in the US' has been consistently interpreted to contextualize intra-US politics. To be more specific, I was surprised that comparisons are not being made to other countries ie 'what does lobbying look like outside the US?'</p>
<p>This is a fundamental question to ask, because many Americans don't realize that many countries around the world do not distinguish between lobbying and bribery. In fact, when US media outlets talk about bribery happening in other countries, the legalistic offenses often relate specifically to &quot;lobbying&quot; efforts. Read more cynically, the reason the US political system is thought not to have endemic corruption is because we have redefined what it means to be corrupt - not because we have uprooted corruption itself.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> In many other countries, lobbying <em>is considered the same thing as</em> bribery.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> A lot of replies appear to confound free speech and lobbying. There's a difference. I'm not trying to argue that actual free speech directed at politicians is necessarily lobbying. Ironically, this thread demonstrates why we have such issues in the first place around bribery. The courts in the US have exploited this to manipulate the definition of lobbying, political donations, etc (this is why we can't just say 'lobbying' in the US is the same thing as 'lobbying' in other countries). Funny how there was a Chomsky thread that hit the front page on the same day. <em>Actually, /u/BrotherPazzo explained this point much more concisely, so go check out his comment!</em></p>
<p>Also, most responses have referred to western democracies in their rebuttals - but see that's exactly my point. While there are western democracies that criminalize the equivalent of lobbying in the US, there are a great many countries (democratic ones!) outside the west that do the same. Apparently, we're not supposed to take their laws seriously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an Italian lawyer, i can tell you that in the vast majority of cases it would be considered corruption in here. The objection is &quot;but it's not guaranteed the politician will actually do x&quot; would just make it attempted corruption (still a crime).</p>
<p>I'll give you an example.
Say a local group has an interest in the local administration to green light a project, something like modernizing a harbor, because they'll profit from it (construction companies, unions). They make sizeable above the board perfectly legal donations to candidates, that need that money to run for office in that administration. That's lobbying in the US and textbook corruption in Italy.</p>
<p>You can try to rationalize it all you want, but the simple truth is that politician in the US need money to run for office, this is provided by donations. Now why would that person/ group donate again if the promises made don't get fullfilled. So you have a politician that needs to fullfill, or at the very least do his best to fullfill, the promises made to the donor, and the only difference with corruption is that you have a legalized system in place and a different name for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
