The summary is that pupil shape has a lot to do with your position in the food web as a predator or prey, and the mode of hunting a species employs.</p>
<p>From the article: If you have a vertical slit, you're very likely to be an ambush predator, says Banks. That's the kind of animal who lies in wait and then leaps out to kill. He says these predators need to accurately judge the distance to their prey, and the vertical slit has optical features that make it ideal for that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>In almost all vertebrates, the pupil is large and round in low light, but constricts as light levels rise. Although the constricted pupil is round in most species, in some animals it can be a vertical or horizontal slit, or even, as in some geckos, composed of several tiny pinholes. The cuttlefish has perhaps the most exotic pupil shape: it becomes a W in bright light.  </p>
<p>In low light, the primary requirement is to be able to see anything at all. This entails the eye gathering as many photons as possible, which requires a large pupil. However, there is a disadvantage to this, namely reduced image quality. The main reason is that when the pupil is at its widest, the entire lens – lying behind the pupil – is being used to form the image. Light going through the edges of the lens ends up being focused more than light going through the centre, an effect known as spherical aberration. The upshot is that not all of the rays are focused at the same point, resulting in a blurry image. In low light, however, this is a price worth paying.  </p>
<p>At high light levels, the pupil constricts to ensure only a small part of the lens is used, resulting in better image quality. In humans and other animals with round pupils, a sphincter muscle at the tip of the iris constricts to form the pupil. The disadvantage of a circular muscle is that the pupil cannot be closed down beyond a certain size.  </p>
<p>In animals with a slit pupil, the corresponding muscle runs along either side of the slit. Consequently, although the constricted human pupil and the dilated pupil differ in area by a factor of about 16, a cat’s pupil changes by a factor of at least 135 and the pupil area can approach zero in bright light.  </p>
<p>Slit pupils are widespread in nocturnal animals whose retinas are adapted for low light and might be damaged in bright conditions.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The slit for domestic cats is a trait needed to track their prey. They are able to identify side to side motions which is largely what rodents do when running. Hence why when you play with your cat and shuffle your hand / a toy side to side they are a lot quicker to pounce than if you go up and down. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
