		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The perceived taste of a substance is due to the brain's interpretation of signals from taste receptors on the tongue. In order to trigger these receptors, a substance (usually) must bind properly to or pass through a protein receptor/channel on its surface. The <em>salty</em> taste is the simplest mechanism: Na^+ ions directly enter the cell and depolarize it (change its charge, causing an action potential/nerve signal to be sent to the brain).</p>
<p>So, metal salts consisting of other positive ions that can trick the channel into thinking they're sodium should also depolarize it, which the brain will interpret as <em>salty</em>. These would be the others in the same column, the alkali metals, which will be similar in size and their +1 charge in solution. But, since the ions will be somewhat different in size, they won't pass through the channel as easily/often, which means the ions will taste less <em>salty</em>. LiCl and KCl will be saltier, while RbCl and CsCl will be less so because of their larger sizes.</p>
<p>If you change out the anion in the salt (Cl^- ), there is less effect. Sodium bromide (NaBr) will taste salty. But you get more complicated effects if you start changing both ions: KBr changes taste with concentration due to differing sensitivities of receptors for the two ions, the weaker saltiness of K^+ not always overpowering. Anything that produces H^+ ions, (i.e. an acid compound) is also going to taste sour, as that ion is the trigger for <em>sour</em>. Pick something with wild organic groups like Pb(CH3COO)2, and it could even taste sweet.</p>
<p>Edit: K^- to K^+</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Northern Europe, a candy called salmiak  is popular. It's licorice that has ammonium chloride in it/on it. Salmiak is an old name for ammonium chloride. </p>
<p>Salmiak tastes salty in a way that is both familiar and unfamiliar. The flavor is sort of briney the way you would expect with sodium chloride, but it also kind of numbs/tingles your tongue. Also it makes your breath smell a bit like ammonia. </p>
<p>It's very much an acquired taste. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>TL:DR Yes they do taste salty, but to lesser degrees.  KCl is a salt substitute for people on low sodium diets.  As the anion gets heavier (NaBr, NaI) they begin to loose their salty flavor.  Lithium salts don't taste super salty but still dehydrate you like other salts.</p>
<p>So yes, they are all still salty(ish) buy NaCl is the saltiest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, not all salts taste salty. </p>
<p>Saltiness is ultimately a product of epithelial sodium channels on taste receptor cells. Other alkali metals (lithium, potassium, cesium and rubidium) are able to enter the cell through these channels, though less efficiently, and are therefore perceived as tasting salty. Potassium then lithium pass through these channels most readily, so their flavor is most comparable to sodium; cesium and rubidium pass through them much less efficiently and instead have a mostly bitter taste. Francium is radioactive and probably not ideal for taste testing.</p>
<p>If you've ever tasted a piece of chalk or Tums antacid, you know that calcium carbonate does not taste salty at all (presumably, this is at least partially due to its low solubility). More water-soluble calcium salts have a range of flavors: calcium chloride tastes mostly bitter but somewhat salty; while calcium citrate, calcium lactate and calcium gluconate have neutral flavors.</p>
<p>Most edible salts have a neutral, salty or bitter taste, but there are also salts that taste sweet (lead diacetate), sour (potassium bitartrate / cream of tartar) and even savory/umami (monosodium glutamate / MSG).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1fgact/do_all_salts_taste_salty_or_just_nacl/" target="_blank">Here</a>'s a thread from 2 years ago asking the same question (I wish I had thought to search for one before I went to the trouble of looking all this up, but on well).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
