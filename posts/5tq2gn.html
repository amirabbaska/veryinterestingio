		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's an awesome question, but unfortunately it doesn't have a clear answer, as there are so many variables that can change the response.</p>
<p>There are 2 components to your immune system: the innate and adaptive. The innate just travels around and freaks out at everything it doesn't recognize. It doesn't matter if it's the common cold or anthrax. (slight exaggeration, since it does matter if it's bacterial or viral). It's going to react the same way. These are responsible for fever, phlegm, swelling, etc.  These happen within hours of being infected. The end goal here isn't to kill the infection. It's to fight until your adaptive cells can bring reinforcements.</p>
<p>You also have an adaptive immune system. These are (primarily) your T and B cells, which take time. They have to 'study' the infection, find a good way to kill it, and then mass produce the antibodies. This can take anywhere from hours (if you've already made antibodies) or days-weeks (if it's something brand new).</p>
<p>Let's say you get an infection that you've seen before. Your innate system attacks right away, and you start to notice those general signs of being sick. But then, your pre-formed antibodies quickly kill it. </p>
<p>Or maybe it's a brand new infection, but for some reason, they don't trigger your innate system as strongly as hers. Therefore, you only get mild symptoms until your adaptive* system kills it. It's also possible that your innate response being smaller actually lets the infection grow, causing you to be sick for a longer period of time</p>
<p>At the end of the day, you can't really say your system is stronger or weaker. The real question is whether it's good enough, and it sounds like both of yours works. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question, but it's complicated, because different infections trigger the immune system to different amounts.  Sometimes, what kills a person isn't the infection itself, but the immune response to that infection.  In those cases, it's better to have a slightly weaker immune response; the response will still be strong enough to fight the infection, but not so strong as to cause you harm.</p>
<p>Another thing that will make a difference is how severe the infection gets.  A minor infection will trigger a lesser response, but if those bacteria or viruses grow out of control, this will trigger a big response, with worse symptoms.  You could be experiencing milder symptoms because you're controlling the infection at an earlier stage...or because your body is taking a more measured, less aggressive response to controlling the infection.</p>
<p>It's hard for me to say without samples.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We all have different responses to infections, and recent studies show that our immune system isn't the only player - normal constituents of your microbiome are also very important for both how effective your immune response is and how strong. They help you fight off disease by competing with pathogens and also prime your immune response to prevent autoimmune conditions. It is quite likely that your wife's strong immune response is caused by her often getting treatments with antibiotics and potentially, if she was delivered by c section. Naturally, there are multiple other factors that play a role. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hers is better, because it's reacting more strongly. However, a little known fact, the great Influenza epidemic of 1918 (a.k.a. H1N1) was unusual because its morbidity rate was so much higher in people who were in the &quot;prime of their lives&quot;. Older people and children didn't die in such high numbers.
This is thought to be because the young, strong adults had the best immune systems, and they died because they drowned in their bodies' own fluids, which were much less plentiful in older or younger people with weaker immune responses.
But that's a pretty freaky response. Usually the stronger immune system wins.
I read it in a book.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So different system respond to different bacteria and trigger different symptoms.</p>
<p>I'll touch on one, fever.</p>
<p>Bacteria and viruses are surprisingly temperature sensitive. They have no way good to regulate the temperature inside their cells. So in this case they are dependent on the temperature of the host.</p>
<p>let's take everyone's least favorite dumpster-diver, the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Opossum_2.jpg" target="_blank">Opossum</a>.</p>
<p>Opossums are largely not susceptible to the rabies virus, as many people think. </p>
<h1>DISCLAIMER: They can still carry it, as well as other diseases, seek medical attention if bitten / scratched.</h1>
<p>This is because their body temperature is low when compared to other mammals, generally around 90-93 <em>F. The rabies virus cannot sustain itself in this lower temperature, as compared to everyone's <a href="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-10/19/17/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-6715-1445290091-1.jpg" target="_blank">favorite</a> dumpster diver, whose body temp averages closer to 100 </em>F.</p>
<p>Now what does this have to do with fever? Well evolution. If a bacteria, or virus thrives at 98.6 <em>F, but cannot survive temperatures of 100-101</em>F well it would do your body good to &quot;sweat it out&quot;.</p>
<p>So somewhere way way way back one of your ancestors immune responses caused them to heat up. This killed a bacterial or viral infection, and kept them alive to procreate, and thus the trait was passed along, and spread.</p>
<p>So now fever is a common symptom. Though it is not so much the infection, as it is the body trying to cook out the infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
