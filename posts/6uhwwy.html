		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What people are missing is the ergonomics of the item. (I'm using that word loosely for the sake of discussion.)</p>
<p>If you try to lift a 200lb log into the back of a station wagon Vs. a 200lb dead body, the body will be much harder. As a matter of fact, almost everything is easier to lift than a dead body.</p>
<p>This is due to the rigidity of the object. A log, chair, door, table... these things are not fighting you by changing shape and balance/leverage points on the fly. Once you find the leverage points on a couch, it doesn't change.</p>
<p>A dead body, on the other hand, is a cornucopia of balance points and weight that redistributes itself randomly at the most inopportune moments. Even with two people, moving it can be a chore.</p>
<p>This is why you want to, preferably, wrap them in a thick wrap of shipping plastic, or visqueen and duct tape, or roll them in a thick rug.</p>
<p>The main point is to keep the limbs tightly together: The arms straight along either side of the torso, and the legs tightly together at the ankles and just above the knees.</p>
<p>This can be done with just duct tape, or a whole lot of zip-ties, but wrapping is really your best bet.</p>
<p>Hope this helps with your son.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe your awake 50lb kid, but (as a parent, I'm sure you've experienced this) when he's unconscious or just being a dick and you have to drag him around, he starts to feel similar to the 50lb bag of concrete. This is because when conscious and aware of what he's doing, he can help you by distributing his weight evenly; he's not just flopping around willy-nilly, hell, sometimes he may even assist in holding himself up by wrapping his legs around your torso. If he were completely out or dead and his own muscles completely relaxed, he would likely feel as heavy as or more than the droopy, unstable bag of concrete.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>When a person is alive and with-it, they &quot;participate&quot; in being held by making sure weight is distributed to your core. Getting a floppy body to have its weight distributed to your core muscles is hard and this makes balancing difficult and causes you to engage relatively weak muscles.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both you and the child compensate.  You can hold the child in a comfortable position without them tipping over and out of your arm because they have a sense of balance and would also not like for them to fall.  If your child was unconscious, you'd find that the kid is potentially more difficult to carry than the bag of concrete.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we pick up an object we naturally articulate and engage the muscles we believe are necessary to shift the weight in the desired manner. Sometimes when objects are a different weight than we anticipate we either fling the object or even strain ourselves.</p>
<p>A rigid body has an unmoving centre of gravity, this makes it easy for us to keep an optimal selection of muscles engaged while moving it.
An object whose contents are mobile (such as a grain-filled sack or a water-balloon) can constantly redistribute its mass as a side effect of handling. These shifting masses moves the centre of gravity in ways that may be suboptimal for the muscles engaged, and thus require more strength, or simply roll out of our grip.</p>
<p>For kidnappers: The solution is to use sacks or other containment objects which keep the centre of gravity in a relatively fixed position. Handles are also useful as they allow our body to exclude weaker muscle groups.</p>
<p>For kidnap victims: The solution if you are being picked up is to not make yourself rigid - that makes you easier to carry, and don't just go floppy either (since they could adjust to that) - instead flail between the two, which will rapidly alter your centre of gravity and make you very hard to grip onto.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
