		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference between the colors observed during a sunrise and the colors observed during a sunset is most likely caused by differences in the <del>density and temperature</del> composition of the atmosphere. If atmospheric conditions are held constant, the colors during a sunrise should in theory look identical to the colors during a sunset.</p>
<p>Light appears redder during a sunrise/sunset because the light from the sun must travel a greater distance through Earth's atmosphere to reach us (<a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/light/u12l2f3.gif" target="_blank">graphic</a>). Earth's atmosphere preferentially scatters short-wavelength light (e.g., blue light); the more atmosphere the light must travel through, the less blue light will reach us (<a href="http://static2.fjcdn.com/comments/5007838+_8e2a290d045683a599312059327f6eea.jpg" target="_blank">graphic</a>).</p>
<p>But then why aren't sunrises just as red as sunsets? <del>This is because the density of the air tends to be lower in the morning than the density of the air in the evening. As the day progresses, the heat from the sun increases the humidity of the air (i.e., increases the number of blue-light-scattering water molecules in the air). Pollution also increases during the day as the number of active power plants, factories, cars, etc. increases. As a result, the density of the air is often much higher in the evening; and, consequently, more blue light from the sun is scattered, leaving a much higher proportion of red light.</del> Edit 2: Evening air often contains more particles than morning air. This is potentially due to changes in atmospheric conditions caused by thermal radiation from the sun and/or due to increased human activity. The increased number of particles in the air scatters even more blue light, making sunsets appear redder.</p>
<p>Edit 3.1: Many users have mentioned that there could be a subjective aspect as well. And I agree. It's certainly plausible that certain biological and/or psychological mechanisms could influence or exaggerate our perceptions of visual phenomena like sunrises and sunsets. u/Gonzo_Rick most accurately <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5bt26j/eli5_why_is_it_that_the_quality_of_light_at/d9rnmet/" target="_blank">summarized</a> this part of the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When light hits the retina, it sends neural impulses directly to sleep regulating parts of your brain ([more specifically, the suprachiasmatic nucleus]) that wake you up. Blue light in particular elicits the strongest reaction. Coupled with the fact that [the concentration of active rhodopsin (the night-vision protein that drastically increases your sensitivity to light) in the rod cells of your retina is probably much higher], that blue light might seem more piercing and prominent than other wavelengths in the morning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit: u/positive_root gave a more accurate <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5bt26j/eli5_why_is_it_that_the_quality_of_light_at/d9rgetl/" target="_blank">explanation</a> regarding the struck-out portion of the third paragraph, which I have added below. Thanks for clearing that up!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Holding pressure constant, atmospheric density is a function of temperature. So in the morning the atmosphere is cold, has multiple stable layers, typically much higher density than in the evening when convection is still settling down. Also high humidity typically leads to haze particles, large enough to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering" target="_blank">Mie scattering</a>. You say &quot;blue-light-scattering water molecules&quot; but all relatively un-clumped molecules with a dipole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering" target="_blank">scatter blue light</a> preferentially, most notably nitrogen, the main constituent of the atmosphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit 3.2: <del>~</del><del>~</del><del>~</del> TL;DR <del>~</del><del>~</del><del>~</del><br />
Sunrises and sunsets are both caused by the scattering of short-wavelength (e.g., blue) light by particles in the air. In the evening, there are usually more particles in the air than in the morning. The increased number of particles in the evening causes even more blue light to be scattered making sunsets appear redder. Sunrises may also appear bluer because our eyes are usually more sensitive in the morning and our brains are most sensitive to blue light in general.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting discussion here about the different state of the atmosphere between sunrise vs. sunset. As an atmospheric scientist, I'd like to list what I think might be the most relevant points.</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be some selection bias. The time relative to the sun's position near the horizon at which you notice the sunset vs sunrise may be rather different.</li>
<li>Dark eye adaptation is a big deal, your ability to see the first light of sunrise (or the false sunrise, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiacal_light" target="_blank">zodiacal light</a>) is likely very different than your ability to see the last light of sunset.</li>
<li>The atmosphere really is different between morning and evening, human effects like light pollution as well as particulate matter are likely to make a difference. But even without humans, physics demands the formation of a <a href="http://http://lidar.ssec.wisc.edu/papers/akp_thes/node6.htm" target="_blank">nocturnal boundary layer</a> whose structure is slightly different from sunrise to sunset.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope some of these ideas lead you to even more interesting topics. I could talk about atmospheric optics all day, it's just so absolutely amazing, you can see why some languages don't even have a different word for &quot;heaven&quot; or &quot;the sky&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit: from the top answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>two factors, both human:</p>
<p>The First</p>
<p>The first is in our heads. &quot;At sunset, our eyes are daylight adapted and may even be a bit weary from the day's toil,&quot; Lynch and Livingston write. &quot;As the light fades, we cannot adapt as fast as the sky darkens. Some hues may be lost or perceived in a manner peculiar to sunset. At sunrise, however, the night's darkness has left us with very acute night vision and every faint, minor change in the sky's color is evident.&quot; In short, you may perceive more colors at dawn than at dusk.</p>
<p>The Second</p>
<p>Human activities also drive a divergence between them. &quot;At sunset the sky is full of pollutants and wind-borne particles,&quot; the authors write. &quot;During the night, winds die down, smog-producing urban activity eases and the atmosphere cleanses itself. The dawn is clearer than any other time of day.&quot;</p>
<p>Neil Degrasse Tyson is also quoted in the article, in reference to being able to differentiate between a sunrise and a sunset without the perception of time,</p>
<p>&quot;When viewed from all latitudes north of the Tropic of Cancer (23.5 degrees north latitude), the sun always rises at an angle up and to the right, and sets and an angle down and to the right,&quot;</p>
