		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is saying &quot;the money,&quot; and while that's definitely correct, it's not the whole story. From the 1830s on, <em>average</em> Americans have had a healthy skepticism of authority (religious, scientific, political, etc) and <em>felt empowered to their own opinions.</em> </p>
<p>P.T. Barnum capitalized on this in his 1840s and 1850s exhibitions––he'd stoke up a controversy and get public naturalists (what we'd now call amateur scientists) to argue over it in newspapers. Then Barnum would come out with an ad saying something like, &quot;When doctors disagree, the public must decide!&quot; This tactic almost got one of his agents beaten in South Carolina, where the disagreement between doctors got particularly heated. </p>
<p>By the early 1900s, science was becoming a more professionalized field, and we see scientists start to argue that the public doesn't really have a right to decide on things outside of their own expertise. &quot;Leave it to the experts,&quot; scientists basically said. But the American people didn't really start buying it until the post WWII era, when a combination of things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Nuclear Age and the rivalry with the USSR made STEM politically crucial</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Science popularizers like Feynman and Sagan bridged the gap between &quot;elite,&quot; professional science and non-experts</p>
</li>
<li>Personal computing made the power of STEM and technology comprehensible on the individual level. There's a bit difference between some scientists in a room with ENIAC and a guy in his garage tinkering with an Commodore 64. </li>
</ul>
<p>From there, some segments of society (generally the people more open to technological and social change) embraced the authority of STEM professionals and made them much more likely to accept something like climate change at face value. Other segments of society (generally the people more socially conservative, who opposed rapid change and wanted to keep the status quo) kept their skepticism of scientific authority, preferring to defer to their own person judgement and investigation. </p>
<p>So that's just another piece of the puzzle, along with money. But there's more to it than those two things, even. We now through around the term &quot;science&quot; as though it has a set meaning. But in fact, science as a term is culturally constructed. Note: I'm not saying that science as the empirical observation of phenomenon is culturally constructed, but that the <strong>term</strong> science is culturally constructed. And what that means is that all the stuff that gets added on to the act  of observation and experimentation is determined by people. So the very definition of what is &quot;right&quot; science and what is &quot;wrong&quot; science is at stake. Climate change skeptics demonstrate the flexibility in the term &quot;science,&quot; because to them they're being just as &quot;scientific&quot; as their counterparts. Skeptics just reject what they call &quot;consensus science&quot; and embrace a more generalized Baconian approach, in which any evidence against a theory blows the whole thing to hell. (Actual historians of science, I apologize for butchering that––it's not really my area, please do correct me). </p>
<p>In addition to money and skepticism of authority, then, there's also the complicating factor of the term science's ambiguity. </p>
<p>So I guess the upshot is that this climate change issue won't be solved JUST by fixing the money problem. There are also culturally conditioned ways that people think about the world around them that make it difficult for them to accept climate change. That's why it's so hard to change their minds––but I hate the term &quot;cognitive dissonance,&quot; which Bill Nye is so fond of saying. Medicalizing their worldviews is dismissive and, frankly, disrespectful. It's not that these people are too dumb to accept the truth and therefore just launch themselves into denial land. It's that, to them, your point literally doesn't make sense. (My point with this is to respect people whose views differ, even when those views seem crazy. If we just dismiss everyone we don't agree with as having some kind of psychosis, we're only going to perpetuate the dehumanization of our countrymen and women...and look where that's gotten us.)</p>
<p>*EDIT: Thank you kindly for the gold, ma'am or sir. I'm in bed sick today, and your kindness made me feel a bit better :-)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes down to a cost/benefit analysis. In order to have an impact on the climate we need to implement costly changes to our economy which harm businesses, jobs, employment and global trade.</p>
<p>So the question then becomes what should we do and is the cost worth the benefit.  Often times the benefits are not measurable, yet very expensive.  Some say we should make those changes anyway, others say no thanks.</p>
<p>I'll give an example using one of the biggest global policies to fix climate change was the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol was an international treaty that was an expansion on a previous agreement from 1992 that put binding agreements in place for nations to curb greenhouse gas emissions by pre-determined amounts. Essentially it put target reductions out at specified points. So in 1 year reduce by X, in 5 years reduce by Y, in 10 years reduce by Z, etc.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton signed the protocol, but the President doesn't have the authority to force the nation to do such things, it required a vote in Congress. After Clinton left office there was a movement in the Senate to refuse the Kyto Protocol from taking place. A resolution passed in the Senate <em>unanimously</em> to prevent it citing major economic harm if the United States actually went through with it.</p>
<p>The problem with the Kyoto Protocol is that it targeted large westernized economic power-houses like the United States and exempted 80% of the world, including major players in the global economy like China and India. It would have seriously harmed our economy more than any other while giving major advantage to other nations impacting our economy and global trade.
Eventually even Canada, who signed, backed out because it was harming their economy and they had enough.</p>
<p>Pros: If (a big if) all the countries signed the Kyoto Protocol actually followed through with its targets, climate modeling suggests it would have reduced global temperatures by 0.11-0.21 degrees Celsius (0.28-0.38 degrees Fahrenheit) by the year 2100. In other words, the impact would have been within the margin of error and the change likely would have been immeasurable. I guess this is a pro.. it wouldn't have actually helped the environment in any realistic way, but it wouldn't have hurt it either.</p>
<p>Cons: Would have crushed our economy while favoring exempt nations like China and India further advancing their economic status.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's origins have pretty much always been hand-in-hand with the political environmental movement, which has a radical fringe.</p>
<p>In the 1970's and early 80's, the dominant scientific idea was that pollution was going to cause a new ice age, and our use of fossil fuels was to blame.  Other propaganda along with this was that we only had a few decades of oil left.  Given the nature of the oil industry, and basic economics, this becomes pretty much irrelevant.  So, despite the 'consensus' of the scientific community, those who are over 40-50 years old see credibility issues, having heard these types of complaints before.</p>
<p>The way it really becomes a political issue is that governments enact policies to restrict oil use, raise taxes, or introduce other laws and regulations that make it more expensive or difficult to use coal, oil, gasoline, and other carbon-based fuels.  This makes things complicated, as carbon based fuels are, without a doubt, the cheapest and most flexible energy supply we have.</p>
<p>And the consequences of restricting carbon emissions are huge, but generally under-reported.  Setting aside the importance to our own economy, if you want to fight third world poverty, you want them to have a much access to cheap energy as possible, not to delay their growth 10-15 years until the price of solar and wind power drops.  And in the meantime, the truck that brings food from the farm country out to the villages isn't a hybrid.  By our standards, it is a poorly maintained, super-dirty diesel.  So third world countries are probably not keen on supporting major restrictions on carbon.  Neither is the Middle East, where Oil Exports are the main economic production.  </p>
<p>So since it is a huge issue that impact different industries, different companies, and different types of people differently, it has become a huge political issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of climate change is caused by the burning of fossil fuels and pollution put out by manufacturing plants. </p>
<p>In order to fight climate change, we need to change our energy consumption to resources that don't cause climate change, such as renewables like solar and wind. We also need to change how we consume energy and output pollutants, such as more energy efficient cars and regulating manufacturing. </p>
<p>These changes are brought about by regulations and incentives put forth by the government. Such as incentives for developing and building solar and wind farms, and taxes against oil and coal.</p>
<p>Big companies, such as oil and coal producers, and manufacturers don't want these changes to go into effect, because those changes will hurt those companies' profits. Therefor they lobby to congress <em>not</em> to implement changes that are good for the environment, but bad for big business. </p>
<p>In order for those people in congress to justify <em>not implementing</em> measures that will help the environment and reduce climate change, (and thus try to <em>appear</em> as if they are acting in the peoples' interest and not in the pocket of big energy companies) these congressmen attempt to debunk climate change in general. Therefor saying &quot;Climate change is not an issue, therefor we do not need to support renewable energy / do not need to curtail oil &amp; coal industry.&quot; </p>
<p>That is how you end up with some people in congress (those in the pocket of energy companies) claiming that climate change isn't real - arguing with others in congress who are trying to curtail climate change (and &quot;save the planet.&quot;)</p>
<p>Edit: Curious why this comment would get downvoted? Especially without any replies. Was anything I said incorrect or not ELi5 enough? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Texas, many people rely on the oil industry for their livelihood. If oil fields were to be closed in favor of green energy, many Texans fear that they will lose their jobs and be out of work completely. This also has an indirect effect. Texas is filled with oil towns where the majority of people with money work in an oil field. By extension, many businesses also set up shop there as the employees need to ship somewhere. Because of this, if the oil fields were to close, many other un-related businesses may close.</p>
<p>The oil industry has a major influence in red states and they spend a lot of money influencing research which favors their point of view. Climate change will regulate the oil industry and became more of a partisan issue as many people believe that there is some agenda from the left which will punish red states in favor of blue states who may benefit from green energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
