<p>The angular momentum of a black hole is a property of the spacetime and needn't have anything to do with what is happening inside the horizon.</p>
<p>The singularity is never a 0-dimensional point. In Schwarzschild it is an &quot;instant of time&quot;. In Kerr it is a ring. I don't think the shape of the singularity in a real black hole is known.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) the singularity is not a 0-dimensional point. That's true of non-rotating black holes. Rotating black holes probably don't even have a singularity (aka as ringularity since it would be a ring) even at a semi-classical level: the singularity lies in an interior region of the solution which we know cannot be trusted to model actual rotating black holes.</p>
<p>2) the singularity does not &quot;carry&quot; or &quot;hold&quot; the properties of the black hole such as the mass, the linear and angular momentum, the charge... it will just lead to confusion to think in these terms. How/where exactly a black hole &quot;keeps&quot; these things is a subtle and counterintuitive matter. </p>
<p>The technical answer is these properties are sort of &quot;delocalized&quot; in the case of a black hole and the black hole itself is essentially a type of topological defect. That would be a very agnostic, strictly classical answer. But that's close to impossible to explain for me.</p>
<p>A simple, bizzarre and not really that wrong at all way to imagine a black hole is as a very thin 2-dimensional membrane lying above the horizon. This membrane is hot and has energy, so mass; when stuff falls in it gets burnt by the membrane and adds to its energy/mass. When charges fall onto the membrane, the membrane (which has a sort of electrical conductivity) absorbs and dissolves charges and become charged itself. And finally, it can acquire linear or angular momentum when it's provided by falling objects, and can start moving, or rotating (and become flattened). This is a quantum-gravity- (and string-theory-) inspired picture, but for what regards classical gravitation it gives the same answers as the &quot;standard&quot; one, and might help clarify a lot of the trickiness of black holes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are infinitely displaced from the singularity in terms of how much our space/time is warped. </p>
<p>Meaning if something falls into the event horizon, if we could see inside, from our point of view theoretically it should never reach the singularity. </p>
<p>Imagine the ship in interstellar that goes to the planet where 1 hour there is 7 years on Earth. </p>
<p>Ok, imagine it goes a bunch closer to the black hole. So 1 hour = 70 years on earth. </p>
<p>Now, imagine it keeps going closer, </p>
<p>it will hit 1 hour on the ship = 700 years
1 hour on the ship = 7000 years
1 hour on the ship = 70000 years</p>
<p>up and up and up forever before reaching the singularity.....</p>
<p>From the point of view of an observer outside of the event horizon the behavior can be totally different from the point of view from inside the event horizon. The black hole may have a singularity by it's own internal math and view point - but from our point of view outside it doesn't seem to me like it can have a singularity. </p>
<p>It's called a dual nature. Anything infinitely displaced by relativity aught to have a dual nature. Light is another example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Black Holes are not necessarily singularities. We know that an event horizon is where the escape velocity reaches the speed of light. That's pretty much it. The rest is theory, some of it very well reasoned, but we can't really verify any of it experimentally (although we can verify other parts of those theories in certain ways, such as at the LHC). That does not necessarily mean there is no internal structure.</p>
<p>For one, spacetime itself could retain some sort of structure as we do not know what happens to it in such a situation.</p>
<p>Secondly, and perhaps more interesting, is that if matter has structure below the quark, or perhaps at a scale below the Planck length, then it's possible there are iterations of black holes. Let me elaborate:</p>
<p>Neutron stars are extremely dense objects made when the &quot;pressure&quot; becomes enough to crush electrons and protons together. Then they are held apart by neutron degeneracy pressure (again, not really pressure but an outward force resisting gravity). When/if the gravity becomes strong enough the neutron star can then collapse further.</p>
<p>The main idea seems to be that neutron stars collapse into black holes. Pulsars (a type of neutron star) can occasionally spin so fast they resist collapse until their spin slows down enough, we think. This does not mean they collapse into a singularity; there is no complete explanation for exactly what happens at this point.</p>
<p>Another thought is that the step beyond neutron stars is a quark star, which would be incredibly dense (10cm across or so).</p>
<p>I wonder if maybe quark stars aren't a type of black hole, or perhaps matter has structure more fundamental than quarks and will resist being crushed at a certain point. We simply do not know so it's all speculation.</p>
<p>I do find it interesting, however, that the external effects of a stellar-mass black hole and a supermassive black hole are generally the same if radically different in scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
