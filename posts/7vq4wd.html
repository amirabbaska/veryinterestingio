The article listed above mentions surgery, but I know medication is also a common option.<br />
Unfortunately, now that people with Down Syndrome are living longer, they are finding that <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-disease-people-down-syndrome" target="_blank">dementia</a> is another common problem in later years. (50s and 60s).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The advancements in open heart surgery. Half of people born with DS have a heart defect.
Also, better treatments, and routine screening for thyroid conditions and childhood cancers ( which the have about a 1/20 chance of having before age 5) </p>
<p>The great hope for parents like myself is that the research that is being done on Alzheimer's that involves the participation on the DS community. This is because our kids start a mental decline around 40, and the processes by which this happens is very similar to what happens with Alzheimer's. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
