		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are actually types of toothpaste that are not based on fluoride, but on other substances that have some degree of research as to increased efficacy.</p>
<p>For example, sensodyne in Canada/UK (not sold in USA due to patent nonsense) contains not plain sodium fluoride, but rather NovaMin, a bioglass that is designed to (in a simplified sense) fill in gaps in the teeth.  Certain toothpastes, typically available as a special treatment in some Dentist offices, use nano-hydroxyapatite which some studies show to be superior to sodium-fluoride in the remineralization of enamel.  While you can't buy either in US stores, except perhaps as an expensive once-off in the right Dentist office, they're readily available on Amazon.</p>
<p>This goes way beyond ELI5, but here's some research articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enamel surface remineralization: Using synthetic nanohydroxyapatite</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3636833/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3636833/</a></em></p>
<p>The use of biomimetic nanohydroxyapatite as a remineralizing agent holds promise as a new synthetic enamel biocompatible material to repair early carious lesions.</p>

<p>The nano-hydroxyapatite is a revolutionary material with a wide use in dentistry. With regard to restorative and preventive fields, nano-hydroxyapatite has remarkable remineralizing effects on initial lesions of enamel, certainly higher than traditional fluorides used until now for this purpose. Nano-hydroxyapatite is, in fact, a better source of free Ca, and this is a key element as regards the remineralization, the protection against caries and dental erosion. </p>

<p>Thirty sound human premolars were divided into <em>nanohydroxyapatite group</em> (n = 15) and the <em>sodium fluoride group</em> (n = 15)...The results showed that the nanohydroxyapatite group produced a surface morphology close to the biologic enamel, the increase in mineral content (Ca/P ratio) was <em>more significant</em> in the nanohydroxyapatite group (P &lt; 0.05) and the SMH recovery was <em>closer to the baseline level</em> in the nanohydroxyapatite group (P &lt; 0.05).</p>

<p>Forty-eight human enamel blocks were assigned to four groups (N=12): (1) control (without agent); (2) fluoride varnish (Duraphat); (3) nano-HAP paste (Desensibilize Nano P); and (4) casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) paste (MI Paste Plus)...After the cariogenic challenge, the nano-HAP group showed significantly higher KHN and %SMHR values than varnish. The CPP-ACP group showed no increase in KHN. The nano-HAP group showed, via AFM, a protective layer formation with globular deposits on the surface....SMHR and AFM morphology revealed that nano-hydroxyapatite paste showed a protective effect against in vitro enamel caries development.</p>

<p>nHAP dentifrice caused remineralization comparable to a fluoride dentifrice, and inhibited caries development, thus suggesting that an nHAP dentifrice can be an effective alternative to fluoride toothpaste.</p>

<p>It was concluded that all the three desensiting agents were effective in the dentine tubule occlusion. In addition efficacy of nano-hydroxyapatite toothpaste was greater compared to the other desensiting agents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Novamin seems somewhat similar, it's a &quot;bioglass&quot; that is supposed to fill gaps in enamel and reduce tooth sensitivity, though it may also promote remineralization.  Like I said, it's in sensodyne (interesting, it is not in US sensodyne, only in other countries like Canada and the UK).</p>

<p>The scoring and the percentage of occluded dentinal tubules by Novamin containing toothpaste was significantly better compared to arginine or the control toothpaste. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dentist here. There are minor differences overall. But really we just recommend one with fluoride that you like for most people. I've seen people comment on here fluoride has no effect. I'm not going to post a long rambling post but that's just wrong. As the hydroxyapatite in enamel loses its ions from acid (which happens around ph 5.5) the hyrdroxyl group is replaced by the fluoride which creates fluoroapatite which is dissolved at pH 4.5. This is a great deal difference as it's the pH scale. I know that's not explain like I'm five but it is. Tartar control has pyrophosphates which do help slightly. Sensitive usually uses another type of fluoride called stannous fluoride or a chemical potassium nitrate to reduce sensitivity. Both work for minor sensitivity. Whitening has a higher RDA value usually which means more abrasive. Cosmetic claims don't need evaluation so those are almost all marketing. The triclosan in Colgate total does have studies backing it up but there is the debate of triclosan in products contributing to antibiotic resistance but it's mainly with hand soaps so it may or may not be around on toothpaste in the future. </p>
<p>Well. Looks like it was a long rambling post. But to sum it up. Brush for two minutes twice a day. The two minutes is not only to do a good cleaning but also to give time for the fluoride to work. It's also recommended to not rinse after brushing especially at night to allow for more contact time. Just spit out excess. </p>
<p>Edit. Also there is also Mi paste/tooth mousse which has ACP which is a bioavailable way for the ions to remineralize without fluoride. But you lose the benefit of creating the fluoroapatite. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in the industry and in the US we are regulated by the FDA. Toothpaste is what's called an over the counter drug. This means that it has some claim that has been substantiated by a study, and an active ingredient that works toward that claim. </p>
<p>In the case of Toothpaste it might have an ingredient like Sodium Flouride 0.24%  there's lots of testing that will substantiate that Flouride at that percent prevents tooth decay via prevention of softening of the enamel. </p>
<p>Now Toothpaste may something like &quot;appears whiter&quot; and this can be a cosmetic claim. Basically they got 20 people in a room and asked them &quot;after using it for a week do your teeth look whiter?&quot; get enough people to say yeah, and now you have label copy. But if they add 0.04% hydrogen peroxide as a whitening agent, then it will say it on the label. </p>
<p>So what's this all mean? If two completely different Toothpastes have the same exact active ingredients they are essentially the same.  Everything else is taste and filler. It also means if a Walmart brand has the same active ingredients it's just as good as the brand name. Likely also made in the same place.  </p>
<p>Edit to add: any OTC drug has a number on the back you can call and ask to see the studies that back their claim. Cosmetics also. Just call and ask, &quot;can I see the study that you use to verify the claim of 10 x brighter?&quot; they have to be able to prove it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some toothpastes definitely have quite different active ingredients. One example is the Sensodyne line, which btw I am from the UK and I believe the active ingredients across the pond are a little different. Anyway, your dentist may recommend you 'Sensodyne' tooth paste for sensitive teeth, but which one you should buy actually depends on a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensodyne rapid relief contains strontium acetate, which effectively blocks the tunnels leading to the nerves within your tooth to sooth pain and, long-term, block the nerves off.</li>
<li>Repair and Protect uses NOVAMIN, which I believe is not approved by the FDA in the US, which actually rebuilds the exterior of your tooth over the dentin, blocking off these tubules that cause pain within your teeth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Colgate's sensitive line uses completely different ingredients, I think. Anyway, not a professional - I just have sensitive teeth - but that's all certainly true.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the formulations are certainly different between companies, as far as the results go the differences are not enough to be noted on a clinical scale in my experience talking with patients for the last 10 years.  Some, like Colgate Total use Tricoslan ( now banned and soon to stop because of the risk of bacterial resistance) while Crest Pro Health uses Stannous fluoride instead of Sodium Fluoride, though again in my experience the average person will not be able to tell the difference.</p>
<p>The two exceptions to that rule would be toothpaste's like Sensodyne or similar products from other companies, as these contain Potassium Nitrate 5% as an additional active ingredient in addition to Sodium Fluoride. Also, if you are at a high risk of cavities or have extremely dry mouth a RX toothpaste with higher fluoride concentrations (most common being Prevident 5000) may be prudent.</p>
<p>My recommendation to patients is to get the cheapest toothpaste you can that contains Sodium Fluoride or the equivalent unless you have problems with sensitivity, in which you should look for a tooth paste with Potassium nitrate.  In my professional opinion if you want whiter teeth you are better served using a peroxide based whitening system from your dentist or from things like OTC whitening strips.</p>
<p>TL;DR: There are no real differences except if you have specialized needs in which other products can be recommended by a dental professional.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
