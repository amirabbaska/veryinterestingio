		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Well this is going to be a psychology crash-course on memory systems.</strong></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>It isn't exactly clear why that is but there is [one main memory theory from atkinson and shiffrin] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson%E2%80%93Shiffrin_memory_model" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson%E2%80%93Shiffrin_memory_model</a>) that is seen as most likely to be true. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In that theory, your <strong>short term memory</strong> (the memory where everything is stored that you are doing right now(like ram on a computer)), and <strong>long term memory</strong> (long term memory is hardwired, its set in stone and very hard to forget) constantly exchange information. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong>Short term memory</strong> is found to be able to hold about 7 strings of info (This is why you should learn between 5-7 words at a time, anything else will write over the other strings). If those strings get repeated enough or underlined enough with other things (for example stress or pain) they will be stored in long term memory. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>^now_this_part_is_research_from_multiple_different_researchers</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In <strong>long term memory</strong> things are stored in 2 different main groups(unlike a computer harddrive, the comparison stops beyond this point). The explicit memory and the implicit memory. These are also known as the <strong>declarative (explicit) memory</strong> and <strong>non-declarative(implicit) memory</strong>. These two sections can again be divided into multiple different storage techniques.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The <strong>declarative (explicit) memory</strong> can be divided into the <strong>episodic memory</strong> and the <strong>semantic memory</strong>. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong>Episodic memory</strong> contains the the chronological timeline and details of an event such as your 10th birthday or your first kiss. It contains where it happened and what you felt while it was happening. It contains time of day and anything else that happened on the order of which they happened at (Or at least, that's the idea it doesn't always work very accurately and can be manipulated to contain lies or dreams appear as truths). its like a filmed autobiography. The <strong>episodic memory</strong> is dependent on context specific remembering. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong>Semantic memory</strong> contains words, ideas,  concepts and facts. this is where the meaning of different words is stored. This memory is not context dependent. The things stored in here is independent of personal experience. A rule of the thumb to divide <strong>semantic memory</strong> and <strong>episodic memory</strong> is that if you know something, but don't know where, when, who, why or with what you learned it, than its stored in your <strong>semantic memory</strong>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Then we still have the other of the 2 main groups, the <strong>non-declarative(implicit) memory</strong>. This memory can be divided into 4 groups, the <strong>procedural memory</strong>, the <strong>emotional conditioning memory</strong>, the <strong>priming effect memory</strong> and the <strong>conditioned reflex memory</strong>. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In <strong>procedural memory</strong> things like how to drive or swim are stored. This memory stores all routine tasks so you can request step by step the needed information to be retrieved in your <strong>short term memory</strong> so it doesn't have to fill all of the strings available with that one task. This memory is like the punch trough paper of an music player. It has all the steps stored in an easy to feed manner.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In <strong>emotional conditioning memory</strong> is stored what the correct emotional response is to a situation, for example feeling sad when a loved one dies. Or feeling happy when you see a loved one in a crowd. This memory is pretty straight forward.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In <strong>priming effect memory</strong> are the relations between different things stored. such as that a word sky is easier to read when the color blue is present, since blue has a relation to the sky. This memory is also pretty straight forward.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In the <strong>conditional reflex memory</strong> are reflexes to certain impulses stored. for example putting your hands in front of you when you fall, or closing your eyes when something goes near them. <strong>Conditional reflex memory</strong> is the only memory that science unanimous agrees to actually exist. The <strong>conditional reflex memory</strong> is nothing more than an hardwired response to certain impulses. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>TL;DR: So to conclude it all, the reason why you have amnesia as an infant is because the <strong>declarative (explicit) memory</strong> does not yet function.</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>In addition to some of the great comments here mentioning sensory memory (remembering smells, tastes, etc, but being unable to recall why those smells and tastes are familiar), trauma processing, etc, there's another factor at play here. When we experience the world, we are creating physical changes in our brains. Our neurons create or prune pathways throughout our lives, but this is especially active in early childhood. Even if you don't remember an event, your brain could have created a neuronal pathway in response to it. A stimulus (for example, a dog) could lead to an automatic response (fight or flight) if the neuronal pathway exists, even if we no longer hold the memory of that time a dog scared us.</p>
<p>Further, there's research that's exploring how the brain develops in utero, which points to how stress during pregnancy could literally shape an unborn baby's brain. Babies born after a very stressful or traumatic pregnancy have more cortisol receptors in their brains in comparison to nonstressful pregnancies. Cortisol being a stress hormone means that these babies may become more prone to stress/have lower stress tolerance, because the increased receptors pick up more signal even without producing additional cortisol. So, no memory of anything happening, but a profound change in your growth and development, and a change in how you live your life despite little memory of the events that shaped it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding, based on trauma-informed research and workshops I have attended, is that when we are infants we experience all of our memories as sensory events. This in turn  means that, as infants, we store our memories from those times into the area of the brain responsible for our primary senses (smell, touch, taste, sound, etc...). </p>
<p>This is what also happens when you enter the &quot;freeze&quot; mode of the fight or flight response, explaining why trauma victims have difficulty recalling sequential events at the time of their traumatic experience. However it is not uncommon for victims of trauma to draw upon their sensory memories and can recall things such as how the assailant smelled, how something tasted (ie: blood) and so on... </p>
<p>All of this to say that there is information out there to suggest that it is not an amnesia, rather it is a part of ourselves that has a weaker connection than it did when we were infants.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Memory isn't one thing. Infantile amnesia is about episodic memory, which is verbal. /u/Burga88 alludes to the idea you actually might remember these experiences, but because you didn't understand language at the time, they are coded in a format you can't use anymore. It would be like trying to run a Nintendo game on a PS4 - you <em>have</em> the game, you just don't have a system that can read it anymore.</p>
<p>However, a large proportion of our memory is actually non-declarative, or non-verbal. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>how to walk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that you should avoid a hot stove</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>associations between the taste of fresh lemonade and a hot day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that when you cry, someone will (or will not) come to help you</p>
</li>
<li>that you can trust people (or not) to be kind</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read that research is showing that it's not that we have amnesia, but that language actually helps form memories. So remembering stuff before you know any language, is difficult. I can understand as its hard to imagine even thinking, without some sort of verbal system in your mind.</p>
<p>So while you might not be able to recall memories, I'd say the emotional impact of certain things are remembered. Also the fact that you learning so much as an infant/toddler, your experiencing so much for the first time. And first impressions stick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
