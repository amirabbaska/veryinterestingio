		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Since around 6 or so years ago I've suffered from severe depersonalization/derealization, I believe (and most of my therapists would agree) that is was caused due to abuse/trauma in my childhood. I also have hints of schizophrenia. I was wondering what the science behind all this is. Also, if it's related, how does PTSD work in terms of science?  </p>
<p>NOTE: This is not me venting about my disorders, I am just curious as it is something I deal with 24/7 in my life.</p>
<p>Edit: Seems I misclassified Schizoprenia and a dissociative disorder. Sorry, my bad.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Schizophrenia isn't a dissociative disorder. Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder. Scientists aren't exactly sure what causes schizophrenia, but it seems to have a strong genetic component. So if you have a close relative with schizophrenia, your chances of having it go up a lot. Experiencing trauma seems to increase your risk too, but trauma alone doesn't seem to be enough to cause schizophrenia. Genetics seem to play a bigger role for this disorder. </p>
<p>Rather than paraphrase, I'll just quote my favorite <a href="http://did-research.org/" target="_blank">website on dissociation</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dissociation is a disconnection between one’s conscious awareness and aspects of one’s environment, experiences, or perceptions. Dissociation is very common, so much so that some claim that it is the third most common mental health symptom. Individuals can experience dissociation for many reasons. Causes or triggers can vary from temporary stress to clinical anxiety to chronic childhood trauma. In some cases, dissociation can serve as a coping mechanism and buffer individuals from overwhelming life circumstances. However, when dissociation is severe or long lasting, it can be disabling. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are different theories about PTSD. One theory is called Structural Dissociation. The really simple version of this theory is that when you are traumatized, a part of you that remembers the trauma becomes dissociated or disconnected from you and that is why it's harder to access those memories of the trauma, but the memories can resurface abruptly when you are triggered by things that remind you of the event. That part of you is very emotional and raw, sort of &quot;stuck&quot; in that traumatic period of your life. Healing from your trauma means reintegrating that part back into your whole self again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PTSD works, based on the Polyvagal theory, as a way to maintain safety. We have three tiers of regulating and have developed this manners through our evolution. </p>
<p>The reptilian brain (oldest/least evolved part of our brain) deals with threats by shutting down (Freeze part of fight/flight/freeze). Self protection through pooling blood to vital organs, depressing our system, and hoping we survive any impeding attack. This is where the dissociation comes into play. Shutting down is dissociation is much safer than managing the current moment.</p>
<p>The mammalian brain deals with things a bit differently. It pools blood to the extremities, jacks us up with adrenaline and gets us ready for action. Whether it's fight or flight we're ready to go. </p>
<p>The top tier of coping is social engagement. Iirc it's connected to our frontal lobe. We can reason and use logic to connect and cope through social engineering due to the evolution of our frontal lobe.</p>
<p>PTSD works like this. You experience trauma and your body/mind gets dysregulated and wants to avoid it happening again so it becomes hypervigiliant -- constantly scanning your surroundings. This becomes a problem because if you're hypervigiliant you're unable to convince your body/mind you're safe and so it's geared up for danger/threats and the top tier of coping gets harder to access because who has time to connect and regulate when there's a threat looming? </p>
<p>Sustained trauma in childhood leads to things like amygdala get biggers -- fear and anger becomes more frequent. The corpus collosum shrinks --left brain/right brain bridge. Our ability to &quot;time stamp&quot; the end of a negative experience gets weaker (I think this is from the hippocampus). So people that haven't experienced trauma would be more likely to feel at baseline quicker than someone that has had numerous traumas following a negative experience. </p>
<p>Hopefully this answers some questions and I'm not rambling. I'm pretty tired and waiting for this World Series game to end to go to bed.</p>
<p>Also, look into dissociative identity disorder. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about PTSD, but my research group discovered that Schizophrenia occurs during the third trimester when the embryo is undergoing neurogeneis, where neural progenitor cells go haywire before they migrate into the cortical plate. The cortical plate forms the cortex, which is known to make you who you are (all parts of the brain make you who you are in fact). You can read about our work at this <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-017-0054-x" target="_blank">Nature: Translational Psychiatry</a> link. And don't worry, it's not behind a pay-wall.</p>
<p>The ontogeny of a human is a product of inherited genomic blueprint, also famously known as the DNA, is endowed upon us by nature.  The ontogeny is also susceptible to changes from environmental factors both inside and outside the human being, called epigenomics, and is affected by his/her ’s nurturing. Stochastic event occurring around an organism affect nurturing to create changes in development. This implies that apart from the information encoded into your genes, you are suspectible to environmental factors. In this case, it could be your PTSD, effects of PTSD or upbringing. I can't shed light on epigenomic factors because most of my work involves cellular analysis, so perhaps someone else can could chime in.</p>
<p>To summarize, both genomic and epigenomic factors affect schizophrenia, and as of yet there isn't much we can do about it. Several research groups have identified the nuclear form of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 (nFGFR1) gene to be responsible for the erratic neural progenitor cells, and hopefully this is a step in the right direction towards preventing schiziophrenia.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I agree with other commentators who have said that the science is still shaky on all of these. We can find things that tend to occur in the brain at the same time as these disorders, but to say that these 'cause' the disorder isn't clear. There seem to be both genetic and environmental causes.</p>
<p>Now dissociation is a feeling of being &quot;out of your body&quot;, or feeling like the world isn't real, or you aren't real. It often passes quickly, and isn't too different from that strange feeling we can sometimes all feel if we're super tired or under the influence, but is more extreme and frequent for those with dissociative disorders.</p>
<p>Dissociation is often developed as a coping strategy for trauma, particularly from a young age. I might speak to that below, other people have written about the biological contributors, so I'll try to paint a picture of the psychological causes.</p>
<p>ELI5: when a young kid is scared a lot, they can react in a number of ways. Some become aggressive, and will tend to lash out. Some become very frightened all the time. Some feel sad and hopeless and stay hidden away. And some teach themselves a marvellous trick where they can go away from themselves, like a ghost floating out of their body, so it doesn't hurt.
These are all great ways to survive scary times, but when the child gets older and there is no reason to be scared, they can't help but use these same methods, so they can become a problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
