		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, just because two objects attract does not mean that they will hit each other. The sun attracts the earth, but that doesn't mean that the earth falls into the sun, it stays in a stable orbit. Gravity curves the trajectory of the earth towards the sun, but that results in a stable orbit instead of collision. The Coulomb force between two opposite charges follows the same power law as gravity and therefore comes with the same dynamics - so a negative charge can orbit a positive one.</p>
<p>But that's not the whole explanation for the atom case. What keeps the previously mentioned orbits stable is the fact that the two bodies have angular momentum relative to each other: If you would cancel the motion of the earth relative to the sun and then unfreeze it again, it would fall into the sun.</p>
<p>For atoms in the other hand we have stable configuration even without angular momentum. Here quantum mechanics comes into play: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle" target="_blank">uncertainty principle</a> dictates that the electron cannot be perfectly localized at the position of the nucleus in its groundstate, but is delocalized in some finite area around the nucleus. </p>
<p>Even so the electron still has some probability to be at the position of the nucleus with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_capture" target="_blank">observable consequences</a>. But if the electron doesn't undergo a reaction with the nucleus, then it this probability to be in the core does not really affect the properties of the atom and it will effectively have a shell with finite extension.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a couple of things going on.</p>
<p>Even in regular old boring classical physics, things which are attracted to each other don't have to hit each other. So the Earth doesn't have to collapse into the Sun, because the Earth is going sideways fast enough that it just falls around the Sun instead of into the Sun.</p>
<p>It's quite popular to think about the atom as being a bit like a solar system, with the nucleus being like the Sun and the electrons being like planets orbiting it, but this actually couldn't really work. An accelerating charged particle (where acceleration here doesn't just mean speeding up, it means any change in velocity, that is how fast or in which direction you're going) emits electromagnetic radiation. So if the electron really did orbit the nucleus like planets orbited the Sun, it would lose energy through radiation and crash into the nucleus.</p>
<p>What saves the day is quantum mechanics. The electron doesn't behave at all like a planet going round the sun. It's often said that in quantum mechanics things act like waves and particles; in this case, it doesn't really look much like a wave, because it's a wave that's forced to wrap around the nucleus, which is not really the sort of thing you see often.</p>
<p>Possibly the best metaphor to help grasp a bit what it's like is to think about a string fixed at each end. If you start that string vibrating, there are a few ways it prefers to vibrate, and these are called modes; you can see them <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Waves/imgwav/strhar.gif" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>An electron is a bit like that; because you're forcing it to wrap around the nucleus, it can only exist in one of a bunch of discrete modes, and even the most fundamental, lowest energy, mode is kind of a spherically-symmetric cloud around the nucleus, where the density of the cloud tells you how likely it is that the electron will be there. There is a chance the electron will be inside the nucleus, but it's much more likely to be elsewhere.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.falstad.com/qmatom/" target="_blank">Java applet</a> (physicists who write code have a surprising love for obsolete things) renders what the probability clouds (or orbitals) look like. n=1 is the lowest energy level, and the l number is angular momentum. These discrete energy levels are actually what determines chemical behaviour: you'll note that the l numbers are labelled s (l=0), p (l =1), d (l = 2), f (l = 3), and you might recall s, p, d, and f from chemistry. You may also notice a correlation with the periodic table; it gets wider as you go down the rows, just like there are more possible l states the bigger your n number is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's nothing like an orbit. </p>
<p>That metaphor is useful if you don't really care to know anything beyond the fact that atoms consist of a central nucleus surrounded by electrons. (Even so, they really needed to get that little diagram out of school textbooks decades ago.)</p>
<p>So it turns out that an electron around an atom is required to have certain specific energy levels. We're still good. The reasons for this are complex but partly have to do with things I'll discuss in just a second.</p>
<p>It also tuns out that certain other measurable properties are required or forced by various reasons, to take on a limited set of discreet values. Such as, angular momentum, magnetization, etc, etc.  This was all discovered experimentally by observing the energies of photons given off by various excited atoms.</p>
<p>I also think I need to go over the idea of momentum as a vector, that Is, a quantity that has both absolute magnitude, and direction. </p>
<p>Still with me on all this? Now to the meat of the issue. </p>
<p>It turns out there's no force or effect in the subatomic world that forces an electron to have any particular direction of momentum, or any particular location. To an electron one position can be valid as another. Or at least a certain range of positions. And a certain range of directions of momentum are equally valid. There is nothing stopping this. </p>
<p>In fact this must be the case.</p>
<p>A consequence of the mathematical relationship between position and momentum, is that the range of possible values of directional momentum is inversely proportional to the range of possible locations.  That is, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.</p>
<p>At best you can say that it's less likely for this odd creature we call an electron to be in some areas, and more likely for others.</p>
<p>This is what prevents the electron from colliding with the nucleus. That would mean it's range of possible locations was extremely, unbelievably small. In turn, that would force it's momentum to be impossibly large. </p>
<p>With some uncertainty, you can actually measure the momentum of electrons ejected from hydrogen atoms, for example. It turns out to be no where near the figure you'd need if you supposed the electron was confined to a space as small as the nucleus.</p>
<p>This means that the idea of an orbit which has one specific position and direction at one specific time, is illogical.</p>
<p>Experimentally, it was found that if a beam of electrons was bent by an electric or magnetic field, they would lose energy by emitting photons and slow relative to the source of the field.</p>
<p>So a pure particle electron orbiting in a classical sense would quickly lose kinetic energy and collide with the nucleus.</p>
<p>In a certain sense the electrons around an atom might be said to not accelerate at all. But if they have a net kinetic energy, how do they avoid escaping the atom without accelerating?  Who knows? This is probably more a result of the inability of the particle model to sufficiently describe electrons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrons dont orbit the nucleus, at least not in the way planets orbit a star. Electrons exist in a 3-d probability wave. This wave is larger than a nucleus, this prevents the electron from &quot;falling in.&quot; As others have saide the electron can be found in the nucleus as the probabillity wave indicates there is a non zero chance that an elctron will be there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
