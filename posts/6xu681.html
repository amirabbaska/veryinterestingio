		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have ATM's in my bars and restaurant. You can choose to lease or buy a machine. I always choose to buy as the return is better. I go through a company that manages the transactions which is supplied by the guy which provided the ATM. We charge 2.75 a transaction and they take .25¢ of every transaction. I fill the machine with cash myself and there is a kinda dumb rule to somehow prevent money laundering that the cash that I put in I have to first deposit into the bank before I put it into the machine. So I literally will walk into a bank with $20,000 in twenties and deposit it and then withdraw the same money five seconds later and put it into the machine.  </p>
<p>I don't see why you couldn't have an ATM in your house, but you would lose money on the transaction fees. I'm sure there is a way to setup a machine that would just spit out money at your hearts desire, seems like an expensive novelty item though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Source: I'm a controller at a bank. </p>
<p>ATMs work like a grocery store. It's all volume. The cost to pay someone to refill the ATM will likely cost as much as you make on fees unless you are in a very active ATM location (casino, strip club, low income grocery store, tourist area of a major city) for most ATMs, 10 transactions in a day would be on the high side. At an average of about $80 per transaction, that's $800/day. Most ATMs hold about 6-8k so you are refilling about 2.5 times a month. </p>
<p>Now you're sayin &quot;well you're making $35 a day! It doesn't cost that much to refill!&quot; But ATMs only make money on non-clients of the operating bank. If you bank with ABC Bank and use only their ATMs, you don't pay fees. The bank makes nothing, the ATM network doesn't get a part of that fee. So really it's more like $10/day/machine, split between the bank and the processor. For someone to use an armored car to transport cash is about $100/hr. So that breaks even. The bank basically gets free advertising out of it. We have a nice sign that everyone has to walk by and our clients get free usage of an ATM. </p>
<p>The Operator gets half of the fee revenue and that covers their costs to keep people employed to maintain, clean, set up, move, all of the machines. They basically break even on the day-to-day keeping up of the machines. </p>
<p>What they do have is an &quot;interchange fee&quot; paid to the operator. A few cents per transaction on every transaction paid to them by the card company to use their card. So our bank uses the same network operator as every other local bank. And while we only have 15 machines with our name on them, the operator has about 1500 machines. They're doing 15,000 transactions per day, making about 6 cents per transaction. That's $900, 365 days a year. Or about $350,000. The more machines they can add, the more that base number goes up, the more they make. </p>
<p>To give a more complete answer to your other questions, the answer is both yes and no. </p>
<p>A bar can buy an ATM, contract with an ATM company, and fill the ATM themselves. But this is VERY frowned upon. Filling your own ATM in a privately owned establishment is basically a big red arrow that points at your place with a banner flying behind a plane that says &quot;WERE LAUNDERING MONEY IN HERE!&quot;. </p>
<p>So yes, you CAN do it, but expect to be audited and expect your bank to probably not bank you if they find out. The regulators go apeshit on banks that bank people that own ATMs to the point where it literally costs more to bank them than the bank makes. The bank has to basically hire someone to just monitor those accounts. So don't do that. If you want an ATM at your bar, go to the bank and ask them to put one in for you. It will be free to you and breakeven to the bank. Hell, if you're a good enough client and have enough volume, you may make a few bucks on it. But not much. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So we have ATMs at the casino I work at so it isn't quite the same as bars but I can shed some light.</p>
<p>The owner of the ATM is the one who collects the fees, services the machines and refills them (via armored car service).  We drive enough business that we don't need to pay someone to have those ATMs placed.  The owners make money because we create a demand enough to make any machines placed profitable.  In addition most of the money withdrawn is spent in the building so the casino benefits from having them placed there.</p>
<p>So we are completely separated from the machines in that sense.  It benefits business to have them all over but we make no money directly from their use. </p>
<p>I doubt very much you could have an ATM at your house outside of maybe just buying an old out of order machine.  It wouldn't be worth it to the company to place one there and stocking money into it wouldn't be a safe investment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can actually answer this. I used to manage a store that had private atms. We acquired them through a third party who handled maintenance and all the specifics with the banks. But they were filled by store management with company cash that was recorded on a spreadsheet that was audited by one of the accounts payable people every day. We made a substantial amount of the fee that added to store profits. So basically it just was added in as a cash inflow on our balance sheet. Unless it broke then you had to eat the cost and it screwed your quarter to a degree.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
