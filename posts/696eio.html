		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am going to assume you are talking about a magnetic confinement fusion reactor, in which the fusion happens in a plasma that is contained by strong magnetic fields.</p>
<p>If the superconducting magnets that maintain the magnetic fields suddenly stop being superconducting (a condition known as quench, which is very bad for the magnets), then the magnetic field will weaken or break down completely. This allows the plasma to expand, lowering temperature and pressure, and likely already stopping the fusion reaction.</p>
<p>Moments later, the plasma starts to collide with the inner wall of the fusion reactor, cooling down even more rapidly now that it is in contact with it - and also ruining the wall, and potentially burning a hole into it to destroy other parts of the reactor.</p>
<p>Result: One ruined fusion reactor, plus if there is a burnthrough possibly deuterium and tritium (or rather, after combustion with air, heavy and superheavy water vapor) and helium being vented to the outside.</p>
<p>The thing is, a fusion reactor going out of control is a lot less dangerous than a fission reactor doing the same, because it needs a lot of effort and control to even get the fusion reaction to happen - fission, on the other hand, happens basically on its own once you have enough fissile material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it would just turn off. fusion reactors are banging together hydrogen to create helium, and that isn't something that can happen by itself the way fission can. there's no chain reaction. if the conditions inside the reactor change significantly, it simply stops doing fusion.</p>
<p>a more theatrical failure would be a loss of containment. the stuff inside the reactor is so hot that it would destroy literally anything it came in contact with, so the reaction materials have to be held by an electromagnetic field. if that field fails, all of the super hot stuff just spreads out, obliterating whatever it touches until it cools down. since the contents of the reactor are only a few grams (for perspective, a paperclip is about 1 gram), this isn't threatening to the outside world. it could destroy the very expensive equipment used to create the reaction chamber, but not much else. </p>
<p>somewhat amusingly, the equipment used to create the reaction is more dangerous than the reaction itself. enormously powerful electromagnets, high pressure hydrogen, power systems measured in <em>trillions</em> of watts. these systems could fail, and you would have a more conventional industrial disaster. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Magnetic Confinement:
The reason why fusion reaction doesn't work (currently) is because they are unstable. So being stable is necessary to make them work.</p>
<p>Stars:
For stars the opposite is true, stars maintain their stability by their fusion. When they start to fail gravity takes over and eventually the star collapses in on itself and this causes the star to go supernova (explodes).</p>
<p>Difference:
The reason for the difference is that in magnetic confinement, the fusion is a result of the extreme squeezing force of the magnetic fields. The hydrogen is crushed to the point of fusion. If the confinement fails, the hydrogen is no longer under the massive crush of the magnetic fields and therefore can no longer fuse.</p>
<p>In a star the fusion is the result of the massive crushing force of gravity. The gravity is so massive because of the huge amount of hydrogen. As the hydrogen fuses it throws off massive amounts of energy which tends to counteract the gravity, therefore at a certain point the outward flow of energy(photons etc) balances the inward pressure of gravity. If the fuel starts to burn out, the pressure of the gravity increases until it reaches a point where it reignites in a massive explosion.</p>
<p>Note:
There are other ways for fusion to occur. The above only applies to man made magnetic confinement and stars and even then they are not the only factors involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The requirements for fusion are very high. A breach would cause the whole system to cool and lose energy to the point the reaction would cease very quickly. </p>
<p>Fusion much safer than Fission. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people have talked about magnetic confinement systems. The other type of fusion reactor is inertial confinement. It works by using lasers to implode a pellet containing a fraction of a gram of fuel. Essentially, they're repeatedly detonating tiny fusion bombs. Since it's not meant to be stable in the first place, there are no risks from instability.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
