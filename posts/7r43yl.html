		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Differentiation is a way of saying the change in one variable as another variable changes. So on a graph with x and y, for every unit x moves, y might move a certain other amount. Instead of saying &quot;for every unit&quot; you can squeeze it down to an infinitely small level, and the notation for that is dy/dx, or &quot;change in y per change in x&quot;. dy is like an infinitely small division of y, and dx is like an infinitely small division of x. In calculus, you are able to assign relative values to things this small.</p>
<p>So for any point on a function, you can take the derivative and see how much the y variable is changing with respect to the x variable. In other words, the rate of change of y with respect to x. This is what is commonly known as slope. If the slope is 2, then I know that if the slope doesn't change, in one x unit I'll have increased 2 y units. Differentiation lets us discover this slope in a graph that isn't necessarily linear.</p>
<p>You can also use an x-y coordinate plane to model things in the real world. Perhaps your x coordinate models time, and the y coordinate models distance. Then your slope is distance over time! That's speed! (cough cough.. rate of change) For a function x(t) modeling position of a point over time, dx(t)/dt would provide velocity &quot;v(t)&quot; of that point over time. Further, d^2 x(t)/dt^2 would provide &quot;a(t)&quot;, acceleration!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A derivative is just rate of change at a given point.  Different orders of derivatives tell different information about rate of change at any point. First derivatives show rate of change in function value (slope), second derivatives show rate of change in slope (direction of curvature), third derivatives shows rate of change in the direction of curvature, and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There could be a more subtle interpretation of &quot;rate of change of a function&quot;.  If the function is the position of each point on a vibrating string, for example, it's a function of two variables: f(x,t).</p>
<p>The &quot;rate of change&quot; of that function could refer to the derivative with respect to time:  v(x,t) = ∂f(x,t)/∂t</p>
<p>So in this interpretation, &quot;rate of change&quot; still refers to a derivative, but it's specifically a time derivative.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're pretty synonymous. If you want to get super mathematically and semantically technical, maybe rate of change may allow for multiple variables to change, whereas differentiation is always with respect to one variable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
