		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This gets asked often and you have a slight misconception. Telephone quality has remained the same, because what's called Plain Old Telephone Service (or POTS) <em>is</em> pretty much the same because it's ubiquitous and it works. </p>
<p>But the technology that's used for what telephones are used for <em>has</em> improved - we have <em>other</em> technologies that far eclipse POTS and <em>are</em> available. ISDN, for example, has been available for decades - ISDN calls are so crystal-clear that many phone companies <em>add artificial noise</em> to the line because people were assuming the line was dead! But if you wanted ISDN, you had to pay a <em>lot</em> more, whereas POTS was already running to your apartment and mandated to be cheap! </p>
<p>Nowadays you can also get phone services through your cable company, or use a cellphone, etc. Many people are switching away from POTS. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have answered the first half of the question - that it's a limitation of the current systems that are already in place - I'm a board op for a radio station, so I can answer the second half of your question:</p>
<p>We are running plain old analog phone systems just like you'd find in someone's house.  Our station doesn't use anything fancy like VoIP, and even if we did, it depends on the other side of the call to have VoIP as well to have high-fidelity voice (I.E. Skype is VoIP, so a Skype-to-Skype call sounds just fine, only limited by the quality of the microphone (and any compression algorithms).  In phone-to-Skype (or other VoIP system), the phone is the lowest common denominator, so you're limited by that technology).</p>
<p>Some cell phone carriers have &quot;HD calling&quot; (my carrier uses VoLTE) and as long as the other phone supports &quot;HD calling&quot;, you can have a high-quality phone call as long as they are on the same network (i.e. no cross-network HD calling is supported as of yet).  There's a catch, though, and that is that VoIP and VoLTE are not compatible with each other.  The difference between VoLTE and VoIP is that VoLTE only runs through the carrier, whereas VoIP runs through the internet.  Unless those two converge somehow, a cell phone calling an analog landline or VoIP phone will not be able to support any sort of high-fidelity audio being transferred.</p>
<p>Until VoIP is a norm and cell phone carriers allow for cross-network HD calling (both between carriers and over the internet), call quality will probably always sound like it does.</p>
<p>edit: clarity about HD calling and VoIP</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rise of the cell phone is what has led to potato quality calls - calls are all essentially data on cellular, and since everyone shares the airwaves, there is a large incentive to compress this data and make it as small as possible, leading to the poor quality calls.</p>
<p>The Atlantic had an article awhile back speculating this is one reason for the great decline in phone calls.  This article also explains the problem of call quality.</p>

<p>Jon Gertner's book &quot;The Idea Factory&quot; documents AT&amp;T's Bell Labs   and the amazing technologies they developed during the 20th century.   Fabulous book.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human hearing can take place from around 20-20,000 hertz (since you're 5, I'll tell that means 20-20,000 cycles per second).</p>
<p>That comes in handy when you want to listen to bird songs, or enjoy the rumbling of distant thunder, or enjoy the complexities of music.  But when one human wants to talk to another they need only a small portion of that frequency.  If 2 people are talking over the phone, 300-3300 hertz is plenty good enough.  With just that small sample they can recognize each other's voices, read the emotions of the spoken word, etc.</p>
<p>The sound quality over a phone line could be improved, but remember that phone service should be cheap enough so that most everyone could have it, phone service needs to be compatible from one section of the country to another, and that by using that small section of the human voice frequency equipment can be constructed to provide voice service more efficiently (for example, equipment can be programmed to carry several dozen voice conversations over a single line by sampling and multiplexing the conversations, saving the expense of stringing new wires over miles for the new customers).  </p>
<p>There's no demand for any better sound quality over voice lines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
