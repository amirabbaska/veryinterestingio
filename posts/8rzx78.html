<p>Edit: Some people have asked what I mean by &quot;difference&quot;, and I really don't know. I intentionally left it vague because I'm interested in any potential ways that meal-distribution affects the body. My motivation for asking isn't necessarily weight loss but overall health; I'm generally happy with what I eat, but my eating schedule is all over the place. Sometimes I'll have a large-ish breakfast, sometimes just a yogurt, sometimes nothing. Sometimes I'll make it to dinner only having had an apple in the morning.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You will find that many sources will have somewhat conflicting but also corroborative conclusions on meal frequency, similar to that of sleep cycle adaptation.  The ELI5 bottom line is that the human body is a master at adapting to and getting the most out of most situations.  That being said, there are a few fundamental differences in your scenario.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mainly, forgoing a meal in order to extend a fast does allow for additional time for certain hormones to baseline.  For example, insulin is the most popular discussion point when it comes to extended fasting.  While it depends greatly on the individual, insulin levels tend to fall to their baseline anywhere between 8-12 hours in a fasted state.  Often diets recommend 16+ hours to be absolutely sure.  This period of time is not long enough for the body to enter a sustained fasted state.  A true sustained fast (3-4 days or more) is an entirely different matter, but this topic isn't about that anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, it has been posited that eating many small but frequent meals helps to keep the natural metabolic rate high.  This is also not necessarily the case.  It is true that fasting will reduce your metabolism, but this is a logical flaw in thinking because the dietary benefits of extended fasting outweigh the lower metabolic rate.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A periodic (once in a while but routine) extended fast allows certain hormonal cycles to reset when you have a major change to your schedule/circadian rhythm.  This is why it is highly, highly recommended that you fast for ~16 hours when you are suffering from jet lag.  The reason behind this is simple, your daily rhythm is governed by a system of hormonal cycles which are affected by diet and sleep.  Ghrelin and leptin, the hormones in control of hunger/satiation naturally rise and fall with your sleep and dietary cycle respectively.  Giving your body an opportunity to line up its circadian rhythm with its other systems, such as hunger, greatly helps to speed up the adjustment time required for a new environment.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is also the simple, practical matter of how much food you can or cannot eat in a sitting/over a period of time.  Lean bulking with an IF diet is extremely difficult (IMO) to maintain due to the time restriction alone, whereas small meals may be just as if not more frustrating to cram into your schedule.  Whichever method will provide the most <em>consistency</em> in your ability to eat mostly healthy foods towards your specific dietary goal will be better in the long run.</p>
</li>
<li>There is always a subset of people who argue the &quot;ancestor diet&quot; in that our modern eating habits are all misaligned for which our bodies were evolutionary designed.  They state that it should be normal to fast for 2-4 days and eat large meals on a periodic basis, using the type of nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle that humans have spent millions of years perfecting.  While it is true that for the vast majority of human history the modern diet was not a thing, still IMO the body is more than capable of adjusting to a modern agrarian diet if we simply restrict our over-consumption of certain macronutrients as evidenced by the simple fact that <em>lifespan</em> has not decreased over the ages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, I am sure you know this but the whole &quot;breakfast is the most important meal of the day&quot; was a straight up ad campaign that is not based on any sort of hard science.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical doctor that specializes in food, nutrition, and preventive medicine. There was a pretty interesting clinical study that studied this exact concept, the isocaloric consumption of one versus two meals separated by time. Metabolic parameters most relevant to insulin resistance/sensitivity were more favorable in the group eating one meal versus two meals separated by time. </p>
<p>People really anchor onto the simple theory of “calories in versus calories out,” as allegedly supported by the first law of thermodynamics. As a medical doctor with a degree in physics, this is a problematic approach to health and well-being, which if I can summarize in one sentence, it’s that calories-in-vs-out does not account for hormones or our endocrine system (among numerous other aspects of our health; ie it’s not just about obesity and weight gain). </p>
<p>Intermittent fasting, which is distinct and dissimilar from a “low-calorie” or “reduced calorie” approach, has demonstrated the ability to improve insulin sensitivity, which is the crux of metabolic syndrome, and thus, someone’s propensity to develop obesity, type II diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers (breast, colon, esophageal, prostate) and perhaps Alzheimer’s and other inflammatory conditions. All foods, to a greater and lesser extent, cause the secretion of hormones, chiefly insulin, which highlights the difference between intermittent fasting and a low calorie diet (no hormone secretion while fasting, and some hormone secretion even with small meals). </p>
<p>With all of that said, it does not mean eating two meals is unhealthy, and in many normal-weight individuals, I suspect the benefits are negligible. Keep in mind however, approx 25% of normal-weight Americans are insulin-resistant. By further separating meals and frequency of eating, you delay and prolong the secretion of insulin, which is beneficial for many people. </p>
<p>TLDR: It’s not all about calories, but also the timing and concentration of hormones secreted. </p>
<p>Edit: I’m also not promoting anyone to binge eat at any one meal, but instead, I want to highlight the importance of timing and food consumption. Once again, the clinical evidence suggests that meal timing may be more important than meal size. More practically, this translates into helpful information regarding the problem of consuming food and snacks all throughout the day, especially when they are highly processed foods that result in consistently high levels of insulin. </p>
<p>Sources:
Increased meal frequency resulted in greater abdominal fat and fatty liver (which is instrumental in the development of insulin resistance) independent of caloric content and body weight gain, <strong>whereas increasing meal size did not</strong>. This study suggests that snacking, a common feature in the Western diet, independently contributes to hepatic steatosis and obesity (insulin resistance). <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668862" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>Eating a single meal per day resulted in significantly more fat loss compared to eating three meals per day, <strong>despite the same caloric intake</strong>. No evidence of muscle loss was found, although there were side-effects reported, such as hunger. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17413096" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>A more technical study demonstrating my primary point that intermittent fasting resulted in less insulin secretion and less insulin resistance than continuous caloric restriction. Overall, similar weight loss and metabolic improvements. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20921964" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>Regular fasting (and thus, regularly lowered insulin levels) leading to improvements in insulin sensitivity. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Halberg+Effect+of+intermittent+fasting+and+refeeding+on+insulin+action+in+healthy+men" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference in metabolic rate or insulin resistance afforded by changing the frequency of one's meals is going to be miniscule compared to the effects of sticking to the desired calorie count. </p>
<p>If fasting in the morning keeps you feeling more satisfied by meals, less hungry, and generally feeling good then go ahead and do that. If you get hangry without breakfast and end up hoovering up a sharing-sized bag of chocolate* then go ahead and eat your breakfast. The main problem with restricting calories is that food is delicious, and eating it is fun. If you can find a way of sticking to your calorie count without being sad, do that.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, some people will eat only 800 (example number) calories in their 2nd meal and so fasting will result in a lower calorie intake. This leads to weight loss. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
