		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>DNA is a lot like a cookbook that your body uses to brew proteins. Proteins are themselves made from amino acids that are glued together. These proteins can have a lot of functions, some act as lego that your body uses to build structures, others function as tiny machines that your body uses to move energy and other proteins around, even others help defend you against bad guys from outside your body.</p>
<p>DNA is a lot like a language which has only four letters (C, G, A, T) and uses only three letter words. Special little machines in your cells can read these three letter words and mix the proper amino acid ingredients together to cook proteins. In doing so, they make new machines and building blocks for your body's cells to use.</p>
<p>When we say we have &quot;mapped the genome&quot;, we mean that we have read the entire cook book of several individuals, and written down the recipes in the correct order. </p>
<p>However, just because we know how to cook something does not mean we know how it works or what every recipe is for. A lot of current research is focused on understanding what the function of a lot of the recipes is. This is important for several reasons. One is that recipes sometimes become damaged. A lot of times you hear about a genetic illness, it is because the recipe for a particular mini-machine or protein has become damaged, and then your body loses some function.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for the kind words, all!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anyone with a child's microscope and a steady hand can see that there are 46 human chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs, and that they look like striped, knotted skeins of yarn when stained; anyone with a child's chemistry set can determine that these chromosomes are made of phosphorous, a modified (deoxygenated) version of a sugar called &quot;ribose&quot;, and four nitrogen-containing, high-pH chemicals (or <em>bases</em>): guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine. (These all rhyme with <em>ween</em>.) Given that we isolate these base-containing molecules as acids, and given that we isolate them from the cell's nucleus, we call these molecules &quot;Deoxyribonucleic acid.&quot;</p>
<p>Anyone with a sophomore's biochemistry kit can determine that different, <em>ordered</em> combinations of DNA's four bases results in different proteins, when exposed to the enzymes and chemical environment of the cell; ask a doctor, and you can easily learn that many human traits (especially diseases) can be diagnosed by whether your body synthesizes a normal, altered, or degenerate form of a particular protein.</p>
<p>Those with the altered <em>protein</em> must have altered <em>DNA</em> producing it; since such traits are heritable by one's offspring, chromosomes must be the mechanism of heredity. (There's other evidence for this, of course - this isn't the order that these things were discovered.) Given that the traits are passed on to new <em>generations</em>, we call the part of the DNA that produces a particular protein the <em>gene</em> for that protein.</p>
<p>What remains is to know <em>where</em> on each chromosome each gene is located - how far from the beginning or the end, and how much of the chromosome each gene takes up. The view of the chromosomes from the microscopes could only go so far down, and the view of the bases from chemistry could only go so far up. For decades there as an enormous gap in between into which we could not see.</p>
<p>That was really hard to figure out, and it took a lot of chemistry and new machines and new computer algorithms, but once we did it, we had an arrangement of a human's chromosomes and what they contained and where they contained it, and when you <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38&amp;lastVirtModeType=default&amp;lastVirtModeExtraState=&amp;virtModeType=default&amp;virtMode=0&amp;nonVirtPosition=&amp;position=chr9%3A133252000-133280861&amp;hgsid=575792781_de5JNIJAbFGOTd3LP5n43ljEill1" target="_blank">plot it out to look at it</a> you can think of it as a <em>map</em>. So when we say we've mapped the human genome, we mean the same thing almost as if we'd said &quot;we've mapped Toledo, OH&quot; - we've gone there and figured out what's there and where it's located relative to everything else. Which is not to say that we know <em>everything about it</em>, just like how a map of Toledo doesn't tell you everything there is to know about Toledo, either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of having landed on North America, without knowing what it is, and wanting to report back on what you have come across. Mountains here, a bay over there, a desert down there, etc. That is a map. Similarly with chromosomes, with a whole bunch of markers on each chromosome, specific genes can be located between point &quot;A&quot; and point &quot;B&quot; on chromosome &quot;12&quot;, say. </p>
<p>There is another century of work figuring out what it all means. But now there is a latitude/longitude system of sorts for the chromosomes. The map is 20 years old, they've been sequenced as well now, so we have a very good idea of what chromosomes look like. </p>
<p>For context, it was discovered long ago that human genomes are 99.9% the same between people. A high level map of one person's genome works pretty well on another person. The differences between people show up in the remaining 0.1%. </p>
<p>Source: Nth co-author on two of the mapping papers in the 90s. The North American analogy was our leader's tutorial for the curious. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human beings have a number of chromosomes with DNA in them. There is also DNA in the mitochondria. The DNA is a tremendously long chain of nucleic acids which specify the construction and the operation of human beings. The entire length of the DNA has been read and recorded in libraries for at least five individuals. </p>
<p>These DNA sequences are on file in accessible NIH databases. </p>
<p>The DNA  sequence of almost all species on Earth has not been mapped.</p>
<p>Having read and recorded this sequence does not mean we understand it. You could spend your life with a computer accessing these libraries trying to understand a small part of it. The DNA sequences make up genes which were identified long ago before we even knew that DNA was involved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It means that for the entirety of human DNA, we know which parts encode which genes. A gene is a plan for producing a specific protein, possibly with variations. A protein is a large molecule, and pretty much everything in our bodies is controlled by the interactions of various proteins.</p>
<p>However, we do <em>not</em> know what all of those mapped proteins actually do, and especially not how they interact. We only know that for a very small part of all the genes that were mapped.</p>
<p>So we're still far away from being able to say &quot;this DNA will produce a human with exactly these characteristics&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
