		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is really just the humidity and temperature that makes the air feel &quot;thick&quot; or less oxygen saturated. In addition, more humid air can transport its temperature better and more humid air smells more. That's why dogs can smell stuff better on rainy days. The CO2 level is not noticeable different. There was a video about a guy in a chamber where they lowered the oxygen level slowly. And the guy had to put a oxygen mask on when he notices. He didn't notice anything. Someone had to put it on him. Can't find the video.. And sorry for my bad English </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our research group has been involved on matters of indoor air quality for many years now. There are two main aspects to consider in answering your question:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is only one air! That means, all the atmosphere and all indoor spaces are connected and, with the exclusion of very special airtight spaces, in general you have to assume that there are continuous exchanges of air between indoors and outdoors. This justifies other peoples' answers here. The bulk general composition of the air will be the same (nitrogen and oxygen, mainly).</p>
</li>
<li>Despite the above, there are many more compounds and components in the air that have a very important role in both the perception of 'freshness' and the potential health impacts of being in contact with the air. Apart from things like humidity (i.e. water in gas form, dissolved in the air) and CO2, the large majority of the other compounds are cumulatively known as 'air pollutants', regardless of being harmful or not to humans. Even though these are generally present in small amounts/concentrations, frequently measured in 'parts per million' (ppm) or even smaller measuring units, they can still be perceived by people in multiple ways, be it by smell, 'staleness', lung and eye irritation, allergies, etc..</li>
</ol>
<p>The World Health Organisation has established a list of <a href="http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/128169/e94535.pdf" target="_blank">particularly relevant indoor air pollutants</a> that we should take special care about. For instance, one important pollutant is nitrogen dioxide (NO2) which originates from high-temperature combustion processes such as internal combustion engines in our cars, trucks, etc. Despite originating mainly outdoors, NO2 can still be problematic indoors, particularly in urban areas, because air will get in the house from the outside bringing with it its air pollutants. These will then be added to the pollutants that originate indoors, be it from people (yes, we emit a number of so called bioeffluents!), cooking, cleaning products, air-fresheners, perfumes, construction materials, furniture, and many other human activities. There are literally thousands of chemicals around us all the time, but the probability of these being present in higher concentrations indoors is higher due to an accumulation effect. This will only be exacerbated in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.</p>
<p>Regarding CO2, the average world level has now gone above the 400 ppm mark and levels indoors can frequently climb to over 1000 ppm. While this is not damaging to health, it is generally a good indicator of deficient ventilation in regards to a space occupancy. The main sources of CO2 indoors are people. You need a minimum amount of air renovation to dilute their exhaled CO2 along with many of the other bioeffluents. If CO2 levels are too high, then it is likely that you will also have high levels of many other compounds which will make the air feel heavy. The perception is particularly intense when someone comes into a room with these high levels. People in the space will generally not notice the gradual degradation of air quality in the space.</p>
<p>Note that in many cities outdoor air quality can become very poor at times. Some Chinese and Indian cities have been particularly hit these past few years. In these cases, it is actually better for your health to stay inside and try to keep outdoor pollutants from getting in (i.e. do not open windows and refrain from opening doors too often). I have also read about the health impacts of going for a run or cycling in urban streets. When you exercise you inhale a lot more air and if you are doing it close to the tailpipes of cars and trucks, you will be absorbing very high loads of pollutants through your lungs. At the end of your exercise, you might actually have damaged more your health from breathing bad quality air than what you gained from exercising.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dry air both inside and outside is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon.  The only real differences are in the very trace compounds present in minute quantities, which make different smells.</p>
<p>Does it make a difference? Well, it's bad for your health to sit on your butt inside all day, although the reasons why have nothing to do air quality. So as health/lifestyle advice the saying is sound, even if &quot;fresh air&quot; doesn't mean all that much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
