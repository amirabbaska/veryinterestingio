		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody knows. For all we know, it could be unknowable. Some suggest that consciousness is emergent, that is, given a sufficiently complex set of instructions on how to respond to external stimuli, one will &quot;think&quot; to decide how to respond before doing anything. Others suggest that our consciousness is inherent to our beings, that is, there exists some part of us that contains our consciousness which would exist regardless of our physical complexity (call it a soul, if you will.)</p>
<p>The problem with emergent consciousness is that it suggests a lack of free will in order to gain agency over our lives. If you are nothing more than a collection of responses to stimuli, then you can control your life, but how can you make decisions?</p>
<p>The problem with souls is that if it is presumed to be independent of the body, that is, non-physical in nature, which it must be in order to be independent of your physical complexity and to exist outside your physical body, then they cannot be measured or observed by any physical instruments. However, if they cannot affect anything physical, then they logically cannot affect your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One theory is that there are tiny magnetic fields around each one of the brain's ~100 billion cells (aka neurons, which themselves are very highly interconnected).  As the neurons activate (as information flows through them) these little magnetic fields interact and add up with one another as well as subtract. It is theorised that in this interaction, the mind, consciousness and many other interesting things exist.  If you wish to know more about this, the topic is Holonomic brain theory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no guarantee that the brain creates the mind. It's also possible that the mind (conciousness) is what creates reality as we know it for each of us - including the brain. Whatever actual objective reality might be like has no reason to be the same three dimensional space as we experience it.</p>
<p>Here's an interesting presentation about all of this: <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/donald_hoffman_do_we_see_reality_as_it_is/transcript" target="_blank">https://www.ted.com/talks/donald_hoffman_do_we_see_reality_as_it_is/transcript</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
