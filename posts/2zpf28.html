		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're asking about is part of a model proposed by John Macdonald. He proposed that a combination of three behaviours is predictive of psychopathy: fire setting, cruelty to animals, and enuresis (bedwetting). This model was known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macdonald_triad" target="_blank">Macdonald triad</a>.</p>
<p>While this idea gets a lot of play time in pop culture, it's not been backed up by research. Bedwetting is not <a href="http://www.scientificjournals.org/journals2009/articles/1441.pdf" target="_blank">predictive of psychopathy</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: Some have rightly pointed out that there are issues with that linked paper (small, likely unrepresentative sample, no normative data). A quick search turned up <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/law/18/4/577/" target="_blank">this community based study</a> which finds no significant effects of childhood environment on psychopathy in later life. The takeaway should be that psychopathy is a much more complex trait that the Macdonald triad may have suggested, and it's going to be hard to pin down specific factors that result in psychopathy and criminality (not all people who are high in psychopathy are going to be criminals and vice versa).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Older&quot; bedwetting is also seen in kids who've been abused (sexually or otherwise). Given than psychopaths are more likely to have been neglected or abused as children, I wonder if some of the incidence of bedwetting past the normal ages is related to abuse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Graduate degree in psychology here, and the information to follow was garnered from an in-service while I was working at a psychiatric hospital.</p>
<p>One theory of sociopathy is rooted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erikson%27s_stages_of_psychosocial_development" target="_blank">Erik Erikson's stages of psychosocial development</a>. This theory suggests that sociopaths never made it past the first stage of development (Trust vs Mistrust) in infancy, and are therefore stuck in a place where they do not trust the world because severe neglect ensured that their needs were never met by their parents or caregivers. This can lead an individual to view other people as objects, not people, as they can only rely on themselves to meet their own needs. </p>
<p>The speaker giving the in-service provided the example of an adolescent boy who lived in a residential facility he was working in who displayed many disturbing antisocial behaviors. They tried a counterintuitive approach, not punishing him for his unacceptable behaviors, but giving him everything (within their abilities) he needed and wanted without expecting anything in return - much like you do with an infant who can only cry and occasionally throw things to let you know they have a need that is not being met. </p>
<p>After some weeks or months (I can't recall specifically) of this, the boy woke up one morning and refused to get out of bed or do anything he was asked, saying &quot;No!&quot; and basically throwing a temper tantrum at further prodding. Essentially, he was a toddler now, graduating to the &quot;Autonomy vs Shame and Doubt&quot; stage most of us master between the ages of 2-4. He no longer displayed antisocial behaviors after this.</p>
<p>It was suggested that people stuck in <em>this</em> stage of psychosocial development are often described by Borderline Personality Disorder.</p>
<p>But I digress. If you accept that many sociopaths (which includes serial killers as a subset) are stuck in this infancy stage of psychosocial development, it would not be difficult to associate bedwetting as a trait, as toilet training is generally paired with the next stage of psychosocial development that was never dealt with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Very very simplified. But a possible connection. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
