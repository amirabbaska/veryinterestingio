<p>Edit: Before commenting and telling me to read the fucking article about this, please read the SECOND PART OF THE SENTENCE. </p>
<p>I mean, Jesus. The question is about ALL the people who were on the malfunctioning machine, not the one who claimed a jackpot</p>
<p>Snapchat and Reddit crossing the streams today. Shout out to Will Honeywell, Calvin H, Giannigreco, Ethan_Fedors, Cody, Dawson, and Leo for entertaining the hell out of me on Snapchat.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Don't forget tomorrow is Reddit's Global Meetup Day and AZ redditors are meeting at Encanto Park. Find me and let's do a shot.</p>
<p>EDIT 3: This is the answer to the specific question I asked, although I really enjoyed learning so much today.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Software developer here,</p>
<p>I wrote software for these one-armed bandits for ~5 years. Detecting a fault in the machine isn't too hard, I suppose, though I never had to do it. If the machine is a &quot;participation&quot; game, then some of the winnings of each game are paid out to the manufacturer, because just making and selling machines isn't profitable enough to stay in business. The catch is the manufacturer pays out the jackpots, not the casino. So the casino doesn't give a shit if you hit 10 jackpots in a row, and neither do the commissioners, for them, they're just doing their job.</p>
<p>When a jackpot is hit, the whole bank of machines are roped off and kept under guard. A poor (EDIT:) sonofabitch engineer or two are dragged out of bed in the middle of the night, or pulled out of their children's birthday party, whatever, and they're stuffed into a plane with all sorts of gear and shit. They will systematically diagnose, test, and dismantle that machine down to the rivets to make sure it wasn't tampered with or flawed. It's the company's responsibility to prove the win was false if they want to save their cash.</p>
<p>But even the manufacturer plans for payouts, it's all part of the budget. My employer designed the math behind their games so one of their participation games, in the entire market, like a Wide Area Progressive, would hit every 6 months. We had one WAP hit twice in one month just after release once, the execs puckered up so tight they shit diamonds to cover the bills that day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume you are referring to the $43M ticket from the other day. </p>
<p>One aspect is the nature of the error. That $43M ticket could never have happened under normal operation. The maximum payout for that machine was $10k. So, a factor of 4,000 smaller than the erroneous ticket. That makes it clear it is an error. A single spin not winning is a pretty normal state of affairs. It may well be in error, but it would be very difficult to prove either way. </p>
<p>Then, we put all sorts of checks into those machines. When it attempted to issue the ticket the server will (most likely) have replied that it couldn't issue a ticket that large. At that point the machine has a balance it can't pay out and will go into alarm. At that point the machine will have been rebooted.</p>
<p>Also against that girl is the fact the only photo is of her collecting her &quot;winnings&quot;. Why take a selfie of the boring ticket print screen rather than the jackpot screen itself? Seems to me like the error occurred well after the game ended, she hit collect <em>then</em> something went wrong. </p>
<p>We do our best to make sure that nothing goes wrong with the machines, but errors do slip through. The logic for us is that it is better to fail in favour of the machine. People who are down money will complain and tell us. Then we can check the logs for the exact time they won, see what went wrong and how much they are owed. It may take longer but it can be put right. If we fail in favour of the player then odds are they will never tell us, or worse they will attempt to repeat the circumstances for free money. It could be months before we even find out something is wrong. This leads into what /u/mredding said - if the machine has been actively tampered with, why the hell would a casino feel obligated to pay out? Fail in favour of the machine and check the logs later. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do have to pay anyone who lost on a broken machine. And they can't just claim a machine is broken, it actually has to be broken. The state runs a gaming commision that audits machines and is in charge of things like broken machine issues.</p>
<p>If a machine is broken, all transactions on that machine are void, wins and losses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago, my brother came home for the holidays. We went to MGM casino after a night of partying in Detroit. He won a jackpot at a Roulette machine, but it didn't payout the $1,000 or so he won. I stayed by the machine as he went to complain. They said they couldn't do anything and said we were lying. </p>
<p>The only reason we were there is because we were waiting to get picked up as e took an Uber there the day before. As you can probably agree with, he was pissed off, and I was confused since there are hundreds of cameras lined all over.</p>
<p>We finally called the police, one of which we knew worked at the DPD from high school. They came and the money was given after they wanted to check the eye in the sky. I thought they'd need a warrant or something, but the panic caused by two police officers showing up made them eat their bullshit and pay my brother what he won.</p>
<p>It sounds unbelievable, but I hate casinos, so this is imprinted in my brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The law isn't written to be fair, it is written to be just. A lot of people equate these terms, but they aren't actually the same.</p>
<p>A fair system would be the one you just described, where if a machine is faulty, all transactions should be considered void and reimbursed.</p>
<p>A just system means everyone has the same legal rights and responsibilities. The just system can have a rule like &quot;if you think a transaction was faulty, the onus is on the person who wishes reimbursement (or the refusal of payment). Any party that wishes to seek these measures must go and prove the transaction was faulty.&quot; Here, the law applies the same to everyone. It is just that the casino has the impetus to test the machine in the case of a huge payout, and you do not have the impetus every time you lose ten cents. If a person would go back to that casino and show evidence that they played 100 dollars on those machines after the casino has proven it was faulty, they would be reimbursed. </p>
<p>TL;DR: You have to seek reimbursement to be reimbursed. Everyone has to, and the casino does when it refuses a jackpot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
