		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about burning a piece of toast.  Can you unburn the toast?  No.  Why not?  Because we didn’t change the toast into a new thing called burnt toast, we just burned up part of the toast.  The way our universe works, so far as we can tell, this only goes one way.  Once you burnt the toast you can’t make it back the way it was.  Even if you had a way or rebuilding it, it wouldn’t be the exact same toast.  Even if you found a way to rebuild it with the exact same stuff and it was the same toast (impossible as far as we know) then you would have needed to spend lots and lots of energy to do that, which means we still lost something, right?  Not quite.</p>
<p>We didn’t lose anything, really we didn’t even lose anything when we burn the toast.  We just converted what was toast into other things.  The universe didn’t lose anything, it still has the same amount of stuff it had before.  We see it as loss because the heat and burnt crumbs aren’t as useful to us.  The universe doesn’t care for toast, it’s not picky at all, it just wants to keep all its stuff.  So it’s not that stuff disappears, it just gets turned into less complicated stuff by breaking it down into its most basic parts, including just plain old forms of energy like heat and light.</p>
<p>This may not seem like a big deal, but stretch it out of millions and billions and trillions of years and it starts adding up.  Eventually everything get’s less complicated, which means eventually everything becomes the same thing.  To put this in human terms, everything dies.  When we see this happening we call it time passing.  </p>
<p>Time and Entropy are twisted together, one has to be that way because other is.  Break one and you break the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what video you watched.  Was it this one?   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLACGFhDOp0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLACGFhDOp0</a></p>
<p>If so, I'm not sure I can explain it better than he does.  The glacier falls apart and the chunks of ice come to a state of rest.  The water will never spontaneously re-organize itself into a block of ice and leap back onto the side of the glacier.  That would require additional energy (eg, something to lift the ice and propel it back to the glacier)</p>
<p>Another example I like to use is to imagine a hot teacup sitting on a table.  The heat from the teacup will dissipate and achieve equilibrium with the rest of the room, so that the teacup becomes 'room temperature.'  But the heat will never spontaneously decide to concentrate itself back inside a cold teacup.  The only way to re-heat the tea is to add more energy in the form of a hot stove, or sunlight from a window, or something like that.  </p>
<p>Cox is saying that this process never reverses itself, which we know with great certainty.  He then expands this to infer that time itself will never run in reverse.  What we call 'time' is our perception of change as it occurs.  Since the process of entropy never works in reverse, we can confidently say that time itself never moves in reverse.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So interestingly, most of the equations which govern things at the quantum level don't actually care about the direction time moves in. If time was moving backwards, individual atoms and their particles wouldn't look or behave any differently from what you would normally expect. </p>
<p>But somehow at the macroscopic level, that's clearly not the case. If time ran backwards, things would look and behave strangely, and they would violate the second law of thermodynamics, which we know to be impossible. Because of entropy, time can only go in one direction.</p>
<p><em>Why</em> that's the case is still an open problem, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time" target="_blank">arrow of time</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Entropy is the gradual decline of the universe from order into disorder. It's irreversible,  too; any energy we spend to create order in one area will inevitably create disorder in another area.  The only way it would be possible to reverse the effects of entropy would be to reverse the flow of time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
