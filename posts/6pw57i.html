		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually have a lot of experience with a practical application of this very problem. I teach a chemistry lab where we do the Winkler method test for dissolved oxygen in water. Part of that process involved vigorously shaking a completely full glass bottle to break up and dissolve a precipitate that forms during one of the steps. If you shake the bottle straight up and down (like a shake weight), very little happens. If you hold the bottle at arms length and rapidly rotate your wrist back and forth (your tricep or underarm fat should be flapping away) you will create a vortex inside the bottle and will rapidly mix the contents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it's completely filled such that there's no air, the bottle is completely rigid, theres no particulate, and <em>you don't rotate it</em> the water will effectively be like a rigid body and not move at all. You need some kind of force differential to get things to move relative to one another, and assuming the fluid to be incompressible it's sort of like shaking a cylinder of solid metal. </p>
<p>If you apply angular momentum though, the fluid wants to stay at rest, but the other fluid is driven by friction, and you create a shear stress in the fluid. Unlike a solid, a fluid deforms in the presence of any shear stress. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure. Unless you have 100% pure H2O (and you probably don't), there is particulate matter in the water, dissolved minerals, and so on. Shaking will certainly disturb those, which will cause currents in the water.</p>
<p>You could test this yourself. Fill a bottle with water, then use a long eyedropper or something to carefully put a teensy drop of food coloring down somewhere in the water. The dye will probably start to diffuse on its own, but if you quickly seal and shake the bottle, you should see the dye get agitated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok after opening this thread I just went and tried it.  Filled a water bottle until it was so full only surface tension kept the water from spilling.  Let it sit on the counter for a minute to settle and let bubbles rise out of it.  Added one drop blue food coloring, and then put the cap on, which had water in it as well just to try to avoid catching any air (it might have done nothing but pour out when I put it on).</p>
<p>Shook the bottle vigorously.  Surprisingly little happened.  The blue started to spread, sure, but not much.  10 seconds of shaking and the blue was still only halfway down the bottle.  I tried to only shake up and down, no rotation and no turning the bottle upside down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems like the answer will be no but, as is inevitable with the real world, it's probably &quot;a bit, mostly&quot;. This would be a good chance for some experimentation. Try doing this with two bottles of water, one completely full and one with an air gap, and put a small amount of food colouring in each. You should be able to tell how much movement there is from how quickly the food colouring mixes. </p>
<p>Edit: also, what u/Overunderrated said about angular momentum. You could try different methods of shaking (up and down/twisting) and see if you can measure how much difference if would make.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
