<p>What are some of the factors affecting our atmospheric production or decline?</p>
<p>Is our atmosphere undergoing any kind of changing state? As in, more oxygen rich, less oxygen rich? Etc....</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are always slowly losing atmosphere. As you mention, we do have solar wind stripping us, but there is also the spontaneous generation of free hydrogen and helium by radioactive processes to consider. These are usually trapped within rock or liquid, but once freed, the atoms experience buoyant force, and barring the occasional spontaneous reactions of hydrogen with oxygen, nitrogen and other molecules to form compounds in our atmosphere, each attains escape velocity and pops off into space. The earth does not produce any more of the elements present in our atmosphere, excluding some rare radioactive decays creating short-lived heavy noble gases (radon), so we are losing mass and atmosphere faster than we produce it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So by this data alone, it's a net increase. But not of the same gases. We mostly lose oxygen and hydrogen. We've lost ⅔ of our hydrogen since the Earth formed.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is very, very hard to know.  </p>
<p>Atmospheres respond to change on time scales that range from days to hundreds of millions of years.  </p>
<p>At this exact moment, the two main processes with atmospheric consequence are the uplift of the Himalayas (India running towarda Asia at full speed) and anthropogenic generation of CO2.  Tectonic uplift creates new crust to react with the atmosphere (google the Urey global weathering equation for more detail).  At the same time, human industry is producing a great deal of CO2 by cumbustion.</p>
<p>That answer is focused mostly on CO2 not only because it’s an important aspect of modern climate study, but also because carbonate chemistry is very fast compared to other geological phenomena.  If you want a shit-your-pants analysis, read about the response of the atmosphere (and ocean) to the Deccan Traps; catastrophic events can have major consequences on the atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The atmosphere has changed over time. Our first atmosphere was outgassed from the accretion of the planet. It was blown away by the impact that created the moon. Our second atmosphere arose from the outgassing of the mantle (now composed of a little bit of proto-Earth and proto-impactor). If life did start abiotically on earth, it was likely lightening strikes that formed the first organic molecules from this atmosphere. We now live in the so-called 3rd atmosphere which is rich in oxygen due to the impacts of photosynthesizing organisms. Humans may be impacting the atmosphere enough to be creating a fourth. However, I think one of our biggest impacts (depletion of ozone layer) is being remedied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned in other comments it's hard to tell exactly for this period in time. But it's fair to say that at any given time we are losing a bit to solar wind.
Apart from human CO2 emission. Volcanoes do a fair bit of outgassing. Occasionally replenishing the athmosphere.
Eventually the atmosphere will be stripped away though.</p>
<p>Edit: I'd also recommend reading up on the IPCC reports for info on current athomspheric trends like Ozone levels and Greenhouse gas levels. I think it was in Part 2 of the 2013 report.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
