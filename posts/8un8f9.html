		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because nitrogen wants five valence electrons, and oxygen wants six. If you draw the resonance forms of NO, the variation which places the radical on oxygen instead results in oxygen having only five valence electrons, and nitrogen having six. Therefore, this resonance form gives oxygen a formal positive charge and nitrogen a formal negative charge. Generally speaking, a particular resonance form contributes less to the overall, averaged structure when it has more formal charge present, because this is a less stable configuration of electrons. Therefore, the uncharged resonance form, in which the radical is drawn on nitrogen, dominates the molecular behavior, and this simpler form is what's usually drawn.</p>
<p>While writing this, my first thought was that in reality, the unpaired electron ought to be shared, to some degree, by both, since it's possible to draw a resonance structure, however unstable, with the radical on oxygen. However, it turns out that this isn't the case, as quantum chemistry simulations have shown. The radical actually is localized pretty much entirely on nitrogen. For more information you can read <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-sp-hybridizations-do-nitrogen-and-oxygen-have-in-NO-and-NO2-How-are-the-atomic-orbitals-overlapped-in-these-molecules" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Nitrogen gets the radical because this prevents either atom from getting a formal charge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Disclaimers aside, the Octet Rule is a simplification of the behavior of non-metallic atoms and molecules. The actual important thing is not whether each atom has 8 electrons, but the overall total energies of all the electrons.</p>
<p>If the final electron configuration of a compound is lower in energy than the reactants' configurarion, then the compound will form by itself over time. If the energies are higher, it will dissociate. </p>
<p>The Octet Rule is just a simple pattern that arises in &quot;normal&quot; simple molecules between non-metals (C, O, N, H, etc.) because each atom having 8 electrons is usually the lowest energy configuration for those atoms.</p>
<p>NO, indeed, breaks the Octet Rule as you point out, as it has a lone electron. This is what is called a &quot;free radical&quot; molecule. A lone electron has a higher energy than an electron in a bond, so that lone electron is effectively raising the molecule's energy. The lone electron can significantly decrease its energy by bonding to something, which makes free radicals extremely reactive with tons of other things. This makes them both dangerous and very useful chemically, in different situations.</p>
<p>Hope that helps! :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As you stated, the NO molecule has an of number of electrons. Thus, one of the two atoms will have 8 valence electrons and the other must violate the octet rule with 7 electrons (four electrons are shared and are thus counted for octet rule purposes for both atoms).  Oxygen is more electronegative (it attracts the electrons more because it has one more proton in the nucleus) than nitrogen. Therefore, an NO molecule with oxygen having 8 electrons and nitrogen having 7 will be more stable than an NO molecule with oxygen having 7 and nitrogen having 8.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
