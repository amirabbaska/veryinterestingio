<p>The only people who were popularly accepted not to have an artificial means of making fire were the Tasmanians, but the claim was probably false. The Tasmanians carried fire sticks that slowly burned and would get fire from other natives when their fire went out. It was sort of like the &quot;Olympic Flame&quot; method, where the fire was never allowed to go out. However, there are other contemporary historical accounts that Tasmanians did know how to make fire. Taking fire from place to place was like having a pilot light on your stove. It was convenient, but if they totally ran out of fire they would bang flint together or use stick friction to make new fire. Here's a link to a scholarly article on Tasmanian fire tech: </p>

They have no contact with outside people and are hostile to any outsider approaching.  They are known as the Sentinelese: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinelese" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinelese</a></p>
<p>It is thought that they don't know how to create fire, but they do preserve fire from naturally fires on the island.</p>
<p>There was a large brush fire recorded on their island a few years ago. <a href="https://www.skytruth.org/2014/03/mh370-n-sentinel-island/" target="_blank">https://www.skytruth.org/2014/03/mh370-n-sentinel-island/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to partly answer my own question. Other comments <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6o3g18/are_any_cultures_known_that_did_not_use_fire_at/dkehkf9/" target="_blank">1</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6o3g18/are_any_cultures_known_that_did_not_use_fire_at/dkeh233/" target="_blank">2</a> suggest that the answer to my original question is &quot;no&quot;, but raise another interesting question: did any cultures lack the ability to make fire from scratch (as opposed to simply preserving a fire that already existed).</p>
<p>The answer appears to be &quot;yes&quot;. For example, the indigenous cultures of the Andaman archipelago have been studied and found not to make their own fire. Here's a <a href="http://julietteblevins.ws.gc.cuny.edu/files/2016/10/Blevins2009_AndamanesePreHistory.pdf" target="_blank">2009 paper</a> that cites several original sources and reviews to which I don't have access, claiming</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also no evidence of fire-making. Prior to the introduction of matches in the 19th century, the Andamanese had no means of making fire. They kept hearth fires burning, carried resin torches through the forest, and buried smoldering logs for future use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One tribe in the Andamans, the Sentinelese, has violently rejected most attempts by outsiders to contact them*. As a result, detailed study of the tribe has not been possible despite popular interest. The Sentinelese are widely believed not to make their own fire, and it's easy to find claims of this on the internet from responsible outlets <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/1540-9295-10.7.396/pdf" target="_blank">1</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/12/theobserver.worldnews12" target="_blank">2</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinelese#cite_note-Burman1990-3" target="_blank">3</a>, though I'm having trouble finding a scientific source I'd be willing to cite. The Wikipedia page cites a source for this claim, but I don't have access to it. Anyway, it would make sense for the Sentinelese to be similar to the other Andamanese groups in not making fire.</p>
<p>Indigenous Tasmanians were also widely believed not to make fire for some time, but their ability to do so is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Tasmanians" target="_blank">documented as early as 1887</a>, and the fact that they did so is now widely accepted.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this appears to be a somewhat charged question. We should remember that it's a real pain to make fire with stone-age methods, which is why hardly anyone ever does it these days. It's easy to understand why a culture would put little or no effort into learning how to make their own fire if they have the option to preserve a pre-existing fire. This could be especially true if you're on a small wet island, where fire wouldn't have to be transported far and starting it fresh would be hard.</p>
<p>*Which, given the post-contact devastation of the contacted Andamananese peoples, is probably a smart move by the Sentinelese.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
