		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ha, something I can answer, my thesis for my bachelor of political science is completely on Dutch private military companies. In the current scientific terminology mercenaries are actually defined as contractors, calling them mercenaries was considered pretty old fashioned by the private military company directors I interviewed. </p>
<p>Contractors are defined as military personnel that do not work directly for a government but for a company. A lot of states, especially the US, have started to use these companies a lot over the last decades. In 2007 for example 54% of US defense personnel in Afghanistan were contractors and not US state troops. Contractors are deployed in a myriad of ways, they fight shoulder to shoulder with American soldiers in the front line but also protect vips or convoys, protect the outer rings of camps or support armies in logistical ways by flying planes or helicopters with vital supplies. They also guard merchant vessels in for example the Gulf of Aden and they help companies that have to deal with kidnappings of personnel in Africa. </p>
<p>Contractors have advantages over normal troops in some situations. They are often cheaper to deploy than army equivalents. You do not want elite troops guarding the outer rings of camps in low intensity areas, so it is preferable for states to hire cheap third country contractors to do these relatively simple tasks so that the regular troops do not have to waste their time on patrol duties and can do actual missions. </p>
<p>There is some criticisms on this system as some argue that companies should not partake in the monopoly of the use of legal force. This monopoly is the idea that only the state can legally detain you or punish you using force. Now there are companies do basically the same. Fighting wars for states makes it legal for them to kill people sometimes largely to their own discretion. The academic and philosophical debate on whether companies should be allowed to partake in this monopoly on the use of legal force is still raging and something we will have to tackle in the coming decades as the use of private military companies is on the rise. </p>
<p>I hope I gave a quick am understandable overview of what pmcs do, I am sadly not with my computer so I can't give references for my sources, but if you want to learn more about pmcs authors like Tonkin and Leander are great sources to learn more about this emerging issue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mercenaries are just companies that provide people who do work.</p>
<p>Swiss mercenaries (employed by the vatican in an official capacity to guard the pope) are essentially an officially endorsed state sponsored mercenary arrangement. </p>
<p>Nepalese Gurkhas who fight for the British army are something similar.</p>
<p>But wholly private mercenaries basically grow out of some former soldier or someone with diplomatic and military connections who can hire people who are going to fight.  </p>
<p>Ghaddafi hired chadian mercenaries essentially straight out of want ads in, well, chad.  </p>
<p>Mark Thatcher (son of former UK Prime minister Margaret) got into the business through Simon Mann, a former British army officer who was contracted by the Angolan government to provide military services retaking an oil field.</p>
<p>The legality of mercenaries is sort of all over the place.  If the government of a country hires you to to do work for them, in their own country then presumably the work is by definition legal, at least in the sense that you took a contract you understood to be legal. </p>
<p>Using a mercenary force against another country isn't at all obvious when it is or isn't legal.</p>
<p>In the case of say, colonial efforts by the americans in Iraq, well, private contractors delivering supplies etc. need guards, so are those guys mercenaries?  (Yes, but not necessarily).  </p>
<p>If you want to pay some French or Americans or whatever to come to your country and train your army that is presumably legal.  But if you want to pay them to come and train your insurgent force to take over the country that usually isn't.  </p>
<p>Keep in mind that many countries, particularly in Africa and the Middle East have pathetically small armies, that have almost no equipment, no combat experience, no competent leadership, and generally can't be trusted to actually fight, or if they do, probably not win.  Those countries rely on foreign specialists for their fighting and training needs because they can't be bothered to train their own forces for the relatively rare event that they need them.  So long as they are fighting non sovereign states (so pirates, gangs, insurgents, even ISIS) mercenaries are generally desirable.  </p>
<p>The situation against ISIS is a fairly good example of why you might need mercenaries.  If you don't trust your own army to not defect, you have a problem (Syria and Saudi have this problem).  If you think your army is going to turn and run at the first sign of trouble you have a problem (the Iraqi's have this problem).  If your army refuses to fight during Ramadan, you have a problem.  Mercenaries let you overcome a lot of that. </p>
<p>Also, Mercenaries, are essentially outside the geneva conventions, they are not considered combatants and not entitled to geneva convention protections explicitly.  For that reason they have no motivation to adhere to geneva conventions, and if you intend to do something illegal some mercenaries are happy to torture and stage coups etc, because it can't get any worse for them if they are caught and taken prisoner.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are typically formed by ex-military or police officers and are hired just like any other company: you'd sign a contract with them.  Naturally, they don't use the term &quot;mercenary&quot; preferring the more subtle term, &quot;security services.&quot;</p>
<p>You would not hire these companies as an army to fight a war though.  Typically they would be contracted for personal security and to train an existing group of men, turning them into soldiers.  They would also offer strategic counsel and probably have sources for supplying arms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of my coworker used to serve in Iraq then worked for military contractor for couple years. He told me quiet a bit about them. It's just a private company that employ people with combat background. That's why most employee there are either vet or off-duty troops, ex-soldiers. People like to join military contractor because the pay is better and more relax than military camp. There is no yelling, yes sir no sir bullshit. </p>
<p>He said most of the stuff contractor do are guarding and escort stuff. He worked in Africa, guarding warehouses and trucks from diamond mine. He also said contractors do a lot of fuck up shit because they arent bound to no rules like the real military</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been a private security contractor for 10 years.  A 'mercenary' if you like the term. Like most Reddit comment sections, a lot of good answers here, a lot of crap.  Put too much faith in knowledge derived from fiction (movies, tv, video games, bullshit stories from wannabees) and documentaries and similar external assessments, you'll always get the wrong answer.  The common truth threaded in the more knowledgeable comments here; it's a legal business offering a service for a fee with licensing, insurance, contracts and government regulations.  The vast amount of misinformation and conjecture that goes on about it from people who have never been actually involved in private security business makes it seem otherwise. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
