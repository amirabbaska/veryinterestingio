		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was reading a random article on soap and sanitation online (was not recent, and I don't still have the link) where a doctor was quoted as saying that one of the benefits of people using soap when washing their hands, even if it wasn't antibacterial, was that people &quot;tend to scrub longer and harder when using soap than when just using water.&quot;
It had never occurred to me that not using soap and not scrubbing thoroughly could still be considered &quot;washing,&quot; but then that got me thinking about all the historical, economic, and situational circumstances where people have washed their hands without soap, and how it is probably possible to wash passably without it, if conscientious.
So what is actually happening to the skin and the microbes on it during a hand wash? How does this differ with antibacterial soap, non-antibacterial soap, and just water? Also, I had a few friends in construction who once expounded upon the virtues of using olive oil instead of soap, that it cleansed dirt and grime away faster and more effectively, and didn't cause as much wear and tear on their hands. I can understand the science of this to some degree, but how hygienic is, and why?</p></div></div>
