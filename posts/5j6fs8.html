Making it easier for mutations to hit genes that make (for example) butterflies be attracted to different flowers, but not genes that are important for them wanting nutrition.</p>
<p>He said (if I remember correctly) that there was no real evidence for this, but that it could be possible.</p>
<p>Has anything been found on this since then?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, some areas of the genome are more conserved than others, which means they mutate and reach fixation in a given population at a lower rate than other more volatile regions. This actually isn't restricted to DNA. RNA experiences the same phenomenon, and we actually make use of this for taxonomy and species relationships. Specifically this is found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA" target="_blank">ribosomal RNA</a>. Since the region is so highly conserved, because it's more necessary for life, we can confidently calculate the rate of mutation, so the sequence similarity of these regions between different organisms can be used to infer how distantly or closely related they are on the tree of life. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conserved_sequence" target="_blank">Here is a neat Wikipedia article discussing the idea of conserved sequences.</a></p>
<p>Also, it's important to note that even though these regions are being conserved (slow rate of fixation into a population) that they are still being influenced by the mechanisms of evolution or more specifically, natural selection. I apologize if that distinction comes off as pedantic, I don't want to be &quot;that guy,&quot; but I thought it was important to note that these regions are still susceptible to selection. They're rate of change is lower, mostly based on the necessity of the regions and their respective function because a mutation in an &quot;important,&quot; gene is more likely to be deleterious than advantageous, which reduces the likelihood of fixation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Overall genes are relatively evenly mutatable (for lack of a better word).
Genes with lots of C-G pairs are a little less susceptible to mutations because a C-G pair is bound stronger than an A-T pair. This is because of the fact that C-G forms 3 hydrogen bonds and A-T can only form 2. Stronger bonds prevents cross-linking, which is one way of mutations.</p>
<p>Why some genes stay almost the same over the range from bacteria to mammals, is because those genes are essential.
Insulin for example is found in nearly all mammals and is only lightly modified for different species. Why is this? Because if your fetus has a mutated insulin, the changes are incredibly high that it won't work. The fetus will consequently die and the mutation dies with it.
Non-essential genes (for example eye color) will not be essential for the example, or the negative effect of this change is so small that the mutation won't die regardless. These genes freely mutate and offspring of this fetus can also carry this gene.</p>
<p>Edit: for your specific example.
The liking for different flowers is actually quite good, because more flowers means less competition for food. Butterflies that eat from different flowers thus have more change to survive and reproduce. Positive selections ensues and the gene gets more prevalent.
A butterfly without a drive for hunger (if that is what you meant) will not eat enough and possibly will compete less for the food available. Thus he has less change to reproduce and his genes will die out in favor of more &quot;fit&quot; individuals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Genes that are involved in antiviral defence would fit this.</p>
<p>Basically what you want is genes that are not essential for existing but are either exploited by the virus or are specifically part of antiviral immunity.</p>
<p>Because the gene us not essential for survival it can accumulate mutations. If an individual gets infected by a virus and it has has picked up a mutation that confers a selective advantage, such as interfering with viral replication or viral entry to the cell, then this individual will have a selective advantage and the mutation will get prepared in the population.</p>
<p>The converse now happens with the virus, where mutations accumulate in its genome and one if them happens to bypass the mutation in the host.</p>
<p>Then the cycle begins again.</p>
<p>Evolutionary biologists call this an Evolutionary Arms Race. If you have genome sequences of either many individuals of a species or many related species you can look to find areas that differ allot over evolutionary time, these are likely to be genes like this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some proteins (and of course all proteins are made from the DNA in your genes) show a great deal of stability over time and some can change quite a bit. For example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone#Conservation_across_species" target="_blank">histones</a> are proteins that help to pack up DNA and bind to DNA stabilizing it in certain situations. There's one type of Histone called H4 which is almost the same across a wide variety of species. For example Cows and Peas only have 2 changes out of H4s 104 amino acids in spite of the fact that the two species diverged 1.2 billion years ago. Another protein called cytochrome C is also highly similar across many plant and animal species.</p>
<p>Compare that with the fibrinogen proteins in vertebrates. Fibrinogen is involved in the blood clotting process and it shows a great deal of variability across species to the point where your fibrinogen probably wouldn't work in your dog and vice versa. So why the huge difference between the two proteins? Histones have to interact with DNA and DNA can't change so the histones don't have much ability to change either. But fibrinogen just has to fix a leaky blood vessel and afterwards it gets re-absorbed (or otherwise discarded) so it can have a wide variety of forms that will still do the job and there is more room for mutational changes. </p>
<p>You can tell how well adapted to a cellular task a particular protein is by how much variation there is between species: for example hemoglobin (which carries oxygen to cells) falls somewhere in between fibrinogen and H4 in terms of number of different mutations between species. This demonstrates that some genes have more &quot;wiggle-room&quot; to change without killing the organism. Proteins change at a liner rate called the <em>unit evolutionary period</em> which is a slower rate for more inflexible proteins and a higher rate for proteins that don't need to be as specific.</p>
<p>This partial answer to your question &quot;are some genes more susceptible to evolution to others&quot; is as much of an answer as I know. The old text-book that I'm &quot;copying&quot; all this from however  (Biochemistry, second edition Voet and Voet, c1995) assures me that protein sequences may be much less important then gene expression; that is it matters less what protein an organism is making and it matters more how much of that protein is being made, and where and when. </p>
<p>I'm not personally sure if they've nailed down all the mechanisms governing &quot;important&quot; gene expression yet. If they have I don't personally know whether the genes involved will be the type of gene that needs to be conserved (like the H4 histone) or if they can show more variability (like fibrinogen) due to some ultimate connection to the inner workings of the most critical cellular machinery. It may be that the regulatory genes can't change that much in which case something else is ultimately driving the fitness of an organism to adapt to its environment. And if the regulatory genes can change then I don't know what the research is on differences across species at this point.</p>
<p><strong>tldr</strong> Some protein sequences can change a great deal, in particular if that protein doesn't have a &quot;sensitive&quot; function within the deepest bowels of the cellular machinery. Since proteins are made by genes then this means that genes can be changed across species to make more &quot;species specific&quot; proteins. If different proteins in different species indicate a better adaptation to an environment then some genes are in fact more susceptible to evolution then others. But if not then I don't the answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah what they said. I also think it's worth noting that because of redundancy in the genetic code there are more ways to make certain amino acids (i.e. 6 ways to code for leucine vs 3 ways to code for isoleucine). So just by virtue of chance in, say, an exon with lots of leucines you are more likely to get a silent mutation vs one containing isoleucine where a one base pair change could then make a different amino acid.</p>
<p>In terms of 'evolvability' a great example is the HIV reverse transcriptase which is deliberately sloppy so that it allows the virus to mutate very quickly--this is what makes it so hard to target. I don't know if there is anything about the genes for HIV envelope proteins (where random mutations help it evade immune recognition) vs the core proteins (where a mutation may prevent it from replicating) that make them more or less likely to get a mutation--I believe it just comes down to chance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
