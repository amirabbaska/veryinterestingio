This is a called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma" target="_blank">granuloma</a> and is a hallmark for TB. Alcohol has been shown to hinder the immune cells (mainly through cytokine disruption) that form a granuloma and subsequently lead to higher rates of TB disease and re-infection.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ethanol dysregulates immunity in many different ways. Here are a few off of the top of my head:</p>
<p>First, with respect to innate immunity, acute consumption <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4325985/" target="_blank">inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages</a> in response to stimulation with Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (e.g., lipopolysaccharide) both in vitro and in vivo. So in the short term, production of  pro-inflammatory TNF-α, IL-1β IL-6, and IL-12 is decreased, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3203086/" target="_blank">anti-inflammatory IL-10 is increased</a>. Paradoxically, acute consumption <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1764540/" target="_blank">also raises concentrations of acute-phase inflammatory proteins like serum amyloid A and P</a>, which recruit immune cells to sites of inflammation. </p>
<p>Mechanistically, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4325985/" target="_blank">ethanol induces stress response proteins like hsp70 and HSF1</a> that bind the immune transcription factor <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2882124/" target="_blank">NFκB</a> (inhibiting its activation and nuclear translocation) and the TNF-α promoter (blocking transcription) respectively, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17548605/" target="_blank">by increasing degradation of IκB kinase (IKK)</a>.</p>
<p>Long-term, heavy consumption, on the other hand, results in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623963/" target="_blank">enhanced production of those same pro-inflammatory cytokines</a> by innate cells. In the case of TNF-α in macrophages, this appears to be due to <a href="http://www.jbc.org/content/276/45/41930.long" target="_blank">enhanced mRNA expression and stability</a>. Also in macrophages, chronic ethanol exposure <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3845821/" target="_blank">enhances expression of a TLR-related kinase (IRAK-1) that promotes NFkB signaling and decreases expression of one (IRAK-M) that negatively regulates it</a>. Additionally, they also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2950894/" target="_blank">show impaired efferocytosis</a>, the ability to clear apoptotic (dead) cellular debris following an immune response, which is important for terminating ongoing inflammatory processes. </p>
<p>Dendritic cells are also impaired by chronic alcohol consumption, showing lower IL-12 and higher IL-10 production, impaired differentiation/generation in the bone marrow, and decreased expression of the T cell costimulatory ligands B7.1 and B7.2 both <a href="http://www.jimmunol.org/content/173/5/3398.long" target="_blank"><em>in vitro</em></a> and <a href="https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1189/jlb.0905517" target="_blank"><em>in vivo</em></a>. Decreased B7.1/B7.2 expression inhibits the ability of dendritic cells to activate T lymphocytes, impairing their proliferation and blunting adaptive immune responses. </p>
<p>With respect to the adaptive immune system in general, it has long been observed that chronic ethanol exposure promotes T cell apoptosis and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002934373901186?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">the reduction of circulating peripheral T cells (lymphopenia)</a>, in addition to promoting a shift in T cell populations <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7515214/" target="_blank">toward the memory (CD45RO^+ ) subset</a>. Lymphopenia can even be seen <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2248759/" target="_blank">after short periods of binge-drinking</a>. CD8^+ T cells in chronic drinkers are also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1839029/" target="_blank">hyper-activated</a> and ethanol <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/130/5/1091/4686457" target="_blank">may impair the ability of lymphocytes to engage in diapedesis</a> (migration out of circulation). </p>
<p>Chronic drinking also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9660319/" target="_blank">decreases B lymphocyte numbers</a>, particularly B-2 B cells, which produce high-affinity antibodies and develop into memory B cells. Somewhat paradoxically, heavy, chronic drinkers also have increased levels of IgM and IgA antibodies, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20575828/" target="_blank">mostly directed against hepatic auto-antigens</a> and byproducts of oxidative damage. These auto-antibodies exacerbate the inflammatory environment and accelerate liver injury -- many patients with alcoholic liver disease <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9024302/" target="_blank">make antibodies to alcohol dehydrogenase itself</a>!</p>
<p>Lastly, both acute <em>and</em> chronic exposure <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3203086/" target="_blank">reduces expression of Type I interferons (IFNs)</a> which are important for antiviral immunity.</p>
<p>In summary, chronic consumption of large quantities of ethanol is <em>quite</em> bad for your immune system (and the rest of you). Moderate consumption, on the other hand, has been associated with improved responses to infection and vaccination, as others have pointed out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
