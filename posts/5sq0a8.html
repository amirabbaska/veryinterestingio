		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spiders are a diverse order, with close to 50,000 described species in more than 100 families, so there is no answer to this question that will apply to all spiders.  Any particular spider's preferred temperature will depend on a variety of factors, including its habitat (climate, substrates, etc.) and its predatory habits.  Some species prefer warmer temperatures (examples: <a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.13156/arac.2007.14.1.45" target="_blank"><em>Pardosa</em> species</a>, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3543678?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank"><em>Phrurolithus festivus</em>, <em>Euophrys frontalis</em></a>) while others prefer cooler temperatures (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2435.1997.00040.x/full" target="_blank"><em>Parasteatoda tepidariorum</em></a>, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3543678?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank"><em>Stemonyphantes lineatus</em></a>, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3543911?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank"><em>Agelenopsis aperta</em></a>, <a href="http://www3.uah.es/pedrovillar/Docencia/Ecologia%20Grado%20Biologia/Archivos/Articulos%20para%20practicas%20de%20campo/Seleccion%20de%20habitat/Seleccion%20de%20habitat%20por%20arana.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Oecobius navus</em></a>).  It's also worth pointing out that as ectotherms, many spiders adjust their behavior/location to gain heat when they are too cold but will also adjust to lose heat when they are too warm.</p>
<p>If you're wondering whether spiders will instinctively move into the warmth of your house during cold weather, the answer is generally &quot;no.&quot;  Even for species that have a preference for higher temperatures, spiders that live outdoors are generally well-adapted to deal with weather swings, and will endure the cold rather than move into a completely different ecosystem where they are likely to have difficulty finding food and water.  There is little overlap between the lists of species that are commonly found in/around people's homes and those that live outdoors in nearby natural areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some spiders, like the European cave spiders actually prefer cold, dark and wet places (caves).</p>
<p>Diving bell spiders prefer living underwater in moderate climates which is usually around 68째F (20째C).</p>
<p>On the other hand members of the family of Theraphosidae (now referred to as tarantulas despite not having anything to do with the city of Taranto, Italy) are known to die in temperatures lower than 60째F (15째C).</p>
<p>Common House spiders and Barn Funnel Weavers (European domestic house spiders) will prefer the temperature and humidity commonly found in people's houses, which often gives people the impression of being heat seekers, especially when it's cold outside.</p>
<p>The giant house spiders also like house temperatures in late summer/fall and they see it as ideal environment specifically for breeding.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It might be worth pointing out that spiders (like any other animal) have more than one motivation. And heat means more than one thing.</p>
<p>Their prey might prefer heat, which in turn means their preferred hunting / webbing grounds are near heat. It might also simply be the difference between a temperature that keeps their prey active and a temperature that keeps their prey dormant.</p>
<p>Heat can mean the difference between liquid water and frozen water. Even though spiders get most of their moisture from their prey, they can and do drink.</p>
<p>Heat means temperature differential. Temperature differential means air currents. Spiders that build webs in particular like air currents because building their web in a current is like putting a neat in a stream.</p>
<p>Anyway my point is that even if they're attracted to warmer areas, it might not be the heat itself that attracts the spider. Also people don't realize just how many spiders there are around us. Even if just a tiny number wander into homes by accident, it'll make you think spiders are seeking it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does anyone have any insight on this? </p>
<p>For years now, I've had issues with little Brown/tan  spiders in my car at night. Only at night. I work late evenings and in the fall have issues with them while driving home at night. Crawling across my windshield on the inside (sometimes outside) or dropping down on a string of Web in front of my face while driving. Having slight arcana phobia, this is a bit irritating at the least. I park under a tree somewhat at home, but not while at work. Some times I can spot/kill two in a drive home. What gives? Why are they IN my car? Why so many? They are never larger than a nickel. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello, I work with spiders, Theraphosids to be exact (tarantulas). They will seek out a heat source. For those who keep tarantulas as pets, we do not recommend heat mats or heat lights for this reason. The tarantula will literally cook itself. We suggest using room heaters for a designated spider room. Most hobbyists keep anywhere from 20 tarantulas to thousands. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
