		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tax lawyer here. I do pro bono work for poverty-level tax payers before the IRS. One of the programs available if you owe a shit ton of money to the IRS and you're hella broke is something called an Offer in Compromise (&quot;OIC&quot;).</p>
<p>An OIC is where you owe a bunch of money to the IRS and you don't have either the income or the assets to pay it so the IRS is like, &quot;ok, we'll settle it with you. How much can you afford to pay?&quot; A settlement amount is determined based on your financial situation, and you pay what you can afford to settle the whole tax debt.</p>
<p>I haven't seen what these companies can do, but I can only imagine that this is what they're doing. They must be filing OIC's on behalf of tax payers. There isn't any other option offered by the IRS to settle high tax debt.</p>
<p>My guess is that these companies charge people a percentage of the amount of debt that is being relieved in this process. So if you owed $20,000 in tax debt and your financials say you can only pay $5,000 (there's a standard formula that everyone under OIC consideration must follow), then you &quot;save&quot; $15,000. If the company files the paperwork on your behalf, then they appear to be the ones who magically saved you $15,000. So they probably have some sort of deal where, &quot;you pay us up front 20% of the amount we can save you ($3,000 in this case. 20% of $15,000 = $3,000), and then we'll make the rest go away.&quot; Then the clients are thrilled because they only pay $8,000 ($5,000 tax settlement amount + $3,000 company fee) to settle a $20,000 debt. &quot;What a savings!&quot;</p>
<p>But what people don't know is that they can file an OIC by themselves. It isn't anything particularly special. If you qualify, you qualify. If you don't, you don't. There isn't some insider secret. So these places are likely a scam.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of these businesses are scams, but some are legal and just charge for a service that anyone has access to.</p>
<p>For instance, people in a lot of debt to the IRS can make an &quot;offer in compromise.&quot; They agree to pay a good chunk of their debt within a set time, based on their income and assets, and the IRS does not collect the rest of the debt. This is something the IRS does because a partially collected tax debt is better than nothing. </p>
<p>Companies like these might do something like charge you up front to submit the application for an offer in compromise, even though that's something you can do yourself, if you knew about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have experience in this industry and almost every company in it is a complete scam designed to bleed people dry.  While there are programs that will result in certain taxpayers paying less than what they owe, chances are that if you can afford to hire a resolution company, you don't qualify for the program.  Stay away from these companies.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The calls are to companies selling products.  They can't make your debt go away, though the IRS is negotiable on penalties and sometimes interest.  If you call, you'll find about services you can pay for, not told that your problems are solved.  Why are these ads on the radio?  Because they work, and <del>poor suckers</del> customers call the number.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I didn't file my tax returns for 7 years.  IRS finally added it up...they finally sent me a notice for $60,000 I owed. I called the IRS, told them <em>whoa,</em> I had always gotten a refund, or maybe just owed $150 at most!  They said since you didn't file, we filed tax returns <em>for you</em>.  Could I re-file those years myself?  IRS said sure, go ahead.</p>
<p>So I took the time to submit 7 years of returns...turns out to be $11,000 owed, including penalties &amp; interest.  Woulda got a refund for 3 of those years, but <em>duh</em> procrastination. </p>
<p>IRS was actually fair &amp; helpful with me.  We worked out a reasonable monthly payment for 10 years, and they're happy.  I didn't call anyone else for help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
