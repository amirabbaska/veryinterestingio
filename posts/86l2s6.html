		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently took a knitting class, and the teacher mentioned that this is really common problem for many knitters. Once the project is almost done, they lose motivation just finish up those last few rows and bind off. Her theory was that once you can actually see the thing you were trying to create, you get most of the satisfaction of the finished project, so you just stop. Maybe this is also true for creating other, less physical things too. Once your vision is mostly realized, to the point where you can 'see' the big picture, you're satisfied with that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

As soon as you can see the light at the end of the tunnel the challenge is gone and the remaining steps feel like 'busy work'.  This is considered false because more often than not, your perception is wrong.  A few challenges await, you just totally failed to anticipate them... surprise!  Keep going, and see if that 100% is really as close as you think it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because that last 20% of the product is actually 80% of the work. </p>
<p>Everyone does it. Whenever we write or create anything we do the easy stuff first, because it is there and we can do it. So all the hard stuff piles up to the end. You aren't sure what you need to do, where to start. So now it takes effort to produce output, rather than the easy stuff just flowing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could be fear of failure. Anxiety over grades. Stress coming from having your work judged after it's done. If the last part of work is no more difficult than any other, as your doing dishes example suggests, then it probably isn't the work itself but the outcome that demotivates you from finishing. </p>
<p>Maybe there's an anxiety of not knowing what comes after. Or dreading unpleasant work you know comes next.</p>
<p>And it could also be that having work to do puts you in a fulfilling state that you don't want to leave, like getting to the last pages of a good book and wanting to read more because you don't want the story's world to go away. Doing all the side quests of a video game before the final boss.</p>
<p>It's something about the task that puts you in a comfortable state that you are okay with and don't want to change. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
