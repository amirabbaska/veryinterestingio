		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So for starters, we know there has to be a lot of iron at the center of the planet. </p>
<p>If we just measure the mass of Earth and its size, then we can find our planet has an average density of 5.5 grams per cubic centimeter. Rock alone has a density of around 3 grams per cubic centimeter, so there must be quite a bit of something much denser for the total to average out to 5.5, and iron (with a density of 7.9) fits the bill nicely.</p>
<p>On top of that, we know we have a very strong magnetic field. That requires some kind of swirling magnetic fluid at the core to generate that field, which again points to iron as the culprit.</p>
<p>Okay, but then how do we know the outer core is liquid and the inner core is solid? For starters, dynamo theory suggests you can't generate a magnetic field that strong without some kind of solid-liquid interaction. For example, Venus has no intrinsic magnetic field; it remains unknown if this is because the core is all solid, all liquid, or just doesn't have enough of a temperature gradient, but the point remains that you need that solid-liquid interaction.</p>
<p>So we know that there has to be some solid iron inner core, but how do we know how big it is? This is where earthquakes help us out. Seismic waves generated by earthquakes can travel deep into the Earth's core and back out again. Exactly where those waves are detected, which kind of waves are detected, and how strong they are can give us a lot of clues. </p>
<p>We see a sudden shadow of pressure waves about 105 degrees away from an earthquake's epicenter. If you back out the geometry, this gives you a zone of intense refraction from a sphere 3400 km in radius - that's the liquid iron outer core. On top of this, we also see a secondary zone of refraction, as well as some pretty intense reflection from a separate sphere 1200 km in radius - that's the solid iron inner core. The path of that reflection off the inner core maps out similar to the black lines in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/FCkY84o.jpg" target="_blank">this diagram</a></p>
<p>Additionally, we can verify this by studying the orbits of satellites around Earth. By measuring changes to their orbits very carefully, using some gravitational calculations we can back out the depths of sudden changes in density, similar to what's shown in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/I2mXG0K.jpg" target="_blank">this diagram</a>. We see sudden density discontinuities for both a 1200 km inner solid core as well as a 3400 km liquid outer core.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: There has to be a lot iron just based on our density, we know some of it has to be solid based on our magnetic field, and we know its size based on seismic wave reflection. This is also verified by gravity measurements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A more complicated add-on answer to Astromike23's is we can calculate what the element proportions in the sun are from the light spectrum. With this we can have an assumption that the other objects in the solar system will have a somewhat similar composition. More accurately we can look at asteroids that would have formed near the start of the solar system. </p>
<p>This can be through analysis of meteorites landing on Earth. We're specifically interested in Chondrites. (very primitive meteorites) These are mainly made up of silica (silicon and oxygen), Magensium and iron. These meteorites have a higher iron and magnesium percentage than can be seen in the Earth's crust.</p>
<p>We have many examples of rocks from the Crust and they typically have much higher silica percentages than when compared to the meteorites (the crust being around 45% oxygen, 27% silica and around 5% iron with other elements). This when compared to overall composition is around 30% iron, 30% oxygen, 15% silica and magnesium with other elements. Essentially there is the assumption that the extra Magensium and iron is deeper in the earth. We can get rocks brought up from eruptions that are likely to give a composition of the mantle, or the semi-liquid substance between the core and the crust. This is mostly peridotite which has a higher Magnesium and Iron content with respect to the crust. The composition of the mantle explains where the Magnesium went but there is still an excess of iron.</p>
<p>So essentially the thought is this excess iron must be even deeper in the earth and with the crust and mantle accounting for the expected Magnesium and silica amounts with some iron then the core must be the rest of the iron.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
