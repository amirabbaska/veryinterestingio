		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short and Simple: Nobody manufactures the drugs for lethal injection in humans, so we wind up using <em>really old</em> drugs or a cocktail of things not meant for the purpose of killing humans. Also, there aren't many doctors willing to administer lethal-injections... and improper application can leave someone alive and in agony instead of dead.</p>
<p>Longer and Detailed: The Pharmaceutical Companies that make the drugs for Lethal Injections <em>know</em> how radioactive the topic of Capital Punishment is. Anyone associated with it is poisoned. Social Media will <em>crucify</em> anyone who sells the drugs used to kill people... and that will result in lost business across <strong>all</strong> of their products.</p>
<p>There aren't many executions in the United States, even when the needed supplies are available. That means that lethal injection drugs are a <em>really</em> niche product. The lost profit from <em>not</em> selling the drugs for Lethal Injection is <strong>much</strong> less than the lost profit from losing sales in every other sector.</p>
<p>So... that opens up another question: Why isn't there a company that <em>just</em> fills the need for lethal injection drugs? </p>
<p>The answer to that is that you can't make a profit in that market alone. It's a ludicrously small market, needing less than a thousand dosages of your product per year. Since you can't sustain a company <em>on</em> lethal injections, and any company that could afford to do it as a side-gig won't touch it with a ten-foot-pole, there's no supplier.</p>
<p>Which brings us to what we use: Old drugs from when companies <em>would</em> sell them, a finite supply that grows less effective with time; and trying to mix a cocktail of drugs that will do the job... to sometimes horrific results.</p>
<p>Doctors and Nurses to administer the lethal injection are hard to find for the same reason. The entire concept of Capital Punishment is <strong>radioactive</strong>. Even if the state shields you from being fired from a hospital or losing your license to practice medicine, your patients <strong>will</strong> eventually learn what you did... and a lot of them are going to look for a doctor that doesn't kill people. Losing your patients isn't worth whatever the state pays you to kill someone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, a simple and effective means is available: Nitrogen. It makes up 70% of the atmosphere, and breathing in pure nitrogen feels no different than air. The lack of oxygen would make you pass out, but without any of the buildup of CO2 that is associated with suffocation (burning lung sensation). </p>
<p>It is dangerous in industrial settings where a few breaths can render someone unconscious without realizing that they aren't getting oxygen. For this reason, you have to have an oxygen monitor in areas where nitrogen is present in the workplace. There were 80 deaths in US workplaces from 1992 to 2002 due to nitrogen asphyxiation. </p>
<p>In fact, wikipedia tells me that Oklahoma signed a bill authorizing nitrogen asphyxiation when lethal injection chemicals are not available. </p>
<p>I believe that historically, the method was seen as &quot;too humane&quot;, which is interesting since lethal injection is also supposed to be humane. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that because of the controversial nature of capital punishment every aspect is made harder. Everything from what drugs to use (companies don't want the PR of being &quot;the executioner&quot; and will likely sue if their drugs are used for the purpose) to who does it (medical professionals are morally and in most cases legally disallowed from causing harm).</p>
<p>There are also legal guidelines for how you are allowed to kill people (the harsh and unusual punishment - type of deal) restricting the executioners methods.</p>
<p>Basically you end up having to use a hammer to screw in a screw.</p>
<p>Whereas with animals, theres no controversy, in fact it is widely regarded as merciful if the animal is seriously ill, and thus we can use the best drugs for the job and the best professionals to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try to answer this.  It has nothing to do with what medications we can get or not get.  You can kill someone with pretty much any of the drugs used, in adequate dosages.  The issue (as mentioned once or twice below) is that it's not always a trained professional.  IV's infiltrate.  etc.</p>
<p>But.  Having said that.  I've read a fair number of newspaper and internet stories on &quot;Botched&quot; lethal injections.  It is EXCEEDINGLY common, after reading the article, to realize it was NOT botched at all.  It is very frequently a description of what people look like as they die.  Not many lay people understand that almost everyone gasps, occasionally coughs, etc as they go through agonal respirations.  They twitch.  they look like they are convulsing.  one of the listed side effects of propofol (used in some lethal injections) is &quot;myoclonus,&quot; which is &quot;twitching&quot; for the layperson.  </p>
<p>And it can take a very long time for a heart to stop.  10, 15, 20 minutes.  Just because it took the guy 20 minutes to stop breathing does NOT mean he suffered AT ALL.    If you're unconcious, you don't really care whether you are breathing or not.
I'm an anesthesiologist.  A HUGE number of my patients stop breathing.  they gasp, snore etc.  That's why i'm there, to make sure that doesn't result in death.  They also twitch from the drugs.  Big deal. they are unconcious the entire time.</p>
<p>the only way they can REALLY suffer is if the paralytic is given with no sedation.  That would suck.</p>
<p>TL;DR
gasping, twitching and turning blue are pretty normal and doesn't relate to discomfort.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in an animal shelter.  I have been there many times for the injections.  There are two main ways this can be done..typically the pet is sedated.  Then another injection ends their life - this can be done with an injection straight into the heart (not usually done when an owner is present) or into the vein.  </p>
<p>I assure you that animals DO NOT always pace peacefully.  Maybe 1 in 500 has an issue.  I once saw a Sheltie dog get up and try to run across the room.. it was sad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
