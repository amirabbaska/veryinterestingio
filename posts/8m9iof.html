		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a phenomena called the Cosmic Microwave Background, or CMB. If you point a radio telescope in any direction, you see radio waves from the CMB. Looking at radio waves from the CMB is kind of like looking at visible light from the sun. If you go far back enough in time, the universe was denser and hotter, so dense and so hot that hydrogen atoms filled all of space <del>and there was fusion happening everywhere</del>. But as time went on, the universe became less dense and less hot, until <del>fusion stopped happening and</del> the light could travel freely through space. The light we see from the CMB is from the moment that light could freely travel.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, both light from the CMB and light from the sun follow a blackbody spectrum. In fact, anything with a temperature emits blackbody radiation. If you measure the intensity of the light at different frequencies, you can fit the temperature. Right now the CMB is in radio, which is cold (about 2.73 kelvin), but if you go back in time the CMB light was much hotter. The reason it's colder now is because light is a transverse wave. As the universe expanded, the peaks and troughs of the light waves expanded with the expanded space. This phenomena is known as red-shifting.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you look in different directions, the original temperature of the CMB is almost exactly the same in every direction, to about one part in 100,000. But it's not exactly the same in every direction. If you look at different angles, the temperatures can be slightly different. If you look at temperature deviations as a function of different angles, you can calculate what's called a Power Spectrum. The Power Spectrum allows you to solve what are called the Boltzmann Equations. The Boltzmann Equations are thermodynamic equations which constrain many parameters of the universe, such as its age, the expansion rate, the density of normal matter, density of dark matter, etc. Solving the Boltzmann Equations constrains the age of the universe.</p>
<p>As a side note, the Boltzmann Equations are perhaps the most compelling argument for dark matter, since it's impossible to fit the Power Spectrum without a dark matter component (but this argument is so technical that many people are not familiar it).</p>
<p>edit: if anyone is interested in learning more, this is a good resource: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01589" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01589</a>. It's the 2015 Planck results, an experiment to map the CMB super precisely.</p>
<p>edit2: As others have mentioned, the period of fusion was between 10 seconds and 20 minutes after the big bang, and is known as big bang nucleosynthesis. The period when light could travel freely was much later, about 380,000 years after the big bang, and is known as the time of last scattering. </p>
<p>Also I should mention there are easier, more intuitive ways of calculating the age of the universe, such as measuring the Hubble Constant directly from redshifts and distances and calculating T = 1/H. However, the current best margin of error of 59 million years comes from precise measurements of the CMB Power Spectrum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many ways and clearly many answers. For those who do not want to read any lengthy answers, I will make a couple breif ones</p>
<p>1) Edwin Hubble noticed that almost all galaxies when being looked at are &quot;redshifted&quot;. Redshirting is like listening to a police siren going away from you, the sound waves are stretched, but in this case it's  lightwaves. Not only that, but the further a galaxy was from us, the faster it was moving away. This can be witnessed in the perspective of nearly any Galaxy you put yourself in. This discovery leads to the idea of an expanding universe. Over time we asked &quot;wait, what if we wound the clock backwards?&quot; So we did, and realized, logically, everything was closer together back in the past, and with lots of math and computations, we calculated that all matter was concentrated to a single point which is the beginning of The Big Bang. We don't know what happened before then, so we just leave it at that</p>
<p>2) The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) has been redshifted as well, but to a much larger degree, making their once visbile light waves stretch out so much that they are now radiowaves. Not visible to the human eye, but once were. When you look at the CMB, you notice that everything is uniform with very minor variations. This suggests that all of these points we look at that are billions and billions of light-years away were once all together. There is some fancy math to be done here but it essentially proof of concept of the big bang, some fancy math was done (Blotzman Equations as mentioned in other comments), and it gives you the general beginning of when the universe might have been</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand it (someone correct me if wrong), the margin of error is only correct under assumption that the right model of universe expansion is used. Under different models, the age might be different. The margin of error is on the measurements plugged into the model and isn't on the choice of model itself</p>
<p>There's some additional evidence of the age of the universe, one of which is that stars/galaxies can be shown to be a certain age. That puts another limit on the age of the universe, which matches well with the CMB results, but is less precise overall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The CMB was the result of electron capture by protons and helium nuclei, ~380000 after the BB.  At this point the universe was a hot plasma consisting of free, unbound electrons, H and He nuclei and photons. Upon cooling, below the ionization threshold for neutral hydrogen , and expanding to a lower threshold density, the mean free path of the photons greatly exceeded the spacing between the nucleii. Protons captured electrons thus  emitting light, neutral hydrogen atoms formed and the universe became transparent. This is a similar state as the photosphere of a star, the region where light escapes. </p>
<p>Fusion resulting in deuterium, helium and lithium nucleii as a result of the BB ended long before the birth of the CMB. Fusion did not re-commence until stars ignited due to collapsing clouds of neutral hydrogen clumping up to a critical density. Once lit, reionization occurred as the universe was now bathed in a new source of light. Fusion was not directly involved in the creation of the CMB.The energy scales for fusion and electron capture are widely separated hence they separate in time in the early universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This also has to do with Hubble's constant. What Hubble's constant reveals is that galaxies that are more distant tend to travel at higher velocities away from us. By plotting all of these galaxies with distance on the X-axis and velocity on the Y-axis, it reveals an upward sloping line, and the slope of that line is the value of Hubble's constant. Its units of measurement are (kms^-1). / Mpc, and 1/Hubble's constant will give us an UPWARD estimate of the age of the universe. The reason it is an upward estimate is because this number assumes that there is no mass or deceleration in the universe, and that these galaxies have been traveling at this speed for all of time. </p>
<p>However, acceleration of the universe started ~5 billion years ago due to dark energy becoming more dense than regular matter. (Dark energy remains the same density regardless of volume.)  Imagine dark energy as when you throw a ball in the air, and when it hits it's maximum height on the parabola, it starts to rise rather than come down back to the ground. </p>
<p>This number has fluctuated in the last 100 years, for Hubble himself estimated his own constant incorrectly. By measuring the distance to galaxies incorrectly, he came up with the number 500(kms^-1) /Mpc, which put the universe at about 2 billion years old, when archeologists measured the earth to be about 3-4 billion based on dating rocks. To this day, we know Hubble's constant to be ~73.8 (kms^-1) / Mpc +/- 2.4(kms^-1) / Mpc. This puts the universe at around 13.8 billion years old. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
