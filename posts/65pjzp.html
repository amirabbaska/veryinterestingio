<p>The explanation I've always gotten is, roughly, 'well, in chromium each atom pairs with another atom, cancelling out the magnetic field' (i.e. antiferromagnetism) - but this leaves a lot to be desired. Why do such pairings form in chromium but not in iron? And why do such pairings form in such a way to cancel out the magnetic field? On a large scale, it's energetically favorable for magnets to orient themselves such that their fields add - why is it any different on an atomic scale?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism#Explanation" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> has a decent (and much better than I could do in a reddit comment) explanation of how ferromagnetism (permanent magnets) work. To properly understand why in some atoms parings are made and others are not requires a decent amount of <a href="https://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/JamesBinney/qb.pdf" target="_blank">quantum mechanics</a> at the 2nd/3rd year undergraduate level. The topic is actually hard to find a good book on online, the closest I could find were <a href="http://www.phys.ufl.edu/~pjh/teaching/phz7427/7427notes/ch3.pdf" target="_blank">these</a> <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jmjk/keeling/teaching/magnetism-notes.pdf" target="_blank">three</a> on <a href="https://www.upjs.sk/public/media/5596/Qauntum-Theory-of-Magnetism.pdf" target="_blank">quantum magnetism</a>.</p>
<p>To provide some quick hand-wavy answers:</p>
<p>Why do such pairings form in iron and not chromium?</p>
<ul>
<li>Iron valence electrons find it energetically favourable to align their spins rather than anti-align them (it's to do with an interaction between the pauli-exclusion principle [PEP], electromagnetic repulsion, and the exact arrangement of electrons).</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do pairings cancel out the magnetic field?</p>
<ul>
<li>All electrons have a magnetic moment (this is what gives rise to the magnetic field), it's orientation is dependent upon the particles' spin (either up or down). Due to the PEP, electrons in a filled shell will always pair up (one up and one down) and their magnetic moments will cancel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is it sometimes more energetically favourable on an atomic scale to anti-align magnetic fields?</p>
<ul>
<li>In the case of antiferromagnets the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction (which will anti-align fields) is stronger than the combination of the PEP and electrostatic repulsion that causes ferromagnetism. The exact reason for this requires lots of maths. </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/news/events/kkr_greens/programme/dias-wednesday.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is a good slideshow with some good books at the end (I can't find any of them online for free though)</p>
<p>I hope some of that is useful.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gist: electrons define magnetism as a side effect of quantum spin. The more electrons with the same spin (up) and no countering spin (down), the more magnetic the atom can be. Each orbital has two electrons in it - one of each spin. A valence shell has X number of orbitals in it, and each shell has more orbitals than the one before it and a higher energy level, but the higher the shell is, the narrower the energy level difference is between them. Each shell fills each orbital with an up electron first until the shell is half full, then the lowest orbital gets a down electron, then the next, etc. When shells' energy are close enough, adjacent orbitals in the nearby shells will also fill with up electrons before the down ones come into play. </p>
<p>Iron is in this sweet spot where the electrons can fill out several orbitals with up electrons without being countered by down electrons, and, because of the properties of paramagnetism, these &quot;ups&quot; can be matched with the &quot;ups&quot; of surrounding atoms when a magnetic field aligns them. Basically this means that iron can be stably filled with electrons without filling any of the outer orbitals with two electrons, and interactions between these shells of ups induces the same direction of up in nearby atoms. When this happens, the magnetic field has multiple contributions from different atoms and forms a larger magnet, and can continue to align nearby atoms with the same properties. </p>
<p>Chromium and other metals don't have as many &quot;exposed&quot; or disparate valance orbitals. Other metals usually have fewer exposed orbitals and/or the spins of the up electrons are mitigated by the spins of the down electrons in the same orbitals. </p>
<p>Think of magnetism as a disparity caused by quantum spin. The field is created when the net quantum property of the sea of electrons in a magnetic chunk of metal is very up and wants some down. Non-ferrous metals don't have as much of an up/down disparity, so the sea of electrons have a balanced spin proportion and the field created by whatever imbalance is much weaker. All the electrons are paired and happy. </p>
<p>Quick edit: I'm operating off of memory of knowledge I don't really use often, so please correct any lapses in vocabulary or understanding! ✌️</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This may not provide all the information you want but this channel has a lot of magnetism related videos. This is the first in a series reguarding exotic metals and magnetism, each video has some broad information on why some metals are not magnetic and others may be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
