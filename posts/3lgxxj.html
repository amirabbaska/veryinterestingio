		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dogs have a variety of microorganisms, such as bacteria and yeast, that live in their skin and produce <a href="http://www.compoundchem.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Aroma-Chemistry-Smell-of-Wet-Dog.png" target="_blank">a large number of volatile organic compounds</a> that have an intrinsic distinctive smell (i.e. which act as odorants). In this sense the &quot;wet dog smell&quot; is always there. What changes when dogs become wet is that the water can dissolve many of these compounds, which may have been trapped in various solids. Once the water evaporates, the surface area from which these volatile odorants can evaporate becomes much larger, which increases their concentration in the surrounding air, effectively amplifying the odor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why is it then some dogs smell WAY more, such as a lab. They tend to be very &quot;wet dog&quot; when they get wet but my boxer on the other hand smells nothing like a dog, I've heard this is very common to this breed too. I would think the breed wouldn't have any effect on the smell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's often caused by a specific microorganism that dogs often carry around. <a href="https://grapecollective.com/articles/from-smoked-meat-to-wet-dog-brettanomyces-in-wine" target="_blank"><em>Brettanomyces</em></a> is a genus of yeast that gives off that 'wet dog' aroma. You'll also find &quot;Brett&quot; in fermented foods like wine and beer, where in very small amounts it can contribute nice undertones but the populations can be very hard to control and maintain at a low/acceptable level and they eventually contribute a 'band-aid'-like aroma, especially in wine. In food science we call the smell &quot;Brett&quot; or &quot;Bretty&quot; aroma in reference.</p>
<p>EDIT: Why do they smell bad when they get wet? Probably because the increased moisture allows the Brett populations to explode for a while on in your dog's fur. Microorganisms need water to grow. When your dog dries off and maybe starts licking himself, some of those microbes will die off and the levels might stabilize, reducing the aroma compound production.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your smell recepters can pick up scents much easier in moist air than dry air.  This is the reason why you can &quot;smell&quot; the rain.  The rain doesn't have smell, it's just that the moist air enhances your ability to smell everything.  This is also the reason why farts always smell worse in the shower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
