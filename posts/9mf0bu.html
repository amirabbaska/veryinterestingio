		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit! Did you know that October 8 is National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day? It's definitely a day worth celebrating - after all, hydrogen and fuel cells are the perfect partners for clean, fuel-efficient transportation and a secure energy future. Here at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, we've pushed the frontiers of hydrogen and fuel cell research. In the area of electrocatalysis, we've developed a new molybdenum phosphide-based non-platinum group metal catalyst that has 5 times greater performance over similar current catalysts and improved results over platinum catalysts for microbial electrolysis. We've also invented a new design for magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction that integrates flow values to enable startup from room temperature as well as optimized operation. And our Chemical Transformations Initiative is allowing us to transform wastes into useful products like aviation fuels, while generating hydrogen gas at the same time. </p>
<p>We'll be on at 12:30 PT (3:30 ET, 20:30 UT), ask us anything!</p></div></div>

<p>Also, what are the other applications that people are thinking of for these fuel cells? Since portability is key I suppose, it's mostly in transportation uses? Or are there lots of other plans for these? Thanks again!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>With the recent, discouraging and frightening report on climate change, how much can these technologies be scaled up in our society? What would it take for them to be adopted widely enough to significantly impact carbon levels and thus help limit climate change?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
