		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a person sues because a police officer violated their civil rights, the lawsuit is almost always against the officer. Sometimes you can sue the local government if it has an unconstitutional policy (like a secret racial profiling policy you could somehow prove existed), but if there's no specific policy then the suit is against the individual officer.</p>
<p>However, individual officers rarely pay any significant portion of a judgment against them. The reason is that governments typically indemnify them. Indemnifying someone means you pay for their legal defense and the judgment against them. For example, your auto insurance company has an indemnification agreement with you for any motor vehicle accidents you cause. </p>
<p>Sometimes the indemnification is required by state law, sometimes it's required by county ordinance, and sometimes city officials decide whether to indemnify or not on an individual basis. Regardless of the exact method, almost every police officer gets indemnified for these types of suits.</p>
<p>There are a couple reasons a city may want to indemnify an officer. First, it helps make sure that your officers aren't afraid to police to the extent you want them to. If you want officers to be &quot;tough on crime&quot; but they have to worry about personally getting sued for being &quot;too tough&quot; then they won't carry out the orders vigorously. On the other hand, if the city is on the hook then it has an incentive to make sure it doesn't make its officers go too overboard because then it will be paying out a lot in judgments.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the person suing, it's good to have indemnification because if you win a $1 million judgment, most police officers wouldn't be able to pay that while a city could. Of course it also takes money from government funds that could be used for public services.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that officers sometimes do have to contribute to judgments against them, but in practice it's usually a small amount of officers and they only have to contribute a small amount.</p>
<p>The reason the money doesn't come from the police pension fund is that the fund is either (1) a contractual obligation the city will have to pay no matter what or (2) privately held by the officers/their union and not accessible in a judgment against an individual officer. You also probably don't want to rob an entire police department of its retirement because one person did one really crappy thing once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the same reason that your employer has to pay you worker's comp if you're injured on the job, even if the injury was your own fault: because you're doing a job that introduces you to risk (be it physical or legal) and it would be unreasonable for them to not help with the fallout. No one is perfect. </p>
<p>As well, having the employer (in this case the government) be on the hook for misconduct means that they are forced to take an active role in <em>preventing</em> it. If you don't believe me, check out workplace injuries during the early 1900's in the US. It wasn't until laws were in place that required employers to pay out to injured employees that things like safety harnesses and guard rails were implemented en mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplified answer?</p>
<p>If you do something bad to someone, and you're unable to compensate for it, it's immoral to have the person the harm was done to be penalized (Not receive compensation), or penalize those who had nothing to do with it (other members of the said fund/group). As such, especially when this said harm was done as a part of assigned duties of a person, it's the organization behind this assignment, that caused this harm, that should be paying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Would you work for a place where everytime one of your Co workers fucked up they took money out of your pension?  You would think it would encourage people not to fuck up but I promise so long as there are police, there will be people suing them.  If you get busted doing something and you are facing 30 years in prison what's to stop you from suing the police to try to get money?  Even if you have to make things up you are losing nothing by trying.</p>
<p>I'm not saying all lawsuits are fabricated, but you have to know some people are winning settlements with absolutely no wrong doing.  </p>
<p>On top of that I'm fairly confident taking money out of pensions is theft and even if you get fired by a place they can't take money from you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other good root-level responses, typically we sue police officers individually and then the police department (and others, typically even the supervisors and chief) for policies of training, etc.  </p>
<p>As these cases progress, typically we receive a very quick response to dismiss the individual officer and proceed against the city or police department.  By the time of trial or settlement, most of these cases will no longer contain the individual officer as a defendant - depending on the circumstances.  </p>
<p>To the rest of your question, the payment will never come out of the police pension fund - that's just not how it works (others have explained why).  The police department pays out exactly how Walmart or any other private firm would - from their operating fund or from insurance coverage (depending).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
