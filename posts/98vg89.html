The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_cognition#Elephant_altruism" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> gives several examples of elephant helpfulness. In general, elephants have very strong feelings of mourning, compassion and empathy both towards their kin and other creatures, and it seems they're very aware of how fragile most things are compared to themselves.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are <em>loooooads</em> of cases of animals saving humans and other animals.  I am going to stick to purely wild animals (no pets, no livestock, no zoo animals) saving humans, because I find them the most interesting.</p>
<p>In 2005, a 12-year-old Ethiopian girl was saved from kidnappers by <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8305836/ns/world_news-africa/t/ethiopian-girl-reportedly-guarded-lions/" target="_blank">three lions</a>, who then stayed with her until rescuers arrived.  Some have theorised that the lions originally planned to eat the girl, but were then confused when her cries sounded like those of a cub in distress.</p>
<p>In 2000, a teenage boy jumped off the Golden Gate bridge in an attempted suicide.  A <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11448514/San-Francisco-bridge-jumper-says-sea-lion-saved-him.html" target="_blank">California seal lion</a> repeatedly swam around him and kept lifting him to the surface to breathe.  There are <a href="https://www.dolphins-world.com/dolphins-rescuing-humans/" target="_blank">numerous reported cases</a> of dolphins doing the same thing for drowning people, or else warning divers of the presence of large sharks.</p>
<p>In 1974, a 52-year-old woman caught in a shipwreck was saved by a <a href="https://www.trivia-library.com/b/mystery-and-strange-phenomenon-from-the-fortean-times-part-2.htm" target="_blank">sea turtle</a>.  Bizarrely, the animal allowed her to ride on its back for 36 hours until she was rescued.</p>
<p>In one of my favourite cases, the human in question didn't actually need to be saved!  In 2013, a National Geographic photographer was videoing leopard seals in the Antarctic.  A massive female began approaching him very closely - alarming, since leopard seals have been known to kill humans!  But this female instead began bringing him penguins.  First live ones, then wounded ones and eventually dead ones, going so far as to shove them right into the camera lens.  The photographer came to the conclusion that, for whatever reason, the female leopard seal was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/06/06/531735345/polar-photographer-shares-his-view-of-a-ferocious-but-fragile-ecosystem" target="_blank">trying to feed him</a>.</p>
<p>There are other cases!  Animal altruism and empathy has been well-documented.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In the case of wild animals, dolphins have been documents to help drowning humans/dogs, but also fend off a shark on one occasion (BBC reenactment of the event: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxuSRnVdwgM&ab_channel=ActionforDolphins" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxuSRnVdwgM&ab_channel=ActionforDolphins</a>)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Semi-related, but there was the story of a gorilla in 1996 that helped out a 3-year old who had fallen into its enclosure. It's possible that the gorilla just thought it had found a baby gorilla and so didn't know it had helped out a different species, but it's something.</p>
