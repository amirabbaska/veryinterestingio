		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body creates chemicals naturally that control various things, which make you feel happy, sad, horny, energetic, etc. These are things like dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, etc. These chemicals traverse your body via the nervous system. There are receptors in each nerve that &quot;moves&quot; the chemicals along. </p>
<p>Use of external chemicals (heroin in this case) add in a supply of chemicals that bind to your receptors. Given the abundance of said chemical, your body reacts by shutting down functions - it doesn't need to spend energy making something that it has enough of. </p>
<p>I like to use the following analogy to explain it simply - it leaves out complexities of metabolism, equilibrium, and parasympathetic activities but is easy to visualize: </p>
<p>Pretend there is a factory, a warehouse and a consumer in your body. Factory makes the chemicals and ships to warehouse. Warehouse sends chemicals to the consumer. One day the warehouse receives a shipment of heroin, which is an adequate substitute for your body's naturally made morphine. The shipping trucks load up and deliver to the consumer - who to their surprise, says they don't need it yet and to come back later. The trucks return to the warehouse full. So they overfill the warehouse with the unused heroin, and the warehouse calls the factory to say they don't need anymore for a couple days. The factory employees get laid off until they need to start again. The factory workers go on vacation as a result.  </p>
<p>Another shipment of heroin comes in as the consumer starts needing more, and so the factory still isn't producing but the consumer continues to run, happily. The factory layoff continues, so the workers start going out of town and what not. This keeps happening as the heroin shipment from this mysterious benefactor keeps coming. Expecting another heroin shipment, the factory layoff continues, except that the shipment never shows up. No problem, the overstock can be delivered. As the supply at the warehouse starts to dwindle, the factory workers start getting recalled. Except, a few are on a cruise, a few got super wasted, a few aren't answering the phones, a few got locked up streaking around a college campus. The boss is getting pissed, but what can the boss do?</p>
<p>Now the consumer doesn't have any chemicals that it really needs. This is when withdrawals begin. The super drunk guys eventually sober up and wander back to the factory, but three guys can't do all the jobs themselves. In all, it took about two weeks to get the factory back to full staff, making morphine again. </p>
<p>Selective Serotonin Re uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) block the serotonin receptors, causing your body to make <em>more</em> serotonin because the tank is reading empty. </p>
<p>Along with this analogy, the trucks going to the consumer never showed up with the SSRIs (they really did, but they never filled out their log book saying they did). As a result, the warehouse is going below its level trying to keep the consumer happy, who in turn calls the factory to order twice as much. The consumer is happier because it's getting twice the serotonin for the same price as a single lot!</p>
<p>This is intentionally oversimplified for a basic ELI5 understanding. Drugs and the human body are crazy complicated. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a much, much simpler eli5.</p>
<p>Every circuit the brain needs an opposing system to slow it down and keep things balanced. Because the opiate system is extremely complex, let's just call them the wellness and pain system. Your body produces heroin-like substances that help do that for pain and wellness circuit.</p>
<p>heroin is way more powerful than what we naturally produce, and the circuits get used to heroin and our natural balancing systems aren't strong enough to counteract the desensitization. </p>
<p>Once the person doesn't have anymore heroin, the pain and wellness circuits have nothing to balance them out, and the person feels a lot of pain and a lot of unwellness, called opiate-induced hyperalgesia. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Deeper cuts</strong></p>
<p>If we want to go deeper, it's receptor based. Heroin binds to wellness (opiate) receptors and puts them into overdrive. The body senses this powerful signal and reduces the number of receptors in an effort to normalize the signal. </p>
<p>When you no longer have that powerful artificial signal, the circuit isn't normalized, it's underdriven. The brain just doesn't have enough juice to keep the pain circuit under control.</p>
<p>Dope sickness is due to the fact that we have opiate receptors all throughout our body. They regulate not only pain, but hormonal stress. If you fuck with all those things at once, you get fluishness as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heroin withdrawal can cause a huge adrenaline level in your body. This can result in diarrhea, vomiting, restless legs and a very strong heart beat. Diarrhea and vomiting will make your body lose a lot of minerals and vitamins which results in cramps and other not so nice side effects. This is one of a few other reasons why withdrawal hurts physically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
