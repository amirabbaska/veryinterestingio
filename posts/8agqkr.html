		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t.  Clear Ice is made by slowly freezing, allowing bubbles and imperfections to find their way out.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly. You can make clear ice at home by putting your molds and water inside a small cooler, sealing it, and placing the cooler in your freezer. The cooler acts as insulation and slows the freezing process. And if you have a thin layer of air bubbles on the edge, you can trim it off; this should leave you with near perfect ice cubes.</p>
<p>**Edit: As a fellow redditor pointed out, I completely forgot to mention the water should be cooled directionally. My apologies, it’s been a long time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ignore every comment about impurities. Clear ice can form on dirty lakes. The ONLY way to get clear ice is to freeze the water <em>in only one direction</em>. Cubes in your freezer freeze from the outside in trapping bubbles, creating fractures, etc. Ice sculpture ice (and higher end beverage ice makers like ColdDraft) freeze the water in only one direction. (I spent 4 months researching this.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you are drawing a grid on a blank piece of paper.</p>
<p>When you can start on one edge and continue making the grid in a uniform and consistent way you get a clear grid structure.</p>
<p>Now imagine you have a huge piece of paper (the size of a city), a pen that runs out of ink quickly (causing you to need to walk off the sheet to get a new one), and you can rarely find where you started your grid. Each grid you start is likely not pefectly consistent with the others. The grid that finishes will look ugly and cloudy.</p>
<p>It is the same for ice. If you can force the water to freeze in one direction it will be consistent all the way through. As an experiment put a couple inches of water in a small cooler ( small enough for your freezer). Put the cooler with the water in the freezer with the top of the cooler off. Let it freeze, it will be clear. You can run a little bit of warm water on the block to get it out of the cooler.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water contains dissolved air (it's how fish breathe).  Less air can be dissolved at higher temperatures, so boiling the water removes most of the dissolved air.  This air bubbling out is part of what causes cloudy ice, so freezing previously boiled water can result in a less cloudy ice cube.</p>
<p>(As mentioned elsewhere, the air bubbles tend to come out at the end of freezing when there is no liquid left for them to be dissolved in, so the best way to get clear ice is to only let half your water freeze, and the dissolved air and other impurities will stay in the remaining liquid water)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
