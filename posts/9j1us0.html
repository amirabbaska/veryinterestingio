		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>True seasonal breeding is actually pretty rare among the haplorhine primates (of which we are members)  While certain species will show peaks in breeding seasonally, haplorhines typically follow a cyclical period of menses and are capable of reproduction during key points of that cycle.  Such cycles are typically not seasonally linked and can occur multiple times through a year.  It is also important to note that it’s not just about cycling as most females are typically not cycling at a given point.  This is due to the fact that among wild primates females are typically at a nonfertile point during their overall reproductive (not menstrual) cycle — either they are pregnant or are currently lactating.  Actually actual fertile parts of the cycle come fairly infrequently, especially among taxa which demonstrate prolonged offspring dependence (e.g., orangs, chimps, etc) which may last a period of years.</p>
<p>This is not to say all primates are not seasonal breeders.  Strepsirrhines (lemurs, lorises and galagos) demonstrate strict reproductive estrus in the primitive mammalian form (think along the lines of a cat or a dog — they essentially go into heat).  This is often linked to breeding seasonality so that lactation occurs during high resource availability and/or it is linked to patterns of infant development and the ability of the kids to be weaned on seasonally available food resources.</p>
<p>So long story short...not all primates are seasonal breeders, including our closest ansestors.  However, some species with faster interbirth intervals and infant development are...Although these tend to be strepsirrhines to which we are only distantly related.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What are the seasons even like in the original hominid environments?</p>
<p>I would posit that maybe in a more stable, more equatorial climate, there is less reason to have seasonal controls on mating, and instead there is reason to allow for opportunistic mating at all times of the year. Fitness should improve with allowing more chances for mating instead of limiting.</p>
<p>I really dislike all of this stuff about fire and shelter. Those are new innovations. It is unlikely to evolve really strong underlying REPRODUCTIVE characteristics in 300k years or whatever. The hominid line has been diverged from chimps and other apes for millions of years. And they are also apparently year-round breeders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
