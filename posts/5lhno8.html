<p>In middle stages, grammar and content can be disrupted due to the state of confusion. </p>
<p>In the later stages, some patients completely lose the ability to initiate or respond to conversation, and require picture cues in order to communicate basic wants and needs.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neuropsychologist. Short answer is, many people do. </p>
<p>As has been noted in several posts, brain functions are in many ways &quot;geographically&quot; located. It is very common for Alzheimer's disease to first impact the left temporal lobe. In more &quot;classic&quot; presentations, the disease impacts two regions, the first being the medial temporal lobe where hippocampus is, a formation that plays a major role in memory functions. The second, moving outward (towards the ear) is a region of the temporal lobe very important for language functions. </p>
<p>In addition to memory difficulties, another classic first symptom of AD is language disturbance called anomia, or the inability to name objects.  In daily living this is observable when people have more &quot;tip of the tongue&quot; moments&quot; or circumlocution (talking around the name of the object). Example, when grandma asks for a pen, but cannot come up with &quot;pen&quot; --- &quot;Can you pass me that...you know that thing you write with....it has ink..&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is some amount of compartmentalization / functional specialization in the brain so that different areas of the brain are more involved in certain functions than others. Different kinds of memory (such as semantic (memory of facts), procedural (memory for skills like walking or playing an instrument), and episodic (memory for events that happen to you)) are localized in different parts of the brain. Language (both understanding and production) are also localized separately. Alzheimer's does not seem to have as much of an effect on those as on episodic memory. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many do, all depends on the individual, how much the disease has progressed and which areas of the brain are affected. PPA or primary progressive aphasia is the gradual degradation of speech and language due to degeneration in the areas of the brain that control these functions (wernicke's and broca's areas). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
