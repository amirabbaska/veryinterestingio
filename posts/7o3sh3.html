		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something worth noting: there are many bodily and hormonal changes that occur during sleep meant to prevent inturruptions. Things like ADH increases to prevent urination, and regulating ghrelin and leptin levels to control hunger.</p>
<p>I can't seem to find any good articles for which horomone/bodily change (if any) would impact nicotine dependency (I'm on mobile, and searching anything that includes &quot;sleep&quot; and &quot;tobacco&quot; results in a flood of garbage articles) but I expect some amount of research has been done on it.</p>
<p>Given the body's ability to keep standard needs in check while sleeping I expect a similar mechanism helps curb some drug addictions during sleep. However, by nature of being a non-standard need it would likely not be curbed as effectively and could still interfere with sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>chemically, everything a cigarette does to you is inclined to activate and energize through acetylcholine receptor uptake (acting as a neurotransmitter), epinephrine production (kind of a big thing if the goal is to sleep), blood pressure increases, alertness increases, a glucose dump, etc. everything that would be counter to going to sleep besides the habituated feeling of 'relaxation' which is really a bit less relaxing that we might think, yet captures smokers when awake. in the case of chain smoking wakers, is it possible they wake for other reasons and use the time to smoke as well?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The neuroadaptation of nicotine dependence is pretty complex. There's the so-called 'sensitization-homeostasis (SH) model', which states that consumption of nicotine both depresses craving circuits (acutely) and triggers their formation (chronically, Brain Sci. 2012 Oct 17;2(4):523-52.). Cellular mechanisms are described here, for example: Dialogues Clin Neurosci. 15 (4): 431â€“443. The autonomous nervous system gets activated upon withdrawal, which make people fuzzy, anxious, etc.</p>
<p>Nicotine plasma concentrations dropping below a certain level, thereby triggering withdrawal, is just one part of the picture. It has a half-life of 1-2 hours, so after 4-8 hours most of it will have left the system. There are also active metabolites such as cotinine that are eliminated much more slowly.</p>
<p>But basically, just looking at nicotine and not the other stuff they put in cigarettes, after a good night's sleep you're pretty much detoxed physically. Unfortunately, there's the psychological triggers such as morning cup of joe, a beer, a meal, or social situations (stress, rewarding oneself for accomplishments, the routine of smoking with peers) that are very tough to overcome (JAMA. 2012;308(15):1573). These are not present when one is sleeping.</p>
<p>The fact that some smokers wake up because of craving has not really been studied. There's a couple of articles such as in Acta Med Austriaca. 2001;28(1):21-2 ('Nocturnal sleep-disturbing nicotine craving: a newly described symptom of extreme nicotine dependence.') but that's about it. Difficulty here is separating the disturbed sleep architecture that comes with smoking from physically being woken up because nicotine levels dropped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
