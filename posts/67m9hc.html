		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientist's don't actually know. The prevailing theory is because of where the cells originate and the difference between stem cells and simply having cells divide.</p>
<p>When we are a fetus, growing inside the womb, our Stem Cells are being used to build everything. It is building bones and muscle and organs and skin. Stem Cells are blank discs that hold the information to do anything in the body.</p>
<p>After we are born, we no longer produce stem cells in such quantities. Instead our individual cells will divide. This is what causes skin to grow back over a cut. It is just the skin growing back.</p>
<p>Why does this happen? Scientists aren't sure. Figuring it out would help amputees regrow at least rudimentary body parts and even organs. Most studies on the topics look at reptile DNA since so many lizards have the ability to regrow tails and even appendages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, it isn't entirely true that scientists do not know. The problem seems to be that we can no longer &quot;remodel&quot; tissue, even if we can grow it. Wound healing usually involves cells of the same type, growing to replace tissue. So blood vessels make more blood vessels, skin cells make more skin cells etc...and the wound is patched up.</p>
<p>Creating any kind of structure requires cells to not just grow, but also adopt shapes and properties in a series of co-ordinated steps such that you end up with, say a finger. It seems this ability to grown <em>and then remodel into an organ</em> is lost in humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes we can heal cuts and wounds. But in bigger and deeper wounds, the new tissue isn't even of the same quality as the original tissue. There is more fibrous tissue that lacks elasticity. If you have a large scar, you can tell that it doesn't stretch the same way as the surrounding skin. Scar tissue isn't as as resilient as the original tissue. So to say that we can regrow skin is almost a stretch, let alone grow new limbs. If we did grow new limbs, I image they would be shriveled up little things that wouldn't compare to the originals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wound healing, complex as it is, is predominantly scar tissues.  Once all the white blood cells are done with cleaning the area, what remained after it completely healed is collagen fibers.</p>
<p>Now compare that to a limb: in a single finger we have, from superficial to deep, the skin (collagen), nerves, blood vessels, muscle fibers, bones, and a bunch of other cell types that I've neglected to mention.  All of these are layered in concert so that our fingers can operate and look the way they do.  </p>
<p>A human fetus in growth has certain chemical factors in play that dictate where a certain cell type will migrate, where some cells will undergo apoptosis, and when to divide.  A grown human simply lacks most of the ingredients needed to grow back an amputated limb. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's evolutionary. Being able to regenerate comes with a major con: it makes you more susceptible to malign tumours. And apparently in our case the benefits of being able to regenerate doesn't outweigh the increased risk of cancer.</p>
