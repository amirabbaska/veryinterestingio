		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One issue is that free trade naturally means more competition. Say you've got a good little business making and selling gizmos in the US. No one in the US does it better and cheaper than you, so you're doing well.</p>
<p>Now a free trade agreement is signed with China, which means they are suddenly allowed to export gizmos to the US and sell them there. Wages are lower there so their gizmos are 40% cheaper than yours. For all the people who buy gizmos, that's wonderful, and if you look at the economy as a whole it might even boost growth (because all the gizmo buyers now have more money let to spend on other things, plus whatever they build using gizmos can now be made cheaper and in greater numbers), but it <em>also</em> threatens your job. It may create new jobs, but it <em>also</em> costs existing jobs. </p>
<p>For your country as a whole, the free trade deal might be a net benefit, but for some individuals in that country, it means a loss of their job or their family business. If this process runs unchecked for a long period, you end up with large areas of the country where virtually no jobs and no industry exists, where unemployment and poverty is rampant, even while he country <em>as a whole</em> becomes wealthier. This has happened in both the US and the UK, for example. The cities are doing great, but in other areas, people have <em>nothing</em>, because their old coal or steel mines closed, as free trade agreements meant the same could be imported more cheaply, and while new jobs were created in the big cities, nothing happened in these desolate areas.</p>
<p>Another problem is that these &quot;modern&quot; trade agreements have tended to have some dubious provisions in them allowing huge corporations to sue countries if they introduce laws that make it harder for the corporation to sell their goods. For example, some countries have been sued by big tobacco corporations because they introduced laws to discourage smoking. Others have been sued for blocking mining companies from creating new, environmentally harmful, mines in populated areas. The EU has dropped bans of certain harmful pesticides in anticipation of TTIP, because such a ban would risk a lawsuit if the trade deal was ratified.</p>
<p>The especially problematic thing about these lawsuits is that (1) these corporations often have greater revenues than the GDP of many smaller countries, and the country might simply be unable to afford losing such a lawsuit and be forced to just do what the corporation wants them to.
Additionally, these cases are not taken to actual courts, but are run by special tribunals which are effectively above national law: they judge <em>solely</em> based on the text of the trade deal, not on what is actually legal in the country in question.</p>
<p>Such investor-state dispute settlements (ISDS) have the potential to be devastating for democracy, as you end up with corporations effectively coercing governments into writing or lifting certain laws.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tl;dr: The benefits of free trade are massive, but divided into very small bits spread across entire populations, making them very hard to notice. The harm of free trade is smaller but extremely focused on small groups, who are therefore more vocal in their opposition.  </p>
<p>There's 2 main issues (and a whole whole lot of smaller issues, but keeping it ELI5...)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>While the entire population benefits, that positive impact is not as noticeable to an individual as the negative impact of losing their job. (Though Free Trade does not destroy jobs, it does re-locate them.) So if 300 million people save $10/year from cheaper free-trade goods, that's $3B, which is way more than the $500M in wages lost by the people who lost their job as a result. However, you and I don't think 'wow, i saved 2 cents, thanks free trade!' when you're buying paper towels - but the company that shut down knows exactly why, and is vocal about it. </p>
</li>
<li>Free Trade Deals are never Free Trade - more like Freer Trade.  NAFTA, TPP, and others are all about loosening of restrictions, but there are still TONS of restrictions.  And when you're negotiating these complex things, you have to give and take, when means you prioritize some industries over others and playing favorites.  Again, less restrictions are overall better, but if you're not one of the groups with well connected lobbyists or a strong influence on voting, then you may end up seeing your market become freer while others still enjoy federally-protected monopolies.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason free trade deals are criticized is that their benefits are largely invisible while their downsides are readily apparent.  </p>
<p>The costs of a free trade deal are concrete; factories close, people lose their jobs, communities that rely on those jobs suffer.  Its easy to understand and communicate these losses.  You can publish photos of decaying empty factories and send a news crew out to interview unemployed men sitting in their kitchens and see it as you drive past a shuddered small town main street.  The pain is real and immediate but it can also be misleading because relative to the size of the economy the losses are minuscule.  Its like how people overestimate the risk posed by terrorism or shark attacks because it is so emotionally raw and reported on when it does happen.  </p>
<p>The benefits are harder to visualize.  While some industries are hurt others begin to expand thanks to increased demand from exports and go on to create new jobs and open new factories and generate new wealth.  But unlike the losses which are centralized the new gains are diffuse and harder to pin down.  On top of the growth, free trade deals drive down the cost of consumer goods improving the spending power of working class people.  But once again the savings are small and spread out making the gains impossible to see day to day.  </p>
<p>Free trade also generates huge political gains but those are even more amorphous than the economic ones.  Free trade deals bind countries together diplomatically, give them strong economic incentives for peace, and provides them with a legal framework to settle their differences. These things are incredibly important for world peace and stability but you can't put a value on them; you can take a picture of them to show next to the rotted out factory.  </p>
<p>Look at NAFTA.  NAFTA affected an incredibly small portion of the economy.  It cost the US roughly 700,000 jobs and closed some auto plants as we transitioned into the deal.  But the best estimate is that the resulting growth and price saving generates roughly 100 dollars per US worker per year indefinitely.  That is a huge value.  It is fair to say that we didn't do right by those 700,00 people who were hurt --that we didn't do enough to retrain them and soften the pain-- but that is an extension of the failure on the part of US government to do right by the entire working class and not a failure of NAFTA.</p>
<p>Free trade is a lot like global warming.  The economic science is in and ninety-nine percent of economists agree that free trade is good for countries and beneficial to their citizens, but its a value that is hard to see while the immediate cost in jobs is apparent to everyone.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Loss of control.</p>
<p>Imagine X Land and Y republic both make products and sell them.  </p>
<p>They want to sell internationally.  </p>
<p>XLand could &quot;cheat&quot; by making all sorts of taxes and laws in order to artificially to make YR products more costly to buy in XLand, in order to help Xland companies (and the XLand economy) by making sure XLandians &quot;buy XLandian&quot;.  </p>
<p>Of course, this is kind of unfair, and YR might retaliate by doing something similar, which just stifles trade and makes less products available at good prices for all the people.  </p>
<p>Instead, both countries agree to &quot;free trade&quot; they won't do anything to block each others' sales.  They'll just allow open market competition.  Best products win.  </p>
<p>Problem: </p>
<p>What happens when YR starts cheating in another way?</p>
<p>YR products are competing with Xlandian products.  Obviously, its good for the YR economy is YR companies are doing better.  </p>
<p>So, YR companies start intentionally targeting Xland companies, making their own versions of the same products, fighting for the exact same markets, knowing that they don't have to play by the same rules.  Xland has strict rules about minimum wage, and safety regulations, and environmental protections.  YR doesn't have any of that.  Thus their companies can make competing products at a cost Xland can't match.  </p>
<p>Then, YR cheated the exchange rate. They intentionally under report the value of their own currency.  1XL dollars should be worth 2YR dollars, but YR lied.  They claim things are going worse for them and that their dollars are weaker than they really are.  The set it up so that 1XL dollar is valued at 4YR dollars.  This phony exchange rate makes XL dollars twice as strong as they should be.  (Read: YR products twice a cheap on the Xland market).</p>
<p>To make it worse, YR is outright copying Xland.  Their companies are copying Xland companies designs.  XLand company can't sue because the YR companies aren't in their country, so they can't take them to court.  YR won't enforce Xland patents  or copyrights.  In fact, there is evidence to show that YR companies straight spied on XLand companies.  It even seems like the YR government's official spy service helped private companies spy on their XLand rivals so they could get an edge.</p>
<p>So, YR is doing all these shady things to fix the market so that YR companies are beating Xland and Xlands businesses and economy are suffering for it.  </p>
<p>Normally, Xland would just say &quot;WTF? From now on, any product that isn't produced fairly, by a company following our rules, can't be sold here.  It will be blocked, or at least taxed unless it plays by our rules&quot;</p>
<p>BUT, the trade agreement says XLand isn't allowed to do that.  They have given up their right to do that.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main issue is that Free trade agreement means that companies might freely stretch into a lot of different countries, and all of these have specific taxes, and different ecological laws.</p>
<p>Well if you make a free trade agreement, the companies, to be more competitive, will split there activities where it's the least expensive, so they will put their corporate seat in the country that has the lowest corporate tax, their heavy factories in the country that has the least social protections and lowest wages, their R&amp;D pool in the country that has the lowest taxes on high wages, ...</p>
<p>Before the agreement, if your raise the taxes by five percents, you are risking a slowdown of your economy, more or less proportional to the raise in taxes. After the agreement, any law that make your country less competitive than any other country in any given sector will give all your industry of that kind an invective to leave.</p>
<p>It also means that ecological laws have a much amplified effect on industry : if it makes, say coal 10% more expensive to extract than in the neighboring country, and provided that they have enough supply to satisfy the demand, ALL of your coal industry is going to die overnight.</p>
<p>All in all it put a huge pressure to the governments to lower taxes on companies, and get rid of ecological laws far above what it was before the free trade agreement. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
