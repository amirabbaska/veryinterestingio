		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Compound eyes are good for detecting and tracking fast motion, and allow for a very wide field of view, as you can just keep adding more cells as you wrap the eye around the head.  Simple eyes, like vertebrates have, only allow a relatively narrow field of view but allow much higher resolution, allowing the use of much smaller eyes and the ability to see things further away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hexagon is one of the most efficient way to fill out a surface. If you put bubble next to each other, they will naturally form hexagon shape. This is because a sphere is the less surface area by volume, but if several sphere need to touch each other, the hexagon is the less  surface by volume.</p>
<p>The less surface by volume is very important because it put the less amount of stress and the less amount of material for a set volume. </p>
<p>Here an image of bubble of soap.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other answers about hexagons, it's probably also about efficient image processing in the brain. The flat hexagon surfaces create separate, individual small images in the eye which can be processed and put together. Same as our eyes create 2 separate images which are then put together in the brain.</p>
<p>If the insect eye surface was completely smooth, that would create a &quot;fish eye&quot; lens across a huge area. That stretches everything out, and you lose detail. It is also possibly far more difficult for the brain to process that stretched image into useful information, as opposed to processing hundreds of small, flat images in parallel.</p>
<p>I also imagine that having lots of small, neat, individual components makes it easier for the brain to organise wiring and signalling.</p>
<p>ED: It's also possible that, for extra efficiency, the insect brain can pay special attention only to those individual images which change frequently, possibly indicating danger. Like looking at a bank of TV screens - if most of them are still images and only a few are moving, you only need to pay attention to the moving ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
