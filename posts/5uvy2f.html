		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physician here. Hemorrhoids are veins that have becomes swollen In the rectum. Occasionally they may bleed which leaves an open communication between the blood stream and the colon but they don't often get infected. Why? Think of it as a small weak fish (bacteria) trying to swim upstream against a fast current.  It doesn't get anywhere right? That's the pressure behind the vein. Now imagine the same stream with a bunch predator fish swimming around eating the small fish.  This is the immune system in and around the rectum.  So we have a two protection systems against infection.  </p>
<p>The most common reason hemorrhoids become infected is when the blood supply to the hemorrhoid ceases (strangulated or thrombosed). So now there is a dam, river comes to a standstill and the predator fish can't get in so the little fish (bacteria) can go wherever he likes including right into the now dead tissue of the hemorrhoid and wreak havoc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rectum/anus has a very solid immune readiness, both inteh form of lymphoid tissue and adequate blood supply. You can actually cut into the rectum and leave the wound bed open, and you won't get abscesses.
Imagine that there is an old-fashioned war, on a battlefield, with troops rushing towards each other and going at it with hammer, tongs, tooth &amp; claw.
The two sides would be the bacteria that are trying to multiply fast enough to bring troops to the front line, and their opponents are your neutrophil leucocytes, or white blood cells, that are getting to the front from the war factory of your bone marrow and making an amphibious landing via your bloodstream.
Both sides are dying in droves. Their dead bodies are what makes up pus, which is actually often sterile, oddly enough.
In the rectum/anus, the bacteria are fighting from a very small beachhead, uphill, and are vastly outnumbered. It's like the body has a tsunami of troops.
While rectal abscesses and infections do occur, mostly it is because there is a compromise in the ability of the body to deliver troops to the front line, or the dead bodies accumulate in a pocket, like and abscess, so you can't clear the dead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
