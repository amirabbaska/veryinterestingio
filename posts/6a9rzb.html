		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hair coarseness is a function of the thickness of each individual shaft of hair. Beard hairs are coarser than scalp hairs because they are individually thicker than your head hairs. One of the main things that influences hair thickness is the size of the dermal papilla, the space the root of the hair shaft sits in at the base of the follicle. Dermal papilla size is characterised both in terms of the space afforded within the dermal (skin) matrix and the number of cells at the dermal papilla.</p>
<p>Table 2 in the following paper shows that the dermal papilla in male beard hair follicles is around 4 times the size of dermal papilla in male scalp follicles. So we might expect that beard hairs are thicker than scalp hairs</p>
<p><a href="http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022202X15406700/1-s2.0-S0022202X15406700-main.pdf?_tid=d76ae1b6-3561-11e7-a265-00000aab0f01&acdnat=1494408180_3ef85226c926ada6bdd37aae4e068499" target="_blank">http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022202X15406700/1-s2.0-S0022202X15406700-main.pdf?_tid=d76ae1b6-3561-11e7-a265-00000aab0f01&acdnat=1494408180_3ef85226c926ada6bdd37aae4e068499</a></p>
<p>This paper (figures 4 through 7) show that follicle size is roughly correlated with hair shaft thickness at different body sites, although they don't specifically measure the dermal papilla size (which would be rather invasive).</p>
<p><a href="http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022202X15306291/1-s2.0-S0022202X15306291-main.pdf?_tid=6e7ddb36-3561-11e7-a5ee-00000aacb362&acdnat=1494408004_b8c74d07766baecfbeff46a1f8d98c18" target="_blank">http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022202X15306291/1-s2.0-S0022202X15306291-main.pdf?_tid=6e7ddb36-3561-11e7-a5ee-00000aacb362&acdnat=1494408004_b8c74d07766baecfbeff46a1f8d98c18</a></p>
<p>That's the proximal, specific reason beard hair is coarser than scalp hair. Also worth noting that follicle density is lower on the face than the scalp and that likely increases the perception of coarseness as the fingers can better resolve each individual hair when the face is stroked.</p>
<p><em>Edit: Possibly &quot;dermal papilla size differences&quot; isn't enough of an explanation, so I'll add a bit more:</em></p>
<p><em>You essentially have 2 types of hair covering your body ultra fine, unpigmented and short Vellus hairs and thick, long, pigmented  Terminal hairs. Hair follicles will convert from vellus hairs to terminal hair follicles when exposed to sufficient levels of androgen hormones (largely testosterone). Hair follicles across the body also show a great range in sensitivity to androgens. Scalp follicles are very sensitive so you grow terminal hairs from your scalp, from infancy, with very modest levels of androgens present. Pubic and beards hairs require the additional increases in androgen levels that come with puberty and once the threshold is met they are also acutely sensitive to the raised level of hormones. The androgen signal causes the follicle to mature, rebuilding and enlarging much of its structure. Interestingly the dermal papilla is believed to be the main site of action within the follicle of this hormone signal. The the extent of these changes is a result of the degree of sensitivity to the new androgens, with more sensitive follicles growing larger which in turn leads to thicker hairs.</em></p>
<p><em>Scalp hairs do not undergo additional thickening at puberty as the follicles are already mature. Interestingly, sufficiently raised androgen levels has the ability to convert scalp terminal hairs back to vellus hairs:</em></p>
<p><em>Here is a really nice review of all this material, and you can read more detail from the section titled &quot;How do androgens carry out these changes?&quot;</em></p>

<p>It certainly appears to be an evolved trait. Beard growth shows  strong sexual dimorphism; males have obvious beard growth and women very little. This kind of marked sexual dimorphism is usually taken as evidence that the trait is primarily influenced by sexual selection rather than some other environmental selection. Another piece of evidence that this is a sexually selected trait is that beard hairs come in around the onset of sexual maturity, which strongly suggests they are a signal of sexual maturation.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection</a></p>
<p>It seems unlikely that exposure (wind chill, precipitation etc...) is the cause. We have no evidence that males spent less time sheltered than women in the Paleolithic period during which Homo sapiens evolved. For many hunter-gatherers men do typically hunt but women spend significant time out gathering (fun fact: grandmothers gather significantly more calories per day than the men acquire through hunting). Also humans evolved near the equator and I'm not aware of any evidence that extant hunter-gatherers living on or near the equator show any gender based differences in sheltering. </p>
<p>Worth noting that women do hunt in some hunter-gatherer groups but I don't think they've started growing beards. Although perhaps they've just not had enough evolutionary time... ;)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What proteins are in beard hair which aren't found in other types of hair?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beard and scalp hairs are both constructed from type 1 and type 2 keratin. There's no specific proteinaceous difference between beard and other hairs.</p>
<p>Edit: In case people revisit this answer. Some people are asking what is the evolutionary reason beard hairs are thicker than scalp hairs. I'm not aware of any work on this nor on how we could assess this. The above answer is kept largely to what Science does know about beard hair thickness and the evolutionary drive for beard presence. Coming up with an evolutionary Just-So story about the Why of it would be much too speculative. Not all traits are under strict evolutionary selection so beard hair thickness may just be an artefact of the process which matures pubic and beard follicles</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hair, like nails, horns, claws and much skin is Keratin, an extremely stable protein. As such it's preserved from 100's of millions of years ago, because of that structural, least energy characteristic. Feathers are seen often fossilized, as are reptilian skin, which are other, common forms of keratin. We cannot digest hair, and most animals cannot either, tho bacteria, fungi and some others can, just like lignin, or cellulose is largely indigestible, because it requires a very great deal of activation energy to break it down.</p>
<p>Hair serves many, many purposes. Not all persons have thick beard hair, Mine is not, and is easily broken.  But the roots of beard hair are very much deeper than head hair. It's more strongly rooted than on top of our heads and elsewhere. But consider that we humans have chins, and most other animals do not. That's probably because of our very large, mobile and speech enabling tongues, which are rooted in the base of our &quot;chinny&quot; jaws.</p>
<p>Note also beard hair is much more densely concentrated around our chins and mustache, forming a sort of natural &quot;goatee&quot;. And also note in most men the beard extends much lower on the neck, and covers in most all cases, our Adam's apple, the external part of our male Larynges. Thus it's protective in the cold, as well. The chin down to the larynx is more heavily covered than the say, cheeks areas, on both sides. Freeze the chin, damages the tongue. Freeze the larynx and speech is damaged. Thus the heavier beard there.</p>
<p>That's largely what's going on, from a structural, protective as well as evolutionary basis. Note also hair is rather slick, too. So a hit to the face where the beard is will more likely slide off compared to if it hits bare skin. it deflects some or more of the damaging impact energy. Beard hair is greasy and slippery.</p>
<p>Won't go into its secondary sexual characteristics, denoting male gender, increases face appearance, threat size, etc.</p>
<p>Multiple functions, complex system characteristics of hair...... No wonder it's persisted so long, too. It's stable because it's least energy and very useful, doing lots with the little, simply repeated structures, the hair follicles. Our hair.....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
