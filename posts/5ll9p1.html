		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple views on the answer to this question.</p>
<p>First off, memory Is also consolidated while awake, but sleep does have a significant effect, especially on episodic and semantic memory.</p>
<p>As for your specific structure question, there is an ongoing debate between the sparseness hypothesis and the distributed hypothesis on how memories are stored. Put simply, the sparseness hypothesis states that certain cells, or groups of cells, fire in response to certain stimuli (2). The most extreme finding in this line of research is probably the ‘discovery’ of a “Halle Berry” neuron in a person, which fired only when the stimulus was a picture of Halle Berry. </p>
<p>However these findings seem to be exceptional, and most researchers tend to believe that memory is stored in distributed networks. This hypothesis states that the memory of a stimulus is stored in a pattern of firing over a group of neurons.  In this sense there is not much difference between ‘hard’ storage and electrochemical activity. There are factors that can moderate the firing rates of individual neurons, such as attention and Long Term Potentiation (1) (3).</p>
<p>Higher level theories try to explain the consequences of these theories. The most dominant position nowadays is that information on a stimulus/event is stored by taking into account it’s relation with other stimuli/events (network and association models). Here too, there is discussion about whether the basis of this categorisation is abstract/prototypical or on basis of concrete examples. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a phenomenon in the brain called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation" target="_blank">Long Term Potentiation</a> which essentially causes synapses in the brain to fire more easily when they are used frequently. There's some speculation that part of how memory works is from LTP. This is due to the fact that the hippocampus (a structure associated with memories) &quot;replays&quot; synaptic patterns that occurred during the day while you are sleeping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampal_replay" target="_blank">[source]</a>. Hippocampal replay and LTP are thought to contribute to the reinforcement of certain &quot;circuits&quot; of synapses used - causing patterns of electrochemical activity to be more likely to occur again if they frequently occur. <a href="http://smash.psych.nyu.edu/courses/spring16/learnmem/papers/Bliss1993.pdf" target="_blank">[link]</a>.</p>
<p>Your brain doesn't really undergo any major structural changes during learning or memory so science thinks currently that memory may come from changes to synaptic strengths through LTP. Though really much of science is uncertain to what extent it contributes.</p>
<p>Edit: Please someone correct me if I'm mistaken - its been over a year since taking neuroscience in University.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We really aren't very close to knowing how memories are formed or represented in the brain. We can't really observe the scale at which memories are formed, possibly in large part due to the gaps in resolution of the techniques we have for detecting brain activity. </p>
<p>We can measure activity of 10s or 100s of neurons (albeit probably not in a human) using probes, and we can measure activity (or something like activity) of millions of neurons using neuroimaging techniques like EEG and fMRI. It seems that memories are stored diffusely across the brain, and we really don't have a technique that can pick up activity at very fine spatial resolution across the entire brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long story short, the &quot;RAM&quot; patterns sit somewhere in an area of the brain organized generically (such as organization by space or object features like color), maintaining activation or looping around (either sustaining itself with feedback excitation, or continuing to be driven by input such as staring at the same stimulus for awhile), constantly providing information for long enough that synaptic weights can change to reflect the same information in a more stable format (e.g. number of protein receptors). This only takes many seconds to a minute or so. All you need for the transfer is some alignment of neural organization between the two systems. Such as a population of neurons in the &quot;RAM&quot; format organized by color hue, aligned with a potentiated network also organized by color hue, and connected to the first (for just this sort of purpose) and the pattern can directly translate over. &quot;Binding&quot; many features together for a whole object (for example) memory is more complicated but also very doable and there are very explicit models of this that predict well.</p>
<p>The thing you mention about sleep is that theoretically, while you sleep, you can take a weak, tenuous long term synaptic pattern (stored as per above briefly while the RAM info was available) and just reinforce it to be MORE stable by deepening that pattern. Sort of like developing a photo. You're not learning anything new, really, just cementing in a faint impression into something more substantial. And you likely do that while awake, too,  it's just going to be easier while asleep, because you don't have other distracting inputs at the same time.</p>
<p>Another possibility about sleep is that it could strengthen memories by forging more &quot;hooks&quot; into the same memory, binding together tidbits as if you had experienced the info in a more context rich environment originally and giving you more ways to remember it later. Which is a pretty different concept than the above.</p>
<p>Sorry I don't remember any citations off the top of the dome for either of those, it's only tangential to my area of expertise. The former is going to be significantly less controversial than the latter possibility, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
