		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscle density. I see a lot of comments about activity, but genetics is the main factor. If you bought a baby chimp and had him lay around the house for a few years eating chips and soda, he'd still rip your arms off if he felt like it. Zoo animals get less activity to some degree, but still rival their wild cousins because their bodies are genetically tuned to get X output from Y food. Whereas Humans get X-1 output from Y food. Mainly because our evolutionary path decided brains requiring high amounts of fat were more important than big fuck you muscles that are dense as hell and build off minimal nutritional needs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Specialist vs. Generalist.</p>
<p>Most primates are specialists. They have a specific ecological niche, and are very good in that niche, but aren't able to succeed in other niches. For example, gorillas are successful in tropical and sub-tropical rain forests; not savannas, not wetlands, not lowlands, but rain forests, and rain forests only.</p>
<p>This specialization means they don't have to adapt to other habitats. They get the optimal build for their niche, and that's it.</p>
<p>Humans are adaptable generalists, and so our physiology adapts to the current stresses. Do a lot of running? Your cardiovascular system gets stronger, and you legs get stronger, but your upper body atrophies. Do a lot of couch surfing? Your body adapts to the optimal couch-surfing fat/muscle ratio, as your skeletal muscles atrophy and your belly grows. Do a lot of weight lifting? Those muscles you are stressing will grow and get stronger.</p>
<p>This adaptable generalist physiology allows us to adapt to a large variety of biomes. You can find us in arctic snows, desert dunes, underwater, on mountaintops, and anywhere in-between. In fact, you can <em>move</em> one of us from one location to another, and we'll adapt and survive. </p>
<p>Gorillas are strong because they specialize in an ecological niche and biome where strength is necessary for every individual to survive and compete. Humans have variable strength because it's not needed in some places we live in, and our physiology adapts to the local stresses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Extra muscle is a liability for the early hominid - it doesn't help you <em>that</em> much for the tasks that matter for your survival (having gorilla-like arms won't allow you to gather more stuff, nor trap more prey, nor catch more prey, nor even to throw missiles further), they not only require extra calories to build but also more calories every day while you have them, and they make you worse at your main survival and hunting skill i.e. endurance running, which is the key advantage you have over other animals in your natural savannah habitat. With our hunter-gatherer lifestyle (which is quite different from gorillas), two smaller hominids consuming 1500 calories a day would be far more effective at gathering food than a single hulking muscleman who needs 3000 calories a day. </p>
<p>Our processes are appropriately tuned to facilitate a pysique like marathon runners have, not like bodybuilders, ensuring that we keep as little extra muscle as possible - i.e. grow muscle only when we can afford the luxury (getting extra food), grow muscle only where it's actually needed (exercised), and shed muscle quickly as soon as it's not needed or when the extra calories aren't needed. </p>
<p>The &quot;need to work out&quot; is not a universal physical or biological need; this is a factor for <em>us</em> because of how <em>our</em> bodies are built. There's no reason why an animal couldn't simply grow massive muscles without any workout whatsoever as long as enough resources are available, and gorillas do just that. Humans probably could too given a bunch of drugs &amp; hormonal supplements to re-tune our muscle growth, i.e. many of the performance enhancing drugs just mimic an effect that gorilla bodies have and our bodies <em>could</em> have &quot;naturally&quot; if our DNA was evolved to make that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
