		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently read an article in a French science magazine stating that the universe might be an hypertorus (Euclidian, finite and borderless). They represented it using a cube in which when you exit through one side you actually come back in from the opposite one.</p>
<p>I made a drawing to make my question clearer : <a href="http://imgur.com/a/C84eq" target="_blank">Drawing</a></p>
<p><em>The three panels on the left represent the universe in 2D and when you move through a side you come back through the opposite one. The star is any star and the black dot represents the Earth. The arrow is the light emited from the star.</em></p>
<p><em>The three right panels represent what we see from the surface of the Earth.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first 2 pictures are straight-forward the star lits us directly and we see it in the sky as it was at the moment the light was emited</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the second line of the &quot;comic&quot; you can see the light traveling through the right side and coming back out of the left one and then hitting us. What we then see in the sky is a second star that appears to be way further than the first one and way older, when it is in fact the same one !</p>
</li>
<li>On the third line I was imagining a scenario where the light goes through the loop several times. We would then see the star as it was a very long time ago, or even maybe witness it's birth ?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To recap</strong></p>
<p>It sounds crazy but would it be possible that we see the same star at different moments of it's life span ?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>Christ this blew up over the week-end while I was away, I will try to read everything as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Also thank you for the gilding ! Even if I have no clue what it does, I feel like someone now !</p></div></div>
