		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your debit card has Visa (or another credit card company) backing it.  Each transaction can be run as debit (processed by your bank directly, requires your PIN) or credit (processed through Visa, does not require your PIN).</p>
<p>Processing as credit through Visa is to your advantage as the consumer.  The consumer protections are much greater.  If there is fraud or a dispute, you have a lot more power to get it fixed quickly.</p>
<p>Vendors don't want you to choose this option, because when you do they have to pay Visa a transaction fee.  This is why some shady Point of Sale systems will force debit even if you try to pick credit.  You could complain to Visa about these places and they would probably be forced to fix it, but ain't nobody got time fo' dat.</p>
<p>When you use debit, the money is literally pulled out of your account immediately without that intermediate &quot;credit stage&quot;.  This is a big deal, for example if you use it to check in at a hotel then the full amount of the hotel's holding amount will immediately be pulled out of your checking account.  Versus the credit card approach where it is just a &quot;pre-authorization&quot; transaction that doesn't actually hit your account until they complete the posting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Source: almost 10 years of card-specific processing.</p>
<p>Your card issuer  (the bank) has a preference on how they verify their cardholder, whether it's via PIN, signature, or not at all. This is primarily what drives the PIN request, but certain transactions require it regardless, such as ATMs. That's the simple answer.</p>
<p>For more color: Prior to the advent of chip cards, transactions made with your PIN posted at the same time as they authorized due to the additional verification token, whereas transactions without it always had a lag between authorization and posting. However, chip cards muddy the waters. Sometimes, PIN transactions will travel along the signature networks, and vice versa; it depends a lot on issuer vs. Merchant network affiliation and a whole bunch of other industry nonsense.</p>
<p>I could go on and on, but the long and short of it is that the PIN request is driven by your financial institution's preferences. That's it!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
