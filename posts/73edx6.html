		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aluminum's always an option; plentiful, lightweight, excellent conductor, easily reused.  </p>
<p>That said, there are drawbacks.  Being softer than copper, handling aluminum wires means they're susceptible to breakage.  Aluminum also expands more when heated than copper does, and over time this can work wires out of connectors, causing arcs that can start fires.  Another issue is that while copper and aluminum both oxidize, copper oxide is conductive, whereas aluminum oxide isn't so much. This can change the properties of the transmission line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The majority of high-voltage transmission lines are already made from aluminium (with a steel core for strength). It does a pretty good job and is cheap.</p>
<p>In reality, we will never run out of copper for the applications where it's most valuable - the solution would just be to reuse old copper and/or use it more efficiently. The cost of the copper in something like a generator is a very small fraction of the cost of a power station or wind turbine. </p>
<p>Other uses like domestic plumbing and wiring might see alternatives used since the copper is less important - e.g. copper pipes could be replaced with HDPE. Aluminium would do a fine job in plenty of areas - there'd be a slight increase in labour and manufacturing costs along with the lower material price but it wouldn't be a huge problem.</p>
<p>Silver and superconductors are also viable replacements for copper in some niche applications.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aluminum has been used before . its more of a fire hazard for power lines than copper . silver is one of the best conductors of electricity would make more efficient conductor than aluminum or copper but its to expensive to be considered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any <em>signal</em> transmission lines (as opposed to power transmission lines) that used to be copper can be replaced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber" target="_blank">fiber</a>, which can be glass or plastic. This means cables that used to be copper don't have to be, and in fact that copper can be reclaimed (if it hasn't been already)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
