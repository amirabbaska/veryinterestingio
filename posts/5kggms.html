		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A large reduction in the cost came from the price of the active material used in the cells. The industry has traditionally been dominated by silicon panels and creating high quality crystalline silicon had been a pretty expensive process. What happened in recent years is summarized <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eHJPpcn.png" target="_blank">in this chart</a>. As the production volume spiked, the the price of panels based on c-Si eventually plummeted. This relationship is sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swanson's_law" target="_blank">Swanson's Law</a>. In fact, prices have dropped so much that now the silicon only accounts for less than half the price of typical modules. </p>
<p>As for what may reduce the price even further, that gets more speculative. A key short-term goal is to cut down on soft costs associated with installing and maintaining the cells. These costs are often lumped together as balance of system (BOS) costs. Here again, a key factor that can reduce these costs is the scale and maturity of the industry. For example, Germany which has been at this game longer already than the US has significantly lower BOS costs (e.g. see <a href="http://blog.rmi.org/blog_2013_12_05_can_usa_solar_cost_compete_with_germany" target="_blank">this article</a>). </p>
<p>edit: To move further out in the long term, things get even more speculative. It is possible that eventually that a new kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film_solar_cell" target="_blank">thin film PV technology</a> will complement or supplant silicon PV. The advantage of such cells is that they could be flexible and more lightweight than silicon panels. These benefits in turn could potentially cut down on material and installation costs yet further. For example, so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perovskite_solar_cell" target="_blank">perovskite PV cells</a> have shown promise in recent years in terms of efficiency, although stability remains a major concern. In addition to the active material itself, storage is still a huge stumbling block for solar energy to gain an increasingly larger share of the grid. Better and cheaper storage is key to deliver a steady supply to the grid in spite of daily and seasonal fluctuations in how much light we get from the Sun <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZLmlPZt.gif" target="_blank">e.g. shown here for Golden, Co.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Power electronic advances in the last 20 years have also contributed to this. Using transistors vs linear power conversion allows over 90% conversion efficiency. Solar panels need to convert DC-DC-AC and do so with expensive modules. In the last 20 years these modules have become cheaper and better. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>While conventional wisdom here is 'better batteries' another way of addressing this problem is a better power grid.  </p>
<p>Not so much smarter as simply one that allow for much longer distance power transfer/markets via more high voltage lines.  This allows you to build solar in places where it's very sunny but there are few people nearby which makes it cheaper.  Same with wind.  It allows stabilizes both power sources since as you increase the area of your sample, the average power from solar and wind together is much more stable.  This is because weather generally travels in bands and averages out over distance, and wind and solar are somewhat negatively-correlated (it's generally sunny when it's not windy, and the reverse).</p>
<p>(Example from Britain of anti-negatively: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277334313_The_climatological_relationships_between_wind_and_solar_energy_supply_in_Britain" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277334313_The_climatological_relationships_between_wind_and_solar_energy_supply_in_Britain</a>)</p>
<p>High voltage power lines are not a technology that needs to be invented and obstacles are mostly political.  Example: A state doesn't want to buy all their power from a windier state next door, they'd much rather buy wind from less-windy and efficient sites in their own state for the tax revenue and jobs.</p>
<p>Longer distance power markets benefits nuclear as well as it opens up more possible locations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that solar energy depends on solar technology -- and like all electronic-based technologies, it continues to become more efficient and less expensive. </p>
<p>Bloomberg just posted <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-06/wind-and-solar-are-crushing-fossil-fuels" target="_blank">a really informative article</a> on this topic.</p>
<p>A couple of money quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason solar-power generation will increasingly dominate: <strong>Itâ€™s a technology, not a fuel.</strong> As such, efficiency increases and prices fall as time goes on. What's more, the price of batteries to store solar power when the sun isn't shining is falling in a similarly stunning arc. </p>
<p>Just since 2000, the amount of global electricity produced by solar power has doubled seven times over. Even wind power, which was already established, doubled four times over the same period. For the first time, the two forms of renewable energy are beginning to compete head-to-head on price and annual investment.</p>
<p>... Government subsidies have helped wind and solar get a foothold in global power markets, but economies of scale are the true driver of falling prices: <strong>The cost of solar power has fallen to 1/150th of its level in the 1970s, while the total amount of installed solar has soared 115,000-fold.</strong>   [Emphasis added.]</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the biggest drops came from them (generally) not cutting the silicon anymore. They were cutting the panels from large thick blocks, and as thin as the sections are, the cutting blade was thinker than the slices, and waste was huge. They started growing the panels to the correct depth in 2015, which meant massive drops in waste. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
