		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an avid RC airplane/helicopter/&quot;drone&quot; hobbiest my opinion has two aspects:</p>
<p>1) FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt).   This is the biggest part of the equation.  People are overly fearful of various possible things that &quot;drones&quot; can do.  Mostly related to taking pictures of you.  Americans believe they  have a &quot;right to privacy&quot; no matter where they are and what they are doing.   This is simply NOT the case.  First of all, the right to privacy is only concerning the government snooping on you.  Private people can snoop on you all they want as long as they don't harass or trespass.   Americans seem to believe you even have the right to privacy (from everyone) when your in a public space (such as a beach or park).   So the american overly exaggerated sense of privacy is fanning a lot of hate-flames towards drones. </p>
<p>2) Idiots with money and a lower barrier of entry.   5 years ago the best to learn how to fly RC was to find an instructor and have them slowly and methodically teach you how to control the aircraft because they were relatively expensive and if you crashed you had weeks of work to re-build them.   With modern technologies it is now possible to build a flight brain that basically flys the aircraft/helicopter/drone for you.  So no instructor, no club, and readily available parts to fix or replace.<br />
What this has resulted in is the idiot wall being much much lower.   People who have zero training, zero knowledge of the laws regarding flying and zero respect for other people are buying ready-to-fly drones and causing all kinds of news because they are idiots.   Flying inside the airspace of an airport is already illegal and every RC flyer who follows the rules knows this,   Flying low over private property is already trespassing so it's already illegal.  Again those who follow the rules know this.   It's the idiots with no respect for others that are going to ruin the hobby for the vast majority. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lower barriers to entry (low price, ease of operation) = way more people flying them, and less education on proper use due to the lower barrier to entry. If you spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours learning, you're more likely to obey the rules. If you spend a couple hundred dollars, and you can fly your craft right out of the box without any need for research or practice, you are more likely to do something stupid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would say part of it would be the recording video aspect. Since you could theoretically fly a drone and peek into your neighbors house. South Park did an episode that is quite entertaining on the drone issues</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big issue in my opinion is that generally a &quot;drone&quot; implies autonomous operation. People associate &quot;drone&quot; with negativity due to the use of drones in military operations. </p>
<p>An RC quadcopter flown by a 13 year old is nothing to be worried about. </p>
<p>Follow the rules set for RC models by the FAA and AMA and everyone should be able to have fun. The emergence of literally thousands of different quads coming out on the market and being sold to people who do not know the rules is a big contributer to the freak out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
