		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First things first: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/biology/birds_are_dinosaurs" target="_blank">birds are dinosaurs</a>, and we know they make <em>all kinds</em> of sounds. With that said, birds and their relatives have some unique traits that I'll get into below. </p>
<p>We can make hypotheses about traits that wouldn't preserve in the fossil record using <a href="http://archosaurmusings.wordpress.com/2009/12/06/the-extant-phylogenetic-bracket/" target="_blank">phylogenetic bracketing</a>. Basically, we look at related animals on <a href="https://www.geol.umd.edu/~jmerck/bsci392/lecture18/epb.gif" target="_blank">either side of the tree</a> from the organism we're interested in, and if those animals possess a trait then it was probably present in the common ancestor of all those animals, so the organism we're interested in most likely does as well. This works pretty well for extinct dinosaurs, because birds are living theropod dinosaurs and crocs are <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/archosauria.html" target="_blank">archosaurs</a> that fall outside of Dinosauria. Traits that both crocs and birds possess are likely ancestral to all archosaurs and therefore would be present in dinosaurs unless they were secondarily lost.</p>
<p>Crocodylians are surprisingly <a href="http://crocodilian.com/cnhc/croccomm.html" target="_blank">vocal</a> - and social, in fact. Just like we've made assumptions about dinosaurs, we've made assumptions about crocs. They are more like birds than we give them credit for. But I digress! Crocs do roar and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s_jrCoWQp0" target="_blank">bellow</a> using their larynx. They also hiss, and their bellows actually have a subaudible component to them. The wavelength of these subaudible sounds corresponds to the distance between the keels on their scutes, creating the &quot;water dance&quot; they use in their mating ritual (and the dancing water is made up of <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/05/alligator-mating-physics/" target="_blank">Faraday waves</a>).</p>
<p>Most of birds' unique vocal abilities are due to a <a href="http://www.hearbirds.com/content/syrnx1.htm" target="_blank">syrinx</a>, which is an organ that sits at the base of the trachea. It's not the same thing as a larynx; it's a different organ. Birds do have a larynx, but the degree to which they can vocalize with it is limited (and poorly understood). Not all birds have a syrinx. No New World vultures (like turkey vultures) do, so they're limited to grunts and hisses. </p>
<p>The syrinx of songbirds is extremely complex, allowing for the wide variety of sounds. Birds make <a href="http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/birdcommunication.html" target="_blank">a ton of vocalizations</a>, from hisses to warbles to squawks. Some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTnVvAb3BRk" target="_blank">can haz cheeseburger</a>.</p>
<p>We know that not all dinosaurs had a syrinx; it evolved at some point in theropods. It's present in all bird groups, so it was likely present in their common ancestor. It seems to rely on the <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08912960903033327" target="_blank">presence of an airsac in the clavicle or collarbone</a> (sorry, paywall), which is part of a system of air sacs connected to the lungs of many reptiles. As far as we can tell that clavicular airsac first arises in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiornithine" target="_blank">enantiornithines</a>, which are dinosaurs that are so birdlike that they're generally just called birds.</p>
<p>Earlier non-avian dinosaurs probably vocalized more like crocs than birds, but of course their morphology was quite different. Some animals like <em>Parasaurolophus</em> had weird hollow chambers that might have <a href="http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/dinosaur/2011/02/how-parasaurolophus-set-the-mood/" target="_blank">been used for vocalizations</a>. </p>
<p>In short: given the amount of diversity we see in the sounds modern archosaurs can make, and the variation we have in extinct dinosaurs, there was probably a great variety in vocalizations. We have no way to test for that in most fossil species, but there are ways to look for some traits, like morphology related to the syrinx, or use models to test some of the structures we see like those in <em>Parasauralophos</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Due to how well developed the t-rex's inner ear is (a fairly recent discovery due to advances in scanning technology) some scientists are now starting to believe they communicated in deep, almost sub-sonic rumbles. A recent BBC doc had a go at recreating it:  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/12/09/sinister-sound-tyrannosaurus-rex-heard-first-time-66-million/" target="_blank">short clip </a>.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I seem to recall watching an educational show where they showed scientists use the fossils of some dinosaur that had a weird head protrusion that they had to male a calling noise to figure out and recreate the noise the creature made. Like, you know that air was blown into it and with just some scans of the fossil or modeling of what you know is it's shape (which you know from the fossil), you know  what noise it would make if you blew air into it.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure I am NOT confusing this with that scene from Jurassic Park 2 or 3</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I heard this a while ago and don't have a source, but I seem to remember reading that new evidence suggests that they made more of a grunting or honking sound like a goose. Not the sounds heard in such films as Jurassic Park which in actuality was the sound of tortoises mating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
