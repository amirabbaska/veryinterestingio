<p>Given that the atmosphere is 98.4% nitrogen, would it even be possible to do, even with the addition of a massive amount of oxygen?</p>
<p>What would the effects be, and what would be left afterward?</p>
<p>Silly question, but I'm curious.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From Wikipedia:
&quot;Because methane condenses out of Titan's atmosphere at high altitudes, its abundance increases as one descends below the tropopause at an altitude of 32 km, leveling off at a value of 4.9% between 8 km and the surface.&quot;</p>
<p>So if you're standing on the surface of Titan, you could probably use an oxygen tank as a blowtorch. Maybe you could do some welding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of my department's professors, Dr. Depcik, <a href="https://saemobilus.sae.org/content/01-11-01-0002/" target="_blank">wrote a short article on this topic</a> (SAE Mobilus, have to pay for article), specifically how to combust the atmosphere in an internal combustion engine. Oxygen would come from the elecrolysis of potential underground sources of water mixed with liquid ammonia. All the waste heat and work output would be used for terraforming and other human purposes. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earth's atmosphere is 21% oxygen and methane must be at least 5% concentration to burn here. So even if you took enough oxygen to Titan to make it 21% of the atmosphere, the methane would still be nowhere near flammable. </p>
<p>Besides, as you add oxygen you are lowering the concentration of methane. I doubt there is any amount of oxygen you could add to make Titan's atmosphere flammable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: I didn't bother doing math in the first place because the point of this answer is that math isn't even necessary. You'd need a few more Titans, but with oxygen, and you'd have to mash them into the original Titan, in order to set all of Titan on fire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's a good way to think of it: methane cannot burn without oxygen, and (essentially) vice versa, oxygen on itself will not burn without fuel.</p>
<p>So if Titan has an oxygen atmosphere—like earth—how much fuel (methane) would you need to get the entirety of it to burn?</p>
<p>In short, you'd need <del>about as much oxygen as there is methane</del> <em>apparently 4x the oxygen, thank you /u/PurpleIcy</em></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming Titan's atmosphere is 100% methane, you would need twice the amount of Oxygen and the end result would be a large fraction of the atmosphere being puffed out into space in the form of Carbon Dioxide and water vapor. Afterward the moon would settle down to being a significantly less interesting lifeless hunk of ice and residual hydrocarbons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
