		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electric eels have specialized muscle cells as noted below (~4/5 of their body length) optimized to generate much more electricity than normal muscle cells.  Essentially they are big biological batteries that can power up and discharge at will. </p>
<p>Ken Catalina at Vanderbilt University has done some remarkable research on these unique creatures. The eel's electrical output is used in at least 3 ways. 1. It uses low level pulses designed to force prey to &quot;twitch&quot; involuntarily revealing themselves to the eel.  2. Higher level &quot;disabling pulses&quot; that act directly on the prey's muscles &quot;locking up&quot; the prey's muscles (without contact with the prey, it's just through the water) preventing them from escaping (kinda like a Taser). And 3. massive discharges used to disable larger prey and protect against predators.  Sometimes during the larger discharges, the eel will leap up out of the water against the threat pressing their heads up high with their tails kept low in the water creating a longer and more effective and powerful electrical circuit through the threat.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Top answer is specific to eels but some people seem to still be curious how cells/life can produce electricity on a chemical level.</p>
<p>A cell is a self-contained membrane-bound environment, like a bubble. And what goes in and out of a cell is under strict control. So, a cell can have channels in its membrane that only allow positively charged sodium ions in. After a while, the cell will then have a higher concentration of positive ions relative to its surroundings and thus, it has achieved a positive voltage potential. The cell could then discharge this  potential (through a different kind of channel perhaps) and harness the stored energy it has developed in a number of different ways.</p>
<p>If youd like to see a really interesting example of using cellular electric potential to do physical work, look up &quot;atp-synthase&quot; on youtube. This is the protein that uses a built up electrical potential to turn a molecular motor which in turn synthesizes atp: an essential stored-energy chemical. Its really cool when you see a visualization of it. And those atp-synthase motors are in the mitochondria of most living creatures, including you! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly this is a conundrum because grade-school textbooks have such poor explanations of electricity, in particular batteries.  Once you know the real explanation of batteries, electric eels seem far less mysterious.</p>
<p>Improved battery explanation:   batteries <em>do not produce electricity.</em>   Instead, batteries are <em>electricity pumps,</em> charge-pumps, same as solar cells and dynamos.   The electricity was already inside the conductive parts.  We don't have to create electricity, we only have to pump it.  Batteries are pumps which create a flow of electricity, an electric current.  (And remember, heh, the electric companies take back every electron they gave us.  They're not selling any electricity  And with AC, the electricity goes back and forth without being consumed.)  Batteries: when water forces a metal to corrode, the dissolving atoms always leave some electrons behind in the metal surface.  The water becomes strongly positive, and the metal negative.   Water-corrosion produces an enormous charge-pump effect.</p>
<p>Besides dynamos and batteries, other electricity-pumps exist as well:  animal nervous systems.  In nerve cells there are microscopic electricity-pumps, called &quot;charge pumps&quot; or &quot;ion pumps.&quot; These molecule-sized pumps are forcing positively-charged atoms to pass through an insulating wall which surrounds each nerve cell.  Basically, a 'battery plate' is created by this thin wall, with its charge pumps.</p>
<p>Electric Eels produce voltage in the same way that your nervous system does:  they use living cells with microscopic insulating walls, and these walls are full of molecular charge-pumps.  Yet in your nerves, the tiny charge-pumps are still behaving like batteries: they can only create a few volts at most.   So, how do electric eels produce lethally dangerous 600-volt outputs?   They do it just like we can do with batteries:  they hook all their cells in series!  All the &quot;battery polarities&quot; must point in the same direction.  And, the electric-eel organ is based on proton pumps, &quot;positive electricity.&quot;</p>
<p>We normally connect bunches of 1.5V batteries in series to create a 6V or 9V battery, or 12v <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0QvbThCxm4" target="_blank">or anything.</a>   An electric eel connects its stacks of cell-membrane &quot;batteries&quot; in series.</p>
<p>PS</p>
<p>Metal-plate batteries have an insulating layer too.  It's called the &quot;Helmholtz Double Layer.&quot;  Today the double-layer is being used as the insulating dielectric when making Supercapacitors. (See, science hangs together, and has connections all over the place, but only after all the grade-school misconceptions are removed.)   In batteries, the metal-corrosion process is forcing all the dissolving metal atoms to move across that insulating Helmholtz layer.  Each corroding metal atom is positive-charged; a positive ion.  So by pumping positive ions along, a battery builds up a net-charge, and a voltage.   But unlike dynamo coils or PN junctions in solar cells, the batteries and the nerves aren't based on electron currents.  Instead they're based on proton-flow and proton-conduction in water solution.</p>
<p>Batteries and nerves and eel electrical organs: same basic idea, but living cells can do it all without needing any metal plates.   If they had to use electrons and wires, the &quot;electric-fish weapon&quot; probably would be impossible, and have never evolved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eels have three organs in its abdomen responsible for its electricity. </p>
<p>The electric eel generates large electric currents by way of a highly specialized nervous system that has the capacity to synchronize the activity of disc-shaped, electricity-producing cells packed into a specialized electric organ. The nervous system does this through a command nucleus that decides when the electric organ will fire. When the command is given, a complex array of nerves makes sure that the thousands of cells activate at once, no matter how far they are from the command nucleus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
