<p>The space environment is pretty nasty. Atomic Oxygen, UV Radiation, Meteoroids/Orbital Debris all cause pretty severe surface degradation.</p>

<p>Edit: and here's a good picture of the Russian Service Module on the ISS, that has been exposed to space for a long time. Look closely and you can see how dirty the once white surfaces are now. <a href="http://iss.jaxa.jp/spacerad/images/img_dos01_e.jpg" target="_blank">http://iss.jaxa.jp/spacerad/images/img_dos01_e.jpg</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is.... sort of. However dust in space tends to be traveling freakishly fast, such that it turns into a plasma on impact. This creates microscopic pits in the outside of the craft. This is like an extreme form of sandblasting. Fortunately space is pretty empty and this damage occurs slowly. This fact makes the design of things like solar panels challenging, for example.  It will also create a hazard to sensitive optics like mirrors or lenses. Optics need to be protected, as much as reasonably possible.</p>
<p>The James Webb Space Telescope is a notable exception to this. The reason for the lack of shielding around it's primary mirror is due to it's sheer size and the need to fold and unfold it to fit inside the aerodynamic shroud of the launch vehicle. Shielding materials were considered too much of a weight penalty and could potentially cause mechanical jams during the unfolding process. </p>
<p>Instead, digital image processing will be used to remove the effects of damage to the mirror, which can be tracked and accounted for. </p>
<p>A second hazard, at least in low earth orbit, is that most of the ambient gas is reactive atomic oxygen. This can slowly degrade and erode carbon-based materials like plastics or paint over time.</p>
<p>This is less of a problem in higher orbits.</p>
<p>The third problem is high energy charged particles both from the sun and from deep space.  Events like solar flares can bombard spacecraft with a storm of energized electrons. This could potentially cause a complete failure of electronic circuits, at least temporarily. Devices used in space need to be designed to be &quot;hardened&quot; against radiation. </p>
<p>The most troublesome form of radiation is high energy Cosmic Rays. These consist of atomic nuclei with extreme kinetic energy and thus high penetrating power. Generally cosmic rays are bare protons or helium nuclei, however larger nuclei are also encountered. These are like atomic bullets and cause permanent microscopic damage to the structure of anything they pass through.  Integrated circuits are most vulnerable to this radiation which is difficult to shield. Over time this can degrade IC chips to the point where they lose function. There is no simple solution to this problem. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is definitely a non-zero amount of accumulation that affects the lifespan of spacecraft. The three main factors are orbital altitude, orientation (attitude), and proximity to other spacecraft. </p>
<p>Altitude is simple enough, the closer you are to earth, the more particles there are in your orbit. This can slowly accumulate on the spacecraft and also plays a role in slowing it down, which is why the ISS needs to re-boost and helps naturally reduce the clutter of old satellites by de-orbiting them back into the Earth. </p>
<p>The attitude is important because most of the contamination will be on the ram surface, which is the one facing into the velocity vector. For something like Hubble or other optical satellites, this means that you might see a reduced lifespan on the instrument's clarity over time if it faces ramwards due to buildup. </p>
<p>Lastly and maybe most important is the proximity to other spacecraft, especially vehicles with thrusters. This is usually a temporary time frame where some particles from the ascent vehicle can contaminate the satellite, but any time spent next to another body (even without thrusters active) can expose it to off-gassed particles that are liberated due to being in an extreme temperature/pressure environment as well as atomic oxygen stripping atoms away. Off-gassing still occurs even if a thermal/vacuum bake-out occurs on the ground, but it can be heavily reduced that way. For any spacecraft mounted on the ISS, this type of contamination is actually a huge concern, since new vehicles visit frequently and there are projects from many sources grouped together that may be off-gassing onto each other. </p>
<p>Lastly, there is also micro-meteorite object debris, but there's no way to predict or avoid that besides minimizing the size of your spacecraft. I have seen pictures of a satellite with a white surface that had some black spots on it from MMOD. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Possibly, I think they are more concerned with micrometeoroid and orbital debris. Even paint chips that shook off a satellite during launch if they are in a different orbit can hit at relative velocities of kilometers per second. Of course they track thousands of large pieces of debris but they cant keep track of small fragments. Lots of satellites are released from their hold downs under the nose cone using things like explosive bolts. They try to contain the debris from that but...</p>
<p>There was a satellite called LDEF ,long duration exposure facility, that aimed to measure and quantify these effects. And there are people whose job it is it measure the statistical probability that debris will cause a catastrophic failure.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Dust may be an issue but an orbiting screwdriver is probably a bigger worry.  </p>
<p>Its kind of like that garbage pathc in the pacific, it's a problem but no one knows really how to clean it up. Most orbital debris is stainless, aluminum, or carbon fiber none of which are magnetic. A vacuuum cleaner doesn't really work in a vacuum. Solve that problem and NASA will bow  down to you and call you Musky.</p>
