Habitable zones are determined based on the temperature of the star and the planet's distance from the star.  Higher temperature just means that the habitable zone is further away from the sun. If our sun were blue and much hotter than it is, we wouldn't be in the habitable zone and would likely look a lot like Mars or Venus. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, yes. But the habitable zone probably won't be very habitable.</p>
<p>By blue star, I assume you mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-type_main-sequence_star" target="_blank">O</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-type_main-sequence_star" target="_blank">B</a>-type main-sequence stars, which are basically heavier versions of our Sun that are hot enough to shine blue. The habitable zone is simply the range of distances from the star where the light is just intense enough to keep water liquid on the surface of a planet, and for a brighter star, the zone will just be wider and further away. However, there are issues with such heavy stars: firstly, as /u/FatLenny- noted, they don't live very long, so life only has a few million years to develop before the star swells to a super/hypergiant and then goes supernova; and secondly, blue stars emit a <em>lot</em> of ultraviolet light, which isn't exactly healthy for organic compounds. There may also be issues with planet formation, but that is beyond my knowledge.</p>
<p>But you asked about other things as well, so let's estimate some numbers!  Let's say we live on a planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a blue star of mass <em>M</em>, and let's say <em>M</em>=16 solar masses, giving us a really massive and solidly blue star. Assuming the planet can support an atmosphere, the sky will be blue for the same reasons as on Earth, but will have a deeper, more violet tone as the starlight contains more of those wavelengths.</p>
<p>How long can you stay? In the main sequence, the luminosity <em>L</em> goes approximately as <em>M</em>^4 , so the star is about 66000 times brighter as the sun. Its lifetime is very roughly proportional to the amount of fuel it has (i.e. <em>M</em>) divided by how quickly it converts it to light (i.e. <em>L</em>), so the lifetime goes as <em>M</em>/<em>L</em> ~ <em>M</em>/<em>M</em>^4 ~ 1/<em>M</em>^3 , 1/4000 of the Sun's. You have to get off the planet in a few million years, or things will get bad.</p>
<p>How far away are you? Well, the habitable zone exists around a fixed light intensity, which goes as <em>L</em>/<em>R</em>^2 , where <em>R</em> is the distance to the star. Therefore, the habitable-zone distance goes as <em>L</em>^1/2 ~ <em>M</em>^2, so you are about 250 times further from the star than Earth is from the Sun. That's far beyond the orbital radius of Pluto. </p>
<p>How long is your year? From Kepler's laws, we know that the orbital period of a planet goes like (<em>R</em>^3 /<em>M</em>)^1/2 , which for the habitable zone reduces to <em>M</em>^5/2 , or about 1000 times an Earth year. Your planet will only survive a few thousand turns before it is blasted out of the sky by the supernova! (It won't be engulfed by the star in the giant stage, since it is so far away.)</p>
<p>What about day and night? How fast the planet spins is less related to the size of the star, so the length of a day I can't give you. Since you are so far away, the star looks about as bright as the Sun to you, which is really a requirement for the habitable zone, so you'll probably have a pretty normal day-night cycle. (Or maybe the star actually looks dimmer -- a lot of the light is UV, which you can't see!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
