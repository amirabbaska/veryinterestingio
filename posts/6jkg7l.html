		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting question, and it seems that no one has actually answered it as intended--what happens when you cool water in a container that allows no expansion?</p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg" target="_blank">phase diagram of water</a>, my best guess is that ice VI would form.  However, <a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/ice_vi.html" target="_blank">ice VI has a higher density than water</a> at the pressure at which it forms, so it would not actually generate any pressure by forming in the first place.</p>
<p>Perhaps what would actually happen in this thought experiment is that some amount of &quot;normal&quot; ice Ih would form, generating pressure in doing so, until the pressure generated was high enough that ice VI would form, which has the effect of relieving some of the pressure.  In the end a mixture of ice Ih and ice VI is formed with the same density as water at that temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Freezing and melting are both very dependent on temperature and pressure. Water can configure itself into around 17 different ways.* The ice we see is Ice I, and there's 2 forms of it. The type of ice will change with changes in pressure. So if you increase the pressure, you might get Ice II. The way we classify ice is in the order that we discovered it. Ice I was the first type we discovered, Ice II is the second and so on. </p>
<p>*I say around 17 because there are some forms of ice that aren't considered &quot;real&quot; Ice, like amorphous ice, which is the most plentiful kind of ice(in the universe). This is because it doesn't have an orderly crystalline structure like the types of ice using the Roman numerals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water has a number of solid phases. The phase that we're used to is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Ih" target="_blank">Ice Ih</a> (pronounced &quot;ice one h&quot;). It has a lower density than liquid water - it must expand to freeze. However, at different temperatures and pressures there are different phases of ice. At higher pressures, the water can freeze into a different arrangement that does not need expansion.</p>
<p>You can check out water's full phase diagram here - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(data_page)#Phase_diagram" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(data_page)#Phase_diagram</a> </p>
<p><em>Assuming you put water into a steel cube that could not expand when the water freezes, what would happen?</em></p>
<p>It should also be noted that if the pressure gets high enough, your assumption of &quot;a steel cube that could not expand&quot; falls apart. Steel is deformable. With a high enough internal pressure, a hollow cube of steel will expand or rupture, allowing the water inside to expand into Ice Ih.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surprisingly like he said there's a lot of types of ice. The res even a planet we found recently that has this hot ice on it which doesn't melt until 278 Fahrenheit, aka much much hotter than normal, due to pressure. We don't know how it got there, but it's mostly amorphous. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
