<p>Google isn't helping me much here, mainly talking about Esperanto and potential future universal languages.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no clear answer here: it's possible that language arose once, in a single population of humans, and their descendants either took over the world or spread their language to other humans. It's also possible that language arose multiple times in different places.</p>
<p>However, linguists generally agree that if there was a single language in the past, we've been unable to deduce anything about it from comparing modern languages. </p>
<p>There's a good discussion here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Human_language" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Human_language</a>. I appreciate this example of the difficulties involved:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the criteria that Bengtson and Ruhlen employ to find cognates to their proposed roots, Lyle Campbell finds seven possible matches to their root for woman <em>kuna in Spanish, including cónyuge 'wife, spouse', chica 'girl', and cana 'old woman (adjective)'. He then goes on to show how what Bengtson and Ruhlen would identify as reflexes of </em>kuna cannot possibly be related to a proto-World word for woman. Cónyuge, for example, comes from the Latin root for meaning 'to join', so its origin had nothing to do with the word 'woman'; chica is a feminine adjective coming from a Latin noun meaning 'worthless object'; cana comes from the Latin word for 'white', and again shows a history unrelated to the word 'woman' (Campbell and Poser 2008:370–372). Campbell's assertion is that these types of problems are endemic to the methods used by Ruhlen and others.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As for your comment about the “ma” sound, I’ve heard that it plays into the development of the infant’s ability to speak, where the “ma” and “da” sounds have some sort of benefit that makes them more ideal for use as a name for parents. Hence why so many languages have similar sounding words for “mom” and “dad.” </p>
<p>I really can’t remember exactly what I heard on the subject since it was so long ago, but there is an explanation for that similarity that doesn’t play into the idea of an ancient universal proto-language or whatever. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
