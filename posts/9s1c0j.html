		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a very good book on this called: “Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human” by Richard Wrangham. It’s essentially about how humans evolved alongside their discovery of fire. Cooking over a fire allowed food to be broken down before eating it, and created more energy dense food sources. Because of this humans have much shorter gastrointestinal tracts than other animals. We also spend much less time eating per day. Cows and other ruminating animals spend almost the entire day actually “eating” or “chewing”. They also have four stomachs and continuously regurgitate the food to rechew it. Humans who eat a purely raw food diet have many health problems because they’re not able to get the same nutrients as they would from cooked food.</p>
<p>Essentially humans evolved with fire, and the ability to cook. Our gastrointestinal system evolved with us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wild animals do get sick, that's one of the reasons domesticated animals live longer than wild ones, which are ridden with parasites.</p>
<p>Diseases also evolve along with the animals and become less dangerous, as it is actually helpful for them if they don't harm the host. For example salmonella lives in chicken guts and doesn't get them sick, but it does get us sick. If a species ate raw chicken for enough time (long, evolution relevant spans of time), they could eventually become immune.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is the simple fact of getting used to a certain bacterial charge. If a western drinks water from many zones of Sud-eastern Asia or Africa they will get diarrhea for sure, but the locals gut flora is used to that amount of bacteria. The same goes for animals, eventually their guts reach an equilibrium where certain not harmful bacteria thrives and competes with the harmful ones, neutralizing them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Breaking down complex molecules like proteins or fats is a difficult and fairly inefficient process, because it takes so much energy to do so. To help us get the most energy out of food, and put the least energy into digestion, we break down many of those molecules with heat. By effectively jump-starting the digestion process before taking the first bite, we can get more energy out of the same amount of food, because it is easier to digest.</p>
<p>A few million years ago, this was useful, but after so long eating cooked food it has become necessary. We have evolved away the defenses against uncooked meat and the bacteria in it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
