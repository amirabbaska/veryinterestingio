		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has two pressures which make you tired: Circadian and homeostatic.</p>
<p>Circadian rhythms are based on the sun and generally adhere to a 24 hour cycle. These rhythms are not perfect and are resynced each day in response to sunlight.</p>
<p>Homeostatic pressure is more straightforward - it increases as you stay up longer.</p>
<p>The second wind you're feeling is your circadian rhythm giving you a boost because you're supposed to be awake. Eventually homeostatic pressure will become the overwhelming force and make you sleep regardless of where you are in your circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>On a side, practical note: Melatonin is the primary actor in syncing circadian rhythms - this means that the OTC melatonin you buy is gently pushing you to sleep via the circadian system.</p>
<p>Antihistamines (Benadryl, ZzzQuil, Unisom) act on the homeostatic system, providing direct sleep pressure.</p>
<p>When you absolutely need to hit the sack right now, taking Benadryl + Melatonin has the highest chance of knocking you out by acting on both pathways.</p>
<p>Source: Science of sleep course I took back when I was in college</p>
<p>Edit: Whoops, I didn't notice what sub I was posting in - this is definitely not ELI5 material. Let me try again.</p>
<p>A lot of things in your body work best at certain times of day. This makes sense because humans usually need to be doing things when the sun is out (moving around, hunting, etc.) and other things at night (sleeping). It's actually really cool - your individual cells make more or less of certain chemicals throughout the day, and if you put the levels on a graph you can see clear 24 hour cycles. One part of these cycles is that your body will make you feel more awake during the day, and more sleepy at night. [Circadian rhythm]</p>
<p>That said, sleep is one of the most important things for us - our body does a ton of things while we sleep which aren't done while we're awake. So our body has a master override switch. The longer you stay up, the more tired you'll feel no matter where you are in your daily rhythm. [Homeostatic pressure]</p>
<p>When you're up for too long, you'll feel sleepy around the normal time because it's night time and your body's normal rhythm says you should be sleeping. [Pressure from both homeostatic + circadian] When the sun comes back out, your body thinks you should be awake, [Pressure from only homeostatic] and that gives you a temporary boost until the override comes back and says that you should sleep even though the sun is out. [Homeostatic pressure overwhelms circadian]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a survival mechanism.</p>
<p>Your body signals that you're tired by releasing certain chemicals in your brain. Those chemicals only last for so long before they dissipate, and it takes time for your body to produce more.</p>
<p>If you're forcing yourself to stay away, the survival &quot;assumption&quot; is that you're doing something important to your survival.</p>
<p>It's also the reason you get sleepy if you're bored. Your body detects that you're in a period of &quot;down time&quot; where nothing important is being done, so it signals the urge to sleep so you conserve energy.</p>
<p>Edit: To the people saying &quot;derp, you're wrong because...&quot; I was oversimplifying the response because this is ELI5. Yes, I'm aware that production of said neurotransmitters is controlled by other more complex systems such as the circadian rhythm and homeostatic balance, but I didn't go into that because this is ELI5, not AskScience.</p>
<p>Also, the circadian rhythm is a general model, but like many aspects of sleep, is still somewhat poorly understood, and doesn't account for people that routinely get sufficient sleep and <em>still</em> become sleepy during the day if they're bored.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>your body will release chemicals to aid you in what you should be doing.</p>
<p>Late at night, your body is trying to get you to sleep.</p>
<p>If you stay up, you essentially override that urge, and your body realises that you don't want to sleep, and then cooperates by releasing chemicals to keep you awake.</p>
<p>Same reason that you get sleepy from sitting around all day compared to being active.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>Your body has an internal clock.</p>
<p>During the daytime(for most people) your clock tells your brain it should be alert.</p>
<p>During the nighttime(for most people) your clock tells your brain to get some rest.</p>
<p>When you stay up late, your clock keeps telling the brain that you are tired and should sleep.</p>
<p>If you stay up until morning, your clock starts telling your body to be alert again.</p>
<p>This sensation may make you feel less tired, or at least more active, like a second wind.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it's the next morning that you're feeling the second wind, then it's cortisol which is released based on the time of day (morning) because it helps wake you up and get going, although that can be shifted if you keep an odd schedule for long enough.</p>
<p>If the rush is in the middle of the night, it's probably a mix of adrenaline and cortisol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
