		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is a link to the bill itself so you can read it for yourself: <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754/text" target="_blank">https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754/text</a></p>
<p>EDIT: To be clear, as others have pointed out in the thread, the bill is not yet law. The house and senate versions have to be reconciled first, and the president has to sign it.  </p>
<p>First, let me reserve the right to be incorrect, and I'm sure others can clarify or elaborate. But from what I've read (and I did read the bill, though IANAL and I'm not sure I fully understood it), the bill does two main things: </p>
<ul>
<li>It requires that companies provide anonymized data on their systems, users, infrastructure, etc to the federal government for the purposes of detecting and eliminating threats to the private and public 'cyber security'. So, to imagine one quick example, google might be asked to provide the government all searches containing terms run on their site that match some filter (bomb, ISIS, Islam, Unabomber) along with the IP address of the client running the search. Technically, and using the quite broad language of the bill, that's anonymous data. </li>
<li>It provides companies that comply with the law with a legal umbrella limiting their liability. So if your ISP turns over your data when requested, that ISP gets certain legal protections for being sued, misusing/misappropriating consumer data, etc. So if you get put on the no fly list b/c you ran a search including terms on the filter and your ISP/google/whatever provided that info to the government, you can't sue that company for the damages you've incurred. </li>
</ul>
<p>(there's also stuff in there about better sharing of data among government agencies, etc, but those are the two big points as I understand them) </p>
<p>The reason folks are freaking out is that the way the law is written is very broad, and it includes specific provisions allowing the government to override the anonymity of the data without a FISA court hearing or warrant. If passed in its current Senate form, it essentially means that the government will have much greater access to your personal data on commercial platforms than ever before. This is not supposed to be the intent of the bill, but the way it is written that will be the effect. </p>
<p>Frankly,  the doomsayers and alarmists aren't really overselling the potential impact of the bill. It's a really broad and sweeping change to the legal framework under which corporations manage 'your' data that they have in their possession. </p>
<p>At a minimum, we're looking at years of court cases to more clearly establish where the powers granted by this bill run up against our constitutional rights. At worst, this makes everything the NSA has already been doing look like child's play, as now they (and the FBI, and DHS, and the IRS, etc) could instantly gain access to most of the things you do online. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, it passed the senate. It has not been passed into law yet. It won't be affecting you (yet). The House of Representatives and the president still has to pass/sign it.</p>
<p>The CISA bill basically tells cyber companies to &quot;anonymously&quot; share its data with the government for the sake of cybersecurity. In other words, your name (or whoever is paying for your internet's name) won't be connected to the data that cyber companies are <del>forced</del> &quot;asked&quot; to share with the government. However, given the wording of the bill, this anonymity isn't guaranteed, and there's a loophole where your name still could be attached to your data as it is passed to the government. Further, the NSA and FBI will still be able to over-rule the part of the bill that grants anonymity, so they will know who certain data is coming from.</p>
<p>Taken from a recent news article, a former government security officer said that this bill basically increases the NSA's spying abilities, and that is supposedly the real point of the bill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>CISA is a bill that in theory sounds like an okay idea. More secure Internet = Less security being breached. In reality the bill is left vaguely worded on purpose so there is room to take advantage of private information to get into the hands of the FBI, NSA, or the like. When companies share your info, private things are supposed to be taken out, but the way the bill is written no one gets in trouble if that information were to &quot;accidentally&quot; be shared.</p>
<p>These types of bills have been tried before, remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_SOPA_and_PIPA" target="_blank">Internet blackout day?</a> CISA isn't exactly about Internet censorship disguised as a bill but it's in similar interest of giving power to organizations that we don't want to give more power to. CISA is more than likely going to be abused from day 1 if it gets passed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Private companies that keep a bunch of data and shit about you (much of which is required by the services you sign up for) can now give this data to the government agencies, without your permission, and receive immunity from prosecution. Meaning you can't go to court to sue them or prevent them from doing it. This is VOLUNTARY, meaning the Government doesn't have to get a warrant (have a Judge sign off on the legalities and practicalities of this dependent on you breaking laws). If the Private Company wants to just give the Govt man this info, they can. You don't have to be accused or suspected of a crime, there is absolutely no judicial oversight of the program, there's a stupid amount of people and big companies totally against this law, and it's a great demonstration about how many members of Congress, who are supposed to be representatives of the People, really don't give any shit what the People think and will vote as they like/are paid off to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
