		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both correct answers are here already but neither in the same post with one another.  First, water has high heat capacity.  That means that even a small change in temperature for water = a ton of energy.  So 200 degree water has thousands of times more heat than air for every degree of temperature change, and that's based on MASS.  The density of water is much higher than that of air so there's a lot more of it close to you when you're exposed to it.  Finally, because of the density, it transfers energy much much faster.  Heat is transferred when molecules hit one another - more density means more molecules close together, which means more collisions = faster energy transfer.</p>
<p>For an example of this at work try to bake a potato in a 450 deg F oven while boiling one in 212 deg F (boiling) water.  Should go alot faster in the water.</p>
<p>tl;dr - Water has more energy in a smaller space and transfers that energy much faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference is how air and water TRANSFER heat. Air is a fairly poor at transmitting heat. It is at a very high temperature but it does not transfer that temperature to your skin. Water is about 30 times better at transferring heat. The high temperature goes right into your skin and burns.</p>
<p>It's the reverse of why standing naked in 50 degree air will be cold but bearable for maybe half an hour, but jump into 50 degree water and you'll be unconscious from cold in a few minutes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water is a very good conductor of heat, while air is not. Humid air, like is in a sauna, is a better conductor, but still not close to water. It works the opposite way too. If you put your hand in a freezer, or somewhere it's very cold, it doesn't make your hand very cold quickly, but if you touch a better conductor of heat such as ice or metal, it will feel much colder than the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Burns are caused by a rapid exchange of energy. The sauna will not provide this rapid exchange for many reasons already posted here.  The direct contact with water will exchange energy with your skin at a very rapid pace, causing severe burns.  Similarly this is why dry ice will cause burns if held by your naked hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
