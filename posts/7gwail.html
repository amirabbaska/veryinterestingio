		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Children phyioslogy is hugely different from adults. </p>
<p>Children skin cells are plentiful, regenerate rapidly, and have no accumulated mutations. These traits fade with age at different rates for different people.</p>
<p>Essentially the traits you find attractive are side effects of a human rapidly growing. When the growth slows down so do these 'perks'.</p>
<p>The attractiveness likely evolved as a behavorial trait to help choose a fit mate. </p>
<p>Edit: in regards to oiliness/greasiness, sebaceous and suderiferus (oil and sweat) glands are less active until the kid hits puberty, when they crank into overdrive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Always think of these types of things in terms of primitive man (who we’ll call “Todd”)as a way to get yourself thinking about why over thousands of years our bodies have evolved to what they are. </p>
<p>It was more important for bear skin wearing Todd to hit puberty and be strong to hunt and gather and be horny AF to spread his genes and create a retirement plan. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the same hormones that increase during puberty to allow for these valuable traits also increase glandular production (ie, pimple time). But Todd didn’t have instagram or other societal ideals so his pimples weren’t holding him back as a mate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hormones. Adults have 'em, kids not so much. Teens have MORE, which explains some of the issues they have that other people don't.</p>
<p>Actually, babies also tend to have little hormone spurts as their systems come online, so it's not unusual to see some baby acne or whatever, though it tends to be short lived.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Note: for the exposed skin (face, hands and feet) keep moisture levels up, as these areas dry out and crack, peel, shed more than others. </p>
<p>If your face out, gets wind/sun burned you are going to prematurely age... if you like the old weathered cowboy look, do nothing. If not, you need to moisturize daily. Children’s skin has a high water content - adults tend to lose this as they age. But some seem to stay young looking (ever heard about some people whose face’ don’t crack’ - that’s likely Shea Butter at work) </p>
<p>Shea butter (pure) is excellent for daily use - Vaseline and Aquaphor can be helpful for dry-chafed skin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert, but I would think it has to do with a combination of puberty and maintenance (or lack thereof), I don't know anyone who has flawless skin that doesn't invest some time in maintaining it through a process. My sister has a car newer (02') than my dad (00') but because she never changes her oil or wash and condition the leather, it looks much older than my dad's. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
