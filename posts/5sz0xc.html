<p>The difference between European freedom of speech and American freedom of speech. American freedom of speech is there to protect the person who is saying things others may be offended or disgusted by. You are allowed to have and express any opinion so long as it does not place people in immediate danger. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its more of an ideal than how it is in practice. The idea is that Americans have the most freedom. Freedom is scary to a lot of people because it means you are responsible for your own errors and decisions in life. Thats why its land of the free and the brave. Because freedom requires bravery, bravery to deal with your own problems and whatever life throws at you. To be the hero in your own story instead of the guy who asks the government to fix all your problems at the detriment of all around you. Given that the government is an institution of non-voluntary action.</p>
<p>But in practice the USA has for the most part forgone that ideal and it just like all the other western countries but instead sniffs its own farts with rhetoric it has abandoned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fundamental difference between American and European Freedom^^TM is the concept of negative vs. positive freedom and where we get our rights from. </p>
<p>Negative freedom is the freedom FROM government action. It's a restriction on what the government can to do you. In the American concept you have the freedom of speech, to own a gun, to privacy, of religion, of the press, etc. The government doesn't say, you can't say that, you can't own that, you can't hide that, you can't worship that, you can't print that. The government is prohibited from action. </p>
<p>Positive freedom is the freedom TO government action. Look at European governments on what the government must do for you. You are free to not be offended, not be unsafe, not be bothered, not be sick, etc. You have a freedom TO be something, but it is a compulsion of the government to provide it. In Germany the government is tasked with protecting the equal dignity of all. So that means the government can impose upon others to ensure your  (positive) freedom.</p>
<p>America is unique as it is the only country which takes negative freedom to such an extreme. America says &quot;yes, literal not even the neo- version, NAZIs have a right to march through Jewish neighborhoods to celebrate the holocaust.&quot; There's not this government having the ability to compel some social norm or protection. There's this government having the mandate not to restrict someone else's rights. </p>
<p>Second, America has a vastly different idea of where rights come from. Rights, especially in Europe are seen as derived from some agreement or some historical moment or something along those lines. Rights, thus, can be created, amended, or done away with when times change. In America, rights are inherent in your being. You don't have the right to say whats on your mind free from government interference because it was a good idea in the 1780s-1790s, you have that right because it is God-given.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; <strong>that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights;</strong> that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not government, its a state of natural existence, that people have rights. These &quot;unalienable&quot; (because what government is equal to divine providence?) rights are part of you and the government either recognizes and protects these rights, infringes on the rights, or its not a right. </p>
<p>And because these rights are granted by the creator, divine providence, the supreme being, or God... they are contained within His creation and not within government (creation of man) or the behavior of others so it's a rejection of positive freedom. Because freedom, in the American sense, is self-contained (you can act as YOU wish because YOU have free will) and government is not the final power or arbiter on what are rights government can not impinge on your self-contained free-will (so be an asshole, no freedom not to be offended).</p>
<p>So that's the two ways it mainly differs from other countries. </p>
<p>Edit: Sorry, I know I'm late to the party but the foremost explanation of what I'm trying to say comes from the Virginia Declaration of Rights, mainly the first clause:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 1. That all men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.</p>
