		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're the driver you're in direct control of the sensations you're experiencing. Its your input on the steering wheel or throttle pedal or whatever that's causing the things you're feeling now; being pulled to one side, or being pushed back in the seat, or being shifted forward into the seatbelt, whatever.</p>
<p>If you're a passenger, this stuff just happens to you, and some people can deal with that better than others. </p>
<p>Motion sickness is theorised to be caused by a disconnect between what you're feeling and what your eyes are seeing; your brain thinks there's something wrong, so makes you throw up to at least limit the possibility of poisoning. </p>
<p>Some are more sensitive to that disconnect than others and it can work in both ways. I know people who can quite happily sit in the back of a car and read a book and I also used to know someone who played the original GTA, (yes <a href="https://www.myabandonware.com/media/screenshots/g/grand-theft-auto-44n/grand-theft-auto_6.png" target="_blank">this one</a>), and got motion sickness from that. Of course in that case he was still and what he was seeing wasn't. As I say how sensitive an individual is to it will vary. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you read a book in the car your visual system is looking at something that isn't moving but your balance system is reporting that you are moving.</p>
<p>The body assumes that if two senses give conflicting information, something's malfunctioning, and the most likely reason is poisoning. So the brains trying to make you sick to get rid of any more &quot;poison&quot; that you've eaten.</p>
<p>Being a passenger is a car isn't something evolution ever dealt with.</p>
<p>In the drivers case, they're (hopefully) watching the road. So the visual and balance systems matchup.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my own experience as a person who gets <em>very</em> motion sick if I try to read, etc. as a passenger: </p>
<p>My motion sickness is triggered by trying to focus on something that's stationary inside the car, while things are zooming past me outside in my periphery. When I'm driving, my visual focus is almost 100% on what's outside (aside from the meters in front of me), so my brain isn't struggling so hard to process both the stillness and the movement at the same time.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if that makes sense, it's kind of hard to explain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Motion sickness is a discussion between your eyes and body. So your body feels like it's moving while you look around and things are still or vise versa (that's why VR has motion sickness) so when you lessen that disconnect (like looking at the moving road or having a wider range of view of moving things) it lessens the motion sickness effect</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
