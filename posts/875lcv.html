		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few ways to go about this.
Firstly, if there are any modern relatives still alive, scientists can recognize that there is a relation between the species based on fossils and figure out that the extinct species had a trunk (assuming the modern relative still has one). </p>
<p>If no modern relatives are present, which I assume is the case here, scientists can look at muscle attachment points on the extinct elephants' fossilized skulls and potentially be able to theorise that the animals had a trunk, though with such a large and strange organ the chances of guessing right are fairly slim. </p>
<p>Lastly, even though a significant majority of fossils are bone matter that has been replaced with rock, soft tissue can also fossilize under very specific circumstances which I don't know enough about to go in detail here. In addition, skin impressions can also fossilize, so if scientists find a skin impression next to a fossilized skeleton for example, they may be able to guess that the animal had a particularily strange nose. The location on the trunk that the impression is from and the size of it would affect the results of this greatly. </p>
<p>These probably aren't the only possible ways to go about this, but I'd say that even though the chances are very slim, scientists would probably be able to figure it out if the stars align just right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's begin with the issue of finding appropriate analogues to elephants. </p>
<p>On the issue of retracted nares, which is one of the conditions of the face that has led researchers to infer the possibility of trunks in non-elephant animals -- including, but not limited to, diplodocoid sauropod dinosaurs -- there are a few notable mammals that we can talk about. Saiga, a type of antelope; <em>Mirounga</em>, the elephant seal, as well as monk seals; tapirs, a perissodactyl; armadillo-like glyptodontoid xenarthrans; and several varieties of notungulates such as <em>Macrauchenia</em>.</p>
<p>Retracted nares are a major hallmark of extensive narial <em>soft-tissue</em>, and the inference is so strong that we do, in fact, slap fleshy tissues on diplodocoid faces as a result of large smooth fossae found on the facial bones and marks and foramina in the bones of the face that suggest neurovascular complexes to feed these tissues. (The issue of diplodocoid sauropods is so peculiar, it prompted Bob Bakker to illustrate trunked sauropods in the 1970s, and which elicited <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2009/03/20/junk-in-the-trunk/" target="_blank">actual speculative research to demonstrate the absence of positive evidence of this</a>.) This issue is less inferrable in mammals, as a lot of these nutriating vessels and nerves are part of the external facial nerve and the internal olfactory nerve, neither of which leave telltale marks on bones of the face.</p>
<p>What are trunks, exactly? In mammals, there's not just one kind. The trunk of saiga differs from that of the elephant -- the one has much fewer muscles than the other, but both are muscular and mobile, although not to the extent of the latter. The former is used for a variety of functions related to its habitat, including part of the heat exchange system in the nasal volume related to the environment (saiga are the largest living open tundra terrestrial mammal). They have extensive cartilages in all but elephants, and in tapirs, these leave large, toroidal or circular depressions on the skull surface as the structures extend onto the skull roof. Elephant trunk flexibility may have much, much more to do with a lack of cartilage in the mass of the trunk than development of muscles.</p>
<p>As for muscle attachment, all trunks in the noted animals involve large masses of facial muscles around the oral cavity modified as part of the narial trunk, and eventually modified into flexible upper-lip/nose mobile structure. In some animals, such as sengi (elephant shrew) or desmans, the large and often mobile rostrum makes use of small versions of these muscles but they move large cartilage structures which are supported by a small bone not present in <em>any</em> flexible-trunked mammal.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now let's consider the question at its root. We want to consider elephants are extinct, so we will not have living animals to study. We don't actually have to! Frozen mammoths from the Asian tundra have been recovered with extensive nasal tissue preserved, including the fascinating Lyuba and more recent finds of distinct trunks of near-adult-seized animals. This tells us immediately trunks are present and they were large.</p>
<p>But what if we didn't have these, and all mammoth remains found were missing these? If we were only to draw upon the living animals I noted at the top of this post, could we infer <em>trunks</em>? Yes, most likely.</p>
<p>This requires the information we'd draw from through how much vascular and nervous tissue trunks require, which as it turns out is quite a lot. Almost all of this is fed through various facial and internal olfactory vessels and nerves and portions of the extension of tissues from the inside of the mouth, because it extends the lip into the trunk in all animals noted. All of this arises in living mammals from distinctive regions inside the skull and from the brain, and all of this leaves traces. The olfactory nerve (rather, a collection of nerves) and bulb of elephants is <em>HUGE</em>, largest in asbolute size amongst all terrestrial mammals, and those nerves almost all extend through the trunk. Facial nerves and the maxillary branch of the trigeminal extend into the trunk as well, and these also leave traces in the form of the mental foramina, which are appropriately large.</p>
<p>We might then take from these skulls that there was extensive neurovascular tissue exiting the face around the nose, and thus that lots of soft-tissue were present which might, plausibly extend into a proboscis of some sort. </p>
<p>A secondary inference can be made from long-legged animals. If you note elephants and mammoths, they are rather long-legged, but have extremely short necks. Other long-legged animals typically have long necks with which to reach the ground without crouching, and for most birds or mammals, this puts them into a dangerous vulnerability to predators. So long necks allow them to maintain upright stance while feeding or drinking. Thus, we can infer trunks from the absence of a long neck: the animal must easily be able to reach the ground without compromising its vulnerability to predators.</p>
<p>But what if none of the living trunked animals were present? Luckily, the evidence for extra tissues of the face are not dependent upon knowing other trunks exist. We must reasonably infer large amounts of fleshy tissue of the face, but we become less certain how large and in what shape they might take, and we might practically infer the width of the structures match the width of the skull, as with hippos and similar animals like horses, antelope, rhinos, etc. But the issue of reaching the ground without crouching comes up here, too, and thus an enterprising alternate researcher could suggest the extra tissue forms a long structure that can reach near the ground.</p>
<p>So one might then generally conclude the answer to the question is &quot;Yes.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
