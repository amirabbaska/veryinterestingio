But it can also be used as a checkpoint for longer missions that require heavy payloads. For example: if we want to send a ship to the moon we can send the ship without fuel to the ISS (International Space Station) and then send the fuel tank to refuel the spaceship. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ISS is essentially a research station in Earth orbit. The astronauts there perform a variety of experiments that can't be performed on Earth (usually because they examine the effects of microgravity). These experiments cover a wide variety of topics, including, biology, genetics, physics, astronomy, meteorology, and many other fields. A focus of these experiments is to examine how extended stays in space effect humans. If humans ever want to leave Earth (to go to Mars or beyond), we'll need to know how the human body will respond to a long term stay in space.</p>
<p>As for the purpose of the space program: In general, its purpose is to explore the origin, evolution, and future of the Earth, the Solar System, and the universe. </p>
<p>If you're talking about studying the Earth, this has important implications: Think weather patterns, storms, atmospheric composition, stuff like that. Much of these measurements are taken with space based observation satellites, and it's hard to argue against their results. It's nice to know about a hurricane a couple weeks before it hits your house. </p>
<p>We also observe our solar system through the use of telescopes and space probes. These can help us answer questions about our planetary neighbors and their evolution. These can answer questions that are important to our survival as a species. Things like: Why did Mars become such a frozen wasteland? Can that happen to Earth? How did Venus's runaway greenhouse effect turn the planet into the literal definition of Hell? Could that happen to Earth? Are there ways to predict solar flares that could knock out power grids here on Earth? What about asteroids? How many are out there that could hit Earth? In addition, they answer other things about our place in the universe. For example, we now believe (thanks to our space exploration program), that Mars (and maybe Venus, too) were warm, temperate worlds with flowing water, just like Earth. Did they have life? If they didn't, why didn't they? Is life on Earth special, or could it have developed elsewhere? Could Humans eventually live on Mars? These are all questions that our space program strives to answer.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have many telescopes in space that observe the rest of the universe (the most famous of these is the Hubble Space Telescope). These telescopes are in space mainly to avoid looking through the Earth's atmosphere, as the atmosphere distorts images (think twinkling stars). These telescopes again help answer fundamental questions about the universe and our place in it. For example, just 30 years ago, we didn't even know if other solar systems had planets. Know we know that almost every star has at least one planet, and about 20% of those have planets similar to Earth in size and orbit (maybe habitable). We also are able to peer into the early universe and examine the way it has developed over its lifetime. This can pave the way to new discoveries about the laws of nature.</p>
<p>All in all, I think most of those are pretty noble causes. And the United States has the world's biggest space program, but we only spend about .5% of our budget a year on it (~$18 Billion). So yeah, maybe we can find better short term places to spend them money, but I see it more as a very small investment into our future as a species with huge potential payoffs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This article brings up many good points.

<p>To summarize: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Tech developed for space exploration has turned into important modern tech (MRIs , smoke detectors, etc). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Space programs educate the public</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creates lots of high skill jobs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gets us closer to becoming a multi-planetary species. It's extinction insurance for when the next mass extinction event happens on earth. </p>
</li>
<li>We learn more about the origin of the solar system and our universe. The value of this information in intangible but the more we understand our environment the more we can control it. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have done a LOT of research into the station, but I'm in no way an engineer on the project.</p>
<p>The station is used to study how people/animals/bacteria/diseases/etc. react to microgravity. The station is large enough to support a LOT of experiments at once, (I'd say thousands but I'm unsure on that number) some even in the vacuum of space (That station has multiple airlocks that can be used to move experiments out into the vacuum). They also search for cures to diseases that may have to be made only in space, such as possible cures for cancer. Also, multiple Earth-observing experiments are onboard the station, such as ones to monitor the ozone layer, rainfall totals, lightning, etc. The ISS may also be used to test out new technologies for space exploration, such as new foods, exercise equipment, spacesuit designs, etc. Finally, many commercial companies can test out large-scale pieces of equipment onboard the station, like Bigelow's inflatable test module, and Boeing's future small experiment airlock.</p>
<p>One side effect of having the station that you may know about is the amount of amazing pictures taken from the station.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
