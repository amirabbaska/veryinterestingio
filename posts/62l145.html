		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a career paid Fireman. The best way to simplify it is to say that we do not ALWAYS enter a burning structure. There are quite a few common sense reasons that are a definite no go for us (such as flames through the roof, indicating a high probability for collapse on most residential fires). If there is a possibility that we can enter the structure, the incident commander has to make a decision which comes down to &quot;risk a little to save a little, risk a lot to save a lot&quot;. If there is any chance that a VIABLE human life is inside, you can guarantee that every firefighter on the scene would risk their life without question to save the person inside. The big word there being viable. Most of the time the toxic chemicals produced by modern manufacturing give off super heated and immediately deadly fumes that can kill you after only a few breaths. We have to take that into account and will not risk as much to recover someone who has without a doubt perished. Our next goal is to save property that can be saved. Family photos and heirlooms are irreplaceable and we make every effort to minimize your loss. If I can read the conditions of the fire and make a direct attack inside the house right at the seat of the fire, it extinguishes the fire quicker, preventing extension and also limiting damage from water being shot in through Windows. Most of our nozzles put out at least 200 gallons per minute. That is a lot if water to put inside your house blindly through a window. Most kitchen fires could probably be extinguished with less than 30 gallons if there is no extension into the walls/roof. Also as others have said, there are a lot of times you can't be certain that the building is unoccupied. A lot of accidental fires happen because squatters light &quot;camp fires&quot; in abandoned buildings to keep warm. They have a right to be saved and us not completing a search of the building (conditions permitting) would be negligent. In residential buildings we keep our eye out for indicators of people that would occupy the structure. For instance if there is a car in the driveway then someone was likely home. Or if there are small children's toys in the yard or house then we automatically assume the possibility that we need to account for children. Sorry for any typos, I'm on mobile. Hope this helps answer your question. If you take anything away from this, just know that if there is a possibility for me or any of the firefighters I know to save a life, we will fight until our last breath to get you out safely.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firefighter here. ELI5 version: Because even a partially burned building is still worth money.</p>
<p>Long version:<br />
If the building is truly empty/unoccupied, with no buildings around it, depending on the age and condition of the structure pre-fire, many times, it will be left to burn. As long as there is some value to the structure and contents post-fire, we'll try our best to contain and extinguish the fire. </p>
<p>There's a lot of factors that go into whether to let it burn or to try and put it out. If only one room is involved, the rest of the house is still good, and we'll put the fire out in that room, then check to see how far it's extended into the rest of the house. The more we can save of the structure and contents, the better. </p>
<p>If the fire is blowing out every window and door, then we know that the structure is unsafe for us to enter. There are some structures that are unsafe for us to enter because the Fire Inspectors have already done an inspection, and determined that the building is unsafe, and marked it as such on the building itself, and on pre-plan documents.</p>
<p>When we're putting a fire out, we try to do our best to save the contents, either by removing them or covering them before we start squirting water and tearing up walls and ceilings. We try to only use as much water and tear up as few walls and ceilings as necessary to put the fire out and make sure it hasn't spread. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firefighter here, like mentioned above there are multiple ways we deal with structure fires.</p>
<p>1: Defensive attack- Just like it says, we're defending. The building/structure/ ect. has no individuals or life inside of it and is so engulfed in flames that  it's unsafe for us to go in. So we set up hoses/aerial hoses (ladder trucks)/ etc around the house to extinguish if from the outside. Also, we constantly water down adjacent houses and tree lines to prevent the fire from spreading (radiant heat warms things up quickly when its thousands of degrees). Practically, we're just controlling the demolition of a house by fire, with a primary goal of attempting to extinguish it completely.</p>
<p>2: Offensive- Just like it sounds again.  We're going in and trying to put it out from the source. This takes place when we have the ABILITY to, such as when the fire is still in the intial phases of growing and not like the scene from spidey 1 where the entire apartment complex is engulfed. I could elaborate more if you so desire, but i hope this amswers your question directly in the simplest way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People get rescued from &quot;vacant&quot; buildings all the time.  Having your house or business on fire is a very stressful experience, and people forget things under stress.</p>
<p>They forget that one of the kids had a friend staying over.  Or that the maintenance guy was going to stay late to work on the air conditioner, or whatever.</p>
<p>They can also be wrong - they may not know someone was squatting in their building or coming in early, or snuck their girlfriend in after bed time.</p>
<p>That's why we get paid to go on and check every survivable space at every fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>30 year career fireman here, times have changed, we don't go in like we used to. We compare risk versus reward, if people aren't trapped and the structure is well involved then typically it is a defensive extinguishment. (Squirt water in from the outside) If it is not well involved, we go inside to put it out and save as much of the property and possessions as possible. The bravado BS is old school and archaic. The chemicals in pretty much all home products are filled with countless carcinogens and poisons unlike a few decades ago. Breathing these products of combustion is stupid and lethal...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
