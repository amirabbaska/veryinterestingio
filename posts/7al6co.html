		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>noise isolating.<br />
consider this ear plugs that have earbuds in them.  THey block outside noise by providing a noise reducing barrier.   In fact my isolation earbuds are so good I use them as Earplugs when using a circular saw  or mowing the lawn. NO music and not even plugged in.</p>
<p>Noise Cancelling
Headphones that essentially listen to ambient noise and produce an opposite sound wave to blank out the unwanted sound.  Fill your bathtub with water.  Drop two rocks into the tub one at each end.  When the waves collide you will see a spot where the water seems calm because the waves are cancelling each other out. Noise cancelling headphones produce this negative wave by listening in to the outside noise and producing the opposite wave to cancel out the wave just like in the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Noise isolating headphones block sound. Noise canceling headphones effectively add anti-sound.</p>
<p>Anti-sound is identical to the original sound, just out of sync by half a wavelength. A sound is just a pattern of high and low pressure air waves. By adding another sound that has high pressure when the original one has low pressure and vice versa, you cancel out the sound.</p>
<p>Noise canceling headphones generally require their own batteries in order to analyze sounds and make the corresponding anti-sounds. Noise isolating headphones just need to cover your ear with something that doesn't transmit sound very well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're standing on the long rope bridge at the playground and Jimmy is on one side of the bridge shaking it up and down.  When he shakes the bridge like that, you move up and down, and that's kind of how sound works.</p>
<p>For a noise isolating headphone, imagine that we lay down a bunch of heavy blankets all along the bridge to weigh it down.  Jimmy's still shaking the bridge up and down just as much as before, but you don't move around quite as much.  That's like how a noise isolating headphone tries to quiet down the sound waves that are coming to your ear.</p>
<p>For a noise cancelling headphone, imagine that I'm standing on the ground in between you and Jimmy.  While he's shaking the bridge, every time he lifts the bridge I pull down on it, and every time he pushes down on the bridge I lift up on it.  The better I'm able to perfectly counteract Jimmy's shaking, the more it's like you don't feel any shaking at all.  That's like how a noise cancelling headphone tries to cancel out the sound waves that are coming to your ear.</p>
<p>Please don't hang out with Jimmy at recess anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
