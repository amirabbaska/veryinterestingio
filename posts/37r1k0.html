		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They peg their currency to an exchange rate that isn't based on natural market fluctuations. There are several reasons to do this, the main reason though is that it makes exports cheaper. Keeping the exchange rate of Yuan to dollars high means that their labor is also cheaper. </p>
<p>While it may seem that this is a devious practice (which it can be), we can look at groups like the EU. For example, prior to the euro, the greek drachma had a very high exchange rate, which meant that greek exports/labor was cheaper (and they could compete with their german counter parts who were on a whole more skilled). However when the euro was implemented and greece joined the EU, they no longer could compete with more productive countries, by having an export favoring exchange rate, as well as not being able to impose import tariffs, to combat cheaper imports on the euro.</p>
<p>Jay Kaplan's book <a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Jay_Kaplan_Financial_Markets_and_the_Economy?id=lBlOBAAAQBAJ" target="_blank">Financial Markets and the Economy</a> is a very good cheap overview of money and banking systems and only requires a basic understanding of economics.</p>
<p>Edit: To specifically answer the currency manipulator question: the US can officially declare china a currency manipulator to help curb the poor living conditions of the population. It would cause the exchange rate to rise, making the purchasing power of the yuan larger, meaning peoples wages would be able to purchase more. However to do so would cause global market externalities that are not favorable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When an American wholesaler is bulk buying widgets from China, they pay the Chinese company in yuan. This means they need to first exchange their dollars for yuan, creating a demand for yuan currency. Over time with many people buying billions of widgets, the value of the yuan should increase as there becomes more demand for it. So the value of the yuan should go up as China continues a trade surplus. </p>
<p>However China can manipulate the value of its own currency by simply printing more yuan. China can also manipulate U.S. currency by aggressively buying U.S. debt., creating a demand for U.S. dollars. This is also beneficial because it shields them from the high inflation of the yuan. </p>
<p>Why does China do this? A cheap yuan makes Chinese widgets cost less on the global market, making China a favorable place for manufacturing. By purposefully keeping the yuan cheap despite increased exports, they maintain a position where they can dominate manufacturing. </p>
<p>Japan and South Korea have faced similar accusations. Japan is actually the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt, which means that compared to the size of their economy, they're even more aggressive at buying U.S. debt. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Economist here:</p>
<p>Unlike most other countries China maintains an artificially low exchange rate for RMB (Yuan) which is determined by the government and not the markets. Other countries have free-floating currencies which means that their value is determined by  supply and demand on the financial markets. This means that the currency can go very low if the demand drops and supply increases (when more investors are selling the currency and few are buying) but it also can go very high if demand rises (everyone wants to buy the currency).  Chinese Yuan doesn't do that - it has a rigid exchange rate which is set by the government very low  - much lower than it would be in the market conditions considering how many Yuans people are buying to trade and invest in China. This makes Chinese exports and labour much cheaper than they otherwise would be and therefore it allows China to out-compete other countries with significantly lower prices. </p>
<hr />
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>There are two kinds of currencies - value-pegged and free-floating.</p>
<p>Value-pegged currencies are denominated as a quantity of something else with a well defined market value. For example a USD-pegged currency is defined as 1currency=x dollars. A gold-pegged currency is defined as 1currency=x gold. This means that there is no direct supply and demand for the currency and it only reflects the supply and demand for the thing backing it i.e. dollars or gold.</p>
<p>Free-floating currencies have no intrinsic value and depend purely on how the market works out <em>their</em> value. This means  that it will depend on two factors: </p>
<p>supply - how much currency is in circulation and how much more of it the government will create or how much of it the current holders will sell back  on the market</p>
<p>demand - how much of the currency everyone wants to buy currently and in the foreseeable future to store value, buy Chinese stuff or invest in China.</p>
<p>Because there is no intrinsic value to a free-floating currency it is only reflected in how much people want it at the moment. How much that is is reflected in how useful it is for trade and investment. A currency of a poor African country with few resources will be very undesirable because it would be nearly worthless. There isn't anything special that you can do with it other than spend in that poor African country.  A currency of a big country with a strong and growing economy is another thing because you can always use it in the country to buy and invest stuff, or just exchange with people in the country who want it to make their purchases.</p>
<p>China is a huge growing economy and therefore having a lot of Yuan is useful because a thousand of Chinese Yuan today will (I will leave inflation out of the picture now to simplify things) buy stuff in a poorer and less developed country than tomorrow. Meaning that at no point people hold a bunch of Chinese money and think &quot;this will be worthless tomorrow&quot;. Every day China grows and modernizes and with every day the money is getting more useful and not less. And therefore the demand for the money increases because with every day there's more and more things that you can to with Chinese economy.</p>
<p>Now when that happens usually markets (people all over the world doing trades) start to want such a currency really badly and the demand for it increases. When demand increases the price of the currency increases too. Therefore if one day everyone decides that they want Chinese currency more than they want American currency it will mean that you will be able to buy fewer Yuans with the same amount of Dollars and more Dollars with the same amount of Yuans.</p>
<p>When that happens every price denominated in Yuans suddenly rises for Americans and every price denominated in Dollars drops for the Chinese. </p>
<p>That means that an investor who set up a factory in China and employed 1000 workers for 1000USD a year now has to pay say...2000USD a year - the cost of production just increased two-fold. If those 1000 workers produced Nike Shoes at 100$ a pair and the cost was 10$ then the other costs and profits had 90$ to share. If suddenly the cost of labour grows to 20$ (and also rents, utilities etc ) that means that you have 10$ less to split between transport, marketing, dividend, profit, investment etc.   It might not seem like a lot but in the long term when you consider growing trend of Chinese economy and the competition (say a pair of Nike shoes at 100$ is worth the same as a pair of Reeboks at 90$) you are faced with the possibility that the cost of production will grow and grow and grow.   So to maintain profits you move the factory somewhere else - that means no more $$$ for China and all those people lose their jobs.</p>
<p>So China decided that they like both the jobs and the $$$ and says &quot;fuck the markets <em>we</em> will tell you how much Yuan is worth&quot; and they keep it at a level where it takes a lot of time to make manufacturing in China uncompetitive - because it has to come from the internal market pressures (internal cost of living, expectations of the workers, supply of labour in China etc).</p>
<p>This means that as long as China does that no other country with free-floating currency can outcompete them because every time they get really productive - people want to buy their money to trade and invest and the price of the money goes up (and therefore all prices denominated in that money). This is a balancing mechanism which works really well... provided it is not distorted - as it is in China and it maintains a certain balance in who can produce or buy what. </p>
<p>Today I make a lot of cheap stuff and you pay me your money but then I have a lot of your money while you have very little so you drop your prices and then you make a lot of cheap stuff.  The currency is flowing back and forth.   With China you have a permanent black hole that just sucks in currency and it is not good in the long run - neither for the world nor for China. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TL,DR</strong>  - the price of your money (exchange rate) determines how competitive your economy is with regards to prices of your goods. If the market sets the exchange rate the more you produce the more people want your money to buy stuff from you the more expensive your money gets - and the higher the prices denominated in your currency. If you do not let the market set the exchange rate then it doesn't matter how many people want to buy your money - you tell them how much it costs and therefore you can both have the cookie (low, competitive prices which attract investment and capital) and eat it (sustained long-term economic growth)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons everything is made in China is because it is cheap.  One of the reasons it is cheap is because China has a lot of people that need jobs so they accept low wages because the alternative is to have no job at all and starve.</p>
<p>As Chinese people start working they begin to earn money and want to buy things like cars and apartments and have families.  This means they need more money and they start to demand higher wages.  Higher wages mean things cost more and pretty soon making stuff in other countries makes more sense.</p>
<p>So China takes in all this cash from making iPods or whatever and this would normally cause the value of the Yuan to rise (again, making things more expensive).  So the Chinese print more Yuan at their treasuries and they buy things like US T-Bills.  The more Yuan there are on the market the less each one is worth to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Therefore things stay cheap and China can keep people employed and not starving in the streets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there. PhD Economist here. I taught economics in China and speak Mandarin.  </p>
<p>1  - no floating ForEx (foreign exchange of currencies).
The exchange rate in China (dollars per yuan) is controlled by the Chinese government.  They do this by not allowing free exchange of yuan for other currencies.  So when you go to the bank in China, you can only buy a few dollars per year per Chinese citizen.  If you could buy as many dollars as you wanted, the currency would &quot;float.&quot;  All of the major banks in China are owned by the Chinese government, as I recall.  If they're not, they at least have very tight controls on them. </p>
<p>2  Seignorage (printing lots of money).
The Chinese government knows that as people get richer, their labor becomes more expensive. This can happen for a lot of reasons. They want to spend more time on leisure, or their labor is in higher demand, so the factories drive wages up, or they have domestic consumption causing demand to rise, causing labor demand to rise, causing wages to rise.  This is a fancy way of saying that as we get richer we buy more stuff, and as be buy more stuff, other people buy more stuff, and we continue to get richer.  The Chinese government sees wages going up and doesn't want exports to fall, so they try to reduce the value of their currency by printing more currency.  By printing more of their currency, Chinese can make more money and buy more stuff domestically, but foreign goods are still relatively expensive.  Foreigners see Chinese made goods as cheaper.  Think of this as; I have one banana and there is nothing else to buy...You have 1 dollar.  You want to buy my banana.  You would buy my banana for $1.  Then lets say I have one banana and you have 2 dollars.  If there is nothing else to buy, you'd buy my banana for 2 dollars.  Same thing if we expand it out to the whole country.  Lots of dollars and lots of goods vs twice as many dollars and the same amount of goods.  This would cause price inflation and the goods would just cost twice as much.  Since China is expanding so rapidly, they have more goods and more yuan, and they're buying more stuff.  The CCP (Chinese Communist Party) just want to make sure that exports stay high so that their growth numbers stay high.</p>
<p>3  Growth numbers.<br />
Politicians (china) are graded on how high their growth is, so they want high exports and lots of new construction.  Their selling a lot of new buildings at high prices.  Those buildings are probably not worth that much and creating a property bubble.  Because of low interest rates in banks, relatively high price inflation, and distrust of the stock market (lots of insider trading and manipulation), property is the best investment.  If they could invest in foreign stocks, you'd see a pretty big devaluation of property.</p>
<p>4   Why does the US give  a shit?<br />
The US has a huge trade deficit with China. That's a really dumb thing to say. We don't have such a big trade deficit with asia.  The US buys lots of stuff from China, but China buys all that stuff from Korea, Taiwan, Japan, etc.  Those places buy lots of stuff from the US.  The trade deficit isn't so bad, but the US government has huge debt and China is buying a lot of it.  That's not so bad if we were using the money well, but we're not.  The Federal government is inefficient and wasting that money that we're borrowing for China.  Its better to blame China for our economic troubles that to decide spending.  Thus, China is the boogeyman.  </p>
<p>TLDR: China is printing lots of money and preventing floating currency exchange to keep exports high.  US is running a huge deficit due to poor fiscal policies and blames China.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
