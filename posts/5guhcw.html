		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on who you ask. There are two major accounts:</p>
<p>The critical period hypothesis posits that humans have enhanced sensitivity to certain contrasts (typically linguistic, but you've noted some others as well) that goes away as we age. This is usually held to be a maturational process, and it follows that lack of exposure to the correct input at the right time would result in a lack of learning the discrimination task in question (e.g., sound contrasts in native languages, differentiating human faces).</p>
<p>However, there's reasonable evidence (e.g., Bouton, Serniclaes, Bertoncini, &amp; Cole, 2012) that humans can learn some of these discrimination tasks to a performance level similar to a native speaker when exposed later in life - in this particular instance, because they did not gain hearing until later in life due to cochlear implants. This suggests that what is happening is a result of experience, perhaps changes in how information is represented or changes in sensitivity of the underlying statistical mechanisms that leads to this loss of fidelity.</p>
<p>I tend to think that this is a result of learning rather than a biological maturational process, and in my work I look at learning mechanisms that might explain this loss of discrimination as a result of experience.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called perceptual narrowing! It happens due to synaptic pruning, and whilst losing certain abilities doesnt sound like a good thing infants brains do this in order for them to specialize in a language and discriminate faces of their own species. There have even been studies done that show that infants after a certain age are better able to discriminate faces from their own race than from others. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a microscopic view, it makes sense as a biological result of honing -- or maybe more appropriately &quot;pruning&quot;. Even while in the womb, the little filament-like nubs pop up and go away on dendrites as rhythmic and regular firing of neurons occur. The brain's trying to make sense of all the input and feedback. Eventually regularity increases for some nubs and neighbor groups of nubs start to form. This process is necessary and called pruning. </p>
<p>I'd hypothesize that this first stage pruning is what makes a decline in extreme plasticity early on. The brain can now hone in on the patterns that had the greatest regularity with the least amount of noise. If it doesn't do this, the child may turn out autistic. Autistic children seem to miss the pruning stage and their dendrites are littered with nubs/spines that never go away. It's information overload with little refinement of processing. <a href="http://www.klannlabnyu.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Bowling-Klann.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.klannlabnyu.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Bowling-Klann.jpg</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This period of time also coincidences when neonates loose their primitive reflexes, essentials sets of evolutionarily conserved behaviors that promote survival and are only present in neonates but disappear during development. We still don't really how they disappear but it has to do with the maturation of the nervous system.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This sounds wrong. </p>
<p>People <em>can</em> distinguish between different language sounds well into late childhood, any psycholinguistics or linguist specialised in language acquisition will testify to you.</p>
<p>It is well studied fact that up until ca. 6 yrs. old anyone can learn any additional language without an accent given enough exposure (with the ratio of ppl achieving this decreasing up until ca. 12, above which it becomes exceptional.</p>
<p>Now, given that until kindergarden age humans can universally learn to speak without a discernable accent, their brains can surely discriminate between the sounds, both of their L1, as well as any L<em>n</em>. </p>
<p>I think you must have misunderstood some claim.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
