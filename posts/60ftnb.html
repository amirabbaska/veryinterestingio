		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was just trying to create an account for my state's tax site, and their account creation featured three required dropdowns where I was supposed to select security questions, then provide answers for the sake of password resets.  Each dropdown had more esoteric questions than the last (ie, &quot;what subject do you believe should be taught in schools, but isn't&quot; and &quot;what song do you think you can sing better than the professional singer&quot;).</p>
<p>This isn't unique to government sites by any stretch; I see it everywhere.  Companies who insist they care about security are creating gigantic holes for spear phishing.</p>
<p><strong>Is there some reason companies/developers don't just let people select their own questions?</strong></p>
<p>I did some rough math and found that 512 bytes per person for 50 million people (256 bytes for the question, 256 bytes for the answer) would only take about 25 GB of storage (if every single person used the maximum allotted space), so it's not a hardware limitation.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because people are idiots.</p>
<p>People selecting security questions like &quot;write 'abc123'&quot; or &quot;what's my name&quot; or such would mean multiple people could have their accounts broken into, and undoing damage caused by their stupidity would by all likelihood be paid by the company, not the idiot user.</p>
<p>So you remove ways for users to be idiots and thus improve security.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To piggy back off your question. I just would like them to include non open ended questions that can vary. &quot;What was your favorite movie as a child?&quot; A year or two from now I'm not going to remember  what age I took as being a child, or what answer I put because who knows what movie I remembered then, compared to what movies I remember I watched now. I would prefer hard point questions. &quot;Your first car.&quot; or &quot;The house number to your longest stayed at childhood home.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
