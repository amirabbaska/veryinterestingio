Even measly old caffeine can turn an otherwise enjoyable stone into an ugly paranoid headspace.</p>
<p>Sativa dominant strains tend to cause the more sketchy panicked feelings. Although some people claim they give them energy and help them focus.</p>
<p>The science explaining this has come down to THC VS CBD, but I believe as time goes on we'll see the terpenes coming into play as modulators of the various effects ascribed to different types off highs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 answer: In short, it enhances what's already there, which is why experienced recreational drug users always talk about &quot;set &amp; setting&quot;. The &quot;set&quot; is your mindset and the &quot;setting&quot; is your surroundings.</p>
<p>If you already have anxiety and stress or if you're in a setting which isn't enjoyable or just negative all-around, all of that is going to get amplified.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you're relaxed and having a good time and in a warm &amp; comfortable place you're more likely to have a positive experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey Timmy! You know how daddy drinks coffee to help him work? And sometimes he drinks whisky for fun? And sometimes, he has whisky in his coffee?</p>
<p>Yeah. Cannabis is like that. (only not really).</p>
<p>Sometimes, people make cannabis with lots of whisky in it so that they can have lots of fun and relax.</p>
<p>Sometimes they'll put lots of coffee (and they'll use lots of shots of espresso instead of one shot and filling the rest up with water). </p>
<p>This means that even though the people that drink the coffee with whisky in it, they get very excited because they had LOTS AND LOTS OF COFFEE AT ONCE! So they get VERY EXCITED! The whisky doesn't calm them down or make them have fun like usual. </p>
<p>ELI15 :</p>
<p>Cannabis has several types of cannabinoids in it. Cannabinoids are special chemicals that do different things. Two main cannabinods are THC and CDB. THC makes you more aware of things, and CBD makes you relax. People can breed Cannabis plants to have a moderate amount of both, lots of both, more THC or more CBD.</p>
<p>If you have a friend who constantly smokes lots of high THC cannabis, they might get more anxious. If you have a friend who smokes cannabis with a regular amount of CBD in it from time to time, they relax and have fun. </p>
<p>As some other users have pointed out, if you're in a bad mind and setting, doing drugs is likely to make this worse. Also, because cannabis is illegal in some places in the world, you can already feel anxious about smells, police etc, if you feel that neighbours or police might see/smell you doing it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure why this is the case for other people but, personally after smoking for 7 years, too much gives me severe anxiety. I'll take maybe two puffs to relax these days but even a whole bowl out of my bong and it can be pretty bad. Needless to say I do not smoke often at all anymore unless I have actual anxiety or nausea. I used to have a really high tolerance but recently I'd say over the last few months it really effects me differently than it used to. Thus why I've been smoking much, much less. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I smoked heavily for 20+ years and sometimes I found I'd get paranoid and anxious. Very unpleasant.
One day it dawned on me; smoke only a very tiny amount. Just enough to feel something without wigging out. Changed my life. Not only can a small bag last for over a year, but I smoke far less frequently and it's no longer a prerequisite for good times.<br />
For me it was all about dosage.
It's a great drug when used wisely. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
