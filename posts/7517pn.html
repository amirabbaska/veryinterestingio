		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear warheads fitted to ICBM's and SLBM's are not really warheads in the same sense as an artillery round. They are in fact a small and complex machine fitted inside a heat resistant and aerodynamic shell. It might be easier to think of them as miniature spacecraft. One nuclear missile will carry several warheads and they will seperate to attack different targets or the same target multiple times. These are called MIRV or Multiple Independent Re-Entry Vehicle.</p>
<p>Because they are basically machines, they are designed to be taken apart and maintained. The pit or the nuclear element of the warhead is just one component. It can be removed and in fact very often is removed from the warhead for things like testing (Where it is replaced by an inert device) and routine maintenance.</p>
<p>The decommissioning process varies depending on the terms of the treaty. In some cases it is simply a case of reducing the number of MIRV's the missile carries say from 12 to 8. If physical removal is required it is a case of removing the nuclear element of the warhead and putting it into storage or use as a fuel, while recycling or destroying the components of the MIRV. The missiles themselves are rarely destroyed in entirety, they or their components often have useful secondary peaceful applications.</p>
<p>There are a number of common misconceptions about ICBM's, SLBM's and nuclear warheads and their MIRV delivery system. One is that their guidance components use GPS to guide them into their targets. This is in fact not true. These missiles must reach their target and relying on GPS might harm their chances of that happening if the GPS system where to be attacked. So the majority of ICBM/SLBM use celestial navigation (The positions of the stars) to guide them into their targets. They don't have to be super accurate. A circular error of probability of half a mile is acceptable. Russian missiles used to have massive payloads to make up for their less accurate guidance systems. It really doesn't matter if your off target by 3 miles if you ramp up the explosive power by 10 megatons! For this reason you will often see US missiles use smaller warheads than their russian counterparts.</p>
<p>Another common misconception is that the warheads have some communication component that offers an ability to communicate with it after launch and give a recall or cancellation ability, so if a missile is fired in some sort of accidental launch scenario it can be communicated with and made inert or to blow itself up without going nuclear. This is also not true and is a myth perpetrated by Hollywood. The risks of an enemy finding out how to communicate with the missile and destroy it would be too great. These weapons are designed to be the ultimate and last deterrent. The missile, once fired, communicates with nothing and no-one. It is a self contained system that once the button has been pressed, will carry out it's mission to it's final horrifying end unless it is somehow intercepted externally.</p>
<hr />
<p>EDIT: Clarified decommissioning process and celestial navigation and the fact I may not have mentioned inertial guidance clearly enough. To clarify the correct term is astro-inertial guidance in that the &quot;majority&quot; of ICBM's and SLBM's (Lest we not forget the US developed versions are not the only types of these horrific weapons) use both, with inertial guidance being responsible for initial and re-entry guidance and celestial for mid course correction. </p>
<p>So celestial navigation is the tracking of your position by looking at where you are in relation to the stars, because where you are and the time of day defines what you can see and where they should be in the night sky. It's not an overly complex skill and we have been doing it for a very long time. It's kind of fallen out of use in these days of GPS. Ships at sea would use a sextant to help them plot their position relative to the time of the day and the position of the stars which was why getting accurate clocks on board ships was such a big deal many years ago. In fact the earliest Boeing 747 aircraft had a porthole in their cockpit roofs to allow the crew to use celestial navigation should the need arise!</p>
<p>Obviously celestial navigation is of more use at night and in good weather if your on the ground, but ICBM's and SLBM's don't need to worry about this as within the space of about 30 seconds they are high enough to begin using it without either of these concerns as they use inertial guidance in their initial launch. The missile and MIRV's basically have a digital version of a sextant on board. If you would like to see a vaguely similar approximation of how they work, I suggest you download the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Sky app (Formerly Google Sky)</a>, which allows you to use your phone to plot the stars in the sky (Though Google augments this with GPS data so they cheat a little bit).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are really two issues here. One is the dismantling — taking things apart. The other is verification — proving to the other party or parties that you did really take things apart, and aren't just lying about it. The latter is just as important for treaties as the former.</p>
<p>As for taking them apart, it is neither as easy nor as hard as one might imagine. Nuclear warheads, and nuclear missiles, and nuclear silos, are all just complex machines. They have many parts. They were not built with the intention of making it easy to take them apart (it isn't just a matter of using a screwdriver), but you can take them apart. Nuclear warheads are disassembled in &quot;<a href="http://wordpress.mrreid.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gravel-gertie.jpg" target="_blank">gravel gertie</a>&quot; containment bays that make it so that if something goes seriously wrong — e.g., their high explosives detonate — contamination will be limited (gravel will collapse onto it, holding in any scattered plutonium, etc.). The missiles themselves can be de-fueled and then disassembled in pieces. It isn't significantly different than deconstructing any other device that contains some dangerous or toxic parts. The warhead is probably the most difficult thing to take apart because it contains toxic, radioactive, and volatile (explosive) components, but they develop procedures for doing it and have been doing it for years.</p>
<p>OK, so how do you verify that you've done it? Most treaties focus only on the disassembly of delivery vehicles, e.g., the planes, missiles, or submarines. Proving you took those apart is relatively straightforward: they are large enough to be seen by satellites so you can just destroy the thing in question in a relatively &quot;public way.&quot; For airplanes this is particularly striking: the <a href="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01583/planes-big_1583925a.jpg" target="_blank">&quot;boneyards&quot;</a> of retired planes, which are just rusting outside, some of which have been &quot;guillotined&quot; with massive blades. Submarines can be taken apart in dry dock, silos can be decommissioned and destroyed, etc. Each &quot;side&quot; has people whose job it is to count up such activities, and so you can get a pretty good tally of what each side has or hasn't. In a world of ubiquitous satellite coverage, you just don't have states being able to field large numbers of ICBMs or even submarines without it being noticed.</p>
<p>None of the treaties currently limit the number of total warheads in a stockpile (they limit the number of <em>deployed</em> warheads which is more a question of delivery vehicles than actual warheads). The question of &quot;counting warheads&quot; actually presents really tricky technical aspects that have been recognized for some time. The US and Russia are not willing to share information on how their warheads work with one another. If they were, it would just be a matter of disassembling the warhead while someone else watched. Because they want to keep it secret, all sorts of counting problems are involved. Let's say I am monitoring Russian warhead dismantlement. They show me a box and say, &quot;there's a warhead in there.&quot; They take it inside their dismantlement facility, then say they took it apart. They might show me another set of boxes and say, &quot;here are the parts from that warhead.&quot; How do I know that any of that is true? How do I know the box isn't just filled with lead? How do I know they haven't just squirreled the warhead out the back of the facility? </p>
<p>There aren't easy answers here. There are some interesting technical approaches to being able to verify that the box contains a warhead without learning anything about the warhead's design. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-virtues-of-nuclear-ignorance" target="_blank">You can read about some of them here if you are interested in more details</a>, but they are essentially similar to creating a &quot;one-way hash&quot; of a 3D, physical object, e.g., something that lets you verify it is &quot;X&quot; without being able to see what the &quot;X&quot; actually is on the inside. </p>
<p>It is not clear we will ever have treaties that put firm limits on warhead counts, it is not clear it is even necessary (if you can't deliver the warhead, who cares?), but the work is being done under the assumption that maybe, someday, there will be political will to do such a thing, and if that day comes, it would be nice to have worked out all of the technical aspects ahead of time, so they don't become a stumbling block.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplifying what others have said;</p>
<p>1) remove component warhead parts and break down further. The radioactive material is often reprocessed into the nuclear power industry.</p>
<p>2) remove fuel component from missile. Liquid fuelled missiles are typically only fuelled just prior to launch. Solid fuel missiles are a little more complicated. Rocket fuel can be rather toxic depending upon the type.</p>
<p>3) missile body is then often cut up and left exposed to satellite observation, or observers from the opposite side of the treaty are there watching the destruction processes. Sometimes both.</p>
<p>4) the silos/ mobile launchers can also be destroyed depending upon the treaty. Observers &amp; satellites monitor this.</p>
<p>When Kazakhstan became nuclear free the US and Russians were present on the ground. The warheads went back to Russia and monitored into the nuclear fuel industry. The silos were systemically destroyed, with additional work undertaken every ~6 months. I have photos of several of the Kazak silos going through phased destruction back in the mid to late '90's.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear weapons were designed to be maintained (fixed).  So most of the device is taken apart.  The one thing that was not really designed to be fixed is the &quot;pit&quot; made of dangerously radioactive material and high explosive sometimes literally glued to the pit.  You can use cold to make the explosive brittle and crack it off or use solvents to dissolve it over time.  Once you have the pit, you can recycle it to other nuclear devices or mix it with lower quality material and use it in nuclear reactors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Making it very short, they're handled in two ways:</p>
<p>First, the warheads are removed and stored at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico. Specifically, in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/35°02'25.0%22N+106°36'33.0%22W/@35.0105695,-106.5507132,955m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d35.040278!4d-106.609167?hl=en" target="_blank">this massive bunker.</a> Fun fact: they're not really dismantled for the most part, they just sit in cold storage under observation.</p>
<p>Next, the delivery system (missile, bomb, cruise missile, airplane, etc.) are destroyed in a way that makes them impossible to reuse. Airplanes get cut in half — like <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/PBDjAe3b57P2" target="_blank">these ones</a>, in Arizona. Missile launch positions get blown up or filled with concrete.</p>
<p>Finally, the warheads are trucked to Texas. Disassembly occurs in a plant there. Once the batteries are disconnected, a nuclear weapon is basically impossible to set off, and becomes much easier to disassemble. The conventional explosives are separated from the nuclear components. Most of the parts are simply stored separately, as they're specialized enough to be incredibly useful to say, a rogue state looking for more information on how to construct a weapon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
