		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is it at all possible that the earth can become an ocean planet? I've seen some rather extreme maps that show only a vast ocean with only narrow strips of land of both hemispheres but most maps seem to show only losing some coastal areas like London and NYC. </p>
<p>So, the simple question is, is there ANY scenario of the planet being taken by basically 90% ocean? Regardless of the likelihood, is there ANY scenario where humanity is forced to become a sea faring species?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the answers guys! Big help. I didn't expect so much answers and it seems to have sparked a good debate. I like a good debate so I enjoyed reading all your comments. I'm not too knowledgeable about science to contribute too much, but please rest assured I read your answers like a real lurker. I'll be sticking around to read any more potential answers but in the meantime thanks a bunch!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sea level rise is caused by the melting of the ice caps, but the planet has actually lacked ice caps for most of its history. If all the ice on the planet melted, it would only amount to about <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2013/09/rising-seas-ice-melt-new-shoreline-maps/" target="_blank">216 feet of sea-level rise</a>--which is enough to displace a major portion of the world's population, given our propensity for living on the coast, but given enough time to resettle they could easily survive on the remaining land. Realistically, though, the transition would be disastrous and could cause widespread famines. To have greater sea level rise you'd have to get water from extraterrestrial sources.</p>
<p>Edit: I'll answer a few common questions here rather than keep addressing them individually</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yes, if you eroded down all the mountains and dumped the material in the sea it would eventually cause the continents to be flooded, but that's not going to happen for a few reasons: 1, that amount of erosion would take many billions of years, and would slow down as the mountains were removed and only low plains remained; 2, tectonic processes create new land faster than erosion can wear it down; and 3, by the time either plate tectonics stops or enough time has passed for this erosion to occur, the Earth will have likely lost it's atmosphere and seas anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some quick math tells me that inundating everest would take around 4.5 * 10^21 liters of water, of which there might be enough on Pluto, or failing that, Triton. If you just wanted to flood all the lowlands then you might be able to get away with using something smaller like Rhea or Iapetus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, there is a large amount of water in the mantle, but it's not like an aquifer that can be tapped--it exists within the chemical structure of mantle rocks, mainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringwoodite" target="_blank">ringwoodite</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The source I cited claims that it would take around 5,000 years for all the ice in Antarctica to melt, but it's hard to be sure with these sorts of climate models. The more imminent risk of 20 feet of sea level rise is still enough to flood many coastal cities and spark mass migrations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I say the population can live in the remaining land after this event, I just meant that the remaining arable land is more than enough to support us. This doesn't make the transition easy by any means, especially given that the changing climate means the location of ideal agricultural land would shift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seawater desalination is possible, but very energy intensive, and though it may provide a source of fresh water for some regions it has no effect on sea-level rise. I'm not too sure why some people have brought it up.</p>
</li>
<li>When considering countermeasures to sea-level rise, your main concern isn't the gradual rise of the sea like a slow tide, but storm surges that cause short-term rises of several meters and destroy coastal structures and barriers--storms of the sort that will be more common in a warmer climate.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you wanted to drown every last square centimetre of land, then you'd have to have an ocean that's at least 8.850 km taller than it currently is (which is the AMSL altitude of the peak of Mount Everest). </p>
<p>With some quick maffs, one can deduce that the rough extra volume of water required would be some 4.5 billion cubic kilometres. </p>
<p>Earth has only got about <a href="https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/quickfacts/icesheets.html" target="_blank">33 million cubic kilometres</a> of ice. Accounting for thermal expansion wouldn't add significantly to this volume, as 4.5 billion km^3 is more than a <em>hundred</em> times this volume. </p>
<p>Earth is more likely to lose its water and become a desert planet than it will ever become an ocean planet.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: some people may account for the  fact that <a href="https://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/scientists-detect-evidence-oceans-worth-water-earths-mantle/" target="_blank">water has been subducted and is trapped in the upper mantle.</a> There is <em>still</em> not enough water there to drown all land on Earth. It <em>might</em> turn the Himalayas into an island chain, but fact remains that ocean planets are theorised to have oceans <em>hundreds</em> of kilometres deep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Melt all the ice on the planet and the sea level would rise 216 feet. It would devastate many populated areas, but leave the bulk of land untouched.</p>
<p>It's a far cry from Noah-type stories. You have to go back to the early Earth, circa 4 billion years ago, before mountain ranges existed, to see an Earth covered by a global ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically in astronomical terms with 75% of the surface area covered with water, the Earth is already a water world.  We just get to have a good amount of land, with not too much desert to live on.  Lucky us.  There is some density evidence for extra-solar planets with much deeper oceans, which I guess are true water worlds, but there are still a lot of unknowns.</p>
<p>I'm too lazy to do the calculation though - when everything melts and the seas go up 250 feet or whatever the final number is, what does that do in terms of the % of surface area covered by water.  I would image it goes up at least 1%?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
