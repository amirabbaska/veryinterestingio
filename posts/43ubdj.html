The BBC (among others), says &quot;The oil giant said its profits had fallen by 51% to $5.9bn (£4.1bn)&quot; while CNN Money (among others) says &quot;The company posted an annual loss of $5.2 billion.&quot;</p>
<p>How are they reporting both a profit and a loss? Are these some accounting terms that mean something different than what a normal person would think?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before I start I need to stress that these numbers are not of a typical income statement. This is for an oil/gas entity which has a vastly different method of valuing profit than a standard manufacturing or service-oriented firm. However, the general idea is the same. Let me first explain what the terms mean to most firms- A clear distinction should be made between profit and net income/(loss). Profit is essentially sales - cost of sales. Cost of sales are the specific costs that go into making a product/service. However, there are other costs that a business incurs (rent, utilities, insurance, product development, compensation, office supplies, penalties/fines, R&amp;D, etc) which we will term Operating Expenses. When you subtract Operating Expenses from Profit you end up with either Net Income/Profit (if positive) or a Net Loss (if negative). OKAY.. So that pretty much sums up the financial reporting for firms across all industries and should clear up the distinction between Profit and Net Income/Loss. NOW let's take a gander into the Petroleum industry. It all comes down to the Cost of Sales component. If you sell a food item your Cost of Sales is easy to understand. It's basically the ingredients, labor, and direct overhead that went into producing your food item. However, in the oil industry, the cost of sales is constantly changing due to the cost of oil constantly changing. So how does BP and other oil/gas entities deal with this? They create something called Replacement Cost which bases the Cost of Sales on the current price of oil. Oil companies are essentially reporting profitability based on how much it would cost the company to &quot;replace&quot; the reserves it sells. Specific to your question- BP is reporting Replacement Cost Profit of $5.9B. This is not a standard measure used by US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and is provided to illustrate to investors the fact that crude oil and product prices can vary significantly from period to period. BP is also reporting $5.2B in Underlying Replacement Cost Loss.  This is the Replacement Cost adjusted for non-operating items and fair value accounting effects. It's used to understand the underlying trends in BP’s operational
performance. Again, this is not a standard measure used across industries and is not GAAP. I hope this helps! Here is BP's <a href="http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/investors/bp-fourth-quarter-2015-results.pdf" target="_blank">Q4 10-Q for 2015</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very large companies tend to be going through a number of projects at any given time. These big projects tend to cost huge amounts of money.</p>
<p>Now, the average investor in these big companies is only really concerned with what level of profit a company is making on a &quot;normal&quot; basis.  They don't really mind that, say, we spent £1m to close a small department during the year, they just want to know what level of profit they should expect going forward.  </p>
<p>In order to give the investors this information, companies will show you two &quot;profit&quot; numbers. </p>
<p>The first &quot;profit&quot; number, will be &quot;adjusted profit&quot; or &quot;normalised profit&quot;.  This will exclude any big one-off costs or revenues that they had during the year.</p>
<p>The second &quot;profit&quot;, will be the total profit including all the funnies of the accounting world.</p>
<p>Given this is &quot;ELI5&quot;, i won't go through the various accounting terms in any real detail, as i don't think you need to know (happy to do so if you'd like). </p>
<p>So, here we have BP.
Their &quot;normalised profit&quot; is 5.9bn.  Their total loss is $5.2bn. The difference is massive for BP because they have had to pay huge fines because of oil spills and similar. </p>
<p>Hope that helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The BBC is reporting the &quot;real&quot; profit for the year. BP made $5.9 billion more than it spent in 2015 on normal activities.</p>
<p>CNN is reporting the &quot;book&quot; loss. BP made $5.9 billion more than it spent, but also took a &quot;charge&quot; of $12 billion, giving it a &quot;loss&quot; of around $6 billion. This charge is basically &quot;We have to pay some money because of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill&quot;, and is up to around $55 billion in total so far in the last 5 years.</p>
<p>If it wasn't for the Gulf of Mexico spill, the BBC number is the one relating to how much BP has actually made/lost and is in some ways the &quot;relevant&quot; number for the long term health of the company. The CNN number is the one that's &quot;right&quot; in terms of the amount of money that appears on the accounting books this year... but BP wouldn't expect to pay $12bn/year forever.</p>
<p>They're just reporting slightly different things. CNN points out that they include the charge. We already knew about the charge, though, so this isn't &quot;news&quot;. The BBC is reporting the &quot;What BP have announced today&quot; side, CNN are putting all the numbers together for a headline.</p>
<p>The BBC number is far more relevant for shareholders, who already knew about the $12bn charge and the Gulf of Mexico oil spill... they already factored those things into their investment and what they really care about right now is how the company is operating day to day. The CNN number is, as I said, just a headline.</p>
<p><strong>Super ELI5 - the BBC is reporting my pocket money and saying &quot;Jon made $10 this month! That's less than last month when he made $20&quot;, while CNN is including the fact I broke my mom's $30 vase and saying &quot;Jon lost $20 this month, omfg!&quot;</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you didnt quote the entire statement from the BBC. When you do, it makes more sense. I'll highlight the part you left out:</p>
<p>BBC -&quot;The oil giant said its profits had fallen by 51% to $5.9bn (£4.1bn), <strong>compared with $12.1bn in 2014</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35469380" target="_blank">Here</a> is the link to the BBC article for reference.</p>
<p>The rest of the difference comes from huge writedowns(big expenses) they had this year that effected the bottom line. 1 was  a $12 Billion for the gulf oil spill. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cases like this are why we always need to be careful with buzz stats. Something like &quot;ABC Corp made $X billion last year and paid no taxes!&quot; without factoring in the costs of doing business, R&amp;D costs that might lead to profits in future years, depreciation of assets, etc. is tricky. Recording costs and losses for mega companies isn't as cut and dry as &quot;I made more than I spent&quot; in the sense of a small business with considerably less moving parts. </p>
<p>As much as big business sucks sometimes, they are EXTREMELY complex accounting entities that can get pretty easily skewed if you want them to be. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
