		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People eat insects, and they can provide some useful calories and protein.</p>
<p>But no human society has survived using insects as a major source of its calories, and for a very good reason.  The amount of calories you gain by eating an insect is very small in proportion to the effort it takes to capture or cultivate it.  In many cases it will burn more calories to harvest and prepare an insect for food than it provides in calories.  </p>
<p>So if you are going to spend time gathering a food resource, it's a very poor choice.  But if you are starving and see an insect as a target of opportunity, eat it.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you’re trying to farm them, yes. <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iM8s1ch5TRw" target="_blank">According to this ASAP science video</a> pound for pound, crickets have as much protein as beef, but more vitamins, while mealworms are low in fat and much higher in fibre. Farming in such a scenario is feasible as the video also mentions that while a pound of beef requires 200 m2 of farmland, a pound of crickets only requires 15 m2 of farmland. </p>
<p>it also mentions the water needed per kilogram, while most conventional meats require thousands of litres of water per kilogram of meat, 1 kilogram of crickets needs only 1 litre of water. </p>
<p>You don’t even need to eat the whole cricket too, 80% of a cricket is edible compared to roughly 50% of conventional farm animals.</p>
<p>In short, if you know what you’re doin and are planning for the long haul in the apocalypse, yes, eating insects is quite feasible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insects, especially grubs worms, are eaten by many cultures and can provide a good amount of nutrition.  Combine this with the fact that often the larvae stages come in nests where you could catch many at a time (much easier than chasing flys!).</p>
<p>So yes you could likely get the caloric content required to keep you alive for a fairly long time from insects provided there was a large accessible source of them. </p>
<p>You can survive off just raw meat for potentially your entire life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on which insects you are eating. Quite a few cultures rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomophagy" target="_blank">insects</a> as a primary food source. But, most insects don’t really have a lot of fats in them and while you can process protein into energy it takes more micronutrients from your body to process than fats or carbohydrates.  Unless you also include vegetation or other fat sources you will end up starving to death no matter how many insects you eat due to a phenomenon called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_poisoning" target="_blank">protein poisoning</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
