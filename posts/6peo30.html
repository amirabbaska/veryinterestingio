		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Take a flat microwave cavity and solve the (electromagnetic) Helmholtz equations. Once you are below a critical frequency, they behave like a two-dimensional system. So your EM field now behaves like a 2-d entity.</p>
<p>Take this a step further: &quot;The formal similarity between the stationary Schrodinger and Helmholtz equations, the latter considered for frequencies f below a critical frequency f_c where the electrical field distribution depends only on the planar variables x and y, renders such experiments suitable for the study of quantum phenomena. The height d of the microwave cavity in the z direction is bounded by d &lt; c/2f_c.&quot; (Taken from <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.69.1296" target="_blank">Graf et al, PRL 69 (1992) 1296</a>)</p>
<p>This means you can use a flat microwave cavity as an analogue computer for a quantum system governed by the equivalent Schroedinger equation - as the authors have done. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this happens all the time for electrons if they are in a confining potential along some axis such that their wavefunction becomes quantized along that direction:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:InfiniteSquareWellAnimation.gif" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:InfiniteSquareWellAnimation.gif</a></p>
<p>If say the average electron has the amount of energy corresponding to state C there and the average fluctuation in energy is much less than the difference in energy between D and C then that degree of freedom becomes &quot;frozen out&quot;, as its motion in that direction is fixed and trapped at C and the electron exists as a reduced dimensional creature.  If you only confine along one direction you create a Quantum Well (electron sees a 2D universe):</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_well" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_well</a></p>
<p>An example here is the billions of transistors that are the basis of the computer you're using right now.  Charge passes through those transistors as if it exists in a 2D world, it's called a 2D electron gas (or 2DEG):</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_electron_gas" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_electron_gas</a></p>
<p>If you confine  along two directions (electron sees a 1D universe) you get a nanowire;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanowire" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanowire</a></p>
<p>And if you confine in all directions you get a zero dimensional structure (0D universse) which is called a quantum dot:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot</a></p>
<p>Dimensional confinement also happens to other things other than electrons, for example in magnetic excitations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking about this the other day but from a slightly different perspective that I would love some insight on. </p>
<p>Would it be possible to have particles that interact in 4 or higher spatial dimensions and have them cross the 3D &quot;plane&quot; of our existence? Wouldn't there just be the briefest of moments that they would even exist in our reality (as they pass through it)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One question I've been wondering about for a while that's kind of related, is that since the fractions in some thermodynamics formulas come from the degrees of freedom of motion of gas molecules, and since 3 of those degrees of freedom come from the fact that we live in a 3D universe, can you practically restrict the motion of a gas in one or more spatial dimensions to change properties of the gas like its specific heat capacity? Or would it be impossible to contain a gas in such a tight cavity without impacting the other translational degrees of freedom as well?</p>
<p>Edit: I missed /u/cantgetno197 pointing out this can happen with electrons in a conductor (not sure if my specific heat question is as relevant there). Can it happen with a regular gas as well?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
