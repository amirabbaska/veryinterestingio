		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The moon has a stronger pull on objects close to it and a weaker pull on objects farther from it.</p>
<ul>
<li>The water between the earth and moon is closest to the moon</li>
<li>The Earth's body is at a moderate distance from the moon</li>
<li>And the water on the opposite side is farthest from the moon.</li>
</ul>
<p>The moon pulls these three parts at different strengths and cause them to separate from each other.</p>
<p>The moon pulls the body of water close to it, causing high tide where the moon is. The moon also pulls the earth toward it, but not as much. And since the earth is being pulled towards the moon, it leaves behind a body of water on the opposite side where the moons pull is weakest.</p>
<p>So there is a high tide on the area close to the moon and another high tide on the opposite side of the earth. As the moon orbits the earth we experience these two high tides.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Help me improve this answer by discussing below and upvoting good explanations! There are a few issues with this answer and there are several excellent details in the comments below that I'd like to give visibility to</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a good illustration of this explanation?</li>
<li>What about moon phases? is there a difference in tide height when there's a full moon vs a new moon? (hint: Syzygy)</li>
<li>Is the moon being pulled by the earth? Or is the earth being pulled by the moon? Upvote the best explanation below.</li>
<li>The two high tides on each end of the earth are not the same height - why?</li>
<li>There are some areas where the tides barely rise and fall. What are these areas and why? (hint: tilt, geography)</li>
<li>Other than water, are there other stuff that is affected by the moon's gravity? (hint: fluids other than water)</li>
<li>Sometimes there's only one high tide in a day - why?</li>
<li>If tides are caused by gravity, what about other stuff that has gravity? Do they affect the tides at all?</li>
<li>My answer implies that the earth is moving towards the moon which is not the case. Can someone help me clarify this?</li>
</ul>
<p>Comment your clarification and additional information below and upvote those that you like! Have a nice day everyone!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a large part about the tidal bulge that isn't being discussed, here.  It is <em>not</em> simply that the side of the of the Earth facing the moon experiences more gravity and the side furthest experiences less.  If it were, tidal forces would be able to lift any arbitrary object the 0.6 meters or so that we see waters rise or fall.  Similarly, we don't see tides in rivers or lakes, so it's not just gravity at work.  </p>
<p>Gravity, itself, is not that strong.  If you work the math, the presence of the moon has a virtually unmeasurable contribution to the local gravity on Earth.</p>
<p>That said, that virtually unmeasurable change in gravity adds up to create a gradient of water pressure that's lowest on the sides facing and opposing the moon's position and highest on the sides orthogonal to the moon's position.  In order to balance that change in pressure, the higher-pressure water sinks and the lower-pressure water rises until the forces acting on the water as a whole are in equilibrium--kind of like a tube manometer, but on a planetary scale.</p>
<p>Addendum: Hydrostatic forces being at the core of the tides also explains why you don't see tides in cups of coffee, rivers, or lakes.  At small scales, the variation in gravity and hydrostatic pressure are too small to notice; I think even Lake Superior's tides would be measured in millimeters at best.  It takes having a body of water that encompasses the planet itself (as the oceans do) to make that variation noticeable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just skip all of the comments that mention centrifugal force: they are not correct.</p>
<p>I have to leave for work, so I'll have to add more later, but even if the Earth and moon were not orbiting each other (they could be moving in any fashion whatsoever), there would still be 2 tidal bulges on either side of the Earth (and moon, for that matter).  </p>
<p>Tides are a purely gravitational effect: a relative stretching across an object, due to the differential of gravitational force caused as the strength of gravity falls off with increasing distance.</p>
<p>EDIT: At work and trying to answer when it's slow.</p>
<p>First: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3AMerging_galaxies_NGC_4676_%28captured_by_the_Hubble_Space_Telescope%29.jpg" target="_blank">visual</a>.</p>
<p>The bright smudges are two galaxies which are in the early stages of a galaxy collision and merger.  Between them, a bridge of stars is forming, as each galaxy gravitationally rips stars off of the nearby edge of the other galaxy.  On the outer edges of each galaxy, there are streamers of stars ( called tidal tails) that look like they're being ejected <em>away</em> from the centers of the galaxies, as well.  This is what tidal forces look like on large scales.</p>
<p>The galaxies used to look like this (&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; for the centers, &quot;s&quot; for stars at the edges):</p>
<p>sssAsss   ..........    sssBsss</p>
<p>Now, they look like this:</p>
<p>s s s A s s s  s s s B s s s</p>
<p>The strength of gravity weakens with distance, so stars on the near edge of galaxy B are accelerated towards galaxy A more than the center of galaxy B is accelerated towards galaxy A.  The near-side stars, then, are pulled away from the center of the galaxy.</p>
<p>This is also true for the center of the galaxy and the stars on the <em>far</em> side, but in reverse.  The center of galaxy B is accelerated towards galaxy A more than the stars on the <em>far</em> side of galaxy B are accelerated towards galaxy A.  The center of galaxy B, then, is pulled away from the stars on the far edge of galaxy B.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the center of galaxy B, then, it looks like the stars on either side are being pushed <em>away</em> from you in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Tides in the Earth-moon system work the same way.  In this case, though, it's the water on the surface of the Earth that's being pushed away from the center of the Earth (the moon is also stretched into a slight potato-shape because of this effect).  </p>
<p>The easiest way to see why the centrifugal-force explanation doesn't work is to notice that the sun contributes to the tidal forces the Earth feels as well.  When the sun and moon are aligned with the Earth ( new moon and full moon) their effect add, and we experience <em>spring tides</em>.  These tidal forces are the same, whether it's new moon:</p>
<p>S-M-E</p>
<p>or full moon:</p>
<p>S-E-M</p>
<p>For the new moon configuration, the centrifugal-force thing kinda works: the bulge on the near side of the Earth is a result of the addition of the gravity of the Earth and moon (they're on the same side).  The far-side bulge is similarly the result of the addition of the centrifugal forces from the earth-moon and earth-sun orbits.  </p>
<p>Nothing obviously wrong so far, but this reasoning falls apart when you look at the full moon configuration, when the sun and moon are on opposite sides of the Earth.  Now, the centrifugal-force contributions from the Earth-sun and Earth-moon orbits are pointing in <em>opposite</em> directions, partially cancelling each other out.  You would predict that tides would be much <em>lower</em> in the S-E-M configuration than the S-M-E configuration, but that's not what we observe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To grossly oversimplify, one tide is caused by the gravity of the Moon, the other is caused by the centrifugal force of Earth orbiting the shared centre of gravity of the Earth-Moon system. </p>
<p>Both are delayed from when you'd expect them to happen by the friction with the bottom of the ocean. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
