		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to link you to a fun video on why 'why' questions are difficult in science, and the unfortunate thing with science, and it's similar in deductive fields like math, is the answer to every why question is going to open a whole bunch of other why questions for you. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjmtJpzoW0o" target="_blank">Here's Feynman's, maybe a bit pedantic, view on the matter.</a></p>
<p>For the speed of light, we originally ran into it studying electricity and magnetism (the speed of light, not light itself). The (classical) picture we have for electricity and magnetism is a bit dry, it's described by 4 differential equations (known as Maxwell's equations). Two of them desribe electricity and magnetism as seperate entitites, and the other two describe the interaction between the electric and magnetic fields, along with an electric current. These equations have two fixed constants called the 'permittivity of free space' (or 'electric constant', call it e_0) and the 'permeability of free space' (or 'magnetic constant', call it m_0). It so happens that in a vaccuum we can combine these equations and simplify so that all we are solving for is a wave, that is the electric and magnetic field are each described as a wave propogating through space. And we find that the square of the velocity of that wave is inversely proportional to the product of those two parameters. So the sort of unsatisfactory answer is that the speed of light is exactly what it is because 1/sqrt(e_0*m_0) is what it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But it makes just as much sense to &quot;set c to 1&quot; and then everything else is recalculated based on that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the question really is, can the speed of light be anything other than what it is?  If not why?  The fact is that until we observe another universe where the speed of light is different, we can't answer this question or the same question for any fundamental constants.  This is why I find the whole idea of a finely tuned universe so silly.  We like to say that if one constant was just a little bit different, then life couldn't arise.  But we have absolutely no reason to believe that any of the universal constants can possibly be anything other than what they are.  Unless we are able to someday observe a universe where they are different, there is no reason to believe they can be different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light is what it is because it is the measure of a fundamental property of our universe. </p>
<p>Maybe the easiest way to think about it is not as a speed,  but rather the amount of time in a given unit of space-time.  </p>
<p>Another way of saying this would be to say that it is the distance between two points divided by the minimum amount of time that separates those two points in spacetime. </p>
<p>So,  186,000 miles of space also &quot;contains&quot; 1 second of time....(roughly). So,  while it is possible to traverse more than a second of time while crossing that distance,  it is not possible to traverse that space without also traversing at least one second of time.  (that doesn't mean that you will experience a second though,  just that you will have traversed it) </p>
<p>This can be helpful in  understanding relativity,  because light (traveling at C)  &quot;experiences&quot; no time in transit,  no matter how far it is going. One way to think of this is that light is travelling at infinite speed,  but still has to traverse time as it moves through spacetime,  because space and time are both just
part of spacetime. </p>
<p>Does that help? </p>
<p>Edit: to clarify,  this is a semantic simplification,  as space does not &quot;contain&quot; time,  and time does not &quot;contain&quot; space.  </p>
<p>&quot;Spacetime&quot; is the word commonly used to express the unified whole of space and time as a single construct,  and so &quot;contains&quot;  both space and time. </p>
<p>Also,  added quotes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
