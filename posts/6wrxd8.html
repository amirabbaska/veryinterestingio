		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really big question that gets very complicated and political.  </p>
<p>Basically, it had to take any number of complicated corporate systems with all fine print, discern what was needed and important, then translate that into a unified marketplace.  It also had to do it perfectly, because any misinformation meant the federal government helped a corporation kill grandma because she didn't know her heart pills weren't covered.  </p>
<p>Insurance companies are betting you $/yr that you'll spend less than that on healthcare this year.  They profit by winning enough bets over a given populace. To help their odds, they will pre-negotiate lower medical costs with larger medical groups and put in exceptions like &quot;We don't cover elective surgeries&quot;, then get shitty with the definition of &quot;elective&quot; in the fine print.  Shit like &quot;That cancer surgery is &quot;elective&quot; because you haven't tried drug therapy yet&quot;.  </p>
<p>Healthcare.gov needed to read ALL of that fine print, for every level of every policy, filter out the ones that don't 100% meet the 15,000 pages of ACA standards and then post the differences using less than a tweet's worth of characters.  All of this needs to be back checked with teams of lawyers to make sure it's presented in a way that a reasonable person can make an educated choice.  </p>
<p>Then there's the technical side.  The website had to plug into at every participating insurance provider's unique and universally terrible corporate sales databases, transmitting application and payment information perfectly, and again making sure there's no fine-print switcheroos for every policy.  Think of the worst corporate management software you've ever seen.  Then consider a the slickest and most user friendly.  You get to write software that works with ALL OF THEM.  Each interface is it's own special shit-snowflake that you get to automate.  For every policy. For every company.  </p>
<p>Oh, and every state has their own branch of the company, and set of state standards, so your fix for Aetna New Jersey isn't going to work for Aetna Missouri, because that has to flow through Mo.Gov's shit website too AND Aetna MO's database didn't get the update yet so they're still using the system from 2003 which is totally different anyway.  So now your shit-snowflake work just went up by a factor of 50.  Also, not everyone speaks english so everything for all policies, fine print, marketplace summaries, and user interfaces has to be accurately translated into a couple dozen languages.  Don't fuck that up or you're killing grandma again.  </p>
<p>While the backend guys are designing a shit-snowflake shoveler, another team has to program a web interface that grandma can use.  See, for the first time EVERYONE was REQUIRED to have health insurance.  That includes your grandmother who browses family photos by dragging them into word documents because it's the only way she knows how.  It also includes the homeless guy who literally cannot read and was genuinely unaware that computers could be used for anything other than porn.  Your interface needs to be so simple that they can figure it out on their own.  </p>
<p>Oh, and since it's collecting SSN's, addresses, and health histories, it all needs to be super secure and require a secure username/password when logging in.  If you're in the identity stealing business, it's goddamn christmas morning in there.  So the site needs to be easy enough to access that illiterate grandma can get in, but also hard enough that 1337HackerBoi69 can't.  </p>
<p>Then it also needs to be ruggedized against political enemies that want the site to fail.  Obama's been telling everyone Sept. 29th is opening day, so how bad would it suck if the site was hit by a DDOS for the first week? Oh, and any fuckup from the aforementioned issues before will
definitely be blown way out of proportion, so build some lawsuit budgets into any work you do building the site.  </p>
<p>And all of this needs to be done ideally within a year or two, because we've got a political schedule to keep.  Oh, also, Aetna MO finally got their system updated to the 2009 version so the plugins you hacked together for them stopped working and need to be rebuilt.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was not part of this specific disaster, but have been involved in other multi-billion dollar non-profit/government entity IT projects.   I have also been involved in many successful projects, so have seen the glaring difference.   The lifecycle of the non-profit project has been as follows;  </p>
<ul>
<li>Management are given low budget, and hire in high paid high skilled consultants.   Work is scoped out, and above average pricing provided (driving work to high priced firm).  In this case, could have been given a $50 million budget, and then consulting firm says they could do it for $80 million.   </li>
<li>Managers then have cheaper firms, especially large offshore types come in and undercut.   They say they could get it done for $10 million, and win the project.   </li>
<li>The firm who underbid, don't have any experience in this type of project, so spin their wheels for 6-12 months, achieving very little.  </li>
<li>More underbidding firms get parts of the project, to help speed things up.  As the baseline has been set for very low cost resources, the only firms bidding are more offshore type firms.  </li>
<li>The multiple firms start competing with each other for each part of the project, bring in more and more resources.  </li>
<li>A small number of highly skilled independents by the this stage are likely doing most of the work.  The offshore firms are spending all their time on presentations to management on why their firm should see increased scope.  </li>
<li>Management sees their $50 million budget has evaporated, and they have nothing to show for it yet.  To save face, they make a great case on why budget needs to increase.  Each firm helps management make the case.  </li>
<li>Now 12 months in, prototypes are produced, which look nothing like what requirements set out.   Turns out lowest salaried grads hired offshore (to maximize firm profit), are not as familiar with new healthcare law as firms had promised.   </li>
<li>Initial firms start to be phased out due to non performance, and new offshore firms start to come in and take scope.   New firms are at same price point or lower, and many of the same offshore resources shift to new firm (since they already have ACA experience).  </li>
<li>Eventually after many iterations, prototypes start looking closer to what is needed, but are as buggy as all heck.   No one realized all the great grads offshore went to work for tech companies at multiples the income.   </li>
<li>Government managers by this stage are so deep, that they are committed to following through on solution.   They have become experts at asking for more money in the budget.    </li>
<li>A few years after it was due, a solution is eventually produced.   Original firm that could have provided it for $80 million are working for private firms.  A strong team of independents who came from $80 million firm could have done it for $20 million.  </li>
<li>Project is declared a success.  Budget issues are swept under rug.  </li>
<li>Firm quietly hires a local firm or independents to correct issues left in original solution.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of the major factors that I'm aware of:</p>
<p>1) Changing Requirements: In the time between the announcement of the ACA, the signing of contracts for website development, and the actual roll-out of the website the law went through several policy iterations, which requires redevelopment of aspects of the website related to those policies. So if you design the website for policy A, but policy B is actually enacted, you have to changed everything related to policy A. Those could be significant impact changes.</p>
<p>2) Lack of Oversight: The program was managed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which does not typically handle large-scale, customer-facing government IT projects. </p>
<p>3) Scope Creep: I don't know about this project specifically, but one of the major problems with government projects is scope creep. The government lays out requirements that usually range between &quot;way too much for what we actually need&quot; and &quot;everything we could think of related to this project.&quot; So the cost is already elevated above what a private program like this would run. Then you add the contractors coming in and saying &quot;but you didn't think of X, Y, and Z&quot; and the government says &quot;you're right, we definitely need that too!&quot;</p>
<p>4) Government Regulations: Not saying this as a political statement, but being a government contractor means dealing with government regulations. Many times these regulations become very expensive, as opposed to developing things in the private sector. This leaves some of the best programmers on the sidelines, since they are working in the Silicon Valley sphere, not the Contracting sphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In any huge IT project, government or corporate, there are typically hundreds (if not 1000's) of people who can add complexity to a project (Janice in Accounting says it needs to do &quot;X&quot;) but very few who can remove it (VP Bob says &quot;no, it really doesn't need X&quot;)</p>
<p>That means over time the scope of the project grows enormously.  There is a term for this &quot;scope creep&quot; that people in IT are very familiar with.</p>
<p>A lot of these additional requirements come in after the project has already started, which means that changes impact multiple teams of people working on multiple parts of the project.  Something as simple as adding a new field to capture &quot;mother's maiden name&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have to change the UI layer</li>
<li>you have to change the database</li>
<li>you have to change the validation that tests for required fields</li>
<li>you have to change the data layer that talks to the UI and database</li>
<li>all of the db maint scripts have to be updated</li>
<li>all of the test scripts have to be updated</li>
<li>all of the translations for different languages have to be updated</li>
<li>reports have to be updated</li>
</ul>
<p>So one little change may impact 8+ teams.  Multiply that by 10,000 - and keep in mind that some changes are much more significant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
