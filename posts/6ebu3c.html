		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am Linguist and Cognitive Scientist, Japanese is my best second language and I'm a member of the Unicode Consortium to boot.</p>
<p>TL;DR: No, it doesn't help. Language is different than reading/writing.</p>
<p>I think the biggest misapprehension---and it's a very common, forgivable one---is your question conflates language with reading/writing. They are <em>related</em> to each other, obviously, but cognitively, they are dramatically radically different skills. Learning to read/write has a lot more in common with learning to drive than it does with learning language. For one thing, it's &quot;optional&quot; in the sense that you could choose not to learn to read/write. It takes time and effort and instruction to learn. Language existed for probably 100,000 years before we invented writing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, any unimpaired child in a community <em>will</em> learn to speak the language of the community they are in. It requires no particular effort, no specific instruction, only exposure and it is inevitable. There have been and there continue to exist languages without writing systems; there are no writing systems that are not attached to a spoken language.</p>
<p>So in that sense, the nature and structure of the writing system is pretty arbitrary. That's not to say that there isn't a relationship in which the writing system influences the language---it certainly does in a number of ways. But that influence is not inherently different from the myriad other cultural influences that impact language evolution (like politics or technological advancement).</p>
<p>If English was written using a logographic writing system it wouldn't prepare me to learn Chinese any more than English being written in the Latin alphabet prepares has prepared me to learn Swahili.</p>
<p>So what if you rephrased the question: do Emoji help prime us to learn how to write using a logographic writing system? The answer is still &quot;no&quot;, I'm afraid. And for mostly the same reasons that have already been mentioned. The relationship between the pictographic origins of Chinese characters and their meanings have largely eroded away and what remains is a fundamentally arbitrary association of character and sound.</p>
<p>It may seem like there's a lot more upfront rote memorization to learn Chinese characters---and that may be arguable---but the time and effort it takes to become a skilled reader of the writing system is not very different. A skilled reader of a language written in alphabetic system doesn't read each letter; they recognize the form of the entire word. So in that sense it isn't really that different.</p>
<p>Writing on the other hand... well that's another misapprehension we commonly have---that reading and writing are the same fundamental skill. They are not (although they are, again, related obviously). The advantage of an alphabetic system is that <em>writing</em> is significantly easier. If you know the word and the alphabet you can write it. If you don't know the Chinese character for a word, you're kind of hooped (although chances are you'd still be able to get your meaning across between context and other characters with the same pronunciation). Of course this applies best to truly alphabetic systems of which English is a <em>very</em> poor example.</p>
<p>The Japanese are famous for having an incredibly high literacy rate; what they don't tell you is that it is for <em>reading</em>. Not writing. It's weird for us to think of those things as so different, but, literally---and I have done it---you can flash a less common character at a Japanese person and they'd be able to tell you what it is, how to pronounce it, name compounds it's in... they <em>know</em> the character. Ask them to write if? They'd be completely incapable of doing so without looking at the character for reference.</p>
<p>It is a fundamental fact of human cognition that production is a different and harder skill than recognition.</p>
<p>What you <em>can</em> say is that knowing how to write Japanese would help prepare you to read/write Chinese because, even though they are unrelated languages, the Japanese borrowed the writing system from the Chinese. So the base character sets are similar (although in PRC the character sets are reduced and &quot;simplified&quot;) and their meanings will still be somewhat similar.</p>
<p>But Emoji... sorry. They are pretty interesting in their own right tho.</p>
<p>Also, bit of trivia in case you don't know: Emoji is a Japanese word borrowed into English that was originally a blend of the English word &quot;emotion&quot; and the Japanese word 字 (ji) &quot;character&quot; or &quot;letter&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea that Chinese or other similar characters are pictorial is off. There are some historical connections to actual pictures, some of which feel very dubious and retrofitted, some of which are plausible. But for the majority of characters you soon realize they are built of subcomponents next to each other. As such you have a word being a bunch of basically arbitrary symbols arranged spacially next to each other, which is the same thing we have in (our Western) phonetic alphabets.</p>
<p>So no. Emojis have zero impact on anyone's ability to learn non-phonetic writing systems. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't really think that's the case.  I speak English and Japanese(Spanish also but not as well), I love emojis in the Japanese language, but I find them completely different in English.  We create very different emojis for one thing.. :) brand is highly popular in English, they become so much more complex easily in Japanese however.. they're just standard selection for complex emojis on Japanese phones.  In America, rather than showing the displays, we've moved towards replacing certain smiley types into actual small icon displays.. My favourite to tack onto any conversation is usually either ^^ or ^^;; ... yet I have plenty of conversations with people in English that can't even recognize those as faces at all, and they ask what they mean.  Furthermore, I know a bunch of people that have tried to learn Japanese or even other languages, and not truly been able to succeed.  </p>
<p>This doesn't mean that emojis have no impact on the way we communicate, and it even seems likely that language could plausibly evolve in a more emoji based way... but I would call it relatively separate from current day pictorial languages.. for example, even the simple ones like :) aren't actually written, we're changing to typed languages, and further representations that are too complex to draw easily anyway.<br />
Just for fun, I decided to write this post in Japanese too.
楽しみのために、このポーストを日本語でも書きます！
確かに面白い概念なんですけれども、そうではないと思っています。英語、日本語、スペイン語も話せるんですかが。。。日本語の絵文字と英語の絵文字はまた全く違うと思います。例えば英語だと「:)」をよく使うが日本語ではありません。日本である経験では、携帯を使うことでは簡単に複雑な絵文字を見つけれます。。。(<em>^_^</em>)(=^▽^=)
英語を話しても、私のよく使う絵文字は「＾＾」と「＾＾；；」です。でもこの絵文字を英語で使うと、よく「そのものは何の意味がありますか？」とよく聞かれます。さらに、友達の中で、たくさん「日本語を習いたいなぁ」「他の言語を習いたいなぁ」と思っている人はいるけど、たくさんはしない・できない。
それでも、絵文字は言語と話の言い方を影響しないということではないと思います。それより、絵文字のおかげで、言語の進化になる可能性が高そうです。でも、最近の絵文字をあまり書かないので、今はタイピングすることに変わっているし、絵文字を書かないし、多分この進化はまた他の複雑ものだと思っています。</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This kind of makes it sound like the east is full with several of these systems. Afaik syllabic/logographic writing is only used in parts of China, Taiwan and parts of Japan. Also afaik these systems all derive from the Han-letters. So these days there are traditional Han-letters, Han-letters with a japanese touch, simplified Han-letters and weird Han-letters in some Chinese provinces where people decided to spice it up. The majority of Asian people use alphabetic/abjad/abugida systems though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
