<p>Eventually the faster cars will weave through and &quot;escape&quot; until they hit the next pack, but there's always another slow-car-slowly-passing-even-slower-car up ahead to cause another group.</p>
<p>The cars in a group do not stay together long, it's a transient phenomenon that forms and dissolves when cars with different speeds meet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The interesting thing about traffic is that it obeys many of the rules of fluid dynamics, behaving like a liquid in a confined space. </p>
<p>This works because cars, like water molecules, don't compress. Traffic on a highway behaves a lot like water in a pipe. Not all traffic moves at the same rate, but when faster moving traffic encounters slower moving traffic, it has to slow down because 2 cars can't be in the same space at the same time. When the car ahead accelerates or moves out of the way, it takes time for the cars behind to take advantage of it and cars farther away take even longer, so the change in speed appears to move like a wave on the ocean, starting at the front, and working its way backwards. </p>
<p>This delay in passing acts a little like a standing wave and it lasts until either all the cars move at the same speed, or move far enough away from each other not to impede each other. </p>
<p>Now say that pockets like that are spread out on an otherwise empty highway, and some person in a sports car wants to get out from behind them so they can drive as fast as they want. They too have to slow down, temporarily joining the pack of cars, adding to it's size, until they can get out from behind it and drive on. But then they run into another pack of slower cars, and the process repeats. </p>
<p>So even cars that don't want to drive together, find themselves driving together because of physics. </p>
<p>That's true for all drivers. There are some drivers though that seek groups of cars on purpose. Either for safety, on a long desert road a breakdown by yourself can be dangerous, but if you have company... Or in order to drive faster than the speed limit and hope that the other cars either see the troopers first, or get pulled over instead of them. That is a flocking behavior that prey species use to protect against predators.</p>
<p>So in a way some of it is the physics of liquids, and some of it is the behavioral survival strategies of antelope on an African Savannah. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because very few people follow the rule Slower Traffic Keep Right (or Left if you drive on the left in your country).</p>
<p>When slower traffic is in all lanes, it creates barriers to faster traffic. Imagine a three-lane road with three slow cars traveling the same slow speed side by side. Nobody can get around, so traffic backs up behind them. The slow drivers in the front almost always seem to be completely oblivious to this and refuse to change speed or move over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are scientifically inclined, it might interest you to know that there are papers written in physics journals on the origin of traffic patterns. One set of mathematical models shows that cars in traffic behave in some ways like ice crystals melting into liquids at their surface, with the water molecules jumping off in clumps. These models are used by highway traffic control designers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
