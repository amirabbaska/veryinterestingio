		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you are smelling is acetone.  Your brain is the one organ in your body that cannot use fat as an energy source.  When you are eating regularly, your body can maintain the sugar glucose at a high enough level in your blood to provide plenty of energy for your brain.  During short times of fasting, such as when you are sleeping, your body breaks down stored sugar in the form of glycogen to provide glucose for the brain.</p>
<p>When you undergo prolonged fasting, however, your body runs out of glycogen, and your blood sugar drops.  In order to continue providing energy for the brain, your liver converts fat into molecules known as ketone bodies, which your brain can then use as an alternative energy source.  Acetone is produced by the breakdown of ketone bodies for energy, and that's where the bad smell comes from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2 reasons. </p>
<p>Eating cleans your teeth. I bet that seems weird to think about it but it's true. Eating raw vegetables works best, but even chewing mashed potatoes grinds against the teeth and dislodges plaque and other food. We tend to eat pretty regularly so unless you've gone a long period without food, you can't really appreciate how much eating keeps your mouth clean. </p>
<p>If you restrict your calorie intake or don't eat for a long time your body may switch to a ketogenic metabolism which burns your fat stores but also creates ketone bodies in your blood. The blood circulates through your lungs and takes on oxygen, and dumps carbon dioxide, and also dumps ketones which are aromatic and smell a little like acetone or paint thinner. This is the slightly sick, slightly sweet smell of carnivore breath. </p>
<p>source - I've gone 2 weeks without eating before and I had to brush my teeth 5 times a day or I'd get a carpet of crud on my teeth.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As well as the reasons that /u/ChuffChuffs and /u/kodack10 mentioned, the stages before eating food, thinking about it, smelling it, seeing it, cooking it etc all trigger your parasympathetic nervous system to produce and secrete more saliva into your mouth. This is further increased while actually eating. This means that your mouth will have much more saliva in it right after eating, and saliva has microbial properties that will kill some of the odor producing bacteria, particularly on the back of your tongue. This is why brushing the back of your tongue is recommended to help with bad breath.</p>
<p>If you haven't eaten for a long time, or have spent a long time breathing through your mouth (exercise, after sleeping especially in people who snore, chronic mouth-breathers), the air dries out the saliva in your mouth, so more bacteria, so more bad smells. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Halitosis: Causes of Bad Breath</strong></p>
<p>1.Skipping meals: Believe it or not, skipping a meal can make your breath smell bad. According to the American Dental Association, dieters can develop halitosis if they don't eat often enough. To avoid it, try to eat regular meals at least three to four hours apart.</p>
<p>2.Illness: Take the Colgate Fresh Breath Assessment and you'll learn that your breath is the gateway to your overall health. Conditions such as gum disease, diabetes and even a sinus infection are associated with bad breath. If one of the common remedies for bad breath doesn't clear up your condition, be sure to talk to your doctor or dentist.</p>
<p>3.Not Brushing Enough: How often do you brush during the day? If you're not brushing at least twice daily for 120 seconds per session, you could be at risk for bad breath. Be sure to brush your tongue, as well. Your tongue harbors just as many odors as the food caught between your teeth!</p>
<p>4.Brushing at the Wrong Time: Most of us brush in the morning. But if you brush before you eat breakfast, the food you eat at your morning meal can get lodged between teeth. This food collects bacteria and becomes one of the most common halitosis causes.</p>
<p>5.Potent Foods: Garlic is delicious on your pizza, but it's downright unpleasant on your breath. If you have an occasion where you need your breath to smell especially fresh, skip potent foods such as onions, garlic and even coffee or alcohol.</p>
<p>6.Dry Mouth: Certain medical treatments and medications can cause your mouth to become dry from lack of saliva also known as xerostomia. Saliva is responsible for clearing away odor-causing cells inside your mouth. If you don't make enough saliva, the cells can stay inside your mouth and cause bad breath.</p>
<p>7.Tobacco Products: There are dozens of reasons to stop smoking or chewing tobacco and bad breath is one of them. Smokers and chewers often suffer from a residual tobacco smell on their breath and a build up of bacteria inside the mouth that can cause odor.</p>
<p>With a little bit of care and attention to your daily routine, you can keep your breath fresh and your smile inviting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
