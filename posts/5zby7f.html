		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not. In fact, it is the most dangerous meal of the day. </p>
<p>Professor Terence Kealey's book Breakfast is a Dangerous Meal highlights the many ways in which it is dangerous. To ELY5:</p>
<p>Because of evolution, humans did not naturally eat in the morning. As a result, our body provides a spike in blood sugar to cope with the natural fast we have. So if we eat breakfast (which in our society is usually full of carbs (i.e. sugar) and other foods of low nutritional value) then our blood sugar levels rocket up, which also increases our insulin resistance, eventually leading to type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, eating breakfast increases our hunger throughout the day (contrary to prevailing wisdom) and makes it more likely for us to eat more calories throughout the whole day. </p>
<p>As other commentators have stated, many of the studies which try to prove that breakfast is good for us are flawed for two reasons: Firstly, they are nearly always funded by Kelloggs or similar, and secondly, they are based on correlation and not causation. This is because <strong>it is true that, generally speaking, people who eat breakfast are also more healthy than those who do not.</strong> However, this is because people who eat breakfast come from a higher socioeconomic profile than those who don't, and so generally do what they are told when it comes to health and nutrition - such as eat their 5 fruit and veg a day, do lots of exercise, etc., and to eat breakfast. They are therefore healthier in spite of the fact they eat breakfast, and not because of it. This then allows the studies funded by Kelloggs and other food companies to say &quot;Hey look! People who eat breakfast are  less obese!&quot; Which then in turn allows bad news publications to say &quot;Hey look! People who eat breakfast are less likely to be obese!&quot; Which is a lie. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not, the slogan, &quot;Breakfast is the most important meal of the day,&quot; was invented in the mid 19th century by Seventh Day Adventists James Caleb Jackson and John Harvey Kellogg to sell their newly invented breakfast cereal food stuffs. Yes, <em>that</em> Kellogg. Then the bacon market jumped on that bandwagon, got 5,000 doctors to sign off on the health benefits of eating protein in the morning, and got news papers to publish the signatories as though it were scientific research.</p>
<p>It was all founded on bullshit. It was a weird time, where people were moving into factories and people were getting all up about indigestion. Kellogg was also weird about the morality of breakfast and thought bland food would curb masturbation. If you look into this period, it gets weirder than that. I blame all the lead and mercury in the water. That shit makes you dumb and <em>fucking crazy</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>Verdict: At the end of the day, whether or not you eat breakfast should be based on your preferences and personal goals. Feel free to experiment to see if you want to make skipping breakfast a habit.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has done intermittent fasting (stopping eating at 8PM, not eating until 12:00 noon the next day) for the past 6 years, I can tell you :  IT'S NOT the most important meal of the day, not for me at least.  </p>
<p>Your body is amazing.  It can adjust to almost any regimen you throw at it.  When I started I.F., it took a bit of time to adjust, but once I did adjust, it was absolutely dead-simple to do it. My body didn't even want food during the &quot;off&quot; 16 hours of the day.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't always. Find what works for you. </p>
<p>I find that I do better personally skipping breakfast, having lunch as my first meal of the day between 11a-1p, having a small snack sometime between 2-4p, and then having dinner 6-8p.</p>
<p>I find that if I eat a meal at 7-8a before work, I get ravenously hungry 2 hours later, whereas I don't get hungry before lunch if I skip breakfast. I believe this is because the 'getting hungry' response that occurs after eating dinner occurs while I am asleep, which means it has curbed itself by the time I wake up. Eating breakfast just re-initiates that hunger because breakfast usually isn't a thousand calorie meal so you get hungry relatively quickly... and then if the solution is adding a thousand calorie meal to my diet to solve a problem that is alleviated by not eating the meal altogether, I don't see how that makes any sense.</p>
<p>Performance-wise I don't notice much difference for skipping breakfast, but I do drink black coffee every morning as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
