		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taking Human Origins right now and we cover quite a bit about bipedalism as that's a defining hominid characteristic, and also related to your question. </p>
<p>The answer provided to us undergraduates (re: there's probably a much better, more in-depth answer hiding in a journal article somewhere) is that the arch acts a spring for balancing and propulsion. If we carried our full weight on a completely flat foot, we wouldn't have the same forward-momentum and bipedal pattern that we currently have today. </p>
<p>Also, modern humans have something called the bicondylar angle with our legs and hips. As we evolved as obligate bipeds, our pelvises changed to become wider (supporting upright weight) and our bottom halves evolved as well. The bicondylar angle basically means that our legs come in from the hips at a V-angle, so that our feet are directly under us when we walk. (PS, this angle is evolutionary but also acquired -- so someone today who has lost function of their legs early on would not have the angle!). This is now my own speculation as we didn't cover this but I think that having flat feet along with the angle would lead to a loss of balance and we wouldn't be able to walk the way we do or as well as we do.</p>
<p>FINALLY -- Laetoli Footprints found in Tanzania show that A. afarensis (perceived human ancestor) was walking upright but patterns show that weight is not distributed on the foot the same way we do. Their bicondylar angle also isn't as pronounced as in modern humans so I think that it's all related!!! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The entire purpose of the arch is to act as a spring to help absorb the impact from walking. Walking puts a ton of stress on your bones and if you run, it's worse. Imagine driving a car without it's springs. Every bump would be slamming into the frame basically. Eventually, you'll wear things out much faster.</p>
<p>Also, it may help store up a little energy in your step and 'spring' you forward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To everybody telling OP that their &quot;flat feet suck&quot; and hurt, etc. I don't think you get what he/she means. The question is if our feet were designed to not HAVE arches, wouldn't it be better - not do failed arches feel better than normal arches.</p>
<p>So we can't really answer with our experiences, cause all of our feet &quot;should&quot; have arches that work. The best person to answer OP's question would be an expert on feet/orthopedics, not our uncle Marv with the bad arches.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you wanted to build a bridge where the strain on the bridge would be on all points equally. How would you build it, as an arch or a straight line? That's your feet. The ground is rarely a straight line, it's usually a bridge from one point to the other (even if the points are extremely close to each other), and the best way to distribute the strain is an arch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We humans are top-heavy and we like to move a lot. And gravity is trying to pull us to the ground all the time. And the world is a bumpy place. And we do a lot of walking — (average is 3,000 steps a day). So imagine the kind of beating your feet take every day! The force of 3,000 steps can add up to hundreds of tons – that’s like a fully loaded cement truck. How do your feet handle it?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They have a built-in cooling system. All that running around gets them pretty hot! But your feet have 250,000 sweat glands, which is way more than any other part of your body! That makes a cup of perspiration a day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each foot is a complex machine that self-adjusts in response to uneven terrain. Theyare able to do this because together they have one-quarter of all your bones, sinews and muscles: each foot has 26 bones, 33 joints, more than 100 muscles, tendons &amp; ligaments and 7,800 nerves. All of those tiny parts allow your feet to change shape depending on the surface, like grass, sand or rocks.</p>
</li>
<li><em>Now to the arch</em>. That &quot;arch&quot; is actually made of <strong>three</strong> (some say five) interconnected arches. They work together in the most optimal design to give your body the maximum possible shock absorption while you walk and run. This explains why the flat-footed all say what they say here. Without arches, feet take a tremendous beating.</li>
</ol>
<p>BTW, what about the toes? Do you really need these funny knobs sticking out of your feet to walk? Just ask someone who’s missing one or more toes — sure they can walk, but toes make it about a thousand times easier to balance, especially when running.</p>
<p>(Now, with such amazing, self-adjusting, shock-absorbing balancing machines to stand on, do we really need shoes? People who go barefoot develop tough soles and strong foot muscles. Bad shoes can ruin the springiness of your arches. And for those who do have good arches, some expensive running shoes actually lead to more foot, ankle and knee injuries than going barefoot.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
