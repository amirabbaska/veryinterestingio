		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><p>The kibble dogs eat supposedly contain everything a dog needs to survive and be healthy. Why isn't there a human version of this concept? Eating can be such a chore sometimes, as well as worrying about the health consequences of eating the wrong stuff. Some days I wish I could just fill up the tank. <br><br><br>EDIT:  Well it has been an informative evening.  It seems the elusive superfood that tastes good and provides everything the body needs, doesn't exist.  Shakes and nutrition drinks come close but miss out on the satisfying factor.  Runners-up include MREs, nutrient enriched pizzas, and potatos.  A startup in California has an interesting new food they call the Burweedo which looks very promising.  <br><br>It seems humans are a bit more complicated then dogs, and dog food isn't all that healthy to begin with.   <br></p></div>
