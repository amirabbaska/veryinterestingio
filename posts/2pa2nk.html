		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The kibble dogs eat supposedly contain everything a dog needs to survive and be healthy. Why isn't there a human version of this concept? Eating can be such a chore sometimes, as well as worrying about the health consequences of eating the wrong stuff. Some days I wish I could just fill up the tank. </p>
<p>EDIT:  Well it has been an informative evening.  It seems the elusive superfood that tastes good and provides everything the body needs, doesn't exist.  Shakes and nutrition drinks come close but miss out on the satisfying factor.  Runners-up include MREs, nutrient enriched pizzas, and potatos.  A startup in California has an interesting new food they call the Burweedo which looks very promising.  </p>
<p>It seems humans are a bit more complicated then dogs, and dog food isn't all that healthy to begin with.   </p></div></div>

The only real problem with them is that humans really like eating and eating things of varying taste and texture, which means it's likely never going to be a very popular thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would,  in fact,  be pretty trivial to do this for humans,  but note that there is no evidence to support the idea that kibble is an ideal food for dogs.   There are plenty of maladies that we consider &quot;normal&quot;  for dogs that may or may not be something that a better more varied diet might help.  I've heard plenty of (anecdotal)  evidence from pet owners who switch to rmb or a raw food diet for their pets that are noteworthy in that way.  </p>
