<p>Much of the thousands of tons of debris resulting from the collapse of the Twin Towers was pulverized concrete, which is known to cause silicosis upon inhalation. The remainder consisted of more than 2,500 contaminants, more specifically: 50% non-fibrous material and construction debris; 40% glass and other fibers; 9.2% cellulose; and 0.8% of the extremely toxic carcinogen asbestos, as well as detectable amounts of lead and mercury.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While being inside a skyscraper is generally safe, when much of the internals and externals of the building get pulverized, it isn't exactly safe to breath. There's a LOT of things that cause cancer, and at ground zero there were easily hundreds (if not thousands) just floating around in the air. But it probably wasn't just the carcinogenic agents that directly led to cancer. It could have been the stress, other chemicals that affected the immune system, or they could have simply been prone to cancer by genetics (but being at ground zero certainly didn't help). In reality, the cleanup should have been done in hazmat gear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>WTC was build with literal metric tons of asbestos that got pulverized and released when it collapsed.</p>
<p>All of NY is facing increased risk of cancer now because that shit is basicaly everywhere. The asbestos fibers are so small they get into your lungs and the repeated poking at the tissue will result in inflamation.<br />
This inflammation causes the elevated cancer risk.</p>
<p>Asbestos today is basicaly forbidden, but a lot of people are pushing against that. The new stuff is treated to avoid small fibers getting lose, but its still mistrusted. Rightfully I'd say.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
