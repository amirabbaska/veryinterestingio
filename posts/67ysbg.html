		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they do. To reiterate a few other comments, there's a part of the brain called the fusiform face area (FFA) that becomes more active when we're viewing a face. </p>
<p><a href="http://vpnl.stanford.edu/documents/golaraigrill-spectorgabrieliTICS2008.pdf" target="_blank">Here's a review article</a> about how this part of the brain changes as we grow up. It's from 2008, which is relatively early days of studying the development of FFA, so the findings that it reports on are a little mixed, but the general result is that the face-specificity of the FFA emerges as we grow up. In other words, that region of brain starts off not so good at distinguishing between faces and objects, but with age (and experience) comes to only activate when viewing faces.</p>
<p><a href="http://vpnl.stanford.edu/papers/GolaraiCerebCortex2015.pdf" target="_blank">This paper</a> had 7 to 11 year-olds and adults look at faces of kids and adults while undergoing fMRI scanning. They found a portion of adult brains around the right FFA that processed kid and adult faces differently, whereas that same region in kid brains processed kid and adult faces similarly. This doesn't exactly answer your question, but it does at least suggest that age and experience change how our brains process faces. </p>
<p>If you're interested in finding out more, I pulled these papers from <a href="http://vpnl.stanford.edu/publications.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Kalanit Grill-Spector's lab at Stanford</a>. She's a face-processing expert, and one of the few who is also doing brain imaging work with children.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, various aspects of face processing do change. Face recognition memory declines with age, but more so for images of young faces than old faces (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBF03193209?LI=true" target="_blank">Lamont, Stewart-Williams, and Podd 2005</a>; see also <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Bartlett2/publication/226844067_Familiarity_and_recognition_of_faces_in_old_age/links/555a3cd808ae6fd2d8281feb.pdf" target="_blank">Bartlett and Fulton 1991</a> &lt;- pdf!; <a href="https://academic.oup.com/geronj/article-abstract/47/3/P138/556573/Changes-in-Facial-Recognition-Memory-Across-the" target="_blank">Crook and Larabee 1992</a>). These effects may partially be perceptual in nature (<a href="http://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2176330" target="_blank">Oswley, Sekuler, and Boldt 1981</a>). </p>
<p>Certain specific emotions (fear, anger, and sadness) become more difficult to recognize (<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.902.7019&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">Calder et al. 2003</a> &lt;- pdf!) and they show a bias for remembering faces showing positive vs. negative emotions (<a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8n37k31f" target="_blank">Mather and Carstensen 2003</a>; <a href="http://204.14.132.173/pubs/journals/releases/xge-1322310.pdf" target="_blank">Charles, Mather, and Carlstensen 2003</a> &lt;- pdf!). For a review (and some hypotheses about neural mechanisms), see <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vicki_Livingstone/publication/5576023_A_meta-analytic_review_of_emotion_recognition_and_aging_Implications_for_neuropsychological_models_of_aging/links/00b4952b35e62797e6000000.pdf" target="_blank">Ruffman et al. 2008</a> (&lt;- pdf!). <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1bj2m61c" target="_blank">Mather et al. 2004</a> argue that these differences are due to reduced amygdala activation to negative faces in older adults. </p>
<p><a href="http://search.proquest.com/openview/813c2a05cff1ebeaea970780849c4072/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=47265" target="_blank">Here</a> is a PET study on differences in face processing between younger and older adults, but I can't find a non-paywalled version and I don't think it's ultimately very informative -- more prefrontal activity in older adults, but it's not clear what that means necessarily. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Assaf_Harel/publication/26322646_Aging_effects_on_early-stage_face_perception_An_ERP_study/links/02bfe5142203472e48000000/Aging-effects-on-early-stage-face-perception-An-ERP-study.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> (&lt;- pdf!) is another study which found no differences in early ERP signatures of face processing between younger and older adults. A more interesting study found that in older adults areas of the brain which normally show high selectivity for faces in younger individuals are less selective, but they may recruit other compensatory cortical networks to help them recognize faces (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yunjo_Lee/publication/50938259_Face_Processing_Changes_in_Normal_Aging_Revealed_by_fMRI_Adaptation/links/00b7d5241b9dc0746d000000/Face-Processing-Changes-in-Normal-Aging-Revealed-by-fMRI-Adaptation.pdf" target="_blank">Lee et al. 2011</a> &lt;- pdf!); see also <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811910001461" target="_blank">Gao, Suzuki, and Park 2010</a>). For a review of the neuroscience of aging, see <a href="http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v13/n7/abs/nrn3256.html" target="_blank">Grady 2012</a>. </p>
<p>tl;dr there is a reduction in face recognition memory, facial emotion recognition, and other face processing tasks as we age; these changes may be due to reduction of neural response specificity to various stimuli (&quot;dedifferentiation&quot;), but these may be offset by some compensatory cortical reorganization.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
