		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically speaking, fighting isn't allowed in pro hockey, there are rules against it and players who engage in a fight are assigned penalties.</p>
<p>There's kind of an unspoken code among hockey players though that dictates when it's appropriate to pick a fight with someone. Generally fighters (or enforcers or goons as they're sometimes called) only fight other fighters. Both players need to consent to the fight, either verbally or by physically fighting back and the fight stops when one player falls to the ice. You don't often see a skilled goal scorer getting into fights, but there are a few who'll drop the gloves if they need to.</p>
<p>An enforcer will usually start a fight with an opposing player if they've done something nasty to one of their teammates like lay on a dirty hit that might have injured them. The referees can't catch everything that happens on the ice and losing your star player for a couple of weeks to an injury is far worse than taking a 5 minute penalty for beating a guy up. It also sends the message that if you want to play rough with our best players, you have to pay the price.</p>
<p>Since fights are for the most part consensual and players assume a certain amount of risk when playing hockey it's very, very rare that any kind of criminal charges get laid against fighters. The only times that it's happened are in cases when one player sucker punches another or decides to use their stick as a weapon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fighting is allowed because most of the injuries aren't too severe, and it's become part of the sport. When two players go at it, the sticks get tossed away (so no one is assaulting anyone with a blunt weapon) the gloves come off (so when they punch each other in the face they feel it just as much in their knuckles as the opponent does in the face) and the skates stay on the ice (so no one is getting a skate stabbed into their femoral artery). Balancing on skates while fighting, there is an upper limit to just how hard you can punch a guy without risking a spill yourself, and while there are a number of very dramatic looking injuries (like the occasional tooth getting knocked out, or split brows bringing that bright red blood splatter on the ice) it's rare that someone is in real peril from a fight; for instance (per wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ice_hockey_players_who_died_during_their_playing_career" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ice_hockey_players_who_died_during_their_playing_career</a>) during the period of 2000-2009, only one guy died as a result of a hockey fight, and that was because he fell over and hit his head on the ice, while more guys died from medical complications during training. </p>
<p>The fights are not &quot;planned&quot; in a wrestling sense, nor are they just for show. No one is sitting with a clipboard and a radio telling the players when they're scheduled to have a punch-out. Fistfighting serves as a form of deterrence against opposition actions that are either frowned upon but not strictly against the rules, or against fowl play that is pulled off while the refs are looking elsewhere. Say for instance someone decides to use their stick to trip an opponent; even if the ref misses it, the other team knows damn well what they did, and he's going to be in less of a hurry to repeat that stunt if he knows that one or more guys on the team (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcer_(ice_hockey" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcer_(ice_hockey</a>)) are ready to eat the penalty time in order to retaliate. </p>
<p>As far as the risk/reward ratio, the risk is that one of your players ends up in a penalty box or with an injury that requires medical attention, versus the reward that the other team isn't going to screw with your players (especially important players) unless they're ready to taste some blood in exchange.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a hockey fights nerd, and ex hockey player (not NHL) who played the enforcer role (in the 80's)...</p>
<p>Hockey is different today. Intimidation was a huge part of the game (less and less so since the mid to late 90's, and probably even before that).</p>
<p>Take 2 teams:</p>
<p>Team A is significantly more skilled/talented.
More often than not they are going to beat Team B...</p>
<p>Team B knows they are significantly less skilled...</p>
<p>They have little chance of winning if it's just based on skill. However Team B realizes that Team A with its skilled players (skill players are normally smaller) can be intimidated (or let's say they hope they can be intimidated) to the point where their skill advantage is nullified.</p>
<p>Team A will employ players to protect their skilled players.
Team B will employ players to attempt to intimidate them.
It becomes an arms race of sorts. </p>
<p>Fighting is less and less relevant in today's game.
It probably serves little purpose except for allowing players to unleash some frustration without swinging a hockey stick at someone's head.</p>
<p>Now it's more tradition; the day is coming when it's eliminated but I don't think anyone in a position to make that change wants to do so because there will be severe backlash from a significant segment of NHL fans.</p>
<p>I'm not sure where I stand. I think it's time for it to go, but a part of me hates myself for saying that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This might be buried but let me try to shed some light with a counter example. Late 90s I'm watching playoff football, I can't remember the teams but I want to say Pittsburgh and San Diego? Anyway, one team had an amazing running back, foundation of the offense and every time he had a run the other team was going after his legs; twisting, falling on his ankles, shitty stuff. The refs were calling it though and by halftime they (the team attacking dudes legs) were losing and the announcers were all over the penalty yards stat: &quot;200yds in penalties! (or whatever it was) that's not how you win at football!&quot; So about a third of the way through the third the RB in question goes down to a leg injury and the team becomes one dimensional on offense. Other team just Ts off on the blitz. 3 and out. 3 and out. 3 and out. &quot;Dirty&quot; team goes on to win. Penalties don't mean shit if you can get the best player off the field.
Good luck with that shit in hockey.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's important to distinguish between &quot;allowed&quot; and &quot;managed&quot;. The officials don't interfere until someone falls. Otherwise they'd be getting between two giant, strong men who are swinging at each other. </p>
<p>After it's broken up, penalties are assigned. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
