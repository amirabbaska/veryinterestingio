They're all around you, right now, passing effortlessly through your body.</p>
<p>They're fundamental particles, so they aren't made of anything smaller (by our current understanding), so &quot;what&quot; they are isn't possible to explain other than telling you how they behave.  They just <em>are</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neutrinos, they are very small.<br />
They have no charge and have no mass<br />
And do not interact at all.<br />
The earth is just a silly ball<br />
To them, through which they simply pass,<br />
Like dustmaids down a drafty hall<br />
Or photons through a sheet of glass.<br />
They snub the most exquisite gas,<br />
Ignore the most substantial wall,<br />
Cold-shoulder steel and sounding brass,<br />
Insult the stallion in his stall,<br />
And, scorning barriers of class,<br />
Infiltrate you and me! Like tall<br />
And painless guillotines, they fall<br />
Down through our heads into the grass.<br />
At night, they enter at Nepal<br />
And pierce the lover and his lass<br />
From underneath the bed – you call<br />
It wonderful; I call it crass.</p>
<p> -- John Updike</p>
<p>It's not entirely accurate, since they do have a small mass (which wasn't known when Updike wrote the poem), they do have weak-force charge (and gravitational charge, and Higgs charge), and they do interact a bit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<hr />
<p>A neutrino is what's left over when a neutron splits into a proton and an electron. This process is called &quot;beta decay.&quot; </p>
<p>A neutrino has no electrical charge and only interacts with other particles via the weak nuclear force. (This can be seen by observing that before the beta decay we just had a neutron with zero charge, while afterwards the electron and a proton charges cancel out, so by conservation of charge, a neutrino must have zero charge so that net charge remains zero.) This means it almost always passes through normal matter like a ghost! Billions of neutrinos pass through your eyeball each second, but not one will interact with even one atom of your retina in your lifetime!</p>
<p>A neutrino has almost no mass and for a long time was thought to be massless. We now believe it has a mass about one-millionth that of an electron, or in other words, one-billionth of a proton or neutron.</p>
<p>(A neutrino, like protons, electrons, and neutrons, has a &quot;one-half spin.&quot; Such particles are called &quot;fermions&quot; and this means they always have a small amount of angular momentum and can't overlap.)</p>
<p>Most neutrinos can be found zipping along at just under the speed of light. (When a neutron splits into a proton and an electron, there is some left over energy. Because of a combination of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum, each particular gets a fair share of that left over energy as kinetic energy. Because the neutrinos mass is very low, it has to go very fast to pick up its fair share of kinetic energy.)</p>
<p>Most of the neutrinos passing through the Earth come from our own sun. But some are relic neutrinos left over from the big bang, or created in distant supernovas!</p>
<p>Scientists theorized that neutrinos <em>must</em> exist decades before they were able to to detect them. When a beta decay event occurred, they could see the electron and proton shooting off in opposite directions. But this appeared to violate the conservation of energy! So they made up a third particle, neutrino. Later they would prove this was the right explanation. </p>
<p>Today scientists are able to directly detect neutrinos, but only by using <em>giant</em> sensor arrays. They bury their neutrino detectors deep underground or under the south pole so they don't get confused by light or other particles. </p>
<p>When scientists first built these detectors, they observed that they were counting less than half the number of expected number of neutrinos from the sun. Observing differences between experiments and theories is the first step in the scientific method. As they studied the problem, scientists learned that neutrinos come in three kinds, and that as they fly through space, they change from one kind to another, and that some kinds are easier to detect than others. The scientists realized that by the time the neutrinos from the sun reached Earth, some of them hard already changed into different types that were harder to detect. This is also how we first learned that neutrinos really do have mass! By working hard to make sure their theories agreed with observed data from experiments, scientists were able to understand neutrinos even better. That how the scientific method leads to an increase of understanding over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A neutrino is part of the remainder of the transition between proton+electron and neutron. If a neutron sits in near empty space long enough it will split into proton electron neutrino and other energy, but I dont know if the total energy is positive or negative since it may be that only happens when enough energy hits it at once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
