They explain that uranium decays to lead. We know the half life of lead. So if we measure the amount of lead and the amount of uranium, we can do some maths to find the age of a sample. </p>
<p>So far so good. But then they say that the original readings for lead were too high. But how could they know that? </p>
<p>Wouldn't the high readings for lead just mean that the age calculated would appear to be much higher? </p>
<p>How do we know the acceptable range for the values for lead? Any help would be gratefully received.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's back off a bit and start from the beginning.</p>
<p>U-Pb geochronology works by using crystals of very resilient U-bearing minerals; the mainstay of this method is zircon, but some other minerals such as baddleyite may also be used.
What is measured is not merely the amount of lead; the amounts of U and Th must also be known, but the key measurements are all about the <strong>kinds</strong> of lead, which isotopes are present and in what ratios. ^^238 U decays to ^^206 Pb and ^^235 U decays to ^^207 Pb, and the decay constants are known for these reactions ... ^^204 Pb, or &quot;common lead&quot; is not the product of radioactive decay. So … when we carry out the measuring, we really focus on the ratio of isotopes which may be measured to a degree of precision which astounds me to this day.</p>
<p>If I may use an analogy, let suppose you have a hamster (work with me here) … it produces small standard pellets of poop at a known rate. You could count the pellets when you change its cage and figure out if (for instance) someone did or didn’t change the litter in your absence, and when. U-Pb dating is a bit like that: you know the residual amount of uranium and thorium, you know the ratio of uranogenic to thorogenic lead, you know the decay constants and you know the crystal didn’t leak lead (cause zircons are tough little crystals). So ... you can backcalculate the amounts to find the time required for the all of the observed decay products to form, which gives you the age at which the crystal was sealed. </p>
<p>Now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the original readings for lead were too high</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn’t see that episode, so I’m not sure of the context in which this observation was made. For one thing I’m not sure if they are talking of the total amount of lead or just of the radiogenic isotopes ...  more important I have no iedea what kind of material they are discussing … zircons, something else, and in what setting. If they are talking of the total lead, well it goes without saying that any ^^204 Pb in there must also be taken into account, so that has to be substracted from the total lead expected exclusively from decay. or they could just have been explaining the ins and out of the method, and stating that the observed amounts of radiogenic lead were much higher than those observed in nature, and work from there to detailing how the method works from the decay constants and the U and Th decay series.</p>
