		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work doing simulations of re-entering spacecraft. We found that the most common things to survive were the bulky metallic parts of the craft - fuel tanks and batteries being the most common items recovered on the ground. They didn't look good, of course, but they were tough enough not to melt (through heat capacity and high melting points) during the quite short period of re-entry where the heat is the most intense. </p>
<p>However, we also found on the far side of the scale that very lightweight MLI - the gold &quot;wrapping paper&quot; on the outside of satellites used for thermal insulation - also survived. This happened if it ripped off the satellite when the atmosphere thickened enough for the breakup to start. If it didn't rip away, and was pulled down by the heavier structure, it would vapourise easily. But things that got free very quickly slowed and cooled, and made it to the ground. A feather would have a lower melting point, but it would also not have (I presume!) a heavy satellite structure attached to it increasing its ballistic coefficient. I would be very surprised it didn't survive.</p>
<p>Similarly, spiders and insects would have no problem with re-entry (other glacial cold, lack of pressure and radiation damage from being in space and the sea they'd likely land in). I wonder if something bigger, like a mouse, could too?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably not: </p>
<p>Since the feather has such a low mass and such a high Cx/drag coefficient, it would pretty much always have the terminal velocity associated to its current air density (dependant of altitude). </p>
<p>When a bigger craft enters the atmosphere, it plunges faster into higher density regions of the atmosphere so that the terminal velocity will almost always be smaller than the actual velocity, resulting in massive friction and heat production. I guess you could calculate terminal velocity and compare it to readily available re-entry data on the internet, but I'm too lazy for that right now.</p>
<p>But a big part of &quot;burning during re-entry&quot; also results from the weak heat exchange that low density air is capable of. That means the aircraft will heat up more and more without sufficient air mass flowing past it to get rid of this heat. So I don't really know how the link between terminal velocity &lt;-&gt; current velocity &lt;-&gt; produced heat due to friction is decribed correctly, but somehow all these variables probably are important for the question at hand. However, when only looking at feathers, I think my the first paragraph is still correct. ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The trajectory and speeds the feather would experience can be encapsulated roughly in what's called the ballistic coefficient, beta=mass/(dragCoeff*dragArea). Rather than calculating this from its components, consider that terminal velocity is equal to sqrt(2*g*beta/rhoAir), so if terminal velocity for a feather at sea level is 0.5 m/s, then beta would be about (1.225 kg/m\^3)*(0.5 m/s)\^2/(2*(9.8 m/s\^2)) = 0.02 kg/m\^2.</p>
<p>The relationship between beta and heating is not straightforward and is complicated by the fact that atmospheric heating is highly dependent on the object shape, but we can use the radius of curvature of the edges. A feather's various parts have very low radii, which would lead to higher heating. Using a Chapman heating model with a radius of curvature of 1 mm and simulating the above feather from a decaying 300 km orbit gives a peak heat rate of about 2 Watts/cm\^2. A radius of 1 mm is probably high, though. Chapman heat rate is proportional to 1/sqrt(r).</p>
<p>Once you know the heat rate, you have to determine whether that's enough to burn the feather. Sunlight is 0.012 W/cm\^2, and I'm guessing that using a magnifying glass to concentrate sunlight by 2/0.012 = 150 times would burn a feather rather quickly.</p>
<p>Yes, I think it would burn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how &quot;high&quot; it started from...i.e., what its initial downward velocity is when it finally reaches terminal velocity.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting question, and when I find time I will run some calculations.</p>
<p>For argument, we should assume that the feather has no lateral velocity relative to earth's atmosphere. </p>
<p>People here have suggested that due to its weight and dimensions it will always be at terminal velocity.  I'm not convinced.  Again, if it started at 1000 miles up, it would undergo an unrestrained acceleration (maybe 9 m/s2?...just totally guessing...it would be close to earth normal g but lower).</p>
<p>That builds up.  The outer atmosphere is so rare that it may not provide enough air resistance to prevent it from burning up before going terminal velocity.  The feather could still burn in <em>very</em> rarefied air if it is moving fast enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
