		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day--maybe pre-1990s?--year-round fresh (not frozen, not concentrate) OJ was not as common and was more expensive. Then, some great new process was devised and it became more common and cheaper. With the new process, it's squeezed, then stored in vats for months at a time. This process caused it to lose flavor. So flavor is added before it is sold. Different brands have slightly different flavor processes so taste different. And these have a different flavor and consistency than genuine fresh-squeezed OJ. Go get some genuine fresh squeezed from Whole Foods or similar and you'll taste the difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OJ is deoxygenated to prevent spoilage. That causes flavor loss. Companies create ^artificial natural flavor packs from &quot;Orange essence and oils&quot; to reflavor the OJ. Every company uses different blends.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are dozens of types of oranges: navels, tangelos, tangerines, temples, mercots, hamlins, valencias, parson brown, etc.</p>
<p>Just like apples, every different type of orange looks and tastes a bit different.   Some are better for eating fresh and some are better for juice.  Some are very popular, some are not as popular, and some are cheap since there is a huge supply and some are expensive.   Some are grown in Florida, some in California, and some in Brazil.    </p>
<p>So every manufacturer sources their oranges from a different place and of course that makes them taste a bit different.   And as other posters mentioned, December is the main time for oranges to be harvested, with some a bit before that to a bit after that.  </p>
<p>Freezes can damage or reduce the crop forcing juice manufacturers to change the mix of oranges they use.   Since we need orange juice year round, some manufactures put the juice in giant oxygen-free holding tanks at 33 degrees and keep it there for up to six months.  This damages the taste so they add in &quot;flavor packs&quot; which are also made from orange oils (which I think is somehow distilled out of the orange peels, but I'm not really sure).</p>
<p>So you can see, there are hundreds of variables which go into how orange juice tastes, and the big companies spend tons of money making sure that their juice tastes the same no matter what time of year it is, or what materials they have to make it with.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
