		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the peak of his career, Babe Ruth (highest paid at the time) made $80,000 a year in the 1930s which is equivalent to a little over $1 million in today's dollars. Today the highest paid baseball players make $30 million+ a year.</p>
<p>In 1937, the highest paid actor was Gary Cooper and he made $370,000 which is equivalent to about $6 million today. In 2016, Dwayne Johnson was the highest paid actor making $65 million in one year.</p>
<p>This is while the average salary (adjusted for inflation)for traditional jobs hasn't risen much in the same time frame.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The salaries of celebrities (be it an athlete, actor, musician, etc) have outpaced those of traditional workers/employees precisely because celebrities aren't traditional workers. Celebrities attract unique attention, and that attention can be leveraged and monetized. And over time, celebrities have gotten better at leveraging that attention, and brands/companies have gotten better at profiting from it. It has, in other words, to do mainly with visibility. </p>
<p>Someone who is 'traditionally' employed by a company gets paid relative to the role they occupy, to what they're tasked with. An athlete might be hired and paid in a similar fashion, in theory, but the key difference is that their role, and what they're tasked with by default has an <em>audience</em>. This makes them more valuable, in a number of ways. Put simply, celebrities exhibit desirable talents and traits in a very visible way. Because these talents and traits are desirable, and often idealized, what celebrities commonly do plays upon emotions. </p>
<p>Musicians and actors give a voice to what people are feeling, or wish they could themselves say, or how they wish they could look or behave. Athletes exercise physical and mental acuity in sports, pull off great feats, etc. And because sports have over time become popular to the point that they're tied to people's identities and dreams, they likewise act as an example of who people wish they could be. TV personalities and models and whoever else also offer a fantasy or a target for people's aspirations - how they want to look, how they want to behave, how they want to be seen, how they want to live. And on a lighter note, all of these people offer entertainment and even distraction.</p>
<p>So you might see how this can all be monetized. What marketing does is play into people's emotions - &quot;Buy (x) to be more attractive,&quot; &quot;Buy (y) to be faster&quot;. And to attach a product which plays upon these desires to a person who epitomizes them? Doubly powerful. As for more traditional jobs, no one is idolizing a lawyer sitting in their office working on a brief. No one (or not many) people are going to want the clothes <em>that lawyer</em> is wearing, or go see a movie that lawyer is in, were they somehow, for some reason, hired for a role in a movie.  </p>
<p>What's interesting about today's world, though, is that we're basically seeing experiments in this. In today's world, a lawyer can start a youtube channel. A teacher can have an instagram. They can find the people who might in fact idolize them, want to be like them, live like them. I think that's great. Maybe they won't be handed a $30-mil a year contract, but they can certainly find ways to make money. There are people in all walks of life and professions making a pretty penny by way of the platforms out there, and the attention they can net. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Increasingly, salaries are tied to how replaceable we are rather than anything about how hard our job is or how much work is involved. Cleaners work very hard and long hours, but you can get someone else in to take over a job immediately with little training if someone quits, so they are paid crap money. Doctors/nurses/teachers are always in high supply because they are jobs that people want to do regardless of the pay, so they don't get paid much either. </p>
<p>Celebrities that bring in lots of money for companies because of who they are as individuals are quite hard to replace. If you don't pay Dwayne Johnson enough to do the job you can't get another Dwayne Johnson. With movies, particularly, up until around the 60s (not exactly sure) there used to be a studio system where an actor/musician/director/writer etc. would sign a contract with the movie studio and they couldn't do a film for another studio until their contract was up or the studio allowed it - it's a bit like comic book movie franchises at the moment. Because actors were contractually tied to studios they couldn't demand ridiculous salaries or threaten not to make the movie, and when there are only a handful of studios the bidding wars can't really get that high when contract renewals come around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The correct price for any product or service is the highest price the market will bear. Econ 101.</p>
<p>As actors/athletes/anyone stipulate that they are worth $X, and a studio/team/employer pays that, then that's the going rate.</p>
<p>If the movie is a runaway blockbuster, or the team wins the championship, that contract is likely to be renewed or extended. The price goes up.</p>
<p>If the movie flops, the player tanks, or (more often) the latest/greatest star/player is coming up and will work/play for less, out with the old, in with the new.</p>
<p>In the movie and sports business, the &quot;market&quot; is inflated relative to Joe Schmoe, but as long as the studio/team is making money, the price will be paid. And the staying power of a few &quot;stars&quot; (Alex Rodriguez, Jennifer Aniston) that exceed the standard curve are not indicative of the more &quot;rank and file&quot; members of the group. They are &quot;sure bets&quot; and are worth a premium. Look at the average career of an MLB/NFL/NBA/etc player, or how many &quot;huge&quot; roles an &quot;average&quot; actor had. Those &quot;careers&quot; are short, perhaps sweet.</p>
<p>The &quot;A-list&quot; is incredibly small, even compared to the  small group of people that make it to the mainstream level. They are paid well above a &quot;market&quot; rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The TOP salaries may have outpaced other salaries, but most musicians aren't Beyoncé and most actors aren't Dwayne Johnson. The vast majority of working actors and working musicians lead lifestyles from poor to middle class. </p>
<p>There are Tony-winning actresses who instagram their temp job applications. There are a lot of important music artists who can barely pay for their records. Some of the top jazz and classical musicians in the world especially support themselves with teaching work. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
