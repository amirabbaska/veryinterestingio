As well as a small set of women with an extra cone in their eyes allowing them to see more colors. Smell and touch may have some outliers as well. And many contend there are more than 5 senses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What does perfect pitch mean?</p>
<p>It means, that the person can name the frequency on the <strong>absolute</strong> scale (via a tone name, e.g. A, c''-flat) vs. on a relative scale (do-mi).</p>
<p>In that sense, we all have &quot;perfect pitch&quot; vision: our resolution of hues would be different, but we all sense the actual frequency repeatedly. You don't perceive &quot;this colour is to blue, as yellow is to green&quot;, but you perceive &quot;this is green&quot;. And the next time it's green to you again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perfect pitch is basically the ability to memorize pitches and their associated names (A, F#, ECT).  You can train yourself to at least relative pitch (memorizing one pitch and adjusting to the interval that you hear to figure the pitch out), but it does take work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Did a bit of google-fu and I found an article about people with great facial recognition and did a test put up by the University of Greenwhich.</p>
<p>Did the test and scored 12/14 and was told I could be a 'super recogniser'.</p>
