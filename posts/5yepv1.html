		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I still remember when I was a kid in Russia and this day was crazy serious. Women would literally get pulled over by the police to be given a rose. Everyone had to drive with their lights on like it was the first day of school (before it became mandatory nationwide to drive like that). I had to call all my relatives that were female and congratulate them and wish them good health etc. I brought in chocolate for my female teacher. Many men went all out for this. Really the whole society went out, at least in the city I grew up in. When I moved to the US, no one celebrated and no ever really heard of it until the last few years. No one still celebrates it, more of a social media blitz and that's it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in Russia. Not only it was/is a public holiday, it is one of the big ones. The message is completely different though. Instead of gender equality they celebrate women as delicate good looking creatures, emphasizing their weakness (the beautiful weak gender).</p>
<p>Yes, women are actually called &quot;the weak gender&quot; (слабый пол).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yep. According to Wikipedia, &quot;The United Nations began celebrating in International Women's Day in the International Women's Year, 1975. In 1977, the United Nations General Assembly invited member states to proclaim March 8 as the UN Day for women's rights and world peace.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You probably live in The US where it is mostly not a thing. I also lived a similar amount of time before hearing about it and then only because I had a German roommate who asked me how I was celebrating. I looked at her in great confusion because until a few years after the time of this conversation with the roommate International Women's Day just wasn't ever mentioned in the US. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>International Women's Day is actually originally a Soviet/Eastern European day. It was made to celebrate the equal rights of female workers. It became especially important when on March 8th, 1917, the Russian Revolution first began. This event is the reason the day is now a public and celebrated holiday amongst many post-Soviet countries.</p>
<p>The reason you're only now hearing about this is probably due the significant media attention that this day received this year. The reason you hadn't heard of it until now is the fact that its not really a part of Western culture and it actually finds its root in Eastern Europe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
