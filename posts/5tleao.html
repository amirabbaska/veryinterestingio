		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is some bad science around here.</p>
<p>It's true that waking up in the middle of your sleep cycle will make you feel groggy, but that really isn't the whole story, and as someone has already pointed out, doesn't explain grogginess at the end of the sleep cycle. And it happens every time you are woken up from deep sleep, not just when you've overslept. </p>
<p>What's going on when you oversleep: throwing in an extra sleep cycle or two messes up your circadian rhythm, so your body has to spend a lot of resources trying to sync everything up again. That can make you feel kind of out of sorts or grumpy. There is also evidence that oversleeping messes up hormones and neurotransmitters, which also makes you feel groggy, as they also follow your circadian rhythm and are now out of sorts.</p>
<p>Also: going without food or water for an extra hour doesn't explain what happens. If you are dehydrated to the point of confusion, that is a medical emergency. Humans aren't delicate flowers. There is evidence that not drinking coffee as early as your body expects it can throw you off. It's part of a phenomenon called &quot;weekend headache.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep is a cycle.  If you wake up in the wrong part of the cycle, you will probably be VERY groggy and slow to wake up.  If you're sleeping outside of your normal pattern, your body doesn't know how to plan the cycles.  So you actually wake up more tired than you would have if you had woken up earlier.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, try to plan for ~90 minute intervals for sleep per cycle.  So 7.5 hours of sleep would be more likely to have you waking up at the &quot;right&quot; time.  9 would be good as well.  8.25 is probably gonna leave you groggy, as would 10.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A scientifically semi-rigorous explanation I've heard before - and this is mostly just expanding on what others have said about hormones getting out of sorts - is about cortisol, a hormone that, simply speaking, makes you alert (like adrenaline but it works more slowly). It's released when you experience stress, and consistently high levels of it, i.e. chronic stress, are bad for you. Natural spikes of it are ok, though. Indeed one such spike normally makes you wake up in the morning, after which cortisol levels decrease over the course of the day (with stressful events triggering more spikes).</p>
<p>Now if you sleep through that morning spike, or if you wake up and then go back to sleep, you will naturally have less of this waking-up hormone to help you wake up later. Also explains why chronic stress can mess up your biorhythm, why is difficult to wake up or fall asleep ahead of your usual rhythm, why depressive ruminating makes it harder to go (back) to sleep, and why being startled (say, hearing a loud and/ or worrying noise in the middle of the night) can wake you up fully and quickly, and again make it difficult to go back to sleep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking just deviating from your usual sleeping pattern will cause you to be tired.</p>
<p>I've seen people speaking about intervals and all kinds of timings, but if you're used to sleeping 7 , 8 or 9 hours and you sleep more or less one day, you're gonna feel a bit more tired.</p>
<p>Also, for centuries we've woken up to the sun and went to sleep when it was dark.<br />
So a lot of that went to shit with unnatural lighting.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
