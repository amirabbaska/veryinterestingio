<p>This practice is referred to as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=126932" target="_blank">Serial Monogamy</a>, and is probably more common than true lifetime-monogamy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Humans are monogamous in that same sense, I'd say. It's not a life commitment, like some births that take their life's when their mate dies, for instance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of species are socially monogamous, often just for one breeding season or for a short time, but some species are socially monogamous for life. I can't think of a single species that is 100% genetically monogamous- socially monogamous species cheat on their partners. Some species cheat a lot, some only occasionally, and it can vary within species by population as well. As for 'divorce', look at species that are monogamous for just a single breeding season. You could say they're serial monogamists. Just be careful of drawing conclusions for humans based on general trends in the animal kingdom. Human relationships are based on our cultures much more than they're based on basic biological principles</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most other species have a shorter life span and require less time caring for their young than humans, which accounts for seasonal monogamy.  It is difficult for a species to thrive when one of partners leaves the other with 6 babies who need to be cared for over the next 18 years. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
