		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a skill, let's say standing wasn't a thing that you do normally so you will have to face the same issuesâ€‹ as standing on one leg (different of course).</p>
<p>Quick explanation about how you gain a skill (standing, handatand, riding a bike):</p>
<p>You just need to do it, time after time and each time you are improving your motion and strength your muscles for that position/movement.
And when finally succeeding, unconsciously you work on smoothing it up to use less energy spending for the action - this keep going and going.</p>
<p>There is a lot of info about how the brain really does it if you're interested in that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, more contact point you have spread out, more surface you have for your baricentre to be in. So quadrupeds are more stable and think about a tree feet base for cameras.</p>
<p>But mainly it's practice. You've been standing on two feet for decades, your muscles are used to it and your brain is too, so it can perform all the adjustment needed without you aven noticing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>One foot = two points of contact with the ground.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alot of people are missing the fact that our legs balance our weight on the sides of our core. If you stand on one leg youre putting all your weight on one side, then you need to make the microadjustments in weigh distribution and foot placement to find balance. </p>
<p>Obviously we dont do that alot and its hard, add that to our ears being a big part in balance and it gets tough. Athletes use balance boards and points of reference to train themselves to get a good balance on both and either feet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's just say that you cut a human body vertically into two symmetrical(assuming) pieces and they are placed side to side. Now, what would happen if one of the legs is cut off? The upper part of that side of the body would fall down due to gravity right?  This force was initially supported by that leg which was cut off. The torque due to this force is what causes the imbalance. </p>
<p>Torque is the force that tends to cause rotation or twisting motion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
