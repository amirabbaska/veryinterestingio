		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>White guy living in Japan for over a decade here. If you don’t look Japanese everyone here will assume you are completely ignorant of the culture and language and most indiscretions will be forgiven. Any attempt at anything “Japanese” will generally be met with happiness and cultural pride that you are trying and interested.</p>
<p>The only things you can do off the top of my head to piss people off that you might not know to do or not do: don’t talk on the phone in trains or on busses, stand on the left side of elevators (or the right side in Kyoto/Osaka), let people get off trains before you get on. Maybe more, but that’s all I can think of.</p>
<p>Edit: Whoops! Why did I say elevators?! I meant escalators!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are subtleties of how far and how long you should bow based on your social status in comparison to someone else's but you are wrong that Westerner's should never attempt it. It is generally seen as a very good thing that Westerner's attempt to use proper etiquette and any mistakes are just assumed to be because you are a foreigner. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You bow lower the more &quot;respect&quot; the person deserves. You would bow much lower to your teacher than you would to a fellow student. Consequently your teacher would bow shorter to you than a colleague.</p>
<p>basically a status thing. The lower you bow, the higher above you than they are. But if you are above the other person you still bow, don't just nod your head. That is seen as very disrespectful. Kind of condescending &quot;Here's a token attempt&quot;</p>
<p>Maintaining eye contact shows a bit of distrust &quot;I respect you, but I am not willing to take my eyes off you.&quot; This is why you will see martial artists bow but maintain eye contact. Because technically they are opponents at this moment.</p>
<p>Those are the two I know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If it's in a traditional setting, expect to bow. If it's in a non-traditional formal setting (e.g. business meeting), expect to make a short bow, followed by a handshake.</p>
<p>That's literally all there is to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's wrong, and an American saying it would get a very strange look, but from someone who doesn't understand the language, it's completely acceptable and welcomed because it's shows effort and respect. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
