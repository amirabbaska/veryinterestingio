		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m not a behavioral scientist but did take a animal behavior course when I got my degree so I think I can answer this.</p>
<p>By reasoning I think you mean making decisions. Almost every behavior has an innate and a learned component to it. Even bees have learned components to their behavior when they search for places to make a hive.</p>
<p>Human babies definitely have a lot of innate behaviors or else we wouldn’t know what to give them. If a baby had to learn how to cry this way or that way to get this or that then they would suffer for it. So, certain baby cries in general across all babies mean the same. The frequency of certain cries or tone will change though if it elicits a response from the caretaker that is favorable for the baby.</p>
<p>Now do they have reason? In the sense that they make decisions, yes. It may be basic but their decision making is only rudimentary because at that stage they are just trying to grow. The need to be socialized and learn habits is in no way beneficial to them. They need food, comfort, sleep, and stimulation at that stage.</p>
<p>Not sure if I answered your question but that’s what I got on the subject.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily germane to the discussion, but possibly useful?</p>
<p>One of the &quot;Self Awareness Tests&quot; that is used by scientists is to test if a creature can recognize itself in a mirror. As in, understand that the image in the mirror IS the creature, not another one or one that looks like it.</p>
<p>The usual method is to place a mirror in the creatures environment for some time to allow it to get used to it. Then they subtly place a dot on the creatures head where it would see it in a mirror, taking care not to leave any real sensation (a wet spot for example might draw attention to it). The next time the creature is exposed to the mirror they see if the creature reacts to the dot.</p>
<p>Now, it's not necessarily conclusive when a creature ignores the dot, as it is certainly possible they recognize themselves but either do not or cannot care about the dot.</p>
<p>However, for some creatures such as elephants, dolphins, and certain birds, they usually clearly understand that the dot is on them and take some form of action about it (elephants rub at it, birds will preen, I forget what dolphins do).</p>
<p>Now, as to how this relates to babies, the average human baby does not pass this test until 18 months of age.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first three months of a human baby’s life is basically the fourth trimester. They’re pretty larval. But beyond that, they’re very intelligent. And the intelligence grows exponentially. Well before the end of the first year they’re pretty damn smart- will use objects as tools, push a stool up to something to climb up, etc.</p>
<p>The problem is language. They get frustrated because they can’t communicate in great detail. And we can’t really test reasoning ability before the kid can reliably talk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot depends on where in their developmental cycle they are. A newborn baby isn't going to have nearly the capacity to reason (i.e., likely none at all) versus a 3 to 6 month old.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4215973/" target="_blank">Even 2.5 month old infants can reason about hidden objects</a>, as they offer behavioural cues about their expectations.  For instance, if you hold a ball in your hand, move your hand behind an obstacle, the infant may look to the other side of the obstacle where they expect the ball in your hand to emerge.  This shows the capacity to understand that just because the ball is hidden does not mean it no longer exists, as well as extrapolating motion, and comprehending distance (e.g., occluding obstacles are closer than the object being tracked).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The wording of your question, though I get where you're headed, is a little off for the answer I think you're looking for. Compared to many animals, babies are born very under-developed. A simple example is many animals are able to walk at birth. Newborn babies aren't even aware they have limbs, and they're definitely not able to control them. Babies can't even see past ~10 inches (or ~25 cm). I think it's more accurate to think of babies as reacting to this big new world they were just born into, rather than reason their every move.</p>
<p>Look up baby's month by month progression. There are many sites that explain what's going on with their development!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
