I was just wondering this since my mom keep yelling at me to improve my damn writing but i just can't.
It's annoying as all hell XD</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure I can tell you why, but it is definitely a relatively new thing.   I am doing some work with a historian and she has a giant collection of documents from about 1600 up to the late 1800s all written by men (ship logs,  manifests,  trade and commerce and tax documents,  etc.) and virtually all of it is more legible than anything I see from first year university students.   </p>
<p>That suggests some substantial change in how we teach penmanship which has been bad for men/boys but either beneficial or no change for girls and women.  </p>
<p>The theory that we teach handwriting when girls are developing fine motor skills while boys are still doing gross motor skills makes the most sense.   Most guys I see can write legible math,  numerals (1, 2, 3 etc.) and then math symbols are taught at a different time than cursive writing and reinforced differently, so it may be that time context and reinforcement are big factors and simply moving when joined up writing is taught would fix it.   Though many of my students have told me they didn't learn cursive in school or their younger siblings aren't learning it.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere, that girls tend to achieve fine motor control earlier than boys, so when they hit school age, girls tend to already be quite good with hand eye coordination and the like, while boys still struggle.
Since you don't really practice neat writing after a certain age boys will mostly be stuck with a messy Handwriting.
(Same is true for children with neurodevelopment disorders that delay the development of motorskills)</p>
<p>On the other hand I guess it's also partly because you expect girls to be neater, so they are pushed more towards improving their handwriting.</p>
<p>Edit:
did a Google search on the motor skills development.. tho most non scientific sites agree with me, most research I found doesn't find a statistically significant difference between fine or gross motor skills in preschoolers.
But from what people comment I'd say in personal experience it seems overwhelmingly that girls invest more time in their handwriting in a young age/consciously change their writing style/etc.
Not sure, if its biological or societal.. tho I personally would lean towards the later (girls are pushed towards being neat and liking pretty things, while boys might get teased for valuing &quot;pretty things&quot;. I mean, it might turn them gay, right? ;) )</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about all of you, but this is my story. I grew up in a European country that celebrated achievement, and you were 'cool' If you were achieving academically. Then I come to Australia (where they celebrate being as much of a useless dick as possible in school), and I kid you not one of the first things I remember at school was another student telling me 'wow look at your gay hand writing, you write like a girl'. And that folks is why this poor immigrants hand writing suffered, because apparently in Australia  anyway, the nicer your cursive handwriting is as a dude, the more dick you suck. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see all these comments suggesting biology as the driving cause, but I suspect social pressures are much more relevant. Personally, I was always one of the best artists in my relatively small school, particularly at the young age when we were learning to write. Nevertheless, my handwriting is ugly. That said, I can write neatly if context calls for it, and I suspect that's true for a lot of those with bad handwriting. We can write neatly, we just don't care to and haven't practiced doing so enough to do it expediently.  </p>
<p>I also have some objection to the premise. I graded papers for a class of 500+ for a couple years, and I found that I was not able to reliably guess a students gender based on their handwriting. Roughly 30% of my students were international though, but that just reinforces that any disparity is probably socially driven. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
