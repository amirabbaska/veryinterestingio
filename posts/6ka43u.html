<p>That said, a collision is very unlikely given the size of Earth and the relatively small number of satellites in orbit. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_satellite_collision" target="_blank">It has happened</a>, but it's not like traffic accidents happening everyday. This register is more related to ensuring peaceful uses of outer space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an amusing story in the second volume of <em>Rockets and People</em> - the Soviets were testing their early missiles and would announce the test and the landing area - clearly saying that a certain part of the Pacific would be &quot;dangerous to shipping from <date and time> to <date and time>&quot; due to the falling missile.</p>
<p>Well, the Americans would go in with their ships and as soon as the projectile landed and try and get pieces to study.  They continued doing this over the objections of the Soviets until one day they tested not one missile ... but three, with the second almost hitting the <em>George Arnold</em>.  These weren't full atomic warheads, but they had about 40 kilos of TNT on board to create a boom that could be picked up on sonar by the Soviet tracking vessels to determine exactly where the rocket had landed.  They were also, you know, falling from space so they had a bit of speed to them.  Certainly not something you wanted to land on your ship.  </p>
<p>So even at the height of the Cold War there were efforts to at least keep everyone minimally aware of where everything was, even if you left out the details so as to not give any unneeded information to the Dirty Commies/Capitalist Swine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
