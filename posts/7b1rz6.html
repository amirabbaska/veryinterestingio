		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All food is mixed in your stomach. By the time it reaches your small intestines its almost impossible to tell what is what from all the grinding and mixing in your stomach. The mix is called the chyme and its pushed further down. This takes a few hours so the order in which you eat your food during a sitting doesnt matter for the nutritional value. <a href="http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/stomach/motility.html" target="_blank">http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/stomach/motility.html</a></p>
<p>There are three key hormones that are triggered by the hypothalamus when your bloodsugar is low, and thus makes you feel hungry. Ghrelin, Orexin and Leptin.</p>
<p>Contrary there are four key mechanics that makes you feel full:
Sensory (smell of food, taste, chewing, temperature and texture)
Cognitive (if I eat at the same time everyday, eating habit)* Im trying to keep it simple.
After intake (when my stomach is literally full, when the food reaches the lower intestine the pacreas, the intestine movement and more sends signals, mechanical and chemical both by hormones and by sensoral nerves)
and After absorbation (blood sugar is getting back up, glucose in muscles and more). Cant find any good scourses, Im a public health major. I will show good sources soon.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Sort off. To a degree.
It's more like food combinations effect nutrition.
For example absorption or iron will be impaired if you've recently (as in just before or with your meal) drank tea but will be improved if you've recently drank orange juice (vitamin C is important for iron absorption). Vitamins A, D, E, and K need fat to be absorbed so fat is important in nutrition though it's pretty hard to have a completely fat free diet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, yes it matters. </p>
<p>Most carbohydrates lower stomach acid production, which will effect digestion. So don't eat ice cream before you eat your steak.</p>
<p>A salad with greens/vinegar/olive oil will provide the stomach with ample amounts of hydrogen and chloride (from vinegar and greens, respectively), while the fatty acids from olive oil act as a stimulant of stomach acid production. Fat also stimulates the gallbladder to release bile acid, which will aid digestion in the small intestine. Also people generally eat more salad if they eat it before the main course compared to if they eat during the meal. So if you want to help yourself maximize vegetable intake, eat them before your main course.</p>
<p>If you drink coffee and some teas before eating, it can inhibit non-heme iron absorption. If you consume high calcium foods like milk or cheese before eating meat, it can inhibit heme iron from being absorbed. Many micronutrients have interactions, where prior or concurrent consumption of one micronutrient can inhibit the uptake of another (many minerals share transporters and are co-inhibitory). </p>
<p>There are many more examples that a person can dig up, this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
