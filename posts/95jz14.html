		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: yes, and here's a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/22/health/a-matter-of-taste-i-was-a-middle-aged-anosmic.html" target="_blank">first-hand account</a>.</p>
<p>Long answer: It's tricky to separate taste and smell. The loss of the sense of smell is a condition called anosmia. The loss of the ability to taste without losing the ability to smell is less common. Here are two quotes cited by the <a href="https://www.anosmiafoundation.com/taste.shtml" target="_blank">Anosmia Foundation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>True taste disorders are uncommon. A taste disorder may present as a loss of taste, that is the loss of the ability to detect salt, sweet, sour, and bitter or it may present as an abnormal taste in the mouth such as a bitter taste, an unpleasant taste, or even an electrical sensation. Loss of taste is most commonly caused by an interruption of the nerve to the tongue. This can happen as a result of surgery, tumors, or even dental injections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In truth, the interplay between smell and taste is complicated. I'm not a biologist, so here's someone who can explain it better than me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, arguments about taste and smell are difficult to keep clear unless you upgrade the vocabulary. Start with the ground rule that &quot;taste&quot; will only be used for the five qualities obtainable from the taste receptors of mouth and throat: salt, sweet, bitter, sour, umami. I know of no good evidence for any further taste qualities. All other experiences that one gets from food (or other objects) in the mouth should be referred to as &quot;flavor&quot;. Flavor is regarded as the result of gustatory-olfactory interaction. <strong>Anosmics can taste quite well -- nothing missing there. But they cannot experience flavor.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to go further down the smell/taste rabbit hole, check out this <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/30737/if-you-can%E2%80%99t-smell-can-you-taste" target="_blank">Mental Floss</a> piece.</p>
<p>In addition to developing anosmia gradually over time, roughly 1 out of every 10,000 people is born with congenital anosmia, meaning they never have the ability to smell. According to the <a href="https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/9486/congenital-anosmia" target="_blank">NIH</a>, congenital anosmia can occur in conjunction with other disorders (like  Kallmann syndrome) or on its own.</p>
<p>So to answer your question... yes, 1/10,000 of the population is born without the ability to smell, which means they cannot experience taste in the same way as the rest of us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

One of the side effects that is very common are &quot;taste perversions&quot;.
