		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did a psych paper while an undergrad and was hoping to find the answer there. What I did uncover was that it was actually the reverse around the 1920's but have no clue to  why it changed. </p>
<p>&quot;The definition of masculinity and femininity is inherited by the generation of that time and is manifested by the attire of infants (Maglaty, 2011). In a June 1918 article of the trade publication Earnshaw’s Infants Department it dictated that the “generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls.&quot; The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.” In the current 21rst century Infants whose sex is ambiguous are identified by the colors of their attire it is common knowledge that pink is for girls and blue is for boys (Ben, 2007).&quot;</p>
<p>Yeah I definitely stop caring when writing this paragraph. Sorry OP</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: My apologies for posting a myth.  </p>
<p><del>It's pretty recent (1940's) and I'm unable to find any credible explanation.</del>  </p>
<p><del><em>The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink , being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.</em> (1918 edition of the trade publication Earnshaw’s Infants’ Department)</del>  </p>
<p><del>In 1927, Time magazine printed a chart highlighting gender-appropriate colors for girls and boys according to leading U.S. retailers. Filene’s (in Boston), Best &amp; Co. (in New York City), Halle’s (in Cleveland), and Marshall Field (in Chicago) all advised parents to dress boys in pink and girls in blue.</del>   </p>
<p>Regardless of color, in both cases, they wore dresses.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tangentially related is that it was usual to dress boys and girls in what today would be considered feminine clothing up to a certain age, maybe 3 or 4. I don't know if throughout Europe but I think this was true in England and USA at least in certain circles.</p>
<p>I think this practice did not stop until the early 20th century.</p>
<p>Relationship to OP is that male/female colors would not have been a thing then, either probably.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I recall, they switched after WWII, and not because of the Nazi's use of pink for homosexuals, despite popular belief, but because of marketing to make women's clothing &quot;pop&quot;.</p>
<p>Initially, I believe boys had pink to represent Mars, and girls had light blue to represent Venus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both boys and girls used to wear while dresses, which were easy for diaper changes and easily bleached.  The concept of an individual color for each gender was appealing to clothing manufacturers who realized that they could sell an entire new set of clothing to families with a mix of boys and girls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
