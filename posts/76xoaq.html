<p>For Rubik's Cube experts, the difficulty is associated with doing it <em>quickly</em>. You know all the formulas, but have to analyze every side of the cube in seconds, and decide which formulas you'll need in which order, without stopping to check your progress, while not making mistakes due to your speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The main difficulty of just basic solving is memorizing the move patterns.

OP, you are mostly right in saying that solving a rubik's cube isn't &quot;hard&quot; once you've memorized the formulas (called algorithms).</p>
<p>Algorithms themselves shouldn't be thought of as &quot;Do this set of moves until the cube is solved&quot; but more of a &quot;if you see these patterns, do these moves to make these patterns instead.&quot; The basic idea behind solving a rubik's cube is to progress from one state of a cube to another using some set of algorithms. After some number of these progressive steps, the cube is solved.</p>
<p>However, there are many different sets of algorithms. There are Beginner's algorithms which were designed to be simple and allow a beginner to solve the cube over several minutes. These algorithms often involve hundreds of sequential moves/steps despite the fact that a cube is only ever 23 moves or less from solved.</p>
<p>And so there are also more advanced algorithms that rely on more complex analysis of the cube so to solve it in fewer moves. The cubing community itself is continuously developing newer and better methods for solving the cube, some of which are radically different from the others.</p>
<p>And in general the community likes to focus on solving it in the least amount of time, so of course being able to mentally and physically execute cube solving quickly is another challenging aspect of cubing.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Just solving a rubik's cube on its own is fairly straightforward with today's availability of information but learning to solve it quickly and efficiently is still a challenge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cube is also a matter of public opinion and effort. So many people have the preconceived notion that the being able to solve the Rubik's cube is the epitome of intelligence, but have also never really put in the effort to learn how to solve it themselves. For the most beginner method, all it takes is some theory and 3 memorized algorithms. </p>
<p>Like /u/Ohh_Yeah says, the difficult part isn't solving it, it's doing it fast (and/or in the least number of moves). More advanced methods cut down on solve time and move count tremendously, but you'd need to put in the effort to learn and practice, not something most people care enough about to do.</p>
