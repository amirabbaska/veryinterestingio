As it is, with the USA selling off its stored reserves, the price is simply too low to bother with the expense of capturing it. When the economics change, then drilling operations will once again begin to capture it. </p>
<p>That being said, with current superconductor technology, the answer is essentially no. Most other common gases will freeze solid before cooling down enough to be useful. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 'cryogen-free' superconducting magnets - see, for example, <a href="https://www.oxford-instruments.com/products/cryogenic-environments/superconducting-magnet-systems/cryogen-free-magnets" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="http://www.cryomagnetics.com/products/cryogen-free-superconducting-magnet-systems/" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="https://www.bruker.com/products/mr/preclinical-mri/biospec-3t/overview.html" target="_blank">3</a> - but you still need gaseous helium to feed the coldhead.  </p>
<p>While there is work on using higher-temperature superconductors (HTS), it is not yet a fully mature technology.  Most of what I've seen suggested is using HTS inserts to kick up a conventional superconducting magnet's field.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liquid helium is required to induce ordinary superconductivity in the static magnetic field coils of the MRI. With the discovery of higher temperature superconductors a few years back there was work on building MRI magnetic coils using these materials and then cooling them with liquid nitrogen instead of liquid helium. My recollect of somewhat laymanized papers in the medical imaging press at the time was that the magnetic fields produced from high temperature superconductors were not as uniform as those produced from true superconducting coils. As a result, the prototype MRIs they were testing had to make software corrections to the images produced that reversed the effect of the non-uniformities in the static magnetic field. A lot of imaging professionals pooh poohed these machines saying a radiologist review the images from them would never be able to tell whether something in the image was a true anatomical feature or an artifact introduced into the images from the software corrections. Bottomline, the new devices didn't really catch on but it suggests if liquid helium did become increasingly scarce, there might be alternatives.  Regarding the statement that helium comes from natural gas production, until recently this was true, but only in the fields of north and west texas. In recent years a gas field elsewhere in the world, I think it was in China, was found to be a significant new source of helium, relieving concerns about a world wide shortage of helium as the texas fields became depleted. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't they already have the ability to cool MRI machines with a very small amount of helium in a closed system.  I think its still more experimental, but the system would use a small amount once and never need to be topped off.  </p>
<p>Even though Helium could become more expensive one day, it will always be available, so even if helium is 1,000 times more expensive, if you can build an MRI machine that uses 1 liter or less in a closed loop, who cares what it cost.  If the machine is several million, whats a few thousand as a one time expense?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most MRI magnets use liquid helium because it is a convenient way of cooling the coils to the temperature (&lt; 4K) required. The use of liquid helium, means that the coils can be fully immersed, and will remain cold for weeks, with no operator action.</p>
<p>In practice, most MRI magnets are &quot;zero boil off&quot;. A chiller unit is installed (typically a Gifford-McMahon refrigerator) connected to a copper block, which protrudes into the magnet cryostat. The copper block is cooled to about 2K. Any helium that boils off from the liquid, contacts the cold copper, condenses back into a liquid, and drips back.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers take this a bit further, and instead of using liquid helium immersion, simply take a very high powered cryochiller, and connect it to a copper or aluminium frame onto which the main magnet coils are attached. This design is often called &quot;cryogenless&quot; or &quot;zero cryogen&quot;.  The chiller cools the metal frame, and in turn cools the coils to superconducting temperature. The disadvantage of this is that the construction of the magnet is much more expensive than a simple helium immersion magnet. Another problem is that in the event of an electrical failure without the buffer of liquid helium immersion, the magnet can rapidly warm up, and will &quot;quench&quot;. A power outage can be a big problem for a zero cryogen magnet, so you need the additional cost of reliable backup power.</p>
<p>Quench is sudden loss of magnetic field in a superconducting magnet, caused for example by the magnet temperature rising above the critical temperature. When this happens, the magnet rapidly loses its field, and releases a large amount of energy as heat into the coils. In a liquid cooled magnet, this causes quite spectacular explosive boiling of the helium resulting in burst valves blowing open, and an impressive smoke show, then days or weeks of downtime as the magnet is checked for quench damage, has the burst discs repaired, is recharged with helium and re-energised. In the case of a cryogenless magnet, a quench is less spectacular, but can still result in magnet damage, and a long period of downtime, while the magnet is cooled and restarted.</p>
<p>Of course, zero cryogen magnets still require some sort of working fluid in the chiller. In this case, they use the same type of Gifford-mcMahon chiller which uses a small amount of helium gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
