		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually did a paper on this a few years ago. In the US, lethal injection is used (partially) because they want it to be less mentally damaging to the spectators. There are sedatives that are less painful, but they cause the body to convulse and therefore it can be disturbing to the people who come to watch. Same idea with gunshots, it is hard to watch. </p>
<p>Keep in mind, spectators usually include the families of the victims so they try to keep the mental trauma down as much as possible. Not saying this is the right or wrong method, but it is one of the reasons we use it in the US</p>
<p>Also good to note is firing squad and even hanging are still options for executions in a few states. If I remember correctly one even still allows the electric chair. </p>
<p>Edit 1:Spelling</p>
<p>Edit 2: I wanted to further explain that the paper was an assignment specifically for lethal injection vs less painful drugs (such as overdosing on sleep aids) so there was no &quot;I don't believe in lethal injection&quot; out for the paper. Gas was not an option, but my guess would be (and this is 100% a guess so don't look too much into it) is in the US it is remeniscent of Hitler and the Nazis. Again, just a guess and not intended to offend anyone who asked about it. That's isn't a bad question. There is also a mentality in some areas of &quot;this death is your penalty, why should it be pleasant or easy for you.&quot;</p>
<p>Also this paper simply focused on method, not whether the execution is right (I personally think it should only be used in extreme cases), whether spectators should be present (which I don't think they should be but I get why they would), or the morality of actions up to the execution(such as last meal). The only topic breeched about anything other than this method vs that method is that it is generally more expensive to execute someone via lethal injection than it is (generally) to incarcerate them for life. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's probably just considered more respectful. But mostly I think it's because people simply don't want to acknowledge what they're actually doing. Also, for a shot to the head to be 99+% effective you want a larger gun than normal. Which means you'd basically decimate the skull. It would be messy. But for almost all purposes I believe it's the most painless and most tolerable. Many rounds are supersonic, so you be dead before you even knew the gun was fired. Any time Ive put an animal down, as hard as it is, that's the proper method. There is no fear or pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To solve all of the concern over what may be to disturbing or messy for the viewers or painful/inhumane to the inmate, I believe if we are going to continue to use capital punishment, it should be done via inert gas asphyxiation (replacing oxygen with an inert gas like helium or nitrogen).</p>
<p>In 2015, Oklahoma's governor signed a bill allowing nitrogen asphyxiation as an option for execution.</p>
<p>There is no pain, only a euphoric feeling. There is no mess. There are no drug companies refusing to sell a particular drug. There are no botched injections, electrocutions, hangings or shootings. There is nothing disturbing to watch. No person on death row would be able to claim that inert gas asphyxiation is inhumane (Mitchell Rupe's death sentence was overturned after he argued that he was too heavy to hang and he would be decapitated. Hanging was the default method at the time).</p>
<p>I understand there are politics involved. And ignorance. Some people want the inmate to suffer. Others feel that current methods are tradition. Some people will liken it to the gas chambers of WWII. Like many other problems we have here in the USA, people need to grow up and stop making everything so difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lethal injection is <strong>not</strong> more humane than firing squad. </p>
<p>There's a lot of botched injection attempts and needing more and more doses to put people out who are naturally resistant to the injection. There's been people who have survived the initial injection for hours in excruciating pain.</p>
<p>From what I understand there is lobbying in multiple states in the US to bring back firing squads to replace lethal injection because of it's inhumane reality.</p>
<p>Lethal injections are prettier for the non-condemned who are watching</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
