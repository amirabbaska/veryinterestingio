		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer depends on what part of the galaxy you are talking about. Galaxies are not rigid disks where all the parts are forced to rotate together. Instead, galaxies are made up of a huge number of bodies that have different linear and rotational speeds. For example, think of the Solar system. While it takes the Earth one (Earth) year to make one full loop around the sun, it takes Neptune 165 years to go around. The same is true of galaxies, objects will have different orbital periods depending on their position. By and large stars towards the outer edge of a galaxy will take much longer orbital periods than stars closer to the center. The main reason is that the further a star lies, the more distance it has to cover to make a full orbit. You might get a more intuitive feel for what is going on from <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/e/e0/Spiral_arms.ogv/Spiral_arms.ogv.360p.webm" target="_blank">this visualisation</a>.</p>
<p>As a result, it's easier to answer your question for one specific object. Our Sun makes for a good an example as any. The Sun (and the rest of the solar system) moves around the center of the Milky Way with an orbital period of ~250 million years. This period is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_year" target="_blank">galactic year</a>. That means that within its 10 billion year long life, the Sun will make about 40 loops around the Milky way.</p>
<p>edit: I expanded the initial explanation a bit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why don't galaxies evolve in the same manner as star systems with orbiting planets and asteroid belts ... or as planets with moons and rings?  In those cases a rotating disk of matter clumps into bodies with circular orbits and these bodies gradually clear their orbital lane.  Would galaxies form such clumps in circular orbits if given enough time?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer depends on the history of the galaxy, how you define &quot;most&quot;, and how you define &quot;lifetime&quot;. Galaxies often have traumatic histories; they go through many events where they merge with other things. Sometimes these things are small, such as dwarf galaxies, other times they're large (such as when Andromeda will merge with the Milky Way). Depending on how violent the event is, angular momentum can be greatly affected, which will of course change how often the galaxy rotates. Indeed, most of these galaxies will be completely destroyed, so it's not clear that &quot;most&quot; galaxies have a fixed lifetime. </p>
<p>It's also important to remember that not all galaxies are nice spirals - a good number are ellipticals that have an even messier dispersion of stars rotating at various speeds than in a disk. Angular momentum also probably depends on environment; galaxies in a cluster, for example, are often stripped of gas and stars as they fall in, which again will affect their angular momentum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The arms of a galaxy are really just the regions where stellar density is highest, they don't have a unified physical structure. It makes as much sense to ask, how many times does a cloud spin around. Because the arms are waves of high density, like a traffic jam moving along a road, it is possible for them to move at different rates from the stars that make them up, sort of like how the individual speed of molecules in the air is on average much higher than the bulk speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
