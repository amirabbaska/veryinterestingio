<p>EDIT: This question is NOT to propagate any stereotypes regarding Australia/Australians and NOT an extension of &quot;Everything in Australia is trying to kill you&quot; meme. I only wanted to know the reason behind the difference in the fauna in two countries which I believed to be close by and related (in a geographical sense), for which many people have given great answers. (Thank you guys!)</p>
<p>So if you just came here to say how sick you are of hearing people saying that everything in Australia is out to kill you, just don't bother.</p>
<p>EDIT2: &quot;choke-full&quot; is wrong. It should be chock-full. I stand corrected. I would correct it already if reddit allowed me to edit the title. If you're just here to correct THAT, again, just don't bother.</p></div></div>

Yes there are dangerous creatures but no bears or large predators that will hunt you down for dinner. As an Aussie I think all the macho &quot;a spider the size of a dinner plate bit my my mates cock off....and he was hung like a rogue elephant&quot; is way overblown. Cars and firearms and the big killers worldwide and firearms are all but banned here in Oz. A bit of perspective goes a long way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is text-book example of Red Queen hypothesis and scarily of pray.
Australia isnâ€™t as fertile as New Zealand. Large parts of Australia is inhospitable desert where living is hard enough as it is. In order to prolong ones survival many species evolve venomous or poisonous traits. Once pray develops venom must hunter evolve even stronger resistance to poison. This leads to pray to corporate even stronger venom and so on. This cycle makes ever stronger venoms.
Geological features such as deserts and lack of out world connections made Australian wild life to take this venomous path instead of focusing on increasing reproduction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As many have mentioned, New Zealand separated from Australia about 60-85 million years ago. The expanse of water between them had completely isolated New Zealand's ecosystem. Now what's interesting is what happened afterwards.</p>
<p>As you may know, New Zealand is a very volcanically active place. In fact the largest known eruption in the past 70,000 years originated in the Taupo Volcanic Zone in New Zealand around 24,000 BC. We know of eruptions that were even larger: one the same size as Yellowstone's largest eruption, except it was only 250,000 years ago! And these are just the ones we know about!</p>
<p>Now, before humans arrived, New Zealand had a very strange ecosystem. We have very few native mammals - bats, whales, dolphins and seals are all we've got. Otherwise, New Zealand was populated by birds, fish, some insects, geckos and a few frogs. Because of its isolation, and the lack of predatory mammals, birds were the kings of the food chain. This allowed them to evolve into predatory animals themselves, in a way that wasn't seen anywhere else.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Giant_Haasts_eagle_attacking_New_Zealand_moa.jpg" target="_blank">Here is an artist's impression</a> of the Moa (right) and the Haast's Eagle (left). <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Dinornithidae_SIZE_01.png" target="_blank">This image</a> can help you understand the scale of these creatures (compare to number 4). These animals were able to evolve to such huge sizes because there were no mammals to 'fill' that niche. There are also hundreds of other bird species that dominated the New Zealand forest.</p>
<p>You may see where I'm going with this. However, before you jump the gun, realise that the following idea hasn't been proven and is only discussed theoretically. But the idea is this: millions of years ago, New Zealand did have many native mammals. This is because the land was at one point connected to the rest of the world, and so must have had the same animals. However, some time in the past 30 million years, a giant volcanic eruption destroyed all life on the subcontinent, save a few invertebrates and one reptile - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatara" target="_blank">Tuatara</a> (they call it the living dinosaur).</p>
<p>Once this extinction level event occurred, the ash settled to create a fertile volcanic soil that would lay the foundation for New Zealand's flora. After a few hundred thousand years, New Zealand became a bountiful land with very few species to take advantage of it. Mammals couldn't walk here, but birds could fly. So they did, bringing with them the seeds of trees, bushes and grasses from distant continents. </p>
<p>These new vegetative species flourished in the mineral-rich ground, and as forests sprung up birds migrated to the area, along with anything else that could fly or swim (bats, butterflies, fish, etc.). And so over the next several million years this ecosystem developed into one of the most unique on the planet - one free of predatory mammals, dangerous reptiles and venomous insects, and one full of colourful (and sometimes <a href="http://activeadventures.com/images/content/New_Zealand/Kiwi-bird-page.jpg" target="_blank">not so colourful</a>) birds, land-averse mammals and beautiful, lush flora.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> After splitting from the rest of the world, a giant supervolcano explosion destroyed almost all life on the subcontinent. This eruption created ideal conditions for a land full of forest, which catered to the birds that could fly over here. These birds, isolated from other continents, evolved over time to become the dominant class of animal. Meanwhile, all the dangerous creatures in Australia weren't able to cross the Tasman sea, leaving New Zealand peaceful and murder-free.</p>
<p><strong>STILL TL;DR:</strong> Big boom kill the bad animals.</p>
<p>Source: I live in the aforementioned volcanic zone, and have been to a few museums with this information.</p>
<p>EDIT: See /u/Aldheim's reply below for some great information on New Zealand's ecosystem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For much of its geological history, New Zealand has been utterly isolated from anything else in the world. The last time it was attatched to anything was roughly 85 million years ago, when it detached from Antarctica, following the breakup of the southern Super Continent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana" target="_blank">Gondwanaland</a>. About 100 million years ago, it was also connected to Australia</p>
<p>For a few dozen million years, things were going good for New Zealand. It remained a continent unto itself, roughly half the size of Australia. The North and South island were large plateaus in the center of this continent. It's faunal suit at that point was just like the rest of Gondwana- so Madagascar, Antarctica then, South America, India, Africa, and yes, Australia. Lots of big, scary (and awesome) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notosuchia" target="_blank">crocodiles</a>, snakes, giant tortoises, [giant birds], (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratite" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratite</a>) venomous reptiles and mammals, the latter of which was very basal and simple compared to the surrounding reptiles and archosaurs. Life on Gondwana was pretty nasty, by all accounts, considering that nearly all venomous reptiles (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venomous_mammal" target="_blank">mammals</a>) originate on the continent. Harsh deserts and jungles made things competitive. New Zealand, at that point, was in all probability just as nasty as 'Stralia. </p>
<p>It wasn't until about 25 million years ago that all of this changed. Tectonic activity and rising sea levels submerged all of New Zealand, save for highlands. Eventually, sea levels receded, but only the central plateau- waht we now know as New Zealand- emerged unscathed. Nearly all of the apex predators died out as is common in ecological collapse, leaving herbivores and low level carnivores to re-colonize the island. There just wasn't enough meat to go around. All the native mammals except for bats went extinct. Only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinornis" target="_blank">birds</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatara" target="_blank">reptiles</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weta" target="_blank">insects</a> made it through, most of them herbivores. </p>
<p>As for why no further creatures migrated over from Australia, they really aren't all that close. About 1000 miles. Even if they were a hundred miles away, rafting events are incredibly rare. Just too many risk factors (currents, rain, ability to catch fish/ fat reserves, etc) for it to be reliable. Extremely close landmasses like Madagascar and Africa have only one recorded rafting event, the Hippopatamus, and that's an aqutic animal. Rafting events are nothing short of miraculous.</p>
<p>TL:DR- Poseidon so feared New Zealand that he flooded it to kill everything scary. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
