		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can do this, but not with great accuracy.</p>
<p>Your visual perception is certainly affected by gravity, which like other accelerations, acts upon the vestibular organs in your inner ears.</p>
<p>We have a very fast neuron arc from these sensors to the neural circuitry that controls eye movements. Here's a simplified outline that may describe your scenario: Nose of the plane rises (which you also notice with sensory modalities other than vision), you tilt your head forward to compensate (probably incompletely). To keep your gaze on the thing you were looking straight ahead at, your eyes automatically elevate by the same amount. You now feel like you are looking upwards, and this can affect your perception of location in rotational threespace.</p>
<p>As to my opening comment about accuracy, this is not an ability you would ever want to have to bet your life on. This is why pilots have an artificial horizon instrument; there are endless cases (NTSB accident reports) about pilots who chose to believe their ears and eyes rather than an objective measurement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Commercial pilot here.</p>
<p>There have been numerous accidents recently due to spatial disorientation (Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501, Air France Flight 447 among them).</p>
<p>When you have no outside visual cues, you really can't &quot;feel&quot; how the plane is oriented.  During your commercial training, you do &quot;unusual attitude recovery&quot; where you are basically blindfolded, the instructor will pitch/roll the plane into to a very weird situation and then you are told only &quot;recover&quot;.  You are still wearing &quot;foggles&quot;, which basically block your view out the window.</p>
<p>You can only rely on instruments at that point, especially the attitude indicator (AI) and airspeed indicator.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances can you rely on how you &quot;feel&quot;, because it's probably the exact opposite of what's happening.</p>
<p>It gets complex with situation like AF447 where you have icing, which gives you incorrect readings (you can get incorrect stall and overspeed warnings rapidly, among other things).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You absolutely can see it on take off. Generally we pitch up between 10-20 degrees on take off, which doesn't sound like much but the further back you sit from the center of gravity, you'll feel the effect more. </p>
<p>On descent, not so much, as we only pitch down 3-5 degrees. </p>
<p>There's been times we've done repo flights (flying an empty plane), and we'll leave the cockpit door open. I looked back into the cabin and was shocked on how much the slope was heading towards the back of the plane.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pilot here. You think you can but your brain is actually extremely inaccurate at this sort of thing. During pilot training we practice flying on instrumentation alone, using a hood to block out all windows/outside references. You would be surprised to find that even when your body feels like you are pitching down, in reality the aircraft could just be decelerating. This (among others) are commonly studied effects. I would recommend checking out this wikipedia article that shows just how many illusions there are:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>F-18 Hornet pilots do not have their hands on the controls during carrier catapult launches for these reasons.  Instead they hold onto two handles dubbed the &quot;towel rack&quot; for the first several seconds of flight while the plane's computer is doing the flying because the acceleration is so great that humans perceive it as pitching too far up when the aircraft is actually level.  This leads to the pilot pushing the nose of the plane down to correct the perceived nose-up attitude and flying into the ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
