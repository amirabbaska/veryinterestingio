		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surprisingly no one has gotten the right answer to this yet! Mass plays a role in tidal forces but what's really important is more often size, not mass. The reason you have a tide at all is the difference in the pull of the tidal body from one side to another. We get a tide on the earth because the side of the earth on the opposite side from the moon experiences less gravitational pull from the moon than the near side that is close to the moon. This makes a net force on the object which stretches it out toward and away from the object generating the tide. Not everyone realizes this but there is actually a high tide on the side of the earth close to the moon as well as the side on the far side from the moon. Low tides are at 90 degrees from the moon on either side. </p>
<p>The only time tidal forces can act on small objects is when the masses involved are extremely compact. Spaghettification in a black hole is actually caused by tidal forces. Basically your head and feet are getting a high tide while your waist is getting a low tide!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does lift those things up! The surface of the Earth will vary in distance from the center by about a meter every twelve hours due to tidal forces acting on it. Trees and small animals <em>are</em> lifted up, but so is the ground beneath them.</p>
<p>You can maybe (depending on how much unnecessary technical language you can swallow) learn more in this hard-to-follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_tide" target="_blank">wikipedia article about these so-called &quot;Earth Tides&quot;</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm afraid I came too late for this to get seen, but here goes:</p>
<p>Everything on the surface of the earth gets lifted up with the terrestrial tide of about 40 cm.  That includes things like tree leaves and small animals.  However, they are getting lifted up just the same as every other part of the earth's surface, and so this movement isn't really apparent.  </p>
<p>So what's different about the ocean?  Well, it's big and made of water.  It feels the same <em>pull</em> as the surface of the earth.  But because it is liquid, this sets up an oscillation in the ocean basin, causing waves (the tides I mean, not regular waves which are caused by wind) to slosh around it.  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/M2_tidal_constituent.jpg" target="_blank">Here's</a> an image showing the circulation of tides in the ocean basins.  The white spider-lines show where the crest of high tide is every hour, the arrows where the lines converge show the direction the tide moves from hour to hour.  And the red shows areas where tidal variation is highest.  While land tides pretty much match up with the pictures you see in books, ocean tides don't at all, and so they aren't moving &quot;in synch&quot; with the land.  They are also often a lot bigger, because of the water sloshing around in the basin.</p>
<p>To get a physical example, fill a cake pan half-full of water and rock it slightly back and forth a little bit.  The small movement of the pan should set up a large movement of water in the pan, with the highest amplitude at the edges of the pan, just like you see in the ocean basins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order for a tree, leaf or small animal to be &quot;lifted up&quot; it would have to experience a negative gravitational force. That is to say that the gravitational force of the moon acting on the object would have to exceed the gravitational force of the Earth acting on the object. The force that an object on Earth experiences due to the moon's gravity is nowhere near strong enough to cancel out Earth's gravity but it will cause a small change in an object's weight. This means that such objects would deform or &quot;grow&quot; upwards slightly.</p>
<p>Animals and small objects are all solids and are relatively, well, small. That means that any deformation caused by a change in the local gravitational field will also be small.</p>
<p>Oceans, on the other hand, are very big. So a relatively small percentage change in their depth is very noticeable to us.</p>
<p>Edit to clarify: In the first sentence I should have said &quot;a negative net gravitational force&quot;. Negative gravity doesn't exist as far as I know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun Fact: The moon/sun system does cause small deformations  in the earth's meaty parts, and the LHC accelerator ring is large enough that its magnet systems have to compensate for distorting beam profiles due to squishing of the beam tunnel.  It's all calibrated and automatically adjusts depending on where the moon and sun are at any given time.</p>
