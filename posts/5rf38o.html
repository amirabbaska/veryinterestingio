		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fridges use a set of nozzles to create laminar flows of cold and hot air to separate the air inside the refrigerator from the rest of the shop without any physical barriers. It is a pretty cool system and can be quite efficient. Although not as efficient as an actual physical barrier. A shop may install transparent doors or flaps to save energy. And during night they often cover the refrigerators to make them more efficient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a way they are enclosed by something called an air curtain, its basically a wall of moving air that separates the inside air from the outside air.  At night many also have actual physical curtains that can be used.  It also helps that cold air falls, so they are designed such that they trap in their own cold air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't recall the term for the phenomenon right now, but I would guess it's because if people have to do extra actions, even minor ones, they're less likely to do the task at all. </p>
<p>If stores build a separate enclosure with a door to save a tiny bit on cooling costs, they're going to lose more than that due to fewer sales. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's good marketing. Putting things behind windows helps slow down &quot;grab and go&quot;, which is a part of good sales. And it also puts a barrier between the buyer and the goods. Seeing things fresh, up close inside of clear plastic, such as meats, tends to encourage lots more buying.</p>
<p>also works with pastas of the many kinds, which are mostly sold inside of clear plastic, or at least windows of plastic, too. We are visual critters, as our brains are organized around the visual systems we use, so that works best.</p>
<p>It's more real that way, too. Imagine how poorly chicken and steak would sell if the beef wasn't reddened with nitrites, and you couldn't see the meat, nor feel it either.</p>
<p>Impulse buying and good marketing, all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
