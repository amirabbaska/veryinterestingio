		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because that only solves part of the problem.</p>
<p>Most of the water distribution infrastructure is based on gravity, water flows downhill and is diverted to where it is need.</p>
<p>Desalination resuls in a bunch of freshwater at sea level, which is about as downhill as you can get.  Even if it were free, you'd still have to find a way to move all the water to where it is needed, and that is an expensive, energy intensive process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is VERY energy intensive and expensive to do. Not to say it isn't being done, San Diego spent millions to make a plant just for that very thing, but it isn't anywhere near as easy to do on a scale that is viable as most people believe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The facilities are still expensive to build and to power and maintain. Plus, once you have clean fresh water you still have to transport it enormous distances.</p>
<p>Industrial use (farming especially) outpaces people's average drinking needs. So while you'd have to make the freshwater at the coast, you'd have to transport it inland over huge distances to get to farming territory. </p>
<p>So the end answer is it costs a lot, and that not screwing around with our existing freshwater sources would be a lot smarter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are indeed putting a lot of effort into it. Although the other posters said it is really energy intensive (which is true, specially if you do it through distillation), there has been a lot of research in Chemical Engineering to develop new membrane technologies for reverse osmosis, which is a less energy intensive way to do it than distillation, and its actually working for some applications. Still, the kg of desalted water is aproximatedly 2x the cost of a kg of fountain / treated water.
Problem for using it in long-scale to supply a whole society is, as someone else already posted, the water distribution is easily done if its downwards using gravity, but pumping water from beach level to cities to supply all the civil and industrial demand would cost a lot of energy.
Whenever you think in industry, think about this: although all the matter needed may be cheap, most of the time the energy required to do something is responsible for most of the expenses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Collectively, we are putting resources towards it. It just isn't cost effective to widen the scope beyond Israel... And Israel is in general very secretive and protective of their technology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
