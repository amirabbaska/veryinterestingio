		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, sort-of. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning#Positive_lightning" target="_blank">positive lightning</a> is a relatively common phenomenon originating from the top of a cumulonimbus and could definitely hit you if you were above it (or quite far away from it, for that matter). There are also more exotic forms of upper atmospheric discharges such as sprites (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(lightning" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(lightning</a>) ) but they are so high up they aren't relevant to your question at all.</p>
<p>However, I don't think the conditions could/would exist to ever allow you to be on a mountain on earth and be subject to this effect. When you see photos of a mountain peak jutting up above the clouds, what you're looking at is an inversion layer. Normally, air is warmest at the surface and cools as you go higher. That warm air rises due to buoyancy, and once it rises into cold enough air, the moisture in it condenses out forming clouds. In an inversion, the opposite happens; cold air sits near the ground and a warmer layer is higher. The cold air is of course more dense so that it cannot rise, and the clouds stop where the inversion begins.</p>
<p>If you look at a temperature profile of our atmosphere, air gets colder up until the tropopause, where the stratosphere ends and the troposphere begins. This is a natural inversion layer boundary, which prevents clouds from rising above it -- hence why massive cumulonimbus clouds spread out horizontally when they hit it.</p>
<p>In order for a thunderstorm to develop, you need convective energy (rising air) to build up all that static electricity. The inversion layer scenario you imagine presents two problems. First, the reason the inversion exists in the first place is that the air is cold and not rising so there is no energy to build up an electric potential. Second, when the heating does start happening (which is why those inversions tend to burn off in the late morning once the sun starts heating things up), all the air rises, punches through the inversion, and keeps rising. So you might get your thunderstorm, but it will rise to a much higher altitude and your inversion will be gone.</p>
<p>In principle you could have a really high mountain which juts into the troposphere allowing for the conditions you're looking for to exist, but it won't happen on earth. Not only would you need a really tall mountain for it to happen, but the vertical relief over the relative terrain would have to be huge. Everest is almost 9km tall which would barely put it into the troposphere if it were at the poles, but the base is at 5km so there isn't much for a thunderstorm to work with, and I can only assume would distort the temperature profile of the local atmosphere. Perhaps on another planet with very different atmospheric characteristics and a REALLY tall mountain that quickly fell off to sea level you might see those conditions, but I don't know enough to be sure if it's even possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
