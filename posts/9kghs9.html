		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the answers here are right. Hopefully this helps give you a clear picture. Basically, there are 2 sites you’ll gain fat. Primary sites and secondary sites. Primary sites are usually stomach, hips, waist. Primary site location depends largely on hormones, and being male or female. Secondary sites are places like arms, legs, face, etc. When weight loss begins, you start to lose fat from the secondary sites first. That is why it takes longer to lose fat from places like the stomach. You lose fat from the primary sites last, in the reverse order the fat was gained.</p>

<p>ETA: It’s homework time but I will try to reply to everyone later tonight!</p>
<p>Edit 2: For those wondering why this happens, u/CrossP has some really good comments. Basically, fat stores around the primary sites first because this protects internal organs and core temperature. Having fat around the secondary sites doesn’t really provide any benefits, so that is why it’s last to come on and first to come off.</p>
<p>Another question I’m getting a lot is why some people don’t experience this. Genetics and hormones (and even ethnicity) are essentially what determines a person’s fat distribution. So not everyone will be the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is explain it like I'm five so here goes the simple reason avoiding the biochemistry: gaining fat in the middle is easier for the body to carry around than other parts. For example if the legs and arms gain too much fat there is the issue of friction (Ask any runner). One way of thinking about it is that you can gain 20 pounds and walk fine but you would get tired carrying around 20 pounds in your hands. </p>
<p>Edit: Fat is not loosely stored. The role of fat cells is to store fat. how you gain or lose weight has to do with the amount of fat stored and how many fat cells you have. That's  why when a person goes for plastic surgery to have fat relocated to a different part of the body such as from the midsection to the hips what is being transferred are the fat cells and not just fat. free fat would just get reabsorbed. This is also why people who are fat as children have a harder time with fat reduction and even if they lose weight they are more likely to be diabetic. Because when we are children we don't gain weight just by making our fat cells bigger but increase their number. As adults it's more about the fat cells storing more fat and getting bigger. This is called hyperplasia (increase number of cells) hypertrophy (increase the size) these terms and ways of growing are not limited to fat cells. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OUr body likes to store fat (primary and secondary) out of the way on unimportant sites,belly, inner thigh, under upper arms, below neck waddle,  though I suspect for pregnant women some belly fat would certainly protect the womb during severe weather, and may be a genetic advantage for the species.   There is evidence that long term storage of a constant fat source may contribute to increase insulin supplies in the body, making it harder to burn off those fat supplies nad actually gain more weight .

<p>Excerpt</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, you’re not imagining things.</p>
<p>Belly fat is harder to lose than fat in other areas of your body.</p>
<p>That’s why you’ve probably noticed that when you diet to lose weight, your upper body is first to shrink while your belly remains more or less the same.</p>
<p>To understand why this is, we need to review how your body actually “burns” fat.</p>
<p>“Burning fat” is really a two-part process:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Releasing energy from fat stores into the blood (lipolysis).</p>
</li>
<li>Cells taking those molecules in and utilizing them (oxidation).</li>
</ul>
<p>This first step, lipolysis, is triggered by chemicals known as “catecholamines,” which include adrenaline and noradrenaline.</p>
<p>Once these chemicals are in your blood, they attach to “receptors” on fat cells (that work much like a lock and key), which causes them to release some of their energy stores (free fatty acids).</p>
<p>These fatty acids are then used as fuel (burned or “oxidized”) by various types of cells in the body, including muscle cells. In fact, well-trained muscle is particularly good at oxidizing fats, which is why it’s easier to lose fat when you have a good amount of muscle.</p>
<p>Now, here’s where we get to the difference between areas of the body where fat stores seem to be “stubborn,” like the belly, versus other areas of the body where fat melts away easily.</p>
<p>The primary difference between “stubborn” belly fat and “regular” fat is it contains a high amount of fat cells with catecholamine receptors that blunt lipolysis.</p>
<p>You see, fat cells have two basic types of catecholamine receptors: alpha and beta receptors.</p>
<p>The physiology gets pretty complicated, but the long story short is beta-receptors accelerate lipolysis and alpha-receptors hinder it.</p>
<p>What this means is fat cells that have more beta-receptors than alpha-receptors are relatively easy to mobilize (they respond favorably to catecholamines), whereas fat cells that have more alpha-receptors than beta are not (they don’t respond favorably to them).</p>
<p>This is the basic problem with belly fat, and all other forms of “stubborn fat“–the ratio between beta- and alpha-receptors is heavily weighted toward alpha, which means that catecholamines can’t trigger lipolysis as easily.</p>
<p>Thus, when you’re losing fat, you see immediate reductions in fat cells with a large number of beta-receptors, but little change in fat cells with a large number of alpha-receptors.</p>
<p>For most of us, this means rapid fat reduction in places like our arms, shoulders, chest, face, and legs, and slower reductions in our stomachs, hips, lower back, and thighs, which have high concentrations of stubborn fat cells.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ELI5</p>
<p>Fat cells in certain regions of the body are just more resistant to the biological processes of fat burning, and will only get burned off when others are depleted first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
