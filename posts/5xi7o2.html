		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I seem to recall that DNA imprinting has something to do with it. People who are morning people have different non-genetic changes to the methylation patterns on their DNA.</p>
<p>I used to be a night person. I grew up that way. 1am was a regular bed time throughout childhood and into college.</p>
<p>Then I had a kid. This kid woke up at 5 am no matter what. I went through a traumatic adjustment and was a good dad.</p>
<p>As the kid grew, they slept later...but I couldn't. To this day (kid is Freshman in college) I still wake up around 5 am...no matter what. When I change time zones, I adjust to the new 5 am.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people have a circadian rhythm (internal clock) of 24hours plus or minus an hour. People who's internal clock are shorter tend to go to sleep earlier and feel more awake earlier in the morning, these are your morning people. People who have longer internal clocks are night people tend to have more problems waking up in the morning. There was a study done on mice showing this and that breeding mice with long circadian rhythms could produce offspring with even longer circadian rhythms. It's been a long time since I took neurophysiology though so someone else is going to have to look it up if they care.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A little off subject but I had an older neighbor all but call me stupid for being a night owl. His theory was that EVERYONE should be in bed by 10:00pm, only idiots stay up all night. I finally lost it and told him to remember that if he needs the police in the middle of the night, or has a heart attack and needs an ambulance or emergency room.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

According to that video, it says that morning and night people is something primal. Goes back to the days when some stayed up and protected the campsite (or whatever) at night and when others hunted or fished during the day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
