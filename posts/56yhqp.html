		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some facts about Mars: It has 24.5 hour days, 144 trillion square meters of land area (roughly equivalent to the land area of Earth), and an average temperature of -85F. That's cold, but better than any of our other options.</p>
<p>First, a self sustaining martian colony is a Plan B for Earth, should a catastrophe occur that wipes out humanity.</p>
<p>Second, rare and valuable metals are abundant on Mars, and Deuterium is 5x more abundant, the fuel of choice should we ever achieve nuclear fusion as a power source. There is commercial and economic motivations to mine and manufacture on Mars. Because gravity is 2.4x less than on Earth, escape velocity is thusly lower and exporting of world to Earth is cheaper than going from Earth to Mars.</p>
<p>Third, there is substantial opportunity for scientific research on Mars, looking for martian life and furthering our understanding of the creation of our solar system. There is also materials science and pharmaceutical chemistry that is achievable on Mars due to the lower gravity than here on Earth. For example, did you know you can make aluminum more transparent than your typical silicon glass? The problem is gravitational shear as the metal cools. There are methods to get around this but it's extremely expensive, reserved for high end optics and bulletproof US fighter jet cockpit domes because it's a government contract so fuck it. But in space or on Mars, if the gravity is low enough, they can mass produce aluminum glass; never again will you shatter your phone screen by dropping it. Or shooting it, apparently.</p>
<p>And one that ties economics and science together is the amount of innovation that has to go into successfully establishing such a colony. As Neal deGrasse Tyson said, for every dollar invested in NASA, there is a $14 economic return just from the innovation that comes out of solving problems. Pyrex bakeware came out of trying to develop rocket noses, WD-40 was the 40th attempt at making a compound that would Displace Water, that's Water Displacement attempt #40, the internet as a whole came out of a scientists who wanted a better way of linking scientific papers to the documents they cite in their bibliographies. Just attempting to get to Mars would be a huge economic boom, and we're seeing this already, with the birth of the commercial space flight industry, with Virgin Galactic, SpaceX, and Boeing - specifically Boeing working beyond NASA and military contracts.</p>
<p>Finally, there are political motivations. Just look how the US rallied behind the space race of the 50s. Imagine if you can motivate whole nations or an entire planet behind a similar cause.</p>
<p>Edit: To quote Tyson again, who wants to build a jet engine that is 20% more fuel efficient? No one that isn't an aviation executive. Who wants to go to Mars? He had more to say in this thread I'm paraphrasing, but basically he was saying frontier science and engineering inspires the next generation, and they get involved and end up solving other problems while trying to achieve the goal in front of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>The Earth is just too small and fragile a basket for the human race to keep all its eggs in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or as Randall Munroe observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The universe is probably littered with the one-planet graves of cultures which made the sensible economic decision that there's no good reason to go into space--each discovered, studied, and remembered by the ones who made the irrational decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is nothing we particularly need on Mars. There is no good reason to live on Mars, but if you looked at it cold and calculating enough there is also no good reason to live on Earth.</p>
<p>We have to ways we can go from here. Humanity can stay on earth and die with its planet at some point in the future or we can go out there and spread ourselves among the stars. Mars is the first step on the second path, we don't know were it will lead and what benefits it will bring us, but the other one is literally a dead end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to do it. The race to the moon created tons of new technology and know how just by existing. Its exceedingly likely that trying to get humans to Mars, let alone colonize it, will create huge tech advancement here on Earth.</p>
<p>We're still decades, if not centuries away from a true colony on Mars. Right now the plan is just to get people there and back again.</p>
<p>Eventually, maybe 500 years from now, maybe less, we should actually be able to teraform Mars, creating a livable atmosphere. There are still significant hurdles to overcome, but that just means mankind gets more technological advances. Perhaps by trying figure out Mars, we succeed in helping Earth's own climate issues.</p>
<p>Lastly, consider Mars a backup plan. If all else goes wrong, we might one day live on Mars while we fix the Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I cant take credit for this, it was submitted by someone in response to a question of why the average person should care about the discovery of gravity waves. We can talk about the practical implications all day but to me there is something more primal about it, and this sums it up perfectly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine you woke up naked in a field, in the middle of nowhere. You have no idea where you are, or how you got there. What do you do? First, you'd probably go into survival mode; you'd look for the basic necessities to sustain life: water, food, and shelter from the elements.</p>
<p>Once you had everything you needed to stay alive, and you knew that, if nothing else, you could at least remain in your current location indefinitely, you might start to wonder what in the hell happened: one minute you're bouncing around Reddit, the next you're bare-ass in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>After you come to grips with the reality of the situation, you'd probably want to try and figure out where in the hell you are. You might try and look for clues from your environment or maybe a constellation you recognize, or perhaps you decide to do a little exploring around the immediate area, to see if there's anything around that could give you some clue as to where in the hell you are.</p>
<p>Let's say that your efforts reveal that you're in the middle of Africa. Once you've figured out where you are, you only have two choices left: stay there and simply exist as long as you can, or attempt to get back to civilization; either option has it's own risks.
If you chose to stay where you are, then that's essentially it for you, you now know how your future will play out: you'll remain at your current location until you either die of old age, or your area becomes unable to sustain life. Either way, the game is over for you; your entire existence becomes about survival, and you're just running out the clock until, at some point in the future, you cease to exist.</p>
<p>Maybe you decide to try and leave a message for someone to find in the future, maybe you're content to simply fade off into oblivion, either way, your fate is sealed.</p>
<p>Now let's say you decided to try and get back to civilization. Since you know where you are, your logical next step is going to be to try and figure out someplace to go, and then of course, how to get there. Now you have a goal, something you're striving towards. Life ceases to be about mere survival and becomes an epic journey to get you where you want to go.</p>
<p>This is the timeline of humanity. We woke up with nothing, on a little rock, in the middle of nowhere. We figured out how to survive, and we struggled to come to grips with our own reality. Then we started exploring, trying to find out just exactly where we were in the Universe. Now we're faced with the same choice: exist, or move on.</p>
<p>You ask if it's something that a &quot;regular guy REALLY needs to know&quot;, to me it's the most important thing he/she needs to know: that humanity chooses more than an existence of mere survival. That humanity chooses to move forward and keep exploring and expanding. To know that, even though we might never make it, at least we're making the effort. That we have hope.
The alternative is to simply run out the clock and wait to fade off into oblivion.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ultimate goal is to create settlements that would have artificial environments suitable for long-term (indefinite) human habitation. Further into the future, Mars could be terraformed, which means that its atmosphere and environment could be permanently altered by the use of technology (we already know how to do this in principle). It's worth pointing out that we know that the surface of Mars was once very different, likely identical to the prebiotic surface of Earth (a rocky but more temperate world, home to large bodies of water). Given that the latest SpaceX video briefly depicts the terraforming of Mars, it's reasonable to assume that they share this goal.</p>
<p>The point is a straightforward one (as elucidated by Elon Musk, and many others including Carl Sagan). Remaining isolated to one world is fundamentally risky for mankind. There is always the potential for cataclysms such as the use of nuclear or biological weapons, or natural disasters like impacts from comets.</p>
<p>This article, written by astronomer Phil Plait, gives probably the single most relevant quote from Elon Musk, &quot;Humans need to be a multiplanet species.&quot; <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/04/16/elon_musk_and_mars_spacex_ceo_and_our_multi_planet_species.html" target="_blank">http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/04/16/elon_musk_and_mars_spacex_ceo_and_our_multi_planet_species.html</a></p>
<p>Wait But Why has a (very lengthy) article explaining why and how SpaceX will colonize Mars. I haven't read it, but I presume that it goes over the importance of colonizing other worlds to ensure the survival of humanity.
<a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html" target="_blank">http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html</a></p>
<p>The fact that the Martian surface is naturally inhospitable (e.g. atmospheric composition, temperature range, etc) is fundamentally no more an obstacle than the inhospitable nature of any other unaltered environment here on Earth. Wherever you live now, imagine surviving a year without any technology (this includes protective clothing, tools, etc). Indeed, without <em>any</em> technology whatsoever, it's unlikely you'd survive a single day of winter if you live in even a temperate climate zone. One could argue that there is no unaltered environment on Earth that is suitable for long-term human habitation, and there is no settlement of human beings <em>anywhere</em> who survive without the aid of technology.</p>
<p>Another relevant Musk quote: &quot;Mars is a fixer-upper planet.&quot;</p>
<p>Our ancestors were pioneers who colonized extremely harsh environments with far more primitive technology, successfully establishing human habitation that continues on to this day. I think it's a safe bet that the same will happen on Mars. Just as before, the first generation of pioneers will be bold, maybe even a little crazy to assume the risk. Just as before, things won't always go smoothly, and maybe people will die (hopefully nothing like the Donner Party incident happens)... But in the end, we'll turn Mars into a second home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
