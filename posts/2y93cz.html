<p>Edit: I'm amazed at how many different approaches were suggested after the lens size became a problem, the amount of creativity definitelly increases with the amount of brains working to solve a problem.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory, yes. </p>
<p>In practice, it's much harder, because the earth is so small and 65 milllion light years is a long distance. For perspective, all the visible stars in the night sky are within about 1,000 light years of us. The Milky Way is about 100,000 light years across. Andromeda is about 2.5 million light years away. If some aliens (or wormhole travelers) want to see dinosaurs, they're going to need a big telescope. We can barely even resolve planets in our own galaxy, and I don't think there is a single known extragalactic exoplanet, but I could be wrong. </p>
<p>But let's not let reality get in the way of our adventure; after all, we've already assumed wormholes exist. So how big does this telescope need to be? Astronomy is hard, and gets harder the further away you look, because you need bigger and bigger telescopes to get the same resolution- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_resolution#Lens_resolution" target="_blank">so we can use the lens resolution equation to find an approximate size for the lens.</a></p>
<pre><code>  Angular resolution = 1.22 * Wavelength / Lens Diameter</code></pre>
<p>So pick a wavelength in the visible spectrum- how about 500 nanometers since that's right at the transition between blue and green, and a distance of 65 million light years. The angular resolution to resolve the earth would be: </p>
<pre><code> Earth Radius/Distance = 1.22 * Wavelength / Lens Diameter</code></pre>
<p>Solving for the lens diameter gives about 5.8x10^10 meters, which is about a third of the distance to the sun. This is big- this lens would fill up about half of Mercury's orbit. </p>
<p>But you wanted to see <em>dinosaurs</em>, not just the earth. If you want to resolve a dinosaur as one pixel or so, then we use the same equation again, but put in the size of a dinosaur (maybe 10 meters?) instead of the earth radius. <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2865+million+light+years+%2F+length+of+triceratops%29+*+1.22+*+500+nm" target="_blank">This lens</a> needs to be 4.4 light years in diameter- where once again I am surprised at the neat tidbits Wolfram has built in, like the length of an adult triceratops. </p>
<p>Anyway, you're going to run into a problem here because when you start putting a lot of mass in one spot space starts to curve a lot, and eventually it's going to collapse into a black hole. For something with the density of glass, which is about 2.5 grams/cc, you're going to hit this point fairly quickly. In fact, <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt%283*%28speed+of+light%29^2+%2F+%288+*+gravitational+constant+*+pi+*+2.5+grams%2Fcc%29%29" target="_blank">a ball of glass 14 light <em>minutes</em> in radius will have enough concentrated mass to collapse into a black hole.</a></p>
<p>Tough luck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I think is interesting is that if you were looking at earth from a distance where you could see dinosaurs, you could theoretically look through a high powered telescope and traveling at a the correct speed toward our planet, see our planet in fast forward. Unrealistic, but possible if our planet was stationary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;I'd bring my iPhone, as the most compact representation of modern culture there is. And I'd visit a civilization on a galaxy 65 million light years away. Assuming I can get there instantaneously, I would look back to Earth with their presumably super telescopes and witness the extinction of the dinosaurs - the light of which is just now reach them.&quot;</p>
<p>I'd link to the exact comment but I'm on mobile and have no idea what I'm doing.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A book series you might find interesting in The Frontiers Saga. Doesn't go much into the science, but after a plague that almost wiped out the species, man lived in a dark time for 1000 years before climbing back out. Then they find a &quot;data ark&quot; that gives them a leg up on gaining their previous knowledge. They find they can make a drive (i thought of it as a quantum drive) that allowed them to appear instantly someone else in a 10 light year radius from where they were.
When they talk about their sensors, they mention the data they are seeing is old at extreme ranges. At one time,  they could see their own ship before they jumped (they were something like a light hour away).</p>
