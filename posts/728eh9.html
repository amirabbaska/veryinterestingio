This means that you can easily access the raw code that the OS is built out of, and edit it as you see fit.  If you have relevant skills as a programmer, you can change literally everything about the operating system.</p>
<p>If you compare that to something more commercial like Windows or Mac OS, you don't have those options.  The operating system was compiled by the manufacturer and released as a finished product.  You can't even see the code, and have no option to edit it.  </p>
<p>Think of it like cakes.  Buy a Linux cake and you get the cake, and the ingredient list.  At any point you can easily take that recipe, tweak it to your heart's content, and make another cake.  Buy an MS or Apple cake, and you just get a finished cake.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll approach this from a different standpoint,</p>
<p>I personally tell people frequently that I bled and sweat and cried my way into Linux. It wasn't an easy thing at first, I started around 2008 with Mandriva Linux, which I borked repeatedly due to inexperience and computer inexperience. I gave up, and returned a year later with Ubuntu linux, of which I use regularly.</p>
<p>It wasn't easy, I was used to being catered to by 90% of the world I knew running on windows, so finding help for Linux was harder. It didn't help that I didn't know how to search for help for linux for quite sometime either.</p>
<p>No Linux is not my main machine at home, but it is at work, so I get a good 50/50 out of it. (Windows at Home for games, Linux for IT work at work.)</p>
<p>Linux is Open Source, as many here have pointed out, and it's very customizable. If you know the right code, and have the right skills, you can change it to your liking, in any way. As long as you follow the Open Source license and release the changes. (This is generally easy, as if you contribute to any open source project your changes will generally be very open to view, I'm looking at you Github.)</p>
<p>But onto the meat of it, Why does open source mean better for us? Me and you? Because it means that while I can edit this code, Everyone else can too. This means that even if I never do, I can use the internet to find a great deal of many people who <em>have</em>.</p>
<p>Say, that I don't like how my desktop is laid out. (I don't like where my start button is, or I like how a Mac laptop is laid out.) I can go online find the appropriate command, and download and change it. It may take a little time to download and install, but the options are available. I can choose between quite a few: KDE, Gnome, Enlightenment, Unity, Mate, LXDE, just to name a few!</p>
<p>This goes for Software too. Because the internals of the Linux Family of Operating Systems are open, we get choices on almost every level, far beyond the ones that Windows gives. This is something some people love to an extreme degree, and naturally have strong opinions on the matter. </p>
<p>Lets list some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My Task bar is too big, because I have a tiny laptop with a tiny screen, with linux you can look up how to make your task bar as small as you'd like, and still hold your icons. Maybe you don't want a taskbar at all, and want a Mac-like dock? Linux lets you do this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My computer is running very very slow, windows just takes too much for it to run, I can find a version of Linux that requires much less power and will run and make my computer act brand new.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want my computer for a very specific use: I only want it to run google chrome, nothing else ever. You can set up a computer with Linux to do just this one task, and nothing else.</p>
</li>
<li>I want to make <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/create-neural-paintings-deepstyle-ubuntu/" target="_blank">Google Deep Style images at home</a> I did this one personally and I love it, I crank them out on one of my servers at home, and it's a fun gift to give to people from time to time who've never seen it. This one is harder though, so I'd recommend a newbie keep clear of it for a little while at least.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my line of work, I often tell people to simply get something that you will enjoy working with. If it's a Mac, a Windows machine, or a flavor of Linux. Do what you need to be productive on your machine, but keep an open mind and try other things. You never know what you will find on another piece of Software, or Operating System that may blow your mind and change everything about how you produce whatever it is on your computer.</p>
<p>I find myself working fairly well on any of the big three. I've poked around with BSD and may in the future make it a work machine so I can learn it more forcefully.</p>
<p>The last thing I can offer is this: If you are curious to learn Linux, I'll tell you the biggest three things I learned that helped me get familiar with it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dive in, and don't be scared of problems. Use google to find solutions and begin to learn how things operate. In time you will find yourself getting more and more familiar with it. This is much like learning Windows for the first time, not a lot will make sense, but as you notice patterns, you will begin to understand how this works. View it as an adventure, and do a little reading before hand so you know where to start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find an aspect of the OS you enjoy and play with it! I learned to love the Command line, customizing how it looks, and having it do things I used to use a mouse to do or my love of SSH which lets you control computers across your network at home, or even across the internet. Maybe yours is Games? Or perhaps it's seeing what kind of different software you can try? I learned about my favorite Linux Software <a href="https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/" target="_blank">youtube-dl</a> via <a href="https://mrs0m30n3.github.io/youtube-dl-gui/" target="_blank">youtube-dl-gui</a> which is a program that makes it easy to use and downloads any music you like from Soundcloud, Youtube, and many other places. It was a god-send for my music collection when I found out that youtube-dl works on sites that aren't youtube. It will even let you download just the audio from videos, so you can collect music. I do know that it's available on Windows, but I learned about it because of Linux.</p>
</li>
<li>Vocabulary! Be sure to ask people about linux functions and see if they have a name you can search for. I wanted to run programs on each of my processors at once. I had no idea what this was called until I asked on the Ubuntu forums and I was told I was looking for something called Parallelization. This then let me google more effectively. This is 60% of the battle. The rest is all implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p>And three warnings:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>People who google are people who get answers, also take a look through /r/unixporn and subs that focus on Unix/Linux specifics like Unix coding, or linux command lines, or subs dedicated to specific distros. The Forums dedicated to specific distros, like the legendary Ubuntu forums also will offer help for even the smallest questions. Feel free to ask, and search through them, usually people have had the EXACT same problem you've had, you just have to find how they fixed it. I forced myself to use linux exclusively, it took two months and before I knew it, I wasn't thinking about how much trouble this was, I was just browsing the internet and playing games I knew could run on Linux. (And doing my IT work at home.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have an older wireless card (USB, onboard, etc.) or certain video cards, be prepared for the possibility of incompatibility or some stretching to get them functioning. Looking them up using google before you install will save heartaches. Of course you may luck out and they may just work without any sort of tinkering.</p>
</li>
<li>If the distro you like offers it, RUN THE LIVE CD, which means simply that you are running Linux off the CD, or USB drive and taking it for a test drive. It is the full version of the Operating system, but temporarily, this allows you to figure out a lot of the worst problems before you make the jump.</li>
</ol>
<p>I work a lot with people who have never used a computer before, and fixing computers for people who only have used them lightly. Feel free to send questions my way if you are genuinely interested in learning Linux, I'll offer what help I can, and point out sites that I used to learn it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I followed the debacle from r/linux and basically asking a question there is against the rules( there are /r/linuxquestions  and /r/linux4noobs  for that). It's clearly stated on the sidebar. Additionally since linux marketshare has started going up we get a lot of trolls leaking from apple and microsoft subs so the situtation is a big tense. So I'll try to answer your question here.</p>
<p>Linux on it's own is not an operating system. Linux is a vital part of it(the kernel) and possibly the hardest to create from scrath, but it's not enough on it's own. The kernel takes care of speaking directly to the hardware. It includes things like thread scheduler( the part that decides which application or daemon will get cpu time and when), I/O scheduler( organizing writes and reads from the hard drive), all hardware drivers and so on. You get the idea, very low level stuff. So when you say &quot;I use linux&quot; (as a desktop OS), in reality you are using linux as the kernel, plus a ton of libraries and applications on top( consisting the userland, usually the GNU userland). The result is a full operating system. An end user rarelly interfaces directly with the kernel unless it is for something technical.</p>
<p>The main driving factor behind the customizability of linux is the fact that it's open source. Open source does not mean that someone makes some code and throws it in the wind, but rather uses a lincese that follows the code around. Linux( the kernel) uses <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html" target="_blank">gplv2</a>, while everything else in the system uses a combination of gplv2, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">gplv3</a>, or permissive like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses" target="_blank">bsd</a>. You can read more about them, because open source has played a huge role in shaping the modern IT world and it's adoption is only expected to increase. </p>
<p>Anyway what every single one of these licenses allows is for a user to take the source code, modify it and redistribute the modified version. This has resulted in companies and people all around the world creating and sharing software that solves all kinds of problems. This ranges from alternative schedulers in the kernel( e.g. Facebook created the BFQ scheduler for their servers and due to the fact that the kernel uses gplv2 they released it to the public), to different algorithms for thread scheduling. The result are 20 years of libre software that ranges from 20 or more different desktop environments( the graphical part of the OS with all the buttons, window management, and a software suite), multiple applications that do the same thing( e.g. nautilus, thunar, pcmanfm, midnight commander, vifm for file managers, a muriad of music applications etc). Aditionally let's say I want an application to look or behave in a specific way, but there is none that is exactly how I want it. In that case I would either make a new one( usually a lot of wasted effort), or I would take the one that is closest to how I want it, modify it to add an option to do what I want it to do and push the patch upstream( to the app maintainers). Now every user of that application will get that new option. So not only we have a lot of e.g. desktops to chose from, but we also have a ton of options on each one of them. This has resulted to the creation of modular applications that users can tweak with addons and extensions to their needs.</p>
<p>This extends down to the more technical part of the OS, for example you can chose different file systems instead of only NTFS for windows or AFS for apple stuff depending on what you are trying to do. You can use ext4 for a stable desktop or try something more advanced like btrfs if you have a system with multiple hard drives and you care alot about data rot. Or different file system if you are running an SSD, specifically designed for SSDs instead of retrofited like NTFS( it's from Samsung, I can't recall the name). You can switch I/O schedulers depending on your workload and the type of the hard drive, you can enable/disable kconfig switches on hardware drivers and so on. </p>
<p>At some point early on this entire ecosystem became too big to be managed by each person, so distributions were created. Each one of them is supposed to cater to a different audience with different use cases. Some of them like Debian go back to the 90s. Debian for example is aimed at users who need extreme stability and are willing to sacrifice newer versions of applications or the kernel (i.e. hardware compatibility) in exchange. It's aiming at being the universal OS, that can run on any architecture people want it to run( from x86-64 to armv7, aarch64, spark, power8/9 riscv, you name it). Ubuntu takes from Debian and tries to make it more user-friendly and ready to use out of the box with minimal tweaking. It's aimed at engineers and business users, and to some extend to the mainstream public that is not afraid to open a terminal once in a while. Linux Mint takes the Ubuntu base and narrows it down to the average Joe, making sure that everything works with a nice coherent UI and no need for a terminal. Arch Linux on the other hand is a DIY distribution that allows you to select a decent amount of the parts consisting your system on your own. It's a rolling release distro meaning it doesn't have releases, but software is updated as soon as a new version rolls out upstream. Gentoo follows the same idea but to a greater extend allowing more control but at the same time you have to compile the software yourself. Fedora lies somewhere in the middle with a stable base(desktop environment, compiler and C library version) rolling applications, while it rebases every time a new kernel is released. There are plenty of distros covering every niche of the userbase, some more professional, some more community oriented. </p>
<p>Of course with power comes great responsibility. You do not have to tweak every single option in the system, but if you do start tweaking you have to get ready to bork it multiple times. The choice is yours. For this reason one can chose e.g. Linux Mint to just get shit done^TM or something more advanced. There is an option for everyone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For Windows and MacOS, one company built the entire thing as one integrated experience from the ground up. They could make everything integrated together.</p>
<p>For Linux and UNIX, one organization made a command-line OS. Then another built a base GUI system, X Windows. Then a third created a widget toolkit. A fourth created a desktop environment.</p>
<p>And then someone else made a different kernel, which is the program that manages your hardware and determines what programs get time on your CPU and get memory and things like that, because the existing ones weren't open source so you had to pay AT&amp;T a lot of money to alter the kernel to your needs, which we needed to do back then.</p>
<p>And then someone else made copies of all the basic utilities you need to have a usable command line only OS because the existing ones weren't open source.</p>
<p>And then several people created different widget toolkits because the existing ones were crud. And on top of that they built a few different desktop environments because they needed them and couldn't agree on the best way of doing things.</p>
<p>This created a lot of choice on how to set up your computer.</p>
<p>So now you've got a bunch of people who are pretty particular about how their computers should be set up, and they know their opinions differ from each other. But they don't want to duplicate tons of work by each maintaining effectively identical software that differs only by what color it is, or what key sequence saves a file, or which side of the window the close button is on. So they added theme support and rebindable keys and configuration options -- a lot more than Macs or Windows.</p>
<p>And then the GNOME Desktop Environment decided that it should ruthlessly curate its configuration options, removing any that the core devs didn't find useful, and they found fewer useful with each release. Eh, it's a general trend that Linux stuff is configurable, not an iron law.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because a &quot;Linux&quot; system is composed of many individual software projects, and these have all developed to play nicely with each other.  Every so often someone becomes fed up with one of those projects and decides to make their own.  There's multiple desktop environments, windowing systems, software libraries, etc. etc.  At some point, someone has made an alternative to just about every piece.  The end result is that these &quot;pieces&quot; are generally well-contained, because they keep getting ripped out and replaced.</p>
<p>So while on a Windows system, where the graphical environment is strongly integrated with the whole, it's not easy to use a substitute, on a Linux system, where there have been many different graphical environments, it's much easier.  The design has evolved over the years to be modular by the nature of how it was developed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
