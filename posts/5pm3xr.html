		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>High school biology student here. I have a possibly controversial question I wasn't bold enough to ask in class.</p>
<p>We've all heard how in the 19th and early 20th century, there were many so-called scientific claims about how blacks and other minorities were intellectually and morally inferior to whites. It's now widely accepted that these ideas are wrong, to the point where somebody like James Watson can have his career ruined for believing some of them.</p>
<p>How do we actually know these old theories are wrong, though? What methodological flaws did all of the relevant studies have? I've done some cursory research and have yet to see anybody address or disprove any of them - people just seem to accuse their proponents of racism and all discussion is dropped.</p>
<p>If anybody could answer this question without delving into anything overly complicated, I'd appreciate it. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Genetically, there are no races.</p>
<p>Also, the most biologically-diverse group of humans are those with direct and recent ancestors from sub-Saharan Africa....meaning if a human from outside of Africa is capable of doing it, a human in Africa is capable of doing it....at least in terms of intelligence and physical ability. It is pretty hard to argue genetic superiority for Europeans or Asians given the genetic evidence.</p>
<p>The methodological flaws in most research in the area is that Europeans are biasing the study to (shocking, I know!!!) show Europeans are superior!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are certainly genes which effect the way people think and act. But as you probably know there is as much variation within races as there is between.       </p>
<p>If there are studies which show that there are certain genes which are superior in some tangible way then the superior group will almost certainly not conform to any traditional group.        </p>
<p>Counter example to my point: Ashkenazi Jews.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There <em>are</em> differences between different groups of humans. That doesn't mean that some are superior to others. Science confirms differences, but not in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Asians have less offensive body odours, and dry earwax compared to Westerners. I envy them for that. There's more lactose intolerance in Africa than in Europe. Or more accurately, Europeans developed a higher tolerance than Africans. Then there's sickle cell anaemia, which is much more prevalent in Africans and their descendants.</p>
<p>But we never discovered any superiority as such, not in the modern definition of &quot;race&quot; which almost exclusively focuses on skin colour and intelligence. On the other hand, genetic differences have played a large part in human evolution, so we could well claim that Homo sapiens were superior to Homo neanderthalensis. Arguably racist, but there's some truth in that. Future catastrophes will show us, if there are any survivors, which subtle differences allow some genetic variants to flourish while others go extinct. Superiority in hindsight.</p>
<p>And it's the least PC subject ever, so we'll probably never know for sure anyway. The Nazis tried but failed to find any fundamental differences. They really, <em>really</em> tried.</p>
<p>Unpopular opinion of the month: Being Jewish was a &quot;race&quot;-related condition that led to lower survival rates in Germany during the war. An indirect genetic weakness based on subtle facial differences. Were the extermination camps some form of natural selection? Is there such a thing as <em>un</em>natural selection? Are humans removed from nature? Try discussing <em>that</em> in class.</p>
<p>The question of <em>nature</em> vs <em>nurture</em> also rears its contentious head. Are rednecks less intelligent than others, or is it a cultural issue?</p>
<p>I'm not sure I managed to ELY5, but I'm sure I managed to offend quite a few, which is much easier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A huge portion is just wrong because it was old science and based on nonsense, like phrenology. </p>
<p>Another whole bunch, we found other, better explanations for. A lot of studies showing that X, Y, Z environmental factors contribute to some condition are refutations of some old racist theory. E.g. There was a bunch of dumb stuff about black people and asthma.</p>
<p>The rest, and arguably most important chunk though is just boring ass statistics. Actually, as it happens, a huge part of the history of statics comes down to this fight. Ser Francis Galton invented correlation and regression analysis, and he named them such to advance his own theory of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; (also his invention) among the races of man. The tldr of it is that the best evidence for racist theories just don't have enough power to reject the null hypothesis of racial equality. In fact, they don't have the statistical power to justify breaking people up into the standard six race model (white black Asian Indian native American Aboriginee) or really just about any racial model you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of good info here, but just to highlight - the original &quot;studies&quot; about race and racial differences would in no way stand up to any of today's scientific rigour. They were funded by people with an ideal outcome, and carried out by people with limited resources and a heavy bias. It's important to always &quot;consider the source&quot; when it comes to historical accounts - most surviving documentation was written by somebody who won a conflict, not those who lost. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
