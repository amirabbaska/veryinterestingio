<p>police could photograph, fingerprint, and run DNA tests.  If no match, keep it on file for future missing person reports.</p>
<p>I doubt this really ever happens though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They'd cremate the limb if nobody claims it. Obviously they'd wait a while and try their best to figure out who it belonged to. And they'd keep as much evidence as they could (finger prints, hair &amp; skin cells, and whatever). </p>
<p>I interned at a prosecutor's office last year and in the homicide department they had a real human skeleton, named him Barry. Apparently he was just a dead homeless guy they found. Nobody claimed his body so the detectives pulled some strings and convinced whomever needed convincing to allow them to keep the skeleton. He wears a lab coat and a nice pair of shades. </p>
<p>Barry also has some bone-y friends, all I remember was the cat skull. Maybe the skull of a small dog? Not sure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They often go to forensic anthropologists who can analyze them and help give and clues as to who they came from.  You can tell a lot about a person from just a couple of bones. </p>
<p>Also, story time:</p>
<p>Back in the day, I took a few physical anthropology courses in school. The professor had a crock pot (no shit, like you'd buy at Walmart) that was used to get rid of the meat and other goop so bones could be studied more closely.</p>
<p>Also, there was allegedly a time when a sealed plastic mystery bag was found in the back of a closet. Inside were two (very decayed) human feet, with no notes as to where they came from or what investigation they belonged to. Assuming there's any truth to that, there's not a hell a lot of oversight as to what ends up happening to &quot;misplaced&quot; limbs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
