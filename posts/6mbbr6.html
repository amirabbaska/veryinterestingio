		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, adrenaline and cortisol. If you haven't eaten in a long time, your body doesn't relax, it instead increases stress hormones which induce the metabolism of energy stores (ie, fat tissue, glycogen) and help mobilize you so that you can find food or fight for it. </p>
<p>Once you eat, stress hormones decrease, blood flow to the intestines and visceral organs is restored, and you feel hungry again (this is why appetizers induce appetite).   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try and answer, but it's been many years (10+) since I've done this study. </p>
<p>One of the most predominant reasons is gluconeogensis, when you do not eat for a period of time your body detects the fall in serum (bloodstream) glucose (This and your stomach being physically empty will trigger a hunger mechanism) and eventually it begins to increase the gluconeogenesis pathway.       </p>
<p>This is a process by which your body begins to increase glucagon production (Hormone that tells your body to raise glucose levels) and maintain your blood glucose level, conversely it will decrease insulin production (Most easily explained as: insulin is necessary to transport glucose for use at the cellular level and therefore decreases serum glucose levels).     </p>
<p>As you enter gluconeogenesis, your body is now breaking down predominantly proteins and fats rather than utilising the glucose as it is entering your bloodstream from the food absorbed in your (predominantly small) intestines.
Initially these proteins and fats will be from intramuscular/lipid/cellular stores and then finally, provided by directly catabolising your own body tissue and organs.<br />
Throughout this process, essential for life neurotransmitters: phosphates, magnesium and potassium continue to be utilized to maintain fluid balance, electroconduction and intracellular movements (which includes the glucose we're 'producing' and using).</p>
<p>Once a stasis level is achieved (stomach has collapsed, intestinal peristaltic motion has slowed considerably, serum glucose is stable) you no longer feel hungry as there are no rapid changes occurring, essentially your body is being supplied the necessary fuel it currently requires to keep going.
(And from a perhaps historic standpoint: There was probably no point tormenting you that you're hungry while you're trying to hunt for food).  </p>
<p>If you maintain this fasting for long enough, there is a risk of potential serious medical compromise (Cardiac Arrest, Seizure etc) predominantly due to neurotransmitter depletion and in some cases due to direct catabolism of the vital organs to provide glucose (such as the heart).   </p>
<p>There is a further risk if you enter in to this state and that's resuming eating, this is called 'refeeding syndrome'.<br />
In refeeding syndrome, where the body is already in an elevated state of glucagon production, the sudden increase in blood glucose results in a sudden increase in insulin and thus consequently your body's overall metabolism spikes which continues to include proteins and fats (Elevated Glucgaon).  With this, neuotransmitters (Potassium and Phosphate predominantly) which the bodies stores have already depleted to maintain serum levels, have a sudden intracellular shift and serum levels can decrease to fatal levels.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some good answers, but I'd like to add another perspective. Without going into too much detail, your appetite is controlled by two opposing processes - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghrelin" target="_blank">ghrelin</a>
(the &quot;hunger hormone&quot;) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin" target="_blank">leptin</a>
(the &quot;satiety hormone&quot;). Fluctuations in leptin/ghrelin levels may affect your appetite independently from metabolic processes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on how long you're talking about fasting for, &quot;because you're in ketosis&quot; is the answer. </p>
<p>People eating the Standard American Diet are almost never burning their fat for fuel as they always have blood sugar to use (because they eat carb-based foods frequently). </p>
<p>If you don't eat for a little bit (or you avoid carbs), and your body runs out of blood glucose, your body starts converting glycogen (stored in your liver and muscles) to glucose. Once that's gone, you start converting fat to energy. </p>
<p>Hunger is a response to hormone levels (insulin and ghrelin mostly) that are largely driven by energy levels in your blood. </p>
<p>For every pound of fat on your body, you have 3500 calories of energy available to use. So nearly everyone in the western world is carrying around weeks worth of energy they can draw on when needed (once they enter ketosis). </p>
<p>As an example, a 175 lbs guy with 20% body fat, has ~35 lbs of fat on their body. That means they have 35 x 3500 calories (122,500) worth of energy. That's roughly 49 days worth assuming 2,500 calories burned a day. </p>
<p>That's why you stop getting hungry. You enter a really sustainable energy mode without the spikes and valleys associated with glucose-based energy and your hormones stop causing hunger as often or as significantly. </p>
<p>I'm not advocating month-long fasts as there are other things that have to be consumed for you to function well (electrolytes are critical, for example). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look up intermittent fasting and how it works, you will find more specific information. The general physiology is as follows. When a person abstains from eating the body uses the stored reserve called glycogen. After the glycogen in your liver is depleted (10-12 hours on average), your body switches to fat burning. When the body uses fat as fuel, hunger diminishes and brain activity increases. This is an evolutionary means of survival through famine, so the body can focus on finding the next feast.  <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4UkZAwKoCP8" target="_blank">intermittent Fasting Tedx</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
